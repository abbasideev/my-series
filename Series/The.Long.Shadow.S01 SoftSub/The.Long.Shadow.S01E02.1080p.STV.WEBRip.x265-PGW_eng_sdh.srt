00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,520
I've been a chambermaid. In hotels.

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
When would you be needing
someone to start?

<font color="yellow">Well... there's other lasses to see.</font>

Well, you want the very best person

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,439
That's important.

79
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,239
Driving?

80
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,839
<font color="lime">I-I don't drive. So she drove t'van.</font>

<font color="lime">Picking up, dropping off...</font>

82
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,760

<font color="yellow">you to school, that kind of thing?</font>

83
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,839
She were hit in the head
with a hammer, Sydney.

84
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,839
That's what we think happened.

85
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,719
Then she were gone over
with some sort of implement,

86
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,840
a screwdriver, or chisel.

87
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,359
<font color="yellow">You being a roofer,</font>

88
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,040
<font color="yellow">you'd have a tool bag yourself.</font>

89
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
<font color="lime">Aye.</font>

90
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,839
<font color="yellow">Hmm. Does it have a hammer?</font>

91
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,479
<font color="yellow">A screwdriver? Chisel?</font>

92
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,119
<font color="lime">What is this? </font><font color="yellow">What shoe size</font>
<font color="yellow">are you there, Sydney?</font>

<font color="lime">Eh?</font>
<font color="yellow">Answer the question.</font>

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,079
<font color="lime">But why, what's it to do wi'?</font>

95
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,199
What's it to do wi'?

96
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,280
It's to do with the fact that we
found a footprint on Emily's thigh.

97
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,559
Someone stood on her.

98
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
Stood is wrong.

99
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,319
Stamped would be a better word.

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,879
And whoever did it was wearing
some sort of work boot.

101
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
So that's why he's asking.

102
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,840
<font color="yellow">So what shoe size are you?</font>

103
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,880
<font color="lime">Er...</font>

104
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,719

<font color="lime">Eh?</font>

106
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,920
<font color="yellow">Show us your foot.</font>

107
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,200
Where were you last night, Sydney?

108
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,879
<font color="lime">We went drinking. Me and Emily.</font>

109
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,679
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

110
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,399
<font color="lime">The Gaiety. Chapeltown.</font>

111
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,839
But you left her behind. Went home.

112
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,359
She wanted to keep drinking?

113
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,239
So you had an argument, yes?
<font color="lime">No.</font>

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,320
No?

115
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,839
So you just left t'van in car park
and went home?

116
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,360
How?

117
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,560

118
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,519

119
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,320
<font color="yellow">you'd have saved yourself the fare.</font>

<font color="lime">Who?</font>
Work, was it?

123
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,279
If I open these books Emily keeps,
will they tell me

124
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,759
all about the roofing jobs
in Scott Hall Avenue?

125
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,399
<font color="lime">Where?</font>
<font color="yellow">Or were you a punter?</font>

126
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,879
<font color="yellow">Is that why you drank in Chapeltown?</font>

127
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,679
Wilma McCann had four kids, Sydney.

128
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,760
One more than your Emily.

129
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,560
That's seven kids without a mum.

130
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
Did you want her
all to yourself? Wilma?

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,599
That it?
SYDNEY SNIFFLES

132
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,159
Did you pick her up on October 29th

133
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,519

Followed by a sustained assault
to the neck, the body and the back,

161
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,079
with what the lab now thinks
is a crosshead screwdriver.

162
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,639
Whoever did this
murdered Wilma McCann,

163
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,520
of that we are now certain.

164
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,919
<font color="yellow">He were also wearing</font>
<font color="yellow">a size seven Wellington boot.</font>

165
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,319
<font color="yellow">But at this stage, we're</font>
<font color="yellow">keeping that detail to ourselves.</font>

166
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,719
Right.

167
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,799
Let's start on Spencer Place,
Leopold Street, and t'Gaiety.

168
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,799
The drinkers - see who saw what.

169
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,599
And I want us logging plates
of any cars

170
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,839
seen cruising those streets over the
next couple of weeks.

171
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,399
If we head over to... <font color="cyan">So we had</font>
<font color="cyan">it right the first time, sir?</font>

172
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,599
Go on.

173
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,079
<font color="cyan">It's the whores he's after.</font>

174
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,439
Well, we don't know...

175
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,719
<font color="cyan">Well, Wilma McCann was a prostitute.</font>

176
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,919
<font color="cyan">Emily Jackson was a prostitute.</font>

177
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,040
<font color="cyan">I don't know about you, sir,</font>
<font color="cyan">but I can see a pattern emerging.</font>

178
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,159
Well, if that's where evidence
is leading us,

179
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,360
then that must be the conclusion.

180
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,239
<font color="yellow">Right, as I said,</font>
<font color="yellow">we'll head to the Gaiety first</font>

181
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,879
<font color="yellow">and we'll go from there, please.</font>

182
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,640
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

183
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,199
Back again?
<font color="cyan">What's that?</font>

184
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,679
I didn't recognise you.
In your uniform.

185
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
<font color="cyan">Very funny.</font>

186
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,280
<font color="cyan">I want you reading this.</font>

Who knows what the average
man gets up to,

251
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,639
left to his own devices.

252
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,519
And any fella who uses a prostitute
doesn't go round bragging about it.

253
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,999
Doesn't go home to the wife saying,
"Guess where I've just been?"

254
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,599
Doesn't tell his workmates.
Doesn't tell his friends.

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,320
<font color="yellow">Oh, mate.</font>

256
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,679
<font color="yellow">Are workmates not real mates</font>
<font color="yellow">any more, Dennis?</font>

257
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,720
Tells nobody is t'point.

258
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,960
And the prostitutes won't talk to us
cos they're worried we'll nick 'em.

259
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,679
And even if they did, they'd be
no use anyway cos the only way

260
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,519
they know this bastard
IS this bastard

261
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,319
is when they're on their own
wi' him.

262
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,639
<font color="yellow">By which point, it's too late.</font>

263
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,760

267
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,560
I'm aware of that.

268
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,360
So, what have we got?

269
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,640
Wellington boot, size seven.

270
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,599
Not many men take a seven.
<font color="yellow">Thousands do.</font>

271
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,479
Yes, but tens of thousands don't.
And we can rule them out.

272
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,479
<font color="cyan">Not necessarily. Dunlop are saying</font>
<font color="cyan">the rubber they use is flexible.</font>

273
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,439
<font color="cyan">He might be a seven.</font>
<font color="cyan">But he could be an eight.</font>

274
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,560
<font color="cyan">And if he wears thick socks,</font>
<font color="cyan">he could be a six.</font>

275
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,799
If he's a six,
why does he take a seven?

276
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,039
<font color="cyan">Because a lot of these boots</font>
<font color="cyan">belong to the workplaces,</font>

277
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,559
<font color="cyan">not the workers themselves.</font>

278
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,000
<font color="cyan">Farms, factories -</font>
<font color="cyan">you use whatever pair's available.</font>

279
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,120
So, what have we got?

280
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
Jim?

281
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,720

282
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,159
For both murders.

283
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,280
For Wilma and for Emily.

284
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,640
They'll be
wanting to know where we're up to.

285
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,920
Bound to ask.

286
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,959
<font color="yellow">Well, that's all right, isn't it?</font>

287
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Oh, aye.

288
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,039
<font color="yellow">You've done plenty of 'em.</font>

289
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,360
Aye. Plenty.

290
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,960
And they'll want to know
if we're any closer to catching him.

291
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,440
There'll be that.

292
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,760
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

293
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
And I'll just have to say, "No...

294
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,360
"..we are no closer."

295
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,360
I keep having
this terrible thought, Bet.

296
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,560
I shut it out, but...
it keeps coming back.

297
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,680
When I'm in the car,
all during the day.

298
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,079
If I'm going to catch that man,
I need more clues.

299
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,800
And the only way to get more clues
is for the bastard to do it again.

Talk a bit slower, then I can...

OK. I'm gonna need an address

306
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,960
OK, you're at the park?
As in Roundhay Park?

307
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,040
OK, and what side of the park?

308
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,399
Chapeltown side.

309
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,760
Yeah, I'm still here.

Yep, Chapeltown corner. OK.

313
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,680
Yeah, and what's your name?

314
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,640
He's hit you on the head?

315
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,679
He's hit you on the head
with a hammer?

316
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,400
Feels like water in your head? OK,
and is it bleeding now, Marcella?

317
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,359
Yeah. OK.

318
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,759
We're gonna get an ambulance and
police officers to you now, OK?

319
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,800
Shouldn't be more
than a couple of minutes.

320
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,160
No, no, no, stay sitting for me,
darling. Stay sitting.

321
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,760
Keep your knickers on the blood.

322
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,679
Scrunch 'em up and hold 'em on
the bit where it's bleeding. OK?

323
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,119
Was it somebody you know, or...?

324
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,320
No. A stranger?

325
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,399
No, no, no, he's not coming back.

326
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,880
No, if he's left you alone,
he won't be coming back...

328
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,799
Marcella, can you hear me?

329
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah, nice clear words for me.
That's it.

330
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,519
That's it...

331
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,080
He is coming back?

332
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,679
He's driving back
towards the phone box?

333
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,359

334
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,879

335
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,280
OK, I need you to stay down.

336
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,039
I need you to stay sitting for me.

337
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,480
No, stay sitting. Stay. Stay.

338
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm right here. I'm here.

339
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,559
He's gone?

340
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,279
He's gone past. He's driving past.

341
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,040
You can see him in the distance.
That's good, that's good.

Oh, no!

343

got blood on the phone,

that's not your fault,

You can see the blue lights?

346
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,399
Yeah, you can see them? Good.
That's...

347
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,119
Yep. They know where you are and
they know that you're poorly, OK?

348
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,720
You just keep holding your head.

349
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,439
Yeah, I can hear them.
Yeah, that's them.

350
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm gonna hand over, OK?

351
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,320

<font color="cyan">Not if you believe the rumours, Jim.</font>

466
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,799
<font color="cyan">I shouldn't have said owt.</font>

467
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,880
<font color="cyan">Just ask the girls</font>
<font color="cyan">back at the office.</font>

468
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,519
<font color="cyan">Terrific windows</font>
<font color="cyan">in a building like this.</font>

469
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,320
<font color="cyan">I always think daylight</font>
<font color="cyan">is such an asset.</font>

470
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,320
<font color="cyan">For example...</font>

471
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,679
Very good.

472
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,639
<font color="cyan">I thought you'd like it...</font>

473
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,280
<font color="cyan">DACC Dennis.</font>

474
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,120
<font color="cyan">Deputy Assistant Chief Constable.</font>

475
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,639
I'm in the middle
of a double murder investigation.

476
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,239
<font color="cyan">The role spans</font>
<font color="cyan">the whole of West Yorkshire.</font>

477
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,559
<font color="cyan">The combined force.</font>

478
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,439
This man needs finding.

479
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,080
<font color="cyan">And he will be.</font>

480
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,200
With respect, sir, you've never
caught a man like this before.

481
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,719
<font color="cyan">With respect, Dennis...</font>

482
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,560
<font color="cyan">you haven't caught him either.</font>

483
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,199
I don't want this.

484
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,680
<font color="cyan">Oh... I believe you want it.</font>

485
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,319
<font color="cyan">Those murders are still</font>
<font color="cyan">West Yorkshire, Dennis.</font>

486
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,319
<font color="cyan">Still within your purview.</font>

487
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,759
<font color="cyan">You just won't be</font>
<font color="cyan">in day-to-day charge is all.</font>

488
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,720
Then who will?

489
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,359
Don't say Hobson.

490
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,440
I respect Jim, but you need someone
experienced on this one.

491
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,439
Unless it's done?
You've already decided.

492
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,639
<font color="cyan">Dennis, this is a promotion.</font>

493
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,720
It's unbelievable.

494
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,119
<font color="cyan">Ah, there it is.</font>

495
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,319
<font color="cyan">Pam said he'll need somewhere</font>
<font color="cyan">to hang his hat, so...</font>

496
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
HE CLEARS THROAT

497
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,000
<font color="lime">'So... what does that mean now?'</font>

498
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,239
It means...
this is only going to get bigger.

499
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,999
More police.

500
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,319
Better resourced.

501
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,199
I'll still have an eye on things,
and then you've got

502
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,680
Detective Chief Superintendent
Hobson in active command.

503
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,719
<font color="lime">And, like, he's good, is he?</font>

504
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,800
<font color="lime">You know, like, you rate him?</font>

505
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,800
He's a very experienced detective.

506
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,680
I need you to know, Sydney.

507
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,360
We never thought it were you.

508
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,880
Since we spoke that morning,
I never...

509
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,639
WE never thought that.

510
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
All right?

511
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,120
<font color="lime">Who were it?</font>

512
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,840
Well... that's what we're
going to work out, in't it?

513
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,680
For Emily and Wilma,
and all the kids.

514
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,680

Morning.
<font color="yellow">Morning.</font>

520
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,559
Quiet.

521
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,880
<font color="yellow">Sunday.</font>

522
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,079
After he made a big point
about getting us in

523
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,639
to discuss these budgets.

524
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,599
<font color="yellow">Mr Gregory rang to say</font>
<font color="yellow">he's on his way.</font>

525
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,199
<font color="yellow">He just needed to speak to</font>
<font color="yellow">Mr Hobson first.</font>

526
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,919
Hobson?

527
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,279
<font color="yellow">I thought you knew.</font>

528
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,560
<font color="yellow">They've found another body.</font>

529
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,240
David?

530
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,279
What we looking at?

531
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,799
<font color="cyan">Early 20s. Dark hair.</font>

532
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,959
<font color="cyan">He's dragged her,</font>
<font color="cyan">in full view of the houses,</font>

533
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,399
<font color="cyan">placed her face down</font>
<font color="cyan">in a specific...</font>

535
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,239
<font color="cyan">..arrangement.</font>

536
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,239
And it's linked, yes?

537
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,399
<font color="cyan">We don't know that yet.</font>

538
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,799
No, but it's the same style as...

539
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,640
<font color="cyan">Dennis, I'm sorry.</font>
<font color="cyan">Would you just give me a moment?</font>

540
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,120
Linked?
<font color="yellow">Dennis...</font>

541
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,119
Not treading on any toes, Jim.

542
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,439
<font color="yellow">You can't turn up like this.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's not your case any more.</font>

543
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,240
Well, think of me
as a fresh pair of eyes.

544
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,360
<font color="yellow">Dennis...</font>

545

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,479
<font color="yellow">of Cowper Street, Chapeltown.</font>

552
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,039
<font color="yellow">After months of failing</font>
<font color="yellow">to find work,</font>

553
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,119
<font color="yellow">she fell into selling</font>
<font color="yellow">herself for money.</font>

554
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,519
<font color="yellow">Irene is now the third victim</font>
<font color="yellow">of this killer,</font>

555
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,399
<font color="yellow">a man intent on slaying prostitutes,</font>

00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,520

<font color="yellow">a very significant mistake.</font>

557
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,199
<font color="yellow">He left tyre tracks at the scene.</font>

558
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,999

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,720
<font color="yellow">but I need a big effort</font>
<font color="yellow">from you now.</font>

561
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,040
<font color="yellow">I need you to help me</font>
<font color="yellow">identify that vehicle.</font>

562
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,720
<font color="yellow">We find that car,</font>
<font color="yellow">we find the killer.</font>

563
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,199
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

564
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,199
<font color="yellow">Yes?!</font>
ALL: Yes, sir.

565
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,119
<font color="yellow">Good, right. Thank you.</font>

566
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,199
<font color="cyan">Right, I want a presence</font>
<font color="cyan">at Roundhay Park.</font>

567
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,559
<font color="cyan">Question everyone.</font>

568
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,280
<font color="cyan">Right, let's get on with it.</font>

569
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,799
Jenny, do you remember Claxton,
the Black lass attacked in Roundhay?

570
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,439
<font color="lime">That wasn't linked.</font>

571
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,399
Well, do we have the file?

572
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,439
<font color="lime">Erm, I could try and find it,</font>
<font color="lime">I suppose.</font>

573
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,960
Yeah, yeah, please.

574
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,959
<font color="yellow">January, we saw a slight increase</font>
<font color="yellow">in the crime overall.</font>

575
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,960
<font color="yellow">Crime in our police area is going</font>
<font color="yellow">down, so made a start with that.</font>

576
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,960

577
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,400
KNOCK ON DOOR

578
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,439
<font color="yellow">She gone. Afraid.</font>

579
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,960
<font color="yellow">Because you people not believe her.</font>

580
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,960
<font color="cyan">You got an address? Oi!</font>

581
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,239

KNOCK ON DOOR

585
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,079
<font color="yellow">Because I think he probably would,</font>
<font color="yellow">especially if he's married.</font>

586
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,640
<font color="yellow">Stop his wife from asking questions.</font>

587
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,919
<font color="yellow">Who did this?</font>

588

00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,959
<font color="yellow">What d'you want me to do with this?</font>

591
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,399
<font color="cyan">Well, there can't be too many fellas</font>
<font color="cyan">look like that, Jim.</font>

592
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,679
<font color="yellow">The crimes aren't connected.</font>

593
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,839
<font color="lime">Will one of you tell us</font>
<font color="lime">what's going on?</font>

594
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,159
<font color="cyan">There were a prostitute attacked</font>
<font color="cyan">in t'park last year in t'summer.</font>

595
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,719
<font color="yellow">And we ruled it out.</font>

596
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,680
<font color="cyan">And now Richardson's been killed.</font>

597
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,759
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>
<font color="cyan">In exactly the same spot.</font>

598
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,079
<font color="yellow">In exactly the same spot</font>

599
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,279
<font color="yellow">that prostitutes</font>
<font color="yellow">take their punters all the time.</font>

600
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,599
<font color="yellow">I told you this, John, at the time,</font>
<font color="yellow">do you remember?</font>

601
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,639
<font color="yellow">People in those big posh houses</font>
<font color="yellow">always complaining? I told you.</font>

602
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,439
<font color="cyan">You don't think</font>
<font color="cyan">it's a coincidence, Jim?</font>

603
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,919
<font color="yellow">I do. I do think it's a coincidence.</font>

604
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,799
<font color="yellow">We ruled it out then</font>
<font color="yellow">for the same reason</font>

605
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,079
<font color="yellow">that I'm keeping it ruled out now.</font>

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,359
<font color="yellow">She were attacked,</font>
<font color="yellow">hit on t'back of t'head.</font>

607
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,999
<font color="yellow">That is it,</font>
<font color="yellow">that is the only connection.</font>

608
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,560
<font color="yellow">Not like these others.</font>

609
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,040
<font color="yellow">And she were lying.</font>

610
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,479
<font color="yellow">She were lying, and she were pissed.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah, but, Jim...</font>

611
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,679
<font color="yellow">Just... Just think,</font>

612
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,999
<font color="yellow">what would happen, on a case like</font>
<font color="yellow">this, if someone puts out an appeal</font>

613
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,640
<font color="yellow">on a man who has absolutely nothing</font>
<font color="yellow">to do with any of these crimes?</font>

614
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,559
<font color="yellow">We'd send everybody</font>
<font color="yellow">off down the wrong road</font>

615

<font color="yellow">Look, we have to work</font>
<font color="yellow">with the facts.</font>

618
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,959
<font color="yellow">The fact that he's a seven.</font>

619

<font color="yellow">The fact that he drives a car.</font>

620
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,640
<font color="yellow">The fact that that he's left</font>

00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,120
<font color="yellow">All right?</font>

Hi, Jim.
We're doing a layout right now,

630
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,160
so I just wanted to check
if you had anything to add.

631
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,239
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think so, no.</font>

632
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,280
OK. Understood.
