00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,679
I'm Detective Constable Laptew,
this is Sergeant Robert Blake.

173
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,160
We're making house visits
in relation to t'Ripper inquiry.

174
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,439
Am I right in saying you're
the owner of a black Sunbeam Rapier?

175
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,559
Not for about a year.

176
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,479
Right, but you did own one?

177
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,920
I did, aye.

178
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
Mind if we come in?

179
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,720
No problem.

180
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,079
What do you do for a living,
Mr Sutcliffe?

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,279
I'm a lorry driver.

182
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,479
Have you had a visit before at all?
Have any of our colleagues...

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,199
The lads are doing house visits
for the Yorkshire Ripper inquiry.

184
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,119
Now's the chance to get rid
of your husband if you want to,

185
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,160
Mrs Sutcliffe.

186
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,120
Would either of you like a cup
of tea? I'd love a glass of water.

187
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,919
Your Sunbeam Rapier has been spotted
in three red-light areas

188
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,439
relevant to our inquiries.

189
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
Manningham, over 30 times.

190
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,360
Leeds. Manchester.

191
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,239
Why might that've been, Peter?

192
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,599
Well, I go through
Manningham red-light district

193
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,279
on my way into work.
I'd be hard pushed to avoid it.

194
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,239
Er, Leeds,
I went to not so long ago.

195
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,079
I dropped Sonia off to meet some
friends. Chapeltown, that were.

196
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,640
And what about Manchester?

197
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,239
When?

198
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,359
February.
February...

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,679
Why would my car have been
in Manchester in February?

200
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,159
It's not just the car.

201
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,480
These are sightings of males
alone in cars. Thank you.

202
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
Well, when in February?
The 16th. A Tuesday.

203
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,639
That wouldn't have been our Peter.
We barely ever go out.

204
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,479
Certainly not on a Tuesday.
Well, the thing is, Mrs Sutcliffe...

205
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,519
You'll have made a mistake.
Peter would have been working.

206
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,400
And if not,
he would've been here... with me.

207
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,559
Would you be willing to provide us
with a handwriting sample?

208
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,720
Aye. Yeah, no problem.

209
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,839
What shoe size are you, Peter?
Why?

210
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,439
Never mind why.

211
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,719
An 8. 8-and-a-half.

212
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,840
You never owned a shoe or a boot
smaller than 8-and-a-half?

213
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
Why would I want to do that?

214
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm sorry to ask...

215
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,640
..what about prostitutes?

216
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,599
In all of your visits
to these red-light areas,

217
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
have you ever used prostitutes?

218
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,200
I wouldn't want to do that either.

219
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,280
We need you to help us find the man
they call the Yorkshire Ripper.

220
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,080
Gather round, everyone,
and listen to the tape.

221
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,680
Nice and quiet now, please, so
that everybody can hear it properly.

222
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,039
I have come here tonight
to play you a tape of the man

223
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
who we believe to be
the so-called Yorkshire Ripper.

224
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,160
If you recognise the voice,
don't hesitate in coming forward.

225
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,879
'I'm Jack...'
Listen, then look at the writing.

226
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,719
Who do you know who
might have handwriting like that?

227
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,319
'I have the greatest respect
for you, George...'

228
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,839
This is not a man with devil horns.

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,599
'You are no nearer catching me now
than four years ago...'

230
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
He's a dad.

231
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,239
A brother.

232
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,679
A son.

233
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,719
'I reckon your boys
are letting you down, George.'

234
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
And he lives in one of these houses.

235
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,240
You can help us now.

236
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,320
You can tell us exactly who he is.

237
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,439
Right, well,
sorry to bother you again.

238
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,279
I know you've already spoken
to our colleague DCS Domaille,

239
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,040
but you've also spoken to the man
that we're looking for.

240
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
You've spoken to the Ripper.
You heard his voice.

241
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,559
That's right, love.

242
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,799
I don't know if you're aware,
but he's sent a tape,

243
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,319
so we've heard it too now. So...

244
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,199
It would be very helpful for us

245
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,079
if you can confirm that this voice
is the man we're looking for.

246
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,080
There are those in our organisation
don't believe it's him, you see.

247
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,480
It's not him.

248
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Well, let's take a listen first,
shall we?

249
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,199
I don't need to have a listen.

250
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,199
I've heard it on t'news.
It's not him.

251
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,119
Well, let's just listen, shall we?

252
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,680
Carefully,
and then we'll discuss it.

253
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,120
'I'm Jack.

254
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,560
'I see you are still having no luck
catching me.

255
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,719
'I have the greatest respect
for you, George,

256
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,759
'but, Lord,
you are no nearer catching me now

257
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,160
'than four years ago when I started.

258
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,319
'I reckon your boys
are letting you down, George.'

259
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,879
That's not the man who attacked me.

260
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,719
'They can't be much good, can they?

261
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,560
'The only time they came near...'

262
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,119
Well, I think you'll find it is.

263
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,279
No, love. He were a Yorkshireman.

264
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,879
You said it were a gentle voice.

265
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,839
Aye, cos it were. It were soft.

266
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,480
What size feet did he have?

267
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,000
How would I know?
Roughly.

268
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,519
I've got... I've got no idea.

269
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,359
I don't want any messing about here,
Olive.

270
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,239
If the man who attacked you
were not the Ripper,

271
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,200
well, then it's time to come clean
and tell us.

272
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,080
I trust the evidence over some woman
who's been banged about the head.

273
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,640
Sir David.
Ronald.

274
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,839
Jim.
Chief Constable.

275
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,960
Follow me.

276
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,080
"Never an inquiry of this scale
in the annals of police history."

277
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,479
Those were your words

278
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,199
when you announced the launch
of this Project R.

279
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,279
I saw that the other day,
and I thought to myself,

280
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,879
"Aye, I suppose that must be true."

281
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,079
In this country, undoubtedly.

282
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,759
You know, Ron, there comes a point

283
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,679
when your inability
to catch this man

284
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,919
becomes a matter
of national concern.

285
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,359
Well, it's certainly a concern

286
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,599
for all of us
on the West Yorkshire Force.

287
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,439
Our greatest priority.

288
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,199
But I don't know of anyone who
believes this series of crimes

289
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,319
will extend beyond
the north of England.

290
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,879
That's not what he's saying.

291
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,399
Four years, 11 murders.

292
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,639
A succession of Senior Investigating
Officers... No arrests.

293
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,519
No arrests. Barely any suspects,
or have I got that wrong?

294
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,919
That's not entirely...

295
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,999
This is starting to affect
the public's confidence

296
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,679
in the police as a whole,
nationally.

297
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,240
That is what he is saying.

298
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,039
This Project R,
to see it another way,

299
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,679
this is just you highlighting
your own shortcomings.

300
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,599
"We need your help
to catch the Ripper..." ie,

301
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,359
"..because we can't do it
ourselves."

302
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,359
Josephine Whitaker.
She was not a prostitute.

303
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,879
No... Jayne MacDonald.
She was not a prostitute.

304
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,800
And yet you maintain that this man
is hunting prostitutes. You insist.

305
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,199
And insist that he's a Geordie.

306
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,519
Those are the findings
of George Oldfield and his team...

307
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,759
But, Ronald...
A very experienced team.

308
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,879
But, Ronald!

309
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,240
The buck stops with you.
This is on you.

310
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Downing Street called me.

311
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,639
Asked whether this wasn't the time
for the Met to get involved.

312
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,119
An internal review from Jim here,
perhaps.

313
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,879
To which I said no.

314
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,120
Such an imposition
could never be possible.

315
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,799
Not unless Ronald Gregory
could be persuaded to meet with us

316
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,480
and, er, sanction such a thing
personally.

317
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,559
His shoe size were an 8.
He said 8, 8-and-a-half.

318
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,399
And put that he's a lorry driver,
so he'll have access to tools.

319
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,280
Gap in his teeth.
This is Marilyn Moore's file.

320
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,240
Photofit done December '77.

321
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,040
What do you wanna do?

322
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,999
Only about half of the people
whose voices we like

323
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
have given a writing sample.

324
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,800
This one's not far off.
The G's and the P's.

325
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,119
But then again, "You say seven,
but remember Preston '75."

326
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
The Y's are completely different.

327
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,040
Right, so we should eliminate that
and move on, yeah? David?

328
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,160
David?

329
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,239
What date was this sent?

330
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,000
This first letter to Oldfield?

331
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,759
It was, erm... last year. Erm...

332
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,399
March 8th, '78.

333
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,679
Yeah.

334
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,720
And when was Donna DeAngelo found?

335
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,319
DeAngelo was, er,
found after the letter came...

336
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,599
April 10th, '78.

337
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,680
Yeah, April 10th, '78.

338
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,359
So, the letter is 8th of March.

339
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,000
DeAngelo is found 10th of April.

340
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,359
So we have McCann, one.

341
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,759
Jackson, two. Richardson, three.

342
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,759
Atkinson, four. MacDonald, five.

343
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,159
Jordan, six. Rytka, seven.

344
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,559
And then March 8th, '78...
The letter.

345
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,399
And then the letter. It says,

346
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,399
"You say seven
but remember Preston '75."

347
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,359
Meaning, er, Harrison's linked.

348
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,719
Meaning eight.

349
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,959
And then... on the 10th of April,

350
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,479
Donna DeAngelo is found
underneath the mattress.

351
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,439
David, where are you going
with this?

352
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
DeAngelo becomes number nine.

353
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,639
She was found April 10th,
a month after the letter arrived.

354
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,079
But here's the question -
how long had poor Donna DeAngelo

355
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,560
been lying dead
underneath that mattress?

356
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,600
Two months.
Two months.

357
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,159
Meaning she was killed...

358
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,519
Before the letter was sent.

359
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,839
Now, here's a man who is keen
on making sure Oldfield

360
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,480
gets the total number of victims
right.

361
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,599
So why no mention of DeAngelo?

362
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,279
Why does our man
with the Geordie accent

363
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,079
fail to mention so recent a victim?

364
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,039
Because he doesn't know about her.

365
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,240
And why doesn't our man with the
Geordie accent know about her...?

366
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,040
Because he's not the Ripper.

Lorry driver. From Bradford.

375
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,519
I visited him last week.
Geordie accent?

376
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,879
He's a dead ringer
for t'Marilyn Moore Photofit.

377
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,480
Shoe size is close,
but here's the bit that gets me.

378
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,119
This is from t'Jackson scene.

379
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,959
Now, we only noticed this
the other day.

380
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,080
The right boot, 8, faded. Look.

381
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,879
Like he's been using that
bit of his foot more than t'rest.

382
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,999
Well, he's a lorry driver, in't he?

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,719
So he'll have been pressing
on t'pedal.

384
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,279
How many times?

385
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,199
Sir?

386
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,160

514
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,079
'James, he were called. Or Jim.

515
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
'Do you need a minute
to find a pen?'

516
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,520
Thank you.

517
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,680
'Jim. Average height. Fair hair.'

518
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,439
FAINTLY: Thank you.

519
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,200
'Thank you, Mrs MacDonald.'

520
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,520
Only... They want us to think now,
don't they?

521
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,279
'It said in t'paper...
he could be anybody.'

522
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,920
Nobody knows.

523
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,559
'Thank you, Mrs MacDonald.'

524
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,840
And I meant what I said, you know,
if...

525
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,640
..you think of anything,
then you just call me, all right?

526
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,920
GRUNTS

527
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,239
No woman is safe,

528
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,079
with bank workers, students,
baby sitters all being killed?

529
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,359
Well, what women need to do,
and George has said this,

530
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,679
is make sure they do not
go out alone, late at night.

531
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,679
Is that the official advice?

532
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,999
Well, that's just common sense.

533
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,239
How would you best characterise the
system that you have in place here?

534
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,559
The system's the same system
as is put in place for any murder.

535
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,079
But this being several murders,
that system has become overburdened.

536
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,520
"Overburdened." "At a maximum."
Depends what word you wanna use.

537
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,359
I want to use the word overburdened.

538
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,880
We haven't spent all this money
and done nothing.

539
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,479
We've tried to catch the man
who's committing all these murders.

540
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,759
So if I were to ask you
to bring me all the evidence

541
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,519
pertaining to a Joe Bloggs,
how would you do that?

542
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,159
That depends.
Does Joe Bloggs drive a car?

543
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,839
No idea. Sorry?
That's what I mean.

544
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,160
You tell me.

545
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,919
Well, you'd look under B,
for Bloggs. Then J, for Joe.

546
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,319
Then it'll come down to
which Joe Bloggs you're on about,

547
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,919
cos there'll be more than one,
name like that.

548
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,519
It's 12-hour days, six days a week.

549
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,920
But we don't mind that,
cos we want him caught.

550
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,559
And nobody does more hours
than Mr Oldfield.

551
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,479
Where is Mr Oldfield?

552
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,679
Well, I've been told
he's got a chest infection.

553
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,759
Meaning he's unfit to lead?

554
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,359
I can't think of anyone fitter.
What would George say

555
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,199
if, in my report,

556
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,399
I were to recommend
a different approach here?

557
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,279
A new way of doing things?
Honestly?

558
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,439
Please.

559
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,759
I think he'd say
you should get back to London,

560
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,839
concentrate on catching
your own Ripper first,

561
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,039
then once that's done,

562
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,119
you'd be more than welcome
to come back up here

563
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,239
and tell us all how it's done.

564
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,239
Is there anything else about
this case that you want to tell me?

565
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,160
Anything you feel
we could learn from?

566
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,400
Only that...
SHE SIGHS

567
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,200
Go on.

568
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,479
Only that they say
there's been 12 victims.

569
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,200
But you think there are more?

570
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,440
There will be.

571
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,760
People's lives
will carry on being destroyed.

572
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,439
Until they catch this man.

573
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,640
No.

574
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,200
Long after that.

575
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,599
TV: 'Tonight, we bring you a special

00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,759
What Jasper means
is that nobody in this room

593
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,239
works for the Probation Service
itself, we're volunteers.

594
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,839
I'm Ruth. This is Tina, Tony

595
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,079
and, of course, Jasper,
who is our chair.

596
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,639
We visit prisoners.

597
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,039
Prisoners who don't have
anyone else to visit them...

598
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,200
and prisoners' partners,
for support.

599
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,200
Everyone does what they can
but we can always do more.

600
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,159
Tonight is just an opportunity
for us all to meet

601
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,959
and for anyone to ask any questions.

602
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,840
Yes?

603
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,520
Do we get to choose who we visit?

604
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,280
Well, I don't want to go see a...
some kind of pervert.

605
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,479
It's a very good question. Erm...

606
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,759
you don't have to meet anyone
you don't want to.

607
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,559
But what I would say is...

608
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,479
depending on how long
they've served,

609
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,799
the man that you meet in prison

610
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,960
is not necessarily
the man who committed the crime.

611
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,200
But if you're unsure,
it's better to know.

612
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,559
If you sign up and don't turn up,

613
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,800
you're not letting us down...

614
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,640
..it's the prisoners.

615
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,560
But a good question, thank you.
Anybody else?

616
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,999
OK, well, I'll pass it back to you,
Jasper.

617
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,479
I've been reading up.

618
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I think it's important
people do this.

619
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,959
Why are you so certain?

620
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,640
Because punishment's not enough.
My dad says it's too good for some.

621
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,399
There's no point
just locking people away,

622
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
whatever terrible thing
they might have done.

623
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,199
They need to get better.

624
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,160
So we can all get better.

625
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,000
Or... does it not work like that?

626
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,120
It doesn't work like that, Jackie,
but I rather think it should.

They could have saved her.
What?

635
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,519
Two students found her handbag on
the road at ten o'clock last night.

636
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,359
The bag had blood on it.
They've given it to the police

637
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,559
and they've told 'em
to look for Jackie,

638
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,799
look for her straight away,
and they've done nothing!

639
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,879
They've not looked for her.

640
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,999

No, no! She might've been alive.

641

RONALD: Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

644
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,839
We have already made a statement,

645
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,999
and as the investigation is ongoing,

646
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,439
we will only be taking
a limited number of questions.

647
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,159
ALL SHOUT AT ONCE

648
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,439
Had you looked for her
at the point you found the handbag,

649
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,399
there's a chance
she might have survived.

650
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,519
Is this true?

651
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,840
It's easy to say they should have
found the body sooner.

652
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,799
Maybe they should.

653
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,079
But what should've been done
and, with hindsight,

654
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,039
what might have been done,
is, of course, pure conjecture.

655
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,399
Should Scotland Yard
be taking over the inquiry now?

656
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,199
Scotland Yard sent one of their very
best men to see us not long ago,

657
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,079
and I don't think
it would be an understatement

658
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,719
to say that he was rather impressed
by what he saw.

659
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,519

What makes them think that
we would ever want to talk to them?

664
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,760
What if we can say something
that makes her be more careful?

665
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,440
Who be more careful?

666
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,400
The next lass.

667
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,439
I want to ask everyone,
not just in Leeds or around Leeds,

668
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,319
but the whole of the country,

669
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,960
to please help us find the person
who killed my daughter.

670
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,399
He could live in a mansion,

671
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,000
or a block of flats
or down the street.

672
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,000
Perhaps he lives in your house.

673
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,760
He lives somewhere.
He works for someone.

674
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,840
But please... please think.

675
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,800
Shall I put the kettle on?

676
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,480

00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,880
Doreen.

678
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,760
What are you doing?

679
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,480
Doreen, what...

680
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,960
Doreen...?
