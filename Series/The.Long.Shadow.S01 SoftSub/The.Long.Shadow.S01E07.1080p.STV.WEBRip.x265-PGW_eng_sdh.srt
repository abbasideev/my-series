1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,239
RON: There's never been
an inquiry of this scale

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,119
in the annals of police history.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,039
He must speak with a Geordie accent.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,959
Anybody not meeting
these five points, they're gone.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,319
Mr Peter Sutcliffe?

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,919
DAVID: I do not think
the man on the tape is the Ripper.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,879
You've made that clear.
I want that on record.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,959
But you're wrong.
This is starting to affect

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,639
the public's confidence in
the police as a whole, nationally.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,879
RON: The most wanted man
of the century,

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
more resources than anyone ever,
and you have failed.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,279
I want to ask everyone

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,759
to please help us find the person
who killed my daughter.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,039
He won't be back in a hurry.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,160
MEG: No.
But he'll turn up somewhere.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,519
HE SIGHS

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
SUTCLIFFE: It's quiet enough here,
isn't it?

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,799
WOMAN: Yeah, it's fine.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,440
Come here all the time.

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,320
We won't be disturbed.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,520
You got a tenner for me?

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,240
Why don't we get in t'back?

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,080
CAR APPROACHES

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,639
Oh, no.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,080
Erm...

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,760
You're my girlfriend.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,440
Is this your car, sir?

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,639
Yes.

29
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,719
Can you give me your name
and address?

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,040
I am John Williams.
65 Dorchester Road, Rotherham.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,760
And who's she?

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,479
My girlfriend.

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,920
And what's her name?

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
I don't know. We've not known
each other that long.

35
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,920
Right.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,320
Just stay there.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,040
OFFICER: Just take the keys
out of your car.

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,279
2-5-6 to Control.

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,279
RADIO: 'Control speaking.'

40
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,040
Number plate check, please.

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,959
'Roger that. Go ahead.'

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,239
Yeah, it's foxtrot, echo, hotel,
9-0-7, Juliet.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,600
Over.

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,439
'That's coming up
as a Skoda saloon.

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
'Owner is a Mr Aslam Khan. Over.'

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,399
POLICE CAR DOOR
CLOSES

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,680
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,479
Right, so, the number plates
on your vehicle

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,519
don't match that of the car itself.

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,199
So what's gonna happen now is
I'm gonna arrest you both

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,559
on suspicion of theft.

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,999
And if this turns out
to be soliciting as well...

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,599
Well, we'll get into that
back at the station.

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,479
OK?

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,359
Right, out you get.

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,720
We'll leave your car.

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,399
You heard him. Let's go.
Come on. Chop-chop.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,760
Come on.

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,120
Yeah, stick them in the back.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,519
Where do you think you're going?
I need a piss.

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
Well, quickly, then.
Do it over there.

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,960
You've been in before, Olivia,
haven't you?

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,640
For prostitution.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,880
And that's what you were doing
this evening when we picked you up.

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,919
The fines get worse the more
you deny it. You know they do.

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,319
You've got two kids at home -
it says so on here.

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,439
So the more you sit there
not saying owt,

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,319
the more the food's coming off
their table.

69
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Doesn't it?

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,120
Doesn't it?

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Start by saying your name.

72
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,079
You know my name.

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,119
Nice and clearly, so PC Small here
can write it down.

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,640
"My name is Olivia Reivers." Go on.

75
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,519
My name is Olivia Reivers.

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,040
"I am a prostitute."

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,919
I'm a prostitute.

78
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,519
"And I am guilty, yet again guilty,
of picking up a punter,

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,039
"this time on the evening
of January 2nd 1981."

80
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,360
Go on, you tell the story.

81
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,360
Got picked up this evening.
For sex. Go on.

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,079
For sex.

83
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,599
£10.

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,520
Got in his car, parked up.

85
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,479
But that were it.

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,560
Then that's when you came along.

87
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,039
Right.

88
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,839
Thank you.

89
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,559
Right, if you just sign here,
I'll let you go.

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,879
You'll get a court date through.
It'll likely mean another fine.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,319
More severe this time

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,479
because it's repeat offences,
you see.

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,680
This is just what happens
when you can't leave it alone.

94
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,479
What about this bloke
who picked you up?

95
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,600
His car number plates
weren't registered in his name.

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,119
What's that got to do with me?

97
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,640
Well, you've never met him,
or he's not a regular, or...?

98
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,600
I've no idea who he is.

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,040
He's just some...

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,079
..just some ordinary guy.

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,920
Mm.

102
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,599
You've given your name
as John Williams

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,160
of Canklow, Rotherham.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,520
There is no John Williams
of Canklow, Rotherham.

105
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,960
So, come on. What's your real name?

106
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,680
Sutcliffe. Peter William Sutcliffe.

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,199
From?
Garden Lane, Heaton.

108
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
Bradford?

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,439
Aye.

110
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,759
Now, is that your real name
and address, or are those more lies?

111
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,480
No, no. You can check that.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,799
So why lie the first time, Peter?

113
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,400
I said a fake name
because I panicked.

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,439
I regret that now.
I should never have done it.

115
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Those plates on your car,
they don't belong to you, do they?

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,839
You stole them. Why?

117
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,439
Didn't want people seeing you
in red light areas.

118
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,439
It's not against the law
to go in t'red light area.

119
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,599
We're not saying it is.
It's whores who are criminals.

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
We're not saying otherwise.

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,080
We're asking why you'd be
driving about with stolen plates.

122
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,520
So you're admitting
that you stole them, then?

123
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,960
So, you've got that now?

124
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,199
Sorry?

125
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,560
I've admitted that,
so you can charge me and let me go.

126
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,479
Well, what's the big hurry, Peter?

127
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,439
I just wanna get back. That's all.

128
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,639
To Bradford?

129
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,880
Yeah, to Bradford, aye.

130
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,839
A lot of this Ripper business,

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,480
that's been up Bradford way,
hasn't it?

132
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,520
Leach.

133
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,720
Was that her name?

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,840
The student. She were Bradford.

135
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,120
You ever been questioned
about the Ripper, Peter?

136
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,800
What's so funny about that?

137
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,040
Look at me.

138
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,360
Have you been questioned or not?

139
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,040
Everybody has.

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,999
This one, is it?
It's that one there.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,320
Right.

142
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
DC Nunn.

143
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
Where?

144
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,479
Well, I doubt it.
He's never done Sheffield.

145
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
What accent's he got?

146
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,999
At one in t'morning?
You've no chance.

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,959
No, there's nobody else here,

148
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,839
and if there were, they'd tell you
the same bloody thing.

149
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,560
Well, bail him, then.

150
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,799
Leeds won't send anyone.
They're saying it's too late.

151
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,360
So they're happy to bail him?

152
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,679
Well, we can't keep him overnight,
Des. Not on stolen plates.

153
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,159
Especially if he's admitted it.

154
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
Well, that wouldn't be the reason
we're holding him.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,839
That'd be the excuse.

156
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,959
We should follow their advice.

157
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,839
Bob's right, sir.

158
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,639
If Leeds aren't bothered,
why should we be?

159
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,719
Because we're here,
and we can feel it.

160
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,680
We can feel
that something ain't right.

161
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,880
SCRAPING

162
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,639
I thought you were off home.

163
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,079
Is it just me
or is the car parked wrong?

164
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,679
Punters usually park
pointing away from the road

165
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,559
to stop people seeing in
when they're doing the business.

166
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,279
He were facing out. Do you remember?

167
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,039
Like he wanted a quick getaway.
Maybe.

168
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
Or he weren't wanting sex.

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,320
So if he weren't wanting sex,
what were he gonna do?

170
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,999
But what with?
Sorry?

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
Well... if he's t'Ripper,
he'd have had weapons on him,

172
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,400
a hammer and...

173
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,480
But we searched him,
searched his car. He never had owt.

174
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,720
Bob.

175
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,039
PHONE RINGS

176
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,320
Yeah, that's fine.

177

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Have they... Have they got him?

191
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,520
Think so.

192
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,599
Right, so, they've kept him in,
this fella, overnight.

193
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,999
So, what they're saying is
one of the coppers went back,

194
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,879
had a look down by the side
of these bins, you know,

195
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,919
where they've nicked him,
and that's where they've found it.

196
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,959
Found what?

197
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,679
Hammer and knife. Kitchen knife,
same as he used on Rytka.

198
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,879
Fucking 'ell.
Phone Sheffield.

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,799
Well, no, look - to be fair,
they did find the weapons.

202
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,959
There's nothing to link the weapons
to him, is there?

203
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,959
not unless there's prints.
Are there prints?

204
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,959
Well, I mean, we've gotta wait.
So where is he now?

205
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,999
Well, they're bringing him
to West Yorkshire

206
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,399
so we can take over.

207
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,959

And these are his details?

I've got half the detectives
in the north of England

230
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,559
saying that your Peter
is The Yorkshire Ripper -

231

minds made up.

232
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,559
So if there's anything you wanna
tell me that might dissuade them

233
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
from that opinion, anything at all,
this is the time to say it.

Sonia, I have a list of dates,

239
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,479
so if you can think of any way
to demonstrate...

240
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,599
He would've been at work.

241
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,879
Sorry?
Or he was with me.

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,080

I'll call Millgarth.

249

We did our bit, you know?

253
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,040
If it's him, then everything were
logged and in the right places.

254

It's all we could do.

But if we did that,
then they must've been out.

already. They must've done.

No, but they will do.

Yeah, I was just saying that
he's coughed up, he's confessed...

272
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,079
about ten minutes ago.
He's admitted everything.

273
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,519
He's admitted McCann,
Jackson, Richardson.

274
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,560
He's even admitted to doing
another one after Barbara Leach.

275
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,519
Now, apparently, he said that
he were hoping to get bail.

276
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,279
He said he were gonna get a cab
to Sheffield, pick up them weapons,

277
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,359
then he'd be in the clear.

278
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,639
He... He said all that? What,
just to two bobbies in Sheffield?

279
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,280
Well, he wants it all off his chest.

280
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,679
He said things about the Hill murder
that only the killer could know.

281
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,360
He said things...
well, that nobody ever should know.

282
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,640
Well, let's have it.

283
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,559
Is he a Geordie?

284
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,079
He's from Bradford.

285
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,319
But his voice, Jim.

286
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,479
Does he sound like a Geordie?

287
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,280

because I've not heard him speak.'

at all?'

Yep, I think that's...
Yeah, I think that's better.

350
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,200
We'll go for that. It's stronger.

351
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,959
'Er, it's a stronger opening.'

352
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,719
BELL RINGS

353
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,639
Don't be nervous, now.

354
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,679
Just remember to say
the things we spoke about.

355
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,120
We've been through them
a thousand times.

356
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,319
The crime and trial of the century
is over.

357
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,799
The Yorkshire Ripper
has been given a life sentence,

358
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,319
and a five-year manhunt is finished.

359
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,319
But the questions
raised by that manhunt remain.

360
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,959
How efficient was the hunt
for The Yorkshire Ripper?

361
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,639
Ronald Gregory is the chief
constable of West Yorkshire Police.

362
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,279
Irene MacDonald is the mother
of Jayne MacDonald,

363
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,839
murdered by The Ripper in 1977.

364
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,719
And she very bravely has agreed to
join us tonight in our Leeds studio.

365
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,399
Ken Dwyer is a journalist who's been
following the investigation

366
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,599
from the very beginning,
and his book on the case

367
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,919
is now being rushed into print.

368
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,399
Another parent, Mrs Doreen Hill,
is the mother of Jacqueline,

369
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,919
The Ripper's last victim.

370
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,159
She understandably cannot face
the prospect of visiting Leeds

371
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,479
after what has happened,

372
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,039
and so joins us
from one of our London studios.

373
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,599
Chief Constable,

374
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,199
was any wild goose chase
more wild

375
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,999
than that which led the police
to concentrate all its attention

376
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,319
on the voice recording?

377
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,599
And the fact that
you instructed your men

378
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,759
to discount anyone
who didn't have a Geordie accent.

379
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,799
That's not...

380
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,759
Thus allowing The Ripper,
who didn't have a Geordie accent,

381
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,680
to go free for that much longer.

382
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,559
'No, that's not true. You see,
that's a miss-statement immediately.

383
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,479
'We did not reject anyone
who did not have a Geordie accent.

384
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,959
'The decision on the tape was taken
after very careful consideration

385
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,999
'because the senior investigating
officers were in a dilemma.

386
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,399
'Had they chosen
not to reveal the tape,

387
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,519
'they may have faced
much worse criticism.

388
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,799
'So when they did reveal it,
they had to be positive.'

389
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,439
"They."

390
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,599
But at no time was that
the only point of elimination.

391
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,319
But you were eliminating people
who didn't have a Wearside accent.

392
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,120
No, not solely on that.

393
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,639
Mrs Hill,
do you now feel able to say,

394
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,440
"It's over,
I have no more recriminations?"

395
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,759
'There are aspects
that I'm not happy about.

396
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,639
'The handbag was found
on the Monday evening.'

397
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,799
But no-one bothered
to look for its owner.

398
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,519
When the detectives
went to Jacqueline's body,

399
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,559
they knew nothing at all
about that handbag.

400
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,000
Could Mr Gregory clarify that?

401
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,680
'Mr Gregory?'

402
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,319
'I can't remember exactly.

403
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,879
'I know the handbag had been found.

404
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,359
'But I cannot say with any accuracy

405
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,240
'whether the detectives
knew about it at the time.'

406
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,079
'Mrs Hill,
would you welcome an inquiry

407
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,359
'into the way the police
conducted the investigation?'

408
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,759
Yes, I would.

409
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,399
If there's going to be an inquiry,
can I see the report?

410
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,840
Would Mrs Hill be entitled
to see that report?

411
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,079
If Mrs Hill is dissatisfied with
any aspect of the investigation,

412
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,679
if she'd like to come
and see us at any time,

413
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,119
we could explain to her
exactly what happened.

414
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,599
Can I ask a simple question?
No doubt you'll tell me I'm wrong.

415
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,799
But could you not
have done that earlier?

416
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,159
Sent for Mrs Hill
and Mrs MacDonald here

417
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,880
and invited them in
and set their minds at rest?

418
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,599
Well, I don't know what they want
to be reassured about.

419
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,199
'This is the first
I've heard of it.'

420
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,799
'Really, Chief Constable?

421
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,159
'You see no error

422
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,159
'in the five-and-a-half-years
investigation?'

423
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,919
'Oh, there may have been errors.
We are not infallible.

424
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,359
'But you are not informed
of what the police did.'

425
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,599
I am informed
about what you didn't do,

426
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,119
and that's catch Peter Sutcliffe.

427
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,879
Oh, I'm aware of that.
That's pretty obvious.

428
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,439
Though I'm glad that you welcome
a public inquiry.

429
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,879
No, I didn't say that.

430
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,079
I would not resent an inquiry,

431
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,239
but who did the inquiry and how it
was conducted would be important.

432
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,359
'You see, the public
and so many commentators

433
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,599
'have criticised the police

434
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,879
'when they have not been privy
to all that the police have done.

435
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,400
'Until they are, they should
reserve judgement and criticism.'

436
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,639
Well, we are grateful to everyone

437
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,399
who's taken part
in tonight's discussion,

438
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,999
but we're particularly mindful
of the courage it must have taken

439
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,159
for both Mrs MacDonald and Mrs Hill
to speak out in public tonight.

440
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,639
'Our thoughts must be with them

441
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,919
'and with all the other relatives
of the Ripper's victims.

442
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,000
'From Leeds, good night.'

443
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,319
CREW MEMBER:
Everybody stay seated.

444
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,440
Nice and still
while the credits roll.

445
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,439
BELL RINGS
OK, thanks everyone.

446
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,199
We're just waiting to hear
from the gallery

447
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,799
in case there's anything to pick up.

448
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,160
CREW CHATTER

449
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,519
What about the accent?

450
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,359
What about the fact
that our daughter was told

451
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,080
that men in Yorkshire were safe?

452
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,199
And why did they call him
The Ripper?

453
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,759
He said it over and over on TV,
"The Ripper".

454
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,359
Like that's his name.

455
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,159
That's just what they say, love.
No.

456
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,799
That's what people used to say
when they didn't know who he was.

457
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,519
When they didn't know his name.

458
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,839
But now they know his name,
why don't they use it?

459
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,560
Why do they have to say
that wretched word?

460
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,640
I'll get someone
to take that thing off.

461
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,799
"As Police Constable Andrew Laptew

462
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,479
"sat in Sutcliffe's modestly
furnished living room in Bradford,

463
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,119
"he realised that everything
the police knew about The Ripper

464
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,919
"fitted the man he was questioning.

465
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,799
"He became convinced
Sutcliffe was The Ripper.

466
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,399
"He submitted a report
saying as much

467
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,999
"to The Ripper headquarters
in Leeds."

468
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,919
Everything just "fitted", did it?
It's not how it looks.

469
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,079
Did everything just fall into place
for Sherlock fucking Holmes?

470
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,799
How much they pay you?
They didn't.

471
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,959
No? So why go round there?
I didn't.

472
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,319
To cover his arse.

473
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,639
He met Sutcliffe,

474
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,679
and then all he did was hand in some
shitty bit of paper, and that's it.

475
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,479
Three more lasses get butchered,
and he's got to live with that then,

476
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,439
the fact that he never followed up.

477
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,399
And that is why he called 'em.
Not true, sir.

478
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,999
Make it known
that it wasn't his fault.

479
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,319
A journalist knocked on my door.
He'd heard I'd put a report in.

480
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,399
Said he'd got a tip.
A tip-off? From who?

481
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,639
No idea. But I said nothing.

482
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,319
Is someone trying to protect you?
Read the article.

483
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,479
Cos you went round there...
You'll find no quotes...

484
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,239
Sat there and had a cup of tea
with him in his front fucking room.

485
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,359
I weren't the only one.
Sorry?

486
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,760
He'd been interviewed nine times.

487
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
Nine?

488
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,359
That's what they're saying.
T'lasses in t'incident room.

489
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,879
So what does it matter
who spoke to what journalist,

490
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,720
when nine times we went round there,
and nine times we failed?

491
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,279
Just like you failed
when I handed you that report

492
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,599
cos you were blinded by that tape,
by that stupid accent. Careful.

493
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,199
It's not me
that's got to live with it,

494
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,439
with them three dead girls,
it's all of us.

495
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,680
But it is you and Oldfield the most.

496
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,400
You watch your fucking mouth.

497
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,200
I want to create
a substantial new role for you.

498
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,119
A role befitting of an
experienced chap like you, George.

499
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,919
Chief of Operational Support.

500
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,840
Running the engine room,
for the whole of West Yorkshire.

501
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,239
To oversee the policing
of all vehicles

502
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,519
and road-based transport
in our portion of the county.

503
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,719
Traffic.

504
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,679
To oversee the safekeeping of
criminal records and documentation.

505
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,199
The library.

506
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,039
And a full oversight of frogmen,
police dogs and police horses.

507
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,039
Animals.
Frogmen aren't animals, George.

508
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,039
They just have an animal
in their name.

509
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,360
Well, I won't do it.

510
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,880
I'm not going from Head of CID
to running the police farmyard.

511
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,800
People'll think I've been fired.

512
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,360
There's shit
coming down the line, George.

513
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,640
And before I retire, I want
to make sure that you are protected.

514
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,200
We attribute it to your health.

515
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,960
Needn't be a reflection
of you and your team.

516
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,959
What about Dick?

517
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,279
I'll find something for Dick.

518
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,760
Oh, well...

519
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,919
..you know, if there's shit
coming down the line,

520
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
then you put as many people
in the way of it as you can, eh?

521
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,440
Don't hold back.

522
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,159
Oh, Margaret wanted to know
if those gifts had arrived.

523
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,799
For Grace's birthday.

524
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,160
Oh, I don't know, George.

525
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,959
That's very kind of her.
I shall ask.

526
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,200
Well, she's good like that, my wife.

527
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,600
Considerate.

528
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,440
DOOR OPENS

529
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,039
Mr Byford, Mr Nevill.
Morning.

530
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,799
If you want to follow me,
I can show you upstairs?

531
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
Thank you.
Yep.

532
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,239
You are a bit earlier
than we expected,

533
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,640
but, er, we're nearly ready.

534
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,159
This is Mr Byford,

535
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,359
he'll be doing the official inquiry.
Hello.

536
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,640
Hello.
OFFICER: Sir.

537
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,720
Did you ladies work on the inquiry,
or are you just packing things up?

538
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,680
We did our share, sir.

539
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,319
Mr Byford requested you draw
all accounts from your system

540
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,799
that might relate to Sutcliffe.

541
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,159
Vehicles, Photofits,
anything you might think relevant.

542
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,240
Yes, sir. Follow me.

543
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,239
Statements, sightings,

544
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,999
any other paperwork, we've boxed up
and we've put in this office

545
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,960
cos, well,
it's more private in here.

546
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,599
These Photofits go back from 1972.

547
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,679
These are from the women
who survived.

548
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,760
The women he attacked
or followed or chased.

549
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,679
The ones he left for dead.

550
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,399
These are what they said they saw.

551
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,839
But not all of the women
were believed.

552
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,600
And these two photos, sir,
these are of Sutcliffe himself.

553
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,519
Er, this one from January.

554
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,720
And this one from when
he was arrested in '69.

555
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,679
Arrested in '69?

556
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,959
For going equipped.

557
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,120
He was caught, late at night,
carrying a hammer.

558
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,040
That's when he started.

559
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,880
KNOCK AT DOOR

560
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,159
Richard McCann?

561
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,159
Is this about our Sonia?
What's she done now?

562
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,039
She only left the house
about an hour ago.

563
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,400
Are you the son of Wilma McCann?

564
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,279
I'm Detective Chief Superintendent
Chris Gregg.

565
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,639
I was a young detective
on the Peter Sutcliffe case.

566
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,959
Sorry, but what's this...?

567
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,879
Because I find these things...

568
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
Can I come in?

569
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,079
I've been visiting
all the next of kin,

570
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,320
those related to the victims,
as we've had a development.

571
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,639
A few years ago, we arrested a man
for being drunk and disorderly.

572
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,039
As a result of his conviction,

573
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,759
he had to provide us
with a DNA sample

574
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,719
for the National Database.

575
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,039
Because I'm now Chief Super,

576
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,759
and because this case
really matters to me,

577
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,679
I make sure to run DNA tests
every few years, you see.

578
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,079
Tests on what?

579
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,960
On the man who wrote the letters.

580
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,039
There were never any prints,
but recently,

581
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,199
we found DNA
where he licked the envelope.

582
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,599
So two weeks ago, we ran the tests,

583
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,519
and we found a direct match

584
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,400
with the man who we'd arrested
for being drunk and disorderly.

585
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,399
That man...

586
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,800
is the man on the tape.

587
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,399
The man...

588
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,720
The man who sent the tape.

589
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,560
He's owned up to it.

590
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,159
Said that it was him,
that he regrets it,

591
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,559
the damage that he's caused...

592
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,520
Wait. No, no, no. I, er...

593
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,839
I need to hear him.
Hear his voice.

594
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,919
I-I need to...
Is there any way that you...?

595
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,999
Yeah,
that's one of the reasons I'm here.

596
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,039
Do you mind if I use
your DVD player? No.

597
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,359
It's just to show you,

598
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,399
like I'm showing
all the other friends and family.

599
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,400
But only if it'll help.
You don't have to.

600
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,160
His name is John Humble.
He's from Sunderland.

601
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,159
We had him read out the letters

602
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,359
in case he later
withdrew his confession.

603
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,999
'We've got a transcript here.

604
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,399
'Would you read that
for us please, John? Back in...'

605
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,119
'That's if I can see it.
My eyes are a bit dodgy, you know.'

606
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,679
'Take your time.'

607
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,599
' "I'm Jack.

608
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,479
' "I see you are still
having no luck catching me.

609
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,239
' "I have the greatest respect
for you, George, but, Lord!

610
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,720

than four years ago, when I started.

are letting you down, George.

612

' "They can't be much good,
can they?

613
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,759
' "The only time
they came near..." '

614
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,240
RECORDING STOPS

615
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,480
That's him.

616
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,560
The voice.

617
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,440
The man who killed Mum.

618
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,559
No, no.

619
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,679
He's just the man who...
No, no...

620
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,840
Maybe not for you, but for me.

621
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,480
D'you know, when they first caught
Sutcliffe, no-one bothered.

622
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,799
They were busy patting
each other on the back,

623
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,760
but no-one actually came
to tell me and Sonia, so thank you.

624
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,000
Why...

625
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,999
..did he do that?
Why did he send the tape?

626
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,079
You must have asked him.
Yeah.

627
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,480
And...?

628
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,400
Notoriety.

629
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,199
And everything he said on the tape,

630
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,959
every word and every detail
that he put down in those letters,

631
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,679
it was all there
in the papers already.

632
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,999
It was all there for him
to read and write down

633
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,839
and pass off as his own.

634
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,919
And my predecessors,
they never worked that out.

635
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,640
And, erm... you know...

636
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,800
..I only wish they had.

637
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,479
MAN: Hello, mate.

638
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
'People often ask me...

639
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,080
'.."how you do you even begin
to get over something like that?" '

640
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,359
And, erm, "What it's like,
being a survivor?"

641
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,119
HE SCOFFS

642
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,199
We're not survivors.
We're surviving.

643
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,439
It's a, er... What do you call it?

644
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,119
A work in progress.

645
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,039
We're managing.

646
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,480
The good days...

647
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,919
..and the bad days.

648
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,079
And, erm...

649
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,439
the best we can hope for
is that very rare thing.

650
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,959
The odd day, when you're working...

651
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,280
I'm a motivational speaker
these days.

652
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,920
But whatever it might be,
when...

653
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,600
..when it doesn't cross your mind.

654
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,719
Or at least you think it doesn't,
and...

655
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,719
till right before bedtime,

656
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,879
when it pops into your head,
and you think...

657
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,480
"Oh, God...
I nearly made it through."

658
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,160
Sorry.

659
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,760
Our mum were never a prostitute.

660
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,839
Yes, she liked a drink,
and-and...

661
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,199
yes, she had boyfriends.

662
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,519
She-She probably
got up to all sorts.

663
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,600
The point is,
the police never bothered to check.

664
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,679
Those men in charge,

665
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,479
they were more fixed
on finding out who he was.

666
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,399
They never even bothered
to find out who Mum was.

667
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,040
And it was the same
for the rest of them.

668
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,159
The police, they showed up,

669
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,479
and they saw a crime scene,
and they saw a victim.

670
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,880
But what very few of them
ever actually saw were the women.

671
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,280
And that's what's important now.

672
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,520
We want to make those women visible.

673
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,800
We want to see 'em in colour.

674
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,960
We want to bring them out of that...
that same long shadow.
