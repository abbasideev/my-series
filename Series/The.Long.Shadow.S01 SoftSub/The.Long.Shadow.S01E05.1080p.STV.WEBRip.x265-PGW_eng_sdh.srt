00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,199
<font color="cyan">There's been another one.</font>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,079
What IS the plan?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,999
How exactly are we planning
on stopping this man?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,759
<font color="yellow">So, it's not just Leeds,</font>
<font color="yellow">it's Bradford.</font>

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,519
<font color="yellow">Now he goes to Manchester</font>
<font color="yellow">for t'first time.</font>

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,399
<font color="lime">It might not be his first time.</font>
<font color="lime">Joan Harrison.</font>

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,079
<font color="lime">She were in...</font>
<font color="lime">Where were it? Preston?</font>

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,759
<font color="yellow">Hoban had us look into it</font>
<font color="yellow">and decided it weren't linked.</font>

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,999
<font color="cyan">Everybody knows the Ripper</font>
<font color="cyan">attacks prostitutes,</font>

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,999
<font color="cyan">and everybody knows</font>
<font color="cyan">the Ripper attacked me.</font>

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,439
<font color="cyan">Don't matter if it's not true.</font>
<font color="cyan">That's me scarred. Forever.</font>

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,919
"Dear Sir.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,319
"I'm sorry I cannot give my name
for obvious reasons.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,879
"I am the Ripper.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,919
"Up to number eight, you say seven,

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,319
"but remember Preston '75."

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,959
<font color="yellow">That's Joan Harrison.</font>
<font color="yellow">The one Hoban says wasn't linked.</font>

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,159
This is it. This is him.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Nobody knows about Harrison.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,359
This now is the inner circle.

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,239
Nobody outside of this room
has read that letter...

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,200
Come in, Dick, sit down.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,479
..and nor do they have to. Not yet.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,999
Not if we're confident
that this is our man.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,759
<font color="yellow">These have been fingerprinted, yes?</font>

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,079
<font color="cyan">Well, course they have.</font>
<font color="cyan">It's first thing we did.</font>

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,039
<font color="lime">"I can feel it coming on again."</font>

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,199
<font color="lime">Jesus Christ, George.</font>

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,839
Nobody knew about Joan Harrison,
not even us.

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,159
But she were hit on the head
with a hammer, left on display,

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,759
just like the others,
and he knew it.

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,679
And he says he posted this
in Sunderland on "one of his trips".

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,199
Now, we know he "gets about".
That's a clue, in't it?

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,759
So no more bothering with tyres that
may or may not have been changed.

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,799
That's done. We're putting
everything into, erm...

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,319
<font color="cyan">Triple area sightings.</font>

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,959
<font color="cyan">He might get about, but he's</font>
<font color="cyan">only ever in red-light districts.</font>

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,039
<font color="cyan">So any driver seen</font>
<font color="cyan">in three or more red-light areas</font>

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,319
<font color="cyan">gets a visit from us.</font>
<font color="cyan">Manchester, Huddersfield, Leeds,</font>

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,319
<font color="cyan">doesn't matter where,</font>
<font color="cyan">he gets a knock on the door.</font>

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,039
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>
<font color="yellow">we can still check for tyres, then.</font>

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,519
<font color="cyan">That's over now, Jim.</font>

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,439
<font color="yellow">No, cos if you're going</font>
<font color="yellow">to their houses...</font>

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,679
<font color="cyan">It's a waste of time.</font>

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,879
<font color="yellow">It takes two minutes!</font>
<font color="cyan">Jim, take the bloody hint.</font>

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,279
It's not a hint, it's an order.

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,559
Point is, there's thousands of men
using prostitutes.

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,679
But they usually go
to one red-light area.

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,959
Two, maybe, if they work
in a different town. But three?

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,559
That is rare.
That is a very short list.

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,040
But one man that you can guarantee
is on it... is the Ripper.

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,520
<font color="lime">Right, what d'you need, Dick?</font>
<font color="cyan">Three teams.</font>

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,400
DOOR SHUTS

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,119
<font color="lime">I did tell them to them face</font>
<font color="lime">when they come fi knock on my door,</font>

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
<font color="lime">"We're going nowhere.</font>
<font color="lime">We have a tenancy agreement."</font>

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,760
HOWARD: Yeah, erm... may I see?

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,279

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,999
DOOR SHUTS

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,199
Here we go, er,

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,479
"Landlord must give
six weeks' notice for eviction..."

61
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,359
<font color="lime">He say he want us to come out</font>
<font color="lime">Monday. </font><font color="white">Yeah. Yeah...</font>

62
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,639
"..unless conditions outlined
in clause 2b are applicable..."

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,919
Er... "Anti-social behaviour"?
<font color="lime">No.</font>

64
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,519
"Overdue rent"?
<font color="lime">No.</font>

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,319
"Or if emergency work is required."

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,719
<font color="lime">You see, that is what</font>
<font color="lime">I've been telling them.</font>

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,479
Sorry?
<font color="lime">No heating.</font>

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,519
<font color="lime">All winter, I was saying,</font>
<font color="lime">"No heating."</font>

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,599
<font color="lime">It cold. And they say, "If you</font>
<font color="lime">want it fixed, you have to get out.</font>

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,919
<font color="lime">"You get it fixed,</font>
<font color="lime">we come back another time. Maybe."</font>

71
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,159
Yeah, but if it's in the contract,
and you've signed the contract...

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,479
No, no, no. No. Go on.

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,879
<font color="yellow">Well, it's clear</font>
<font color="yellow">that the gentleman...</font>

74
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,159
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry,</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't know your name.</font>

75
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,679
<font color="lime">Calvin.</font>
<font color="yellow">Clearly, Calvin has a case.</font>

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,719
<font color="yellow">They can't evict him</font>

77
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,479
<font color="yellow">because they need to maintain</font>
<font color="yellow">their own property.</font>

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,279
<font color="yellow">And they won't be doing it, anyway.</font>

79
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,639
<font color="yellow">What they'll do is use it</font>
<font color="yellow">as an excuse to get the rent up.</font>

80
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,039
<font color="yellow">I had it with that flat on Oak Road.</font>

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,039
<font color="yellow">Tenants out for "renovations",</font>
<font color="yellow">flat's back on the market next week,</font>

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,439
<font color="yellow">only this time - surprise,</font>
<font color="yellow">surprise - with higher rent.</font>

83
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,479
Yeah, but the point is,
Calvin's signed the contract.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,639
<font color="yellow">Well, the point is</font>
<font color="yellow">the contract's not fair.</font>

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,919
<font color="yellow">That's the point.</font>

86
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,999
<font color="yellow">And they're relying on the fact</font>
<font color="yellow">that people like Calvin here</font>

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,279
<font color="yellow">won't seek out local lawyers</font>
<font color="yellow">like us to challenge them.</font>

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,359
<font color="yellow">But you have. And we will.</font>

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,960
<font color="yellow">Or Howard will, you're his client.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but I can't stand it.</font>

90
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,640
This is Ruth, by the way.

91
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,960
SONG: 'Bridge Over
Troubled Water'

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,479
Is he here?

93
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,199
<font color="yellow">Looks ever so smart.</font>
<font color="yellow">I've asked him to stop for his tea.</font>

94
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,919
Well, he can come up here first.

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,079
<font color="yellow">Jackie.</font>
Mam, I'm 18.

96
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,639
About to go to university,
I'm allowed boys in my room.

97
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,599
I want him to hear me new record.

98
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,039
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>
<font color="yellow">Well, leave the door open.</font>

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,600
Mam!
<font color="yellow">What? Then we can all hear it!</font>

100
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,159
<font color="yellow">How far is that, Ben?</font>
<font color="cyan">Kinloss?</font>

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,359
<font color="cyan">That's a six-hour drive</font>
<font color="cyan">to get there, Mrs Hill.</font>

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,879
<font color="yellow">Six?</font>
<font color="lime">And they call THIS the North East.</font>

103
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
I keep saying
it'd be quicker to fly.

104
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,519
You know, cos he's in the RAF.

105
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,559
<font color="cyan">They have a scheme</font>
<font color="cyan">for girls to join.</font>

106
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,079
<font color="cyan">They even do grants for university,</font>
<font color="cyan">but Jackie wants to join the police.</font>

107
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,679
Or the Probation Service.

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,759
<font color="cyan">I'm still not sure about all that,</font>
<font color="cyan">you know?</font>

109
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,199
<font color="yellow">No? Why not?</font>

110
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,719
<font color="yellow">Go on, I wanna hear this.</font>

111
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,359
<font color="cyan">Well...</font>
<font color="cyan">when it comes to an actual career,</font>

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,239
<font color="cyan">there's not many girls</font>
<font color="cyan">get involved in that sort of thing.</font>

113
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,760
<font color="yellow">Exactly. And that needs to change.</font>

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,679
Well, no-one's saying it
for certain,

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,559
but Brian Newton,
who's at Wakefield...

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,319
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I know Brian.</font>

117
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,079
Right, well, he heard Mr Gregory
talking about it on t'telephone.

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,039
And Jenny reckons
that's what got Oldfield

119
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,839
shouting the place down
the other day.

120
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,239
<font color="cyan">Said it straight after</font>
<font color="cyan">I gave him t'post.</font>

121
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,559
<font color="cyan">And before that,</font>
<font color="cyan">he were all... subdued.</font>

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,639
<font color="lime">So did YOU see the letter?</font>

123
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,519
<font color="cyan">It would've been in a pile.</font>
Well, she would have done.

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,920
<font color="cyan">But they get that many.</font>

129
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,879

<font color="lime">really sent a letter?</font>

147
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,919
<font color="yellow">You'll be making calls</font>
<font color="yellow">all day today, yes?</font>

148
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,119
<font color="yellow">And I won't need to know</font>
<font color="yellow">the details of those calls,</font>

149
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,079
<font color="yellow">cos I know that</font>
<font color="yellow">if something important comes in,</font>

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,119
<font color="yellow">you'll send it through</font>

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,399

<font color="yellow">that you need to know about,</font>

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,399
<font color="yellow">that you can help with,</font>
<font color="yellow">we'll let you know.</font>

153
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,999
<font color="yellow">Not in a nasty way.</font>

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,119
<font color="yellow">Just we can't have everybody knowing</font>
<font color="yellow">everything, as that gets confusing.</font>

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,239
<font color="yellow">Does that make sense?</font>

<font color="lime">Yes, sir.</font>
<font color="yellow">Good lass.</font>

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,240
<font color="lime">We can take that as a yes, then.</font>

Morning.

<font color="lime">This is different.</font>

186
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,239

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,240
No, I can't take the form.
You scrunch it up, threw it away.

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
<font color="lime">I did keep it.</font>

192

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,999

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,720
<font color="lime">And you show them.</font>

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,479

he ain't never going to help me.

<font color="lime">She.</font>

197
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,679
Her name's Donna DeAngelo.

198
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,759
She was a prostitute
found under a mattress in Bradford.

199
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,479
I mean, there's a lot to like,

200
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,919
but David Gee
isn't linking it quite yet.

201
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,079
<font color="yellow">No? It was on the news.</font>
Yeah, but it's not official.

202
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,839
The injuries aren't quite the same.

203
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,719
You know, I mean,
we're not discounting it,

204
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,199
but she's been lying there
for several weeks,

205
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,679
so it's taken a while to sort out.

206
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,119
<font color="yellow">And there are others like this?</font>

207
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,839
<font color="yellow">Ones you're not sure about</font>
<font color="yellow">that could well be the Ripper?</font>

208
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,719
Yes, there's a handful, yeah.

209
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,359
<font color="yellow">Some of them, survivors?</font>
<font color="yellow">Women who'll have met him?</font>

210
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,439
Yeah, but if they've survived,

211
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,599
they've survived
a crack on the head, haven't they?

212
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,479
And some of these women are not
the most reputable types, you know,

213
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
what they say and what we believe
are not always the same.

214
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,439
Now, what we don't want to do
is link one of these by mistake,

215
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,679
and that'll send us off
right down wrong path, won't it?

216
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,359
<font color="yellow">Right, but we need something.</font>
<font color="yellow">It'll be three years in October.</font>

217
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,679
<font color="yellow">And there's nothing in the letter</font>
<font color="yellow">to tell you who he is.</font>

218
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
Well... I believe it's him.

219
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,279
<font color="yellow">It might well be.</font>

220
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,119
<font color="yellow">But there's nothing</font>
<font color="yellow">in the actual letter</font>

221
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,159
<font color="yellow">that gets you any closer</font>
<font color="yellow">to knowing who he is.</font>

222
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,360
<font color="yellow">Or am I wrong?</font>

223
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,559
<font color="yellow">To me, you could do a lot worse</font>
<font color="yellow">than having someone like Domaille</font>

224
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,439
<font color="yellow">meet these women,</font>
<font color="yellow">these... survivors.</font>

225
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,239
<font color="yellow">Interview them, so you can</font>
<font color="yellow">either rule them out properly</font>

226
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,479
<font color="yellow">or rule them in officially.</font>

227
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,719
<font color="yellow">See if what they say</font>
<font color="yellow">can't push you along. Just an idea.</font>

228
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,680
<font color="yellow">But this is your area of expertise,</font>
<font color="yellow">not mine.</font>

229
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,479
'I'm sorry. Me friend got angry.'

230
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,239
He scrunched it up like that.

231
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,319
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>
<font color="yellow">No, in a way, I rather like it.</font>

232
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,399
<font color="yellow">"My client found your response</font>
<font color="yellow">to be so objectionable,</font>

233
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,840
<font color="yellow">"that it had to be fished</font>
<font color="yellow">from a nearby bin."</font>

234
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,039
<font color="yellow">It is disgusting, this judgement.</font>

235
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,399
<font color="yellow">On so many levels.</font>

236
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,959
<font color="yellow">The assumptions it makes about you,</font>

237
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,960
<font color="yellow">the suggestion that you in some way</font>
<font color="yellow">brought this attack upon yourself.</font>

238
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,400
<font color="yellow">I bet it's changed things, has it?</font>

239
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,160
Every moment of every day.

240
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,719
You drive a fast car. A blue car.

241
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,719
I saw you once.

242
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,879
Music blaring,
not a care in the world...

243
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,960
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't always...</font>
No, darling. I like it.

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,279
<font color="yellow">Aye, I can't complain.</font>

255
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,760
<font color="yellow">Well, I can, but I won't.</font>

<font color="yellow">How about you, Dennis?</font>

257
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,320
Oh... not so bad.

258
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,880
'Ey.

259
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,199
I-I know I haven't been there
day-to-day,

260
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,919
but I have been keeping tabs
on things...

261
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,839
<font color="yellow">Oh, no, come on. Let's not...</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see you.</font>

262
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,399
A-And what you find, you see,

263
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,159
when you have time away...
is perspective.

264
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,119
<font color="yellow">Aye. Well, you would do.</font>

265
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,079
Yeah.
Start seeing the wood for t'trees.

266
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,760
And now, it strikes me that...

267
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,920
..all this time...

268
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,159
..we've been looking for a monster.

What you'll find,
if and when you do,

271
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,919
is someone...

272
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,159
forgettable.

273
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,959
A man who buys t'paper,
like you and me.

274
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,319
Puts up shelves.

275
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,200
Goes for a pint,
bickers with his wife.

276
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,640
Can't speak openly with his mates.

277
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,599
<font color="yellow">A nobody.</font>

278
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,520
Not a nobody, that's...
that's different.

279
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,280
A normal man.

280
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,200
Otherwise...

281
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,800
..you'd have spotted him by now.

282
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
You've interviewed...

283
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,679
..thousands of people.

284
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,559
And what's that tell you?

285
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,880
<font color="yellow">That we will meet him very soon.</font>

286
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,480
You've met him already.

287
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,040
He's in system.

288
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,320
Bound to be.

289
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,520
He needs to...

290
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,599
..change things, Oldfield.

291
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,639
Otherwise,
it's going to get away from him.

292
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,439
He needs to change the way
he's thinking.

293
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
Fetch that book.

294
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
Aye.

295

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,959
<font color="cyan">She looked it an' all.</font>
<font color="cyan">She were frail.</font>

441
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,799
She were ill. She'd been in
hospital. He mentions that an' all.

442
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,359
And in my letter, he says, what?
At the bottom, "Maybe Liverpool..."

443
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,279
<font color="lime">"Maybe Liverpool</font>
<font color="lime">or even Manchester again.</font>

444
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,080
<font color="lime">"Too hot here in Yorkshire. Bye."</font>

445
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,800
<font color="lime">Not getting much wrong, is he?</font>

446
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,039
<font color="lime">I'm beginning to wonder,</font>
<font color="lime">can we trust The Mirror?</font>

447
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,159
<font color="cyan">Well, they came straight to us,</font>
<font color="cyan">and they've agreed not to publish.</font>

448
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,079
<font color="yellow">Well, what if we do let 'em publish?</font>

449
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,999
<font color="yellow">What would be the downside to that?</font>

450
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,039
<font color="cyan">Don't talk daft.</font>

451
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,919
<font color="lime">I don't see what's daft about it.</font>

452
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,239
<font color="lime">Someone might recognise the writing.</font>

453
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,799
<font color="lime">And if he knew we were reading them,</font>
<font color="lime">he might write again,</font>

454
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,679
<font color="lime">give us something extra to go on.</font>

455
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,839
No. I'm not having him
think he's in charge.

456
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,079
That letter, it were addressed
to me personally.

457
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,719
<font color="yellow">He's goading you.</font>

458
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,839
So I get to decide if we go public.

459
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,760
It's down to me.
<font color="lime">OK.</font>

460
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,999
Registration, Juliet-Foxtrot-Papa,
six-two-two-Delta.

461
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,079
A Vauxhall Viva.

462
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,439
<font color="yellow">On a John Minter of Shipley.</font>
<font color="cyan">What's reg?</font>

463
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,799
<font color="lime">We've got him down as</font>
<font color="lime">the last statement on the seventh.</font>

464
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,599
Right,
there's now a quadruple sighting,

465
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,519
including Bradford
on the night of Atkinson.

466
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,839
MURMUR OF CONVERSATIONS

467
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,919
He has indeed, sir.
He's been a busy boy.

468
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,079
<font color="lime">I can't come home, no.</font>

469
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,439
<font color="lime">No!</font>

470
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,080
<font color="lime">You do your job,</font>
<font color="lime">you do your overtime...</font>

471
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
<font color="lime">Neither can I!</font>
<font color="lime">Because that's my job.</font>

472
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,039
<font color="lime">Well, I don't think</font>
<font color="lime">it's sustainable, either.</font>

473
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,799
<font color="lime">Because if I leave now...</font>

474
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,160
WHISPERING: <font color="lime">If I leave now,</font>
<font color="lime">then I'm letting them down.</font>

475
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,599
<font color="cyan">We won't keep you long,</font>
<font color="cyan">Mrs Rogulskyj. </font><font color="white">OK.</font>

476
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,999
So, what myself and Les here
have been doing,

477
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,799
is comparing all the attacks

478
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,519
that we know for sure
to be by the Ripper.

479
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,479
<font color="cyan">With those that might</font>
<font color="cyan">or might not be.</font>

480
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,520
<font color="cyan">Sort things out properly.</font>
<font color="cyan">Does that make sense?</font>

481
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,999
You and your mum,
you've been in once before, yes?

482
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,599
Saying you think
that the man we've been looking for

483
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,959
might have been the same man
who attacked you?

484
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,759
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>
<font color="yellow">As soon as we saw it in t'paper.</font>

485
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,999
<font color="lime">But they didn't believe her.</font>

486
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,120
Could you describe him for me?

487
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,280
<font color="lime">He were about 5' 8". Blue shirt.</font>

488
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,520
<font color="lime">He had these dark-coloured eyes.</font>

489
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,720
<font color="lime">And a dark beard,</font>
<font color="lime">like it said in the paper.</font>

490
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,919
<font color="lime">I were just walking down the lane...</font>

491
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,840
<font color="lime">and so were he, so, you know,</font>
<font color="lime">just fell into talking.</font>

492
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,000
<font color="lime">And he were nice enough.</font>

493
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,080
<font color="lime">He kept hanging back,</font>
<font color="lime">to tie his shoe.</font>

494
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,640
<font color="lime">Then just as I turned around,</font>
<font color="lime">to thank him for his company...</font>

495
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,360
<font color="lime">..he started hitting me.</font>

496
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,400
<font color="lime">Over and over. On the head.</font>

497
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,039
<font color="lime">Grunting.</font>

498
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,640
<font color="lime">Grunting from the effort.</font>

499
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,160
But it was only the head?

500
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,159
<font color="yellow">"Only"? She were covered in blood.</font>

501
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,960
But he didn't attack you anywhere
else? Any other part of the body?

502
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,199
You were hit three times on the head
with a hammer, Mrs Rogulskyj.

503
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,719
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>
Then slashed in the stomach.

504
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
That's the pattern
we're looking for.

505
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,479
That is what the Ripper does.
<font color="yellow">So what are you saying?</font>

506
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,839
Sorry?

507
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,399
<font color="yellow">You calling me a prostitute?</font>

508
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,679
No. No.

509
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,120
We're saying he made a mistake.
That when he saw you, he...

510
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,680
..he thought you were a prostitute.

511
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,959
He's picking up these women
in a car,

512
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,719
and he's doing it in urban areas.

513
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,959
You live in the countryside,
Mrs Browne, yes?

514
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,919
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right. In Silsden.</font>

515
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,359
So there's a lot of things here
that do not apply.

516
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,959
<font color="yellow">He's hitting lasses with hammers.</font>
Yes.

517
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,679
And then he's ripping them
across their stomachs

518
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,079
with a screwdriver or a knife.

519
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,679
<font color="lime">He didn't get a chance.</font>
That is what links these cases.

520
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,319
<font color="lime">He didn't get a chance.</font>
And that is not what happened here.

521
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,919
<font color="yellow">He saw someone coming, and he ran</font>
<font color="yellow">off, that's what saved her life.</font>

522
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,959
<font color="cyan">You don't want your daughter</font>
<font color="cyan">to be known as a victim</font>

523
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,999
<font color="cyan">of the Yorkshire Ripper, do you?</font>
<font color="lime">Course she don't.</font>

524
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,519
<font color="cyan">Well, then.</font>
<font color="lime">But that's what I am.</font>

525
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,719
<font color="yellow">Why would she make it up?</font>

526
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,080
Well, she's your daughter,
Mrs Browne. You tell me.

527
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,839
We'll be including you
in the series. <font color="yellow">No.</font>

528
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,879
That'll be the recommendation.
<font color="yellow">I don't want including.</font>

529
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,440
Look, you were attacked by a man
who made a terrible mistake.

530
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,160
There's no shame in it, love.

531
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,919
<font color="yellow">But there IS shame in it.</font>

532
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,400
<font color="yellow">I'll be left to deal with it.</font>

533
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,759
<font color="yellow">There'll be folks buying papers</font>
<font color="yellow">in the shop where I work</font>

534
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,919
<font color="yellow">who will read all that,</font>

535
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,679
<font color="yellow">that the Ripper came for me,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I must be a prostitute.</font>

536
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,559
And you'll tell them
the Ripper made a mistake.

537
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,719
<font color="yellow">And I'll tell them</font>
<font color="yellow">the Ripper made a mistake,</font>

538
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,359
<font color="yellow">and they'll think, "Well</font>
<font color="yellow">she would say that, wouldn't she?</font>

539
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,839
<font color="yellow">"Wouldn't want people to know</font>
<font color="yellow">what she really gets up to,</font>

540
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,239
<font color="yellow">"but it's too late now,"</font>
<font color="yellow">that's what they'll say.</font>

541
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,519
<font color="yellow">"Her secret's out.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's in the papers.</font>

542
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,519
<font color="yellow">"Now we know the truth."</font>
Well, if that happens...

543
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,159
<font color="yellow">Except it is not the truth!</font>

544
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,800
If that happens, Mrs Rogulskyj,
then I'm sorry.

545
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,240
But none of that means
he didn't attack you, does it?

546
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,560
HE EXHALES

547
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,880
PHONE RINGS

548
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,759
Grange Moor.
<font color="yellow">'George, Jim Hobson here.'</font>

549
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,279
Look, if this is about
those letters,

550
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,879
I'm not gonna change my mind.

551
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,679
<font color="yellow">No, it's not about the letters.</font>

552
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,599
<font color="yellow">I, erm...</font>

553
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,960

JIM CLEARS THROAT

556
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,840
<font color="yellow">She said, "There's another one".</font>

557
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,080
What does that mean?

558
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,720
<font color="yellow">'Meaning that he's claimed</font>
<font color="yellow">another one. He's killed again.'</font>

559
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,799
That's bollocks.

560
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,080
<font color="yellow">Well, that's just Betty's way</font>
<font color="yellow">of putting it, all right?</font>

561
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,879
<font color="yellow">Funeral details are to follow,</font>

562
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,919
<font color="yellow">but I said there'd be a good showing</font>
<font color="yellow">from our side...</font>

563
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,280
<font color="yellow">Leeds lads especially.</font>

564
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,599
<font color="yellow">When you think about it,</font>

565
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
<font color="yellow">this were t'one case</font>
<font color="yellow">that he couldn't crack...</font>

566
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,080

567
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,400
<font color="yellow">'I'll see you in the morning.'</font>

568
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,360
DISCONNECT TONE

569
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,160
HE COUGHS LIGHTLY

570
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,680
COUGHING INTENSIFIES

571
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,960
<font color="cyan">You all right, love?</font>

572
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,080
MUFFLED COUGH
<font color="cyan">Love?</font>

573
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,919
I need a quick drink, that's all.

574
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,199
<font color="cyan">Shall I get you a glass of water?</font>
Aye.

575
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,079
Good idea.

576
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,360
A quick drink and a glass of water.
HE COUGHS

577
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,799
Right. Stuck in that office
God knows how long,

578
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,999
so this is my idea.

579
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,319
I want you seeing
what this is actually all about

580
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,399
and what you're doing it for.

581
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,920
It's not just bits of paper,
these are real places...

582
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,679
..real people, real crimes.

583
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,639
Now, this became a scene
first thing this morning.

584
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,719
You've got forensics officers here
as you can see,

585
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,359
an area cordoned off

586
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,439
and a roadblock built
all around Savile Park.

587
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,560
Dave.

588
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,159
<font color="cyan">Victim was a Josephine Whitaker,</font>
<font color="cyan">early 20s...</font>

589
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,439
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

590
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,560
<font color="lime">Did he just say early 20s?</font>
Mm-hm.

591
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,599
<font color="lime">Oh, God.</font>

592
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,239
<font color="cyan">The initial attack</font>
<font color="cyan">was around here...</font>

593
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,240
<font color="cyan">and then he's dragged her out</font>
<font color="cyan">onto the grass.</font>

594
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,160
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

595
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,440
<font color="lime">My sister's got the same shoe.</font>

596
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,479
What this is, I'm afraid,
is another mistake.

597
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,079
In our determination
to catch this man,

598
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,479
we're driving him
out of his comfort zone,

599
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,439
and he is travelling further
and further afield

600
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,279
to find prostitutes and...

601
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,720
<font color="yellow">Er, Josephine wasn't a prostitute.</font>
Just let me finish, Mike.

602
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,679
He is travelling further afield
to find prostitutes

603
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,279
and such are the number of officers
looking for him

604
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,279
that he is now making
repeated mistakes.

605
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,159
<font color="yellow">Is it fair to say</font>
<font color="yellow">that every woman is at risk?</font>

606
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,599
<font color="cyan">Inadvertently.</font>

607
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,319
<font color="yellow">But the pressure's getting to him?</font>
Correct.

608
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,239
<font color="lime">Pressure's on, as they say.</font>

609
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,199
Oh, we sincerely hope so.

610
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,759
WOMAN: <font color="yellow">That's now three murders</font>
<font color="yellow">in under a year.</font>

611
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,879
<font color="yellow">So, Chief Constable,</font>

612
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,120
<font color="yellow">what would your advice be</font>
<font color="yellow">to the women of Yorkshire?</font>

613
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,439
<font color="cyan">Stay home, stay safe.</font>

614
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,800
MAN FAINTLY: <font color="lime">Stay home?</font>

615
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,880
DOOR KNOCKS

616
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,080
Marcella Claxton?
West Yorkshire Police.

617
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,640
Can we have a word?

618
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,480
Now, maybe, Marcella, I'm...
finding all this a touch confusing.

619
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Maybe you can help me out here.

620
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
Now you say you were up
on Soldier's Field at, er...

621
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,880
..whenever it was,
silly o'clock in the morning.

622
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,960
You make a point of saying
you're not a prostitute...

623
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,719
..yet you offer no explanation

624
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,479
as to what it was
you were doing there.

625
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,479
<font color="yellow">I can't remember.</font>
You can't remember?

626
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,680
<font color="yellow">But I know it were him.</font>
Do you?

627
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,040
Why?

628
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,919
How can you be so certain

629
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,239
if you can't even remember
what you were doing there?

630
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,839
<font color="yellow">You heard the name Richardson?</font>
I heard the name Richardson.

631
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,799
<font color="cyan">We know who she is,</font>
<font color="cyan">if that's what you're asking.</font>

632
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,519
<font color="cyan">We wouldn't be doing our jobs</font>
<font color="cyan">if we didn't.</font>

633
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,039
<font color="yellow">She were attacked in same place.</font>
Yes.

634
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,359
<font color="yellow">Fifty yards away.</font>

635
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,440
<font color="cyan">Yes, and she was a prostitute,</font>
<font color="cyan">wasn't she? So that makes sense.</font>

636
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,759
Either you were there selling sex

637
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,840
or to steal from a man
wanting to pay for it.

638
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,399
It's one or the other.
SHE EXHALES

639
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,160
If you won't admit that...

640
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,080
..how is anyone to believe
anything you say?

641
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,439
I've locked the back door.

642
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,360
I'll leave you to do the front.
<font color="yellow">Mm-hm.</font>

643
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,239
If they agree to review
the decision,

644
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,439
you'll need Marcella to sign it.

645
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,120
You know that, don't you?
<font color="yellow">Mm-hm.</font>

646
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,720
Don't work too late.

647
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,080

<font color="cyan">this is how they're carrying on?</font>

651
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,279

<font color="cyan">Yes, yes, she's here. Will do.</font>

654
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,119
<font color="cyan">No, no, it's not that, darling.</font>

655
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,160
<font color="cyan">It were Mr Oldfield.</font>
<font color="cyan">He wants to see you.</font>

656
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
MEG LAUGHS NERVOUSLY,
CLEARS THROAT

657
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,960
Sit yourself down.

658
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,399
Remember I told you,

659
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,359
"If ever we get something
that you can help with,

660
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,599
then we'll let you know?"

661
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,279
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>
<font color="cyan">Right.</font>

662
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,519
<font color="cyan">I want you to go into that office</font>
<font color="cyan">and type up what's on here.</font>

663
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,560
<font color="cyan">I'd ask one of the secretaries,</font>
<font color="cyan">but we need someone we can trust.</font>

664
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,359
<font color="yellow">Who's it from?</font>
<font color="cyan">Just type it up as quick as you can.</font>

665
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,520
<font color="cyan">There's a good girl.</font>

666
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

667
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,600
<font color="cyan">'I'm Jack.</font>

668
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,040
<font color="cyan">'I see you are still having no luck</font>
<font color="cyan">catching me.</font>

669
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,440

670
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,440
SHE EXHALES

671
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,760
SHE EXHALES

672
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,880
SHE CLEARS THROAT

673
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,800
<font color="cyan">'I'm Jack.</font>

674
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,959
<font color="cyan">'I see you are still having no luck</font>

676
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,439
Right, you all know Dave Zackrisson
down from Sunderland.

677
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,919
David, this is Jack Ridgway
from Lancashire.

678
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,639
<font color="yellow">Look, is he a Geordie?</font>

679
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,199
<font color="cyan">He's not Newcastle,</font>
<font color="cyan">but he's North East, no question.</font>

680
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,919
<font color="lime">And the writing on the envelope</font>
<font color="lime">is a match to that on the letters.</font>

681
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,799
<font color="yellow">There's no doubt.</font>
So we're all agreed.

682
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,959
Whoever wrote those letters
sent that tape.

683
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,279
And here's another thing -

684
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,639
forensics have done tests
on the letters.

685
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,919
The saliva on the envelope tells us

686
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,079
that the man who wrote those letters
is blood group B.

687
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,719
<font color="lime">B non-secretor.</font>

688
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,799
Same as the man
who killed Joan Harrison.

689
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,199
Now you want to know how many men
are B non-secretor?

690
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,639
Six percent.
That's one in 20, roughly.

691
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,080
And, remember, he knows things
that only the killer would know.

692
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,479
<font color="cyan">Then this is it. We go public.</font>
No.

693
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,719
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>
Let's not be hasty.

694
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,279
<font color="cyan">We call a press conference.</font>

695
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,119
<font color="cyan">We can have it</font>
<font color="cyan">on television tonight.</font>

696
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,839
<font color="cyan">Someone is going to recognise</font>
<font color="cyan">that voice.</font>

697
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,719
<font color="yellow">I agree. </font><font color="white">Look,</font>
putting this out will drown us.

698
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,199
You think we're busy now,
this'll open up the floodgates.

699
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,319
<font color="yellow">Ah, we've gotta change things,</font>
<font color="yellow">George. We've got to change things!</font>

700
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,199
<font color="yellow">We can't just sit here waiting</font>

701
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,039
<font color="yellow">for him to strike again</font>
<font color="yellow">and again and again.</font>

702
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,759
<font color="cyan">How many did you find?</font>
<font color="lime">Another three.</font>

703
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,839
<font color="lime">Anna Rogulskyj,</font>

705
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,239
<font color="lime">Donna DeAngelo,</font>
<font color="lime">now confirmed attacked and killed.</font>

706
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,599
<font color="yellow">And not all of them prostitutes,</font>
<font color="yellow">either. It were never just that.</font>

707
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,239
<font color="yellow">He's after any lass going.</font>

708
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,399
He wants prostitutes.
He says it himself.

709
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,839
He's says it on the bloody tape.

710
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,240
<font color="cyan">And if it's not him?</font>
It's him!

711
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,199
<font color="cyan">But if there was a mistake or...?</font>

712
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,479
<font color="yellow">Right, then, well,</font>
<font color="yellow">somebody will recognise that voice,</font>

713
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,159
<font color="yellow">we'll find him, we'll eliminate him,</font>
<font color="yellow">and then we can move on,</font>

714
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,360
<font color="yellow">and that'll be a result</font>
<font color="yellow">all in itself.</font>

715
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,920
Right, let's have it, then.

716
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,960
How many people in here thinks
that we shouldn't go public?

717
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,640
<font color="lime">Only one.</font>

718
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,639
<font color="lime">We need action, George.</font>
