So, Mummy said
she weren't going out,

36
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
but you think she might've done?

37
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,200
Had she done that before, love?
Left you on your own?

38
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,080

where she were going?

apparently.

But not through front door,
through here.

44
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,759

leaving kids.

they only just missed her.

At 7:41 this morning,

75
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,159
the body of a 28-year-old woman,
Wilma McCann,

76
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,199
was found
in the Prince Philip playing fields

77
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,639
behind Scott Hall Avenue
in Chapeltown.

78
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,119
Wilma had been stabbed 15 times.

79
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,759
Two further lacerations were found
on t'back of her head.

80
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,599
Impact wounds from some kind of
tool. Hammer, spanner, maybe.

81
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,760
I'm telling you this
not to shock you...

82
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,879
..because
I want you all to appreciate

83
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,280
what one person did to another
person in our city last night.

84
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,359
And it's our job, it's your job...

85
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,999
to find out who they are
and why this happened.

86
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,520
SOFTLY:
I think cos she was an whore.

87
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,599
Little louder, John,
so all t'class can hear.

88
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,639
I said she died, sir,
because she was a prostitute.

89
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Vice have never heard of her.
Don't mean she wasn't one.

90
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
She'd already been done
for drunk and disorderly.

91
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,040
She might've been a prostitute...

92
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,040
..she might not.
Might've liked a drink, might not.

93
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,559
But nobody, whoever they are,

94
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,719

like Wilma died last night.

95
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,039

96

155
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,320

The killer was driving.

He could've been on foot.

157
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,559

Hm?
I've seen you before.

179
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,439
Hm. All right.

180
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,119
How does it, er, work, then? Er...

181
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,560
You got a place where we can go?
How much?

MUSIC AND CHATTERING
CONTINUES

183
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,359
The last confirmed sighting
of the dead woman, Wilma McCann,

184
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,199
was on the corner of Meanwood Road,
at 1am.

185
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,959
What we want now
is for anyone who was either in

186
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,999
or driving through
the Chapeltown area at that time

187
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,039
to make themselves known to us
immediately. Wilma was a mother.

188
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,800
Her kids were waiting for her,
but she never made it home.

189
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,359
Please, if you have
any information... come forward...

190
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,920
for their sake.

191
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,440
Er, Chief Constable Gregory's here.
I can see.

192
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,879
I saw
the Mercedes parked up outside.

193
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,079
Here to check up on me?
I'm here to do nothing of the kind.

194
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,599
The lovely Jenny
has provided a cup of tea,

195
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,920
and I'm... familiarising myself
with this map of yours.

196
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,919
This arrow here,
I was wondering, represents...

197
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,519
Last known sighting of Wilma McCann.

198
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,999
And this is where she was killed?
Sir.

199
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,959
And all you've got to do is
figure out what happened in between.

200
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,239
So... you are here
to check up on me.

201
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,999
I'm dropping in to make sure
you've got everything you need.

202
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,399
Sir...
we have a list of 29 suspects...

203
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,399
we found in her notebook.

204
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,600
We're working our way through them
as we speak.

205
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,679
What's interesting about this case,
it's... not been motivated by sex.

206
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,319
He's killed her first. But it's not
purely violence, either...

207
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,399
Dennis. You are confident,
and I have every confidence in you.

208
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,439
No, the reason I dropped by
was to make sure you don't try

209
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,399
and duck the Christmas drinks
for the third year running. Drinks?

210
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,360
This new merger -
chaps I'd like you to meet.

211
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,279
Well, sir, I... I shall certainly
see if I'm free that night.

212
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,439
You are free. According
to the lovely Jenny, that is.

213
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,080
You can give me
the proper update then.

We've handed out 10,000 leaflets,

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,679
and we've gone door to-door

247

in a half-mile radius.
Pubs?

248
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,679
And the pubs, aye. We've gone
round them twice. And every shop.

249
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,759
The only new witness is a bloke

250
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,599
who sold her chips and curry sauce.
When?

251
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,439
Just after one. She were pissed.
That's all he remembers.

252
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,319
Right. So we keep going.
Door to door.

253
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,599

more leaflets, print more posters,

SHE SIGHS

There were this man
at Eric's birthday,

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,840
when you were at t'bar...
this good-looking man.

262
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,079
And when I went for a dance,
he went for a dance.

263
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,679
And when I went to t'toilets...
so did he.

264
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,479
If this is what I think it is,
I'll kill you.

265
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,639

Just let me finish.

266
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,359

Sydney. I swear to God!

267
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,759
Well, I could've done.
I could've done something,

268
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,439
and... well, why shouldn't I?
It's not like we ever do,

269
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,239
ever since Derek died.
I'd've been within my rights...

270
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,999
No, you wouldn't. I didn't.
No? I didn't, no.

271
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,759
Because he offered money.
He thought he'd seen me before

272
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,760
at, um... Spencer Place,
with the working girls.

273
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,200
He thought what...?
He even took out a £5 note.

274
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,240
£5, Sydney.

275
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,040
£5 for how long would it have been?
Five minutes?

276
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,080
No.

277
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,319
No, you're my wife.
They've sent a summons.

00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,480
it's on my way out to the M62.

311
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,039
But this one here...
she's not on t'pavement,

312
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,159
she's right in front of me,
right in t'middle of t'road.

313
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,199
Her hair weren't like that,
though. It were darker.

314
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,679
So, go on, you drove past her?

315
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,679
No. No. I was...
You picked her up.

316
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,519
No. Now is this something
that you do all the time, or...

317
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,239
Let him speak, Jim.

318
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,319
I were thinking about it.
About picking her up.

319
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,919
No crime in thinking about it.
I even parked up.

320
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,999
But when she came over to t'window,

321
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,839
I could tell
she were too pissed for it.

322
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,359
Could hardly stand still.

323
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,879
I'm not having her chucking up in
my cab, you see, it's only on lease.

324
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,720
So you just leave her there?
Drunk, in t'middle of t'road? No.

325
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,359
That's how it sounds,
t'way you're describing it.

326
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,080
This is why I wanted to talk to you.

327
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,839
So, I've decided better of it,

328
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,360
so I'm expecting a bit of stick as
I pull away, but I don't get any...

329
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,519
..cos she's already got
another punter.

330
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,119
He's pulled in right behind me.

331
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,239
Another lorry?
A car. And she goes with him.

332
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,599
Did you see t'driver?
No.

333
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,599
But it were a Corsair. A Corsair
or a Fastback. Summat like that.

334
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,079
So, why has it taken you a month
to come forward with all this?

335
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,040
Well, I live in Rochdale.
This is t'first I've heard of it.

336
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,920
You're talking
