1
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:30,157
Hello, love.

2
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,633
'Oh, hi. Just, er, just tried you.'

3
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:34,534
Did you? My volume was down.

4
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:37,505
'Are you at home?'

5
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:40,141
I went to early yoga, just finished.

6
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,337
'Er, are you smoking?'

7
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,799
No.

8
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:47,194
'Oh. What time do you want to leave
this evening?'

9
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:51,227
Listen, Phil rang.
I've got to go in.

10
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,821
They want me to take on
the Mortensen case.

11
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,457
'What?! I thought you...

12
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,532
'..we'd agreed.' I've said yes.

13
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,383
'Have you?'

14
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:05,484
SI SIGHS Let's talk later.

15
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,040
'Bye, love.'

16
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,832
Have you got any comments
on the Connie Mortensen case?

17
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,787
Is she faking?
Is she still a danger to society?

18
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:52,983
Can you stop and chat with us
for a minute?

19
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:56,042
Do you reckon it was pre-meditated?
Is she faking the amnesia?

20
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:20,938
You are up for this, aren't you?

21
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,917
Everyone's breathing down my neck
for a report.

22
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:34,117
You got your alarm, yeah?

23
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,058
She took a hefty bite
out of security.

24
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,147
Good morning, Constance.

25
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,966
I'm Emma Robertson,
I'm your new forensic psychiatrist.

26
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:12,319
Well, don't you sound
pleased with yourself.

27
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:33,581
Go on...

28
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:36,217
have a good look.

29
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:37,734
I would.

30
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:41,392
“How on earth did her life
go so wrong?“

31
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,025
Quite easily, as it happens.

32
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:50,793
So you better watch out...

33
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,970
with your swishy bag
and your sensible shoes...

34
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:59,044
you could be next.

35
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,550
It's my job to keep you safe...

36
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,585
to treat you.

37
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:15,074
And the court have asked
for my opinion of your mental state

38
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:16,831
on the night of the offence.

39
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:20,585
We need to find out
why you are unable to recall

40
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,526
the events of that night.

41
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,075
I'm going to be recording
our sessions, if that's all right?

42
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,949
Just means I don't need to take
too many notes.

43
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,400
You like poetry, do you?

44
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:39,898
Ah. Yes, I do.

45
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:46,184
Now, why don't you tell me...

46
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,021
what happened that night?

47
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:51,815
You're the expert,
why don't you tell me?

48
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,209
You drove your car into the river,
Constance.

49
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,751
You're lucky to be alive.

50
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:03,021
There were children in the back.

51
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:15,840
I'm going to help you remember.
How does that sound?

52
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:22,246
Well, here we are...

53
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,958
in some fancy part of North London,
where, rumour has it,

54
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:29,514
there are more therapists
than nut-jobs.

55
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,950
So when you look at it that way...

56
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:34,785
I think you'll find
I'm the one helping you.

57
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:39,482
Ooh. No phones in here, Doc.

58
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,528
He's gonna be late home, is he?

59
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,030
That old chestnut.

60
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:52,876
I think betrayal probably
just begins with disenchantment.

61
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,817
Is that what happened to you?

62
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,745
I'd like to see Josh and Annie now.

63
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,125
That's not going to be possible.
Don't you have kids...

64
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:06,454
The more you remember about
that night, Constance,

65
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,770
the better your chances.
..or have they flown the nest?

66
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,767
You're no spring chicken.

67
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,203
In fact, I haven't even seen
your qualifications yet.

68
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,681
The other one showed me hers.

69
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:17,357
Avoidance tactics
won't work with me, Constance.

70
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,658
Connie...

71
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,055
please.

72
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,968
So this is her, is it?
The Yummy Mummy Monster.

73
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,979
Tabloids would pay a fortune
for this.

74
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:30,495
How long do you think
she's realistically looking at?

75
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,157
She plead not guilty, didn't she?

76
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:36,006
Mm. Attempted murder, Level 1...

77
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,163
she could be looking at 30 years.

78
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:40,519
Or a lifetime hospitalised.

79
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:42,436
Well, that's down to you,
my darling.

80
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,834
Temporary insanity,

81
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:47,093
she could soon be buzzing round
a Waitrose near you.

82
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,541
That's her and the poor neighbour,
Vanessa Jones.

83
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,762
Mother of the other little girl
in the car.

84
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,334
I must say...

85
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:58,834
I prefer a modicum of sanity
in my ladies.

86
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:04,584
Si, I've got files to read.

87
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:12,372
Em, is this really such a good idea?

88
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,177
My husband was meant to come,
where is he?

89
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,891
And my mum.

90
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,503
When is my mum coming?

91
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:59,818
Not exactly queueing up,
are they, Tuft y?

92
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:04,730
It's not really vocational for you,
is it, the caring profession?

93
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,247
You might be fooling all that lot

94
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,845
with your little
lost posh girl thing,

95
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,841
but you ain't fooling me.

96
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:12,022
You know exactly what you did.

97
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,744
It's just a paracetamol.

98
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,415
Hello, Dr Robertson.

99
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,332
Now, you be a good girl, Constance.

100
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:31,790
Thank you, Addy.
Off you trot, Fatso.

101
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:38,020
Good morning, Constance. Connie.

102
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:43,411
I think I'd like
one of your cigarettes.

103
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,501
Is it menthol,
or did you pop a mint in?

104
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,418
You can't smoke in here.

105
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,935
Oh, I don't smoke.

106
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,994
I always think smoking
is a sign of terrible weakness.

107
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:06,414
Have you remembered anything
about the night?

108
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:11,127
How long have you been keeping
little secrets from Si Hubby, then?

109
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:18,634
Why don't we begin with your
relationship with Vanessa Jones?

110
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:23,507
It's Ness...

111
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,939
not Vanessa. I'm sorry. Ness.

112
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,605
I wish it was before again.

113
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:39,720
Before what, Connie?

114
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:45,990
Before I was skinned,
boned and filleted.

115
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,992
Oi, they're mine, give them back!

116
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:56,749
Polly, give them back
to the little girl.

117
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:58,067
I'm not little!

118
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,584
Oh, I am so sorry... Annie!

119
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:00,982
What's your name. Annie.

120
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,817
Give them back to Annie.
Annie, stop shouting!

121
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:07,252
And don't swear. Jesus Christ!

122
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:09,448
I'm really sorry.
Please, don't worry.

123
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,725
No, here. No, honestly.
Polly, she's such a biff er.

124
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:13,642
Give them back to me.
Look, you've got so many.

125
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,279
Annie, be nice.

126
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:17,356
Didn't I say?
Share them with the little girl.

127
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,111
Thank you. Follow me!

128
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,852
Right. And now they're best friends.

129
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,381
It's as simple as that.
She's such a flirt.

130
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,657
Can 1? Of course.

131
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,854
Are you local? Yes, are you?

132
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:33,969
We've just moved to the area.
I thought I hadn't seen you before.

133
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:36,205
Well, welcome. Thank you.

134
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:38,402
Polly starts at Meadowside
next week.

135
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,996
Oh, right. It's a great school.
Yeah? Yeah.

136
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,909
You don't know if the first train
in the morning is reliable, do you?

137
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,986
I'm not the best person to ask,
I am afraid.

138
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,943
I work from home.

139
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,940
Mm! Have one.

140
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:54,296
They taste better than they look.

141
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,957
Thank you.

142
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,726
What do you do?

143
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,000
Nothing spectacular. I write.

144
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,876
Copy-editing, articles,
journo stuff, you know?

145
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,297
You've got some...

146
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:11,732
No...

147
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:21,013
Oh, God, you smell fantastic.
Oh, thank you.

148
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:23,689
What is that?
It's, erm, Jo Malone.

149
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:24,951
The pomegranate one. Mmm!

150
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:27,882
Mmm. It's good, right?

151
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:28,944
Yeah.

152
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,634
It's my partner
that has to be in early.

153
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,952
What does he do?

154
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,668
She, actually.

155
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,209
Sorry.

156
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,814
So, now that the school's got
an Outstanding,

157
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:47,091
all the bankers are moving in.

158
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:50,326
You'll see their wives
at the school gates.

159
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,519
They have flick y hair and little
dogs that don't moult or shit.

160
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,555
There's a lot of yoga.

161
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,511
I love your tattoos. Oh, do you?

162
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,507
Mm. I've never dared get one.
Oh, thank you.

163
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,864
Hello, Daddy.
Hey, darling, how are you?

164
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:05,341
Good. This is us.

165
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,178
Hi, Con.
That's my husband, Karl.

166
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:09,535
Oh, and that's us. Just here.
Wow.

167
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,411
Yeah, you must come meet Leah
some time.

168
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,848
Definitely. We're so close.
Yeah.

169
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:16,284
Come on, Polly. Say goodbye.

170
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:18,240
Bye!

171
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,657
See you, Mum.

172
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,261
'I think my body
was trying to tell me something...

173
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,683
'even back then.

174
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:37,553
'I felt... a little tug,
as if from the wings.

175
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,707
'Like a warning... perhaps.'

176
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,956
Did it make you uncomfortable,

177
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,615
the fact that she was attracted
to women?

178
00:14:57,002 --> 00:15:00,572
I like cock... Dr Robertson.

179
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:02,729
I like men.

180
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:04,230
W hy?

181
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:07,904
Does it make you uncomfortable?

182
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:13,495
So...

183
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,946
back to you and Si Hubby.

184
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,342
Professional couple.

185
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:24,014
Left it a bit late...
just the one kid, I presume?

186
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,171
Little Emmalina.

187
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:29,509
In pony club and extra Mandarin.

188
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:36,235
Oh, you'll find that everything's
locked in here, Doctor.

189
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,350
Windows, doors, cupboards, minds...

190
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,730
Do you know what I think, Connie?

191
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:46,817
I think that you are
seriously underestimating

192
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:49,773
the gravity of the situation
that you're in.

193
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:53,607
Attempted murder
carries a long sentence.

194
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:57,440
YOU can come across as
a little head-mistress y...

195
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,078
you ought to watch that.

196
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:02,193
I bet Si Hubby's sick to death
of it.

197
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:04,589
“Have you done this,
have you done that?“

198
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,985
At some stage...

199
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,180
we all take responsibility
for our actions.

200
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:14,253
And a little smug,
if you don't mind me saying.

201
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:18,071
You're at it again.
Avoidance tactics.

202
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:25,275
Would you say
your life's pretty good...

203
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:27,935
Little Miss Mary Poppins? Hmm?

204
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,740
I mean,
what could possibly go wrong

205
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:36,657
in your perfect world...

206
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:39,213
with your important job...

207
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:43,606
and your expensive
but deathly dull clothes?

208
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,264
And admit it, Doctor...
you have let yourself go.

209
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,676
Unbelievable.

210
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,312
You come home after a busy day
saving people,

211
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:55,467
to your lovely terraced house...

212
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:58,502
with the white slatted blinds,
your island kitchen...

213
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:01,936
and your Pouilly-Fume
cooling in the fridge...

214
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,334
The cheek.

215
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,754
And lovely Si Hubby...

216
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:09,508
your nice but dim husband,

217
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:13,462
has cleaned up all the kid mess.

218
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,933
But it's all such a sham, isn't it?

219
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,799
Answer this...

220
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:49,607
for how long
can you realistically avoid it

221
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:53,784
when it's all part of
the unspoken contract of a couple?

222
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:56,556
Yes.

223
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,749
Tonight might have to be THE night.

224
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:03,808
The Once A Month Duty-Fuck.

225
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:09,175
And don't get me wrong -
you're a good wife,

226
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:13,409
you love Si Hubby and all that,
blah, blah, blah...

227
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:17,642
but it's such a monumental effort,
isn't it?

228
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,755
Come bedtime, perhaps you could
stall for a bit downstairs,

229
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:24,056
or pretend to be asleep...

230
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,651
working in bed... Hello?

231
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:31,340
Huh. You didn't hear me come in.
What are you listening to?

232
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:33,720
Oh, nothing, it's work. Oh.

233
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:40,030
I see I've got
some catching up to do.

234
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,958
So, how was it?
No biting, altercations?

235
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:46,675
I've only had a glass or two.

236
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:47,977
No.

237
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,988
Starving.

238
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,264
Oh, so tell me...

239
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:55,021
what was Adrian's
new girlfriend like?

240
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:57,458
Far too good for him.

241
00:18:57,482 --> 00:19:00,692
Susannah? Sahara? Samantha?

242
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,528
Savannah. Savannah.

243
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:05,844
They're coming round Thursday,
by the way.

244
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:07,921
I asked Hattie, too. Oh.

245
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,239
I'll do it.

246
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:12,617
Please tell me your sister's dumped
that dreadful boyfriend.

247
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:15,972
So come on...

248
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,566
how was the Yummy Mummy Monster?

249
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:24,055
Monstrously arrogant, actually.

250
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,090
And... don't be tabloid, Si.

251
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:29,150
Is she faking the amnesia?

252
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,305
Can we not talk shop.

253
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:37,377
I was thinking that maybe we should
try and get away for the weekend.

254
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,067
I've got orchestra
Saturday afternoon.

255
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,449
Oh, right.

256
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,443
It's just we never really
do anything spontaneous.

257
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:58,024
Huh. Have I missed something?

258
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:01,754
Is it my birthday?

259
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:04,533
Did I win the lottery?
Fine, let's not bother.

260
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,106
Gently, gently, gently...

261
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:53,295
It's not so bad
once you get going, is it?

262
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:56,665
Although, let's be honest,

263
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,965
it'd be nice
if he'd hurry up and come.

264
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:04,676
But fucking is easy, isn't it,
Doctor?

265
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:08,766
It's kissing that you can't fake.

266
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,262
It's kissing that is
the unbearable intimacy.

267
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,142
Think about it...

268
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,299
that mouth of his...

269
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,455
the disgusting way it eats,

270
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,652
the stupid things it says,

271
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:32,831
the idiotic expressions it pulls...

272
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:40,698
that mouth you're stuck with
for the next 30 years.

273
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:21,249
Oh, I think all of us
use avoidance tactics,

274
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,148
don't you, Dr Robertson?

275
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,882
What are you meant to do with
all the love that's left over,

276
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:51,543
after someone's gone?

277
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:57,174
It must go somewhere.

278
00:23:58,332 --> 00:24:00,009
I honestly don't know.

279
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:05,640
No. You're not much help.

280
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,151
Is Karl often unreliable?

281
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,985
I wasn't talking about him.

282
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:26,766
It's looking so good, Polly.

283
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,841
Hi, I'm so sorry to interrupt.

284
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:41,638
Would I be able to grab a selfie
with you?

285
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:42,980
Yeah, of course.

286
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:45,935
All my friends will be so jealous.

287
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,689
OK, you're done, darling.

288
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:53,483
Jade, I'll be back in just a sec.

289
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,404
Mum? Mum, what are you doing?

290
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:05,719
She's feral enough as it is.
She was desperate!

291
00:25:05,743 --> 00:25:07,716
Use a dock-leaf, darling.

292
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,551
Polly, maybe don't watch, darling.
Come here.

293
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,225
Oh, Con, look, it's that lesbian
who reads the news.

294
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,741
That's Polly's mum, Mum.

295
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,896
Right, I've got to get back to it,
can you two look after them?

296
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,812
You need a break, Con.
You haven't stopped.

297
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:24,489
Let me go and get you some wine.

298
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:26,805
All right. I am gagging for some,
but I warn you,

299
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:29,441
it's £5 a plastic glass.
Oh, don't be fucking ridiculous.

300
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:32,356
Mum, language, with the children.
Dad, please come down.

301
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,752
Grandad, shoot me,
with a machine gun, in the face!

302
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:36,789
Bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

303
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:38,626
Be careful.

304
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:47,572
I'd like to welcome some new members
to our Meadowside family.

305
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:50,926
I think Leah Worthington
needs no introduction.

306
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,440
And her lovely partner, Vanessa.

307
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:20,399
So what's a girl got to do
to get her face painted around here?

308
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:23,138
Well, she has to turn up on time,
for one thing.

309
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:25,614
Only joking.

310
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,208
Let's see what I can do.

311
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,948
You're wearing my perfume.

312
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:49,735
So...

313
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,004
did you go home and fuck,
after our little chat yesterday?

314
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:05,965
How did it make you feel the fact
that she'd copied your perfume?

315
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:11,700
You did!

316
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:18,984
Look at you
in your elasticated sports bra,

317
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:21,979
hoping to get fit by fabric osmosis.

318
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:24,455
What are you so angry about, Connie?

319
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:26,771
I want to see Ness. Why?

320
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:29,807
What is it that you want to say
to her?

321
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:32,307
Perhaps we need to work that out
first.

322
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:37,658
You could pretend I'm her.
Talk to me, if you like?

323
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:41,308
Oh, a little role play.

324
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:43,624
Did you do
a weekend course in it

325
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:45,741
We could begin where you left off.

326
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,640
Let's pretend we're at
the face-painting stall.

327
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,904
All right.

328
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,180
There's no need to be scared of me,
Doctor.

329
00:28:11,204 --> 00:28:13,121
I'm not scared of you.

330
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,825
You copied my tattoo...

331
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,855
my perfume. I did.

332
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:32,250
How does that make you feel?

333
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:37,681
A bit robbed, to be honest.

334
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:42,194
Robbed and...

335
00:28:45,468 --> 00:28:46,986
flattered.

336
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:56,051
No touching.

337
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:09,310
What stunning eyes you've got.

338
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,811
What did you do, my lovely?

339
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:27,001
Why are you so full of pain?

340
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,712
What happened?

341
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:44,493
You're gonna be late for OT.

342
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:14,541
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I just wanted a room.

343
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,617
Don't worry, it's fine.

344
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:19,173
I think I should warn you
that the prosecution

345
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:21,889
might show some evidence
that's going to be disturbing.

346
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:23,726
I mean, obviously,
we'll try to exclude it

347
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,187
on grounds of relevance...

348
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:29,421
but I think it's best
you see these photographs now.

349
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:46,449
Oh, Annie.

350
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:54,820
Oh, sorry.

351
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,621
It's OK, Doc.

352
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:07,295
It's just a thing Annie does.

353
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,973
It's a game.

354
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,313
She is always play acting.

355
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,187
It's just a game.

356
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:19,580
That... is not a game, Constance.

357
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:23,094
I know it's...

358
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,357
It's OK, Connie.

359
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:02,146
I want to see my baby.

360
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,354
I want to see my baby.

361
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:08,831
It's OK.

362
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,107
I want to see my babies.

363
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:13,464
Where are my babies?

364
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:15,964
Where are my babies?

365
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,251
Get me my babies!
We need some help in here, please!

366
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:29,358
Get me my babies! Get me my babies!

367
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:31,379
We need PRN Lorazepam now.

368
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:35,867
I need you to take a breath now,
Connie.

369
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:37,169
Quickly.

370
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:42,042
That's it, Connie,
take a breath now.

371
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,710
He was horrible, Savannah.

372
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:26,426
His room was disgusting,
he never did any work.

373
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,463
He never got up before three.

374
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:31,018
I can never get up in
the mornings.

375
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,095
That's what she said.

376
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,491
THEY LAUGH Ooh-oh-ooh!

377
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,169
Thank you.

378
00:33:37,193 --> 00:33:39,365
I want to hear about
this hitchhiking trip

379
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:41,761
round the south of France
cos he wouldn't tell me anything.

380
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:43,438
Absolutely, yeah. Yes!

381
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:46,513
No. No, no, no, absolutely.

382
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:48,111
Don't you dare, Si, no.

383
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:49,988
I'll just get some more wine.
I'll be back.

384
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,421
Anyway, change the subject.

385
00:33:54,445 --> 00:33:56,601
I wanted to ask Emma about the case.

386
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:00,076
What's she like?

387
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,424
What?

388
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:11,513
The Yummy Mummy Monster.
Did the kids die?

389
00:34:11,537 --> 00:34:15,027
The kids survived. But... the papers
got it wrong, didn't they?

390
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:17,703
Leah Worthington wrote
this beautiful piece about it,

391
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:20,658
- did you read that?
- I did.

392
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:23,334
I know someone who used to do
the park run

393
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,050
with the Yummy Monster's husband.
He's really cool, apparently.

394
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:28,645
One of the kids is in a coma.
That's what it said on the news.

395
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:30,922
That's right, isn't it?

396
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,516
Mind you, I'd kill my bloody kids
given half a chance.

397
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:42,703
Have you read what they're saying
about it on Twitter, Emma?

398
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:45,538
Shit. Storm.

399
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:48,414
Christ Almighty,
what is gonna happen to her?

400
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:50,570
She should fry, man.

401
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:52,910
Oh, shut up, Blair.

402
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:58,118
Seriously, though, Em.
She is a monster, isn't she?

403
00:34:58,142 --> 00:35:01,057
Patient confidentiality.
Emma can't talk about it.

404
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:07,127
Excuse me. Loo.

405
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:16,967
Seriously, though...
Can you imagine that phone call.

406
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:20,162
“No, no, no,
they've had a great sleep-over,

407
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:24,340
“yeah, there's just one
tiny weeny little thing...“

408
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:29,451
Em? It's me. You all right?

409
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,301
KNOCK ON DOOR Em?

410
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,617
Bloody hell.

411
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:58,884
It wasn't Connie's fault.

412
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,957
That's ABH.

413
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:06,432
The way they talk...

414
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,987
the vitriol...

415
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:11,583
it's disgusting!

416
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:15,034
That Blair bloke,
he's the bloody monster.

417
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:17,630
Careful what you say,
he might end up my brother-in-law.

418
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:19,826
I'm always careful what I say,
it's my job!

419
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,502
You've had too much to drink, love,
I'll get them to go.

420
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:25,577
And I'm gonna have loads more.
It's a day off tomorrow.

421
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,077
No, love, it's Friday tomorrow.

422
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,175
She was shown a photograph today.

423
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,245
Her daughter lying there
on a white sheet...

424
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:17,637
her little body, tubes everywhere.

425
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:21,750
Do you know what she did?

426
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,145
She laughed.

427
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:27,557
She just laughed.

428
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,458
She's not of sound mind, darling.

429
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:36,662
Do I nag? You do. I don't mind.

430
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:40,775
Oh, God, listen to them.

431
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,892
“Is she dead? Is she in a coma?“

432
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:45,687
What do they care?
A dead child is just a dead child.

433
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:47,524
Don't be cruel, Emma.

434
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:49,082
Me? Cruel?

435
00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:51,382
You don't even say her name.

436
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,174
Say it, Si. Say our daughter's name.

437
00:38:26,374 --> 00:38:28,746
You look like shit.

438
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,166
You don't look so great yourself.

439
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:44,544
Do you hate me?

440
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,217
Here.

441
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,846
Shall we talk about Karl?

442
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:12,978
Do you think the pills
are still working, Con?

443
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:15,814
Are you happy?

444
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:20,942
Life is not all about being happy,
Karl.

445
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:23,721
Are you happy? No.

446
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:28,170
Well, exactly.

447
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:31,724
That's just how it is
once you have kids.

448
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:34,320
I don't even recognise myself
half the time.

449
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:35,957
Don't be so dramatic.

450
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:38,873
You're just going through
a rough patch.

451
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:41,349
Work will come in.

452
00:39:41,373 --> 00:39:43,010
I thought you'd had an order?

453
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:50,238
Were you just numb?

454
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:55,270
Wasn't there anything
making you feel alive?

455
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,296
Back at six. Love you.

456
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:07,331
'She made me feel alive.

457
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,540
'At this age...

458
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:14,040
'when you really connect
with someone...

459
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:18,393
'..it's a bit like falling in love.'

460
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:24,519
Hope you make a lot of nice friends
out there,

461
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:28,513
but just remember,
there's a lot of bad and beware.

462
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,989
Oh, I know this,
I know this, I know...

463
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:33,265
I know this.

464
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:35,046
Oh, I know this! Go on.

465
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:38,361
Too slow. I know this.

00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:18,991
Sorry!

476
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:20,852
Tell me more about that other guy.

477
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,783
The big one before Karl.

478
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:27,122
Oh, it was so complicated.

479
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,836
He was my professor at uni.

480
00:41:31,994 --> 00:41:34,845
Ah. He was married.

481
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,004
Mm-hm.

482
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,796
Bet the sex was good, though.

483
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,954
Mm-hm.

484
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:49,366
Have you always been with women?

485
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:54,534
No, Leah was my first.

486
00:41:54,558 --> 00:41:56,075
Really? Mm.

487
00:41:58,511 --> 00:42:00,165
Do you have a good sex life?

488
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:03,823
Me and Leah? Yeah. Do you?

489
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,658
Yeah.

490
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:17,057
I really should make more
of an effort.

491
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:18,335
Oh, me too.

492
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,370
Like, chuck out the granny pants.

493
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:24,326
But they're so comfortable!

494
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:28,463
Well, I suppose I could dig out
the old French maid's outfit.

495
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:32,337
You dress up?

496
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:35,627
No, I'm serious! Do you?

497
00:42:35,651 --> 00:42:38,383
Well, many centuries ago.

498
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:41,378
No way! What?

499
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:44,996
I'd feel such a plonker! Tell me.

500
00:42:47,472 --> 00:42:49,988
Things like what? OK, well...

501
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:55,499
I do have a nun's outfit somewhere.

502
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:03,383
It's because Karl is a Catholic -
they love that shit.

503
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:04,980
Here.

504
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:07,616
Sex tip number one, Vanessa...

505
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,411
Mm-hm.
..when getting it from behind,

506
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:12,847
one must never ever turn around

507
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:15,044
and try to look sexy.

508
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:17,903
Because it just doesn't work.

509
00:43:33,198 --> 00:43:35,395
Can I ask you something?

510
00:43:36,353 --> 00:43:38,310
Of course.

511
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:43,861
How does everyone else function?

512
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,567
I just don't understand.

513
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,196
Why aren't the streets full of...

514
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:02,072
wrecked people?

515
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:19,180
Oh, God.

516
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:21,576
I'm sorry, this is inexcusable...

517
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,393
No, it's OK...

518
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:29,723
get it all out.

519
00:44:29,747 --> 00:44:31,784
It happens to the best of us.

520
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:38,070
Oh, I'm just... I apologise,
I don't...

521
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,642
Oh, God... It's OK.

522
00:44:48,637 --> 00:44:52,127
Oh. I'm really, I...

523
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:54,164
I apologise.

524
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:58,357
Ooh, red wine, poor you.

525
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,514
It's all right.

526
00:45:19,866 --> 00:45:21,424
You're wearing my jacket.

527
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:37,318
Hi, I'm Karl Mortensen.
I'm here to see Constance Mortensen.

528
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,685
