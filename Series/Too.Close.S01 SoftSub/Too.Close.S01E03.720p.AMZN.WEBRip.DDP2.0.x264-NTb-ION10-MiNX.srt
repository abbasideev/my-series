Come on. Come on.
Where the fuck are you?

6
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,230
I think my husband's having an affair.

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,030
With a perky-breasted 25-year-old.

8
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,150
It's disappointingly unoriginal.

9
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,960
Question. What tips would
you give your younger self?

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,670
Have more fun.

11
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,030
What about you?

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,600
Have less fun.

13
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,480
And don't worry what
people think about you.

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,590
And... while I think of it, not
to bother with contraception.

15
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,510
- Really?
- Yeah. All those years on the pill!

16
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,950
Turns out, despite my womanly
hips, as the old cow used to say,

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,680
it wasn't quite that easy.

18
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,480
I quite... liked your womanly hips.

19
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,600
Are you flirting with me?

20
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,080
Oh, Dougie...

21
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,910
- I'm gonna get that.
- Yeah, I know.

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,480
Yeah.

23
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
Hello?

24
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,160
Connie!

25
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,470
Connie!

26
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,160
Connie! Connie!

27
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,990
No sign?

28
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,040
CCTV tracked her to the gates.
The police are bringing dogs.

29
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,470
She slipped away when
the fire engines arrived.

30
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,510
She's still on the grounds.

31
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
- Give me a sec, yeah?
- All right.

32
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,840
Connie? Connie? It's me.

33
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,920
Connie, you have to
come down from there.

34
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,100
I did it. I drove them off the bridge.

35
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,430
- Are they going to die?
- No. No.

36
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,830
They, they were in induced comas
in hospital, but they're fine.

37
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,230
They're alive.

38
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,270
Can I see her? Please,
I need to see her.

39
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,030
I want to see Annie.

40
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,110
You know you can't, Connie...
You need to come down from there.

41
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,620
- I'm gonna call the front desk, OK?
- I'll jump. I'm gonna jump.

42
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,870
No. No. No. Please don't do that.
Please don't do that. Stay there.

43
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,590
Oh, Christ...

44
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,990
I should be dead.

45
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,230
I wish I was dead.

46
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,790
I want to die.

47
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,190
We all deserve forgiveness, Connie.

48
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,190
- What would you know?
- I do know.

49
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,590
Because I've done terrible things.

50
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,790
I promise you you're
not alone. Listen to me.

51
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm going to tell you
about this woman, Connie,

52
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,770
who's just had a baby.

53
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,930
A beautiful, tiny baby girl.

54
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,160
And this woman is so happy,

55
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,010
because it's what she's
wanted for so many years.

56
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,980
But... as the months go by, she
becomes more and more exhausted,

57
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,380
because the baby will only
sleep for one hour at a time.

58
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,310
And the woman becomes depressed
and ashamed of her depression,

59
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,330
because she's a woman who can fix
anything, but she's truly failing.

60
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,440
So, she...

61
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,640
She takes anti-depressants
and pills to send her to sleep,

62
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,330
and pills to keep her awake.

63
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,340
The baby is a toddler now,
but still she doesn't sleep.

64
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,910
Only now, she's having tantrums.

65
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,190
Awful, screaming tantrums.

66
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,230
And nothing in this mother's
life has prepared her for this.

67
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,310
All of her logic, her
usual tactics, her patience,

68
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,720
- none of it has any effect...
- Dr Robertson?

69
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,380
OK, Connie, down you get.

70
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,720
The corticosteroids
were for the alopecia.

71
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,120
And the lorazepam on the same date?

72
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,560
Well, the antidepressants
weren't proving sufficient.

73
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,520
She was very anxious.

74
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,440
And did you warn her
about possible addiction

75
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,540
and the side effects of lorazepam?

76
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,520
Of course I did. As and when required.

77
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,320
I think we could have had this
conversation over the phone.

78
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,480
And what does "as and
when required" mean?

79
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,360
How often was she taking them?

80
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,800
Why not speak to her husband?

81
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,480
Though I would suggest a different tone,

82
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,120
I think he's been through enough.

83
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,440
The guidelines recommend
that no-one's on lorazepam

84
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,000
for more than four weeks.

85
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,100
You've prescribed them three
times over three months.

86
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,860
Thank you for your time.

87
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
You know, all of us at the
school are very shocked.

88
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,450
It's an exceptionally
tight community around here.

89
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,400
It's not that tight, though, is it?
She slipped and no-one caught her.

90
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,340
Hi! It's Josh, isn't it?
I'm your mother's doctor...

91
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,760
I left a message. Is your dad in?

92
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,490
Dad? Dad?!

93
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,330
- Mum's doctor.
- In you go, son.

94
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,090
Come in.

95
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm going to take all
this stuff to the hospital.

96
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,970
Ness thought the girls would
like some familiar things.

97
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,460
- Good idea.
- Yeah. She's been amazing.

98
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,330
- How's Josh doing?
- Well, he's, um...

99
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,530
Well, we're all pretty bad.

100
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,140
I'm really sorry, Karl, but
I am going to have to ask you

101
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,680
how Connie seemed to you
in those last few days,

102
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,920
and about her medication.

103
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,400
You may be better off asking her dad.

104
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,760
- She was staying over there.
- Why?

105
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,240
Well, she wasn't herself.

106
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,290
I didn't want the kids
to see her like that.

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,780
- Like what?
- Hyper. You know.

108
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,850
Manic.

109
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,800
Listen, I've got to get to the hospital

110
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,600
and the train leaves shortly, so, erm...

111
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,160
Oh, I'll be passing that
way, if you want a lift?

112
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,960
Yeah, yeah, OK. Thanks.

113
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,490
We could pop by her dad's, if you
want? He's only round the corner.

114
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,300
She slept most of the time. She
didn't want me to disturb her.

115
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,950
Oh, my God.

116
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,630
Oh, my God.

117
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,400
Karl, why don't you wait
downstairs? I'll be down in a minute.

118
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,050
- Are her meds here?
- Um...

119
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,610
OK. Thank you.

120
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,220
- Hi.
- Hi.

121
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,850
- Hi.
- Hello.

122
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,650
Do you have a good life, Kenneth?

123
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,870
Do we know each other?

124
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,720
Oh... Jesus Christ.

125
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,900
I am so sorry I didn't
warn you that I was coming.

126
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,570
I didn't think I'd be
able to go through with it.

127
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,820
Oh...

128
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,170
Oh, God.

129
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,230
Do you mind if we go outside?
I really need a cigarette.

130
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,380
Someone I know, someone special...

131
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,610
... she said to me...

132
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,100
".. why aren't the streets
full of wrecked people?"

133
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,200
I think they are.

134
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,570
I really think they are.

135
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,410
It's OK. It's OK.

136
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,400
It's OK.

137
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,860
It's OK.

138
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,800
You didn't need to write to us.

139
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,210
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

140
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,810
Thank you.

141
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,990
Emma?

142
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,200
I didn't know who else to call,

143
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,800
- you were the last number on her phone.
- No problem, mate.

144
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,295
- Hi.
- Are you OK?

145
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,090
- Mm-mm...
- Come on.

146
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,870
- What's going on?
- Look, just get her home.

147
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,460
You all right? I'll get it. Thanks.

148
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,460
Can you get the door, please?

149
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,630
Oh, hey, mate. How are you doing? Erm...

150
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,200
She's a bit worse for wear.

151
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,670
Yeah. Yeah. I can see that. Who are you?

152
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,360
Mary fucking Poppins.

153
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,610
Dougie.

154
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,520
I got a call from a guy in Cheam.

155
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,860
- He tried ringing you...
- What were you doing in Cheam, Emma?

156
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,390
What were you doing?

157
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,930
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thanks...

158
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
... Dougie.

159
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,280
I've organised another psych for you.

160
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,290
Someone more suitable. Sarah.

161
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,350
I don't want Sarah.

162
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,410
I want YOU.

163
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,430
Sarah's good. You'll like her.

164
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,720
What happened? What did I do?
Why are you so angry with me?

165
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,690
I'm not angry with you. It's me.

166
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,150
You deserve someone better.

167
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,810
They could rip me to shreds in court.

168
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,650
Stop self-flagellating.

169
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,250
Come on! Get on with it.

170
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,610
Ask me one of your stupid questions!

171
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,090
Why did you stop taking all
your medication on August 7th?

172
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,680
♪ Why does the sun go on shining? ♪

173
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:54,250
♪ Why does the sea rush to shore? ♪

174
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,920
♪ Don't they know ♪

- Are you all right, Dad?
- Yes, I'll be fine.

- Course not.

182
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,740
He wouldn't miss her funeral.

Jesus, Con. Someone could've
cracked their skull open.

208
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,140
I'm sorry.

209
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,900
You've got to get
yourself together, Con.

210
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,860
For the kids.

211
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,890
Why don't you go stay with
your dad for a few days?

212
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,140
Get some proper rest.

213
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,350
- I am so sorry, Dad.
- Hey...

214
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,980
Go to sleep, my little honey bee.

215
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,130

Why did you leave your dad's house?

220
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,800
- It was raining.
- When was it raining?

221
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,470
All day.

222
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,650
It was such a... terrible storm.

223
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,490
Why did you put the children in the car?

224
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,190
Just raining, raining, raining.

225
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,360
My mum. I miss her.

226
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,250

Mama, wait for me.

244
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,150
Mama, where are you?
Mama, where are you?

245

Mum!

248
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,990
Where are you? Mum?

249
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,070

00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,970
Annie! Annie! Wake up, darling!

251
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,790
- Where's Joshie?
- He's at Toby's house.

252
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,830
Come, on darling. We've
got to get out of here.

253
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,590
- Where to?
- Out. It's a surprise.

254
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,630
- Is it Scotland?
- No. Come on, sweetie. Not a sound!

255
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,400
Can Polly come too?

256
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,790
Good girls. Good girls.

257
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,100

272
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,010
A psychotic episode?

273
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,250
Not necessarily from the
benzodiazepines per se,

274
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,730
I'm not saying that, they
can be very helpful drugs.

275
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,310
- I'm talking about the withdrawal process.
- I see...

276
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,970
Although, might I add,

277
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,440
the General Medical Council
is currently looking into

278
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,680
whether the benzos were incorrectly
prescribed in the first place.

279
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:56,080
Aside from lorazepam, what else
was Ms Mortensen taking? Remind us.

280
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,730
The antidepressant lofepramine
and corticosteroids.

281
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,450
And she stopped taking all
medication on the... 7th, you say?

282
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,070
- Yes.
- Three days.

283
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,090
Is that usual for benzodiazepine
withdrawal to kick in?

284
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,040
It can be. If it's an acute
withdrawal, which this was.

285
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,350
There are previous case reports of
violent behaviour in this situation.

286
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,800
She should have been on a
gradual withdrawal programme.

287
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,050
People need to be monitored. They
should have a support network.

288
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Obviously, there were
other contributory factors.

289
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,380
She was in the depths of grief.

290
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,480
She had buried her mother
on the 7th, as well.

291
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,560
And grief can be its own kind of hell.

292
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,680
Let's not forget that
she'd recently discovered

293
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,360
her husband was having a relationship

294
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,480
with Polly Jones's mother? Correct?

295
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,730
Ms Mortensen had been through
considerable emotional turmoil

296
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,410
prior to seeking lorazepam. Yes.

297
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,300
So, we could say that
she certainly had motive.

298
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,040
Can you explain to us
what spousal revenge is?

299
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,550
It's what you might call a jealous rage.

300
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,710
Which rather seems to fit with
the actions of Ms Mortensen,

301
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,470
- wouldn't you agree?
- Not at all.

302
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,270
Ms Mortensen was in fact
acting altruistically.

303
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,990
In her acutely psychotic
state that night,

304
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,880
she believed she was saving the
children from a malevolent force.

305
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,580
A malevolent force.

306
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,190
How can you be sure that Ms
Mortensen isn't just fabricating

307
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,400
these psychotic symptoms in
order to get away with this?

308
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,610
Experience. Expertise.

309
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,710
I've seen many a
malingerer over my 30 years,

310
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,950
and not many of them
would go to the lengths

311
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,100
of severely scalding themselves
with hydrochloric acid,

312
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,110
which, by the way, pre-dates
the offence in question.

313
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,140
Her psychosis was not faked.

314
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:56,520
And I would put it to you, Dr,
that Ms Mortensen is still a danger,

315
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,070
not only to herself, but
to her family and society.

316
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,320
And I would strongly refute that.

317
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,630
Now that she's on the
correct monitored medication,

318
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,310
Ms Mortensen is no more
a danger to herself,

319
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,510
her family or society than you or I.

320
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,510
For who knows what any
one of us is capable of,

321
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,250
given the wrong medication
and the right triggers?

322
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,900
I've just had Foxtons on the phone.

323
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,280
They're going to come
round tomorrow to value it.

324
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,160
I feel like we're betraying her.

325
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,040
Leaving her behind. Moving on.

326
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,200
I thought that's what you wanted?

327
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,840
I need you to listen to me.

328
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,580
There's something I've never told you...

329
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,250
... about that day.

330
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,990
Mummy!

331
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,550
Mummy, are we going to the swings?

332
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,030
We're going later.

333
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,870
Mummy, I want to go on the swings!
Mummy, I want to go on the swings!

334
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,030
We're gonna go later!

335
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,510

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,270
Mummy! I want to go on the swings!
Mummy, I want to go on the swings!

337
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:04,480
Mummy, I want to get out of the buggy!

338
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,270
Hey, Jenny! How's it
going? Getting any sleep?

339
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,950
God, don't ask.

340
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,590
Abigail, you can stop
that, Mummy's talking.

341
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,990
- Oh, Emma. Drop her with me.
- I said stop it!

342
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,070
Oh, you're so kind. You are
just going to have to wait!

343
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,080
It's not a good moment. I'll
let you be. I'll see you soon.

344
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,570
Can you just be quiet!
I need to take this call.

345
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,660
I have had it with you!

346
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,000
Hello? Yes. Is this
about the washing machine?

347
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,670
Well, could you be more specific?

348
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,950
When you say "all day", I mean,
I can't wait in all day, can I?!

349
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,470
Well, could you at least
say morning or afternoon?

350
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,200
Well, can I track you, then?

351
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,160
"I've had it with you".

352
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,140
Those were the last words she heard.

353
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,490
Abigail.

354
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,330
You're right. I never say her name.

355
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,190
Abigail.

356
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,970
You're right to blame me.

357
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,420
I don't blame you.

358
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,000
And I don't blame you at
all for having an affair.

359
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,000
- What?
- With Savannah. Adrian's girlfriend.

360
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,160
What?!

361
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,850
I am not an idiot.

362
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,110
I saw you together. Outside your office.

363
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,000
Arm in arm. You left together.

364
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,950
No. No, no, no, no.

365
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,110
She was trying to rope me in

366
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,100
to organizing a
surprise 50th for Adrian.

367
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:53,200
Oh, come here, you big idiot.

368
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,300
Spaghetti.

369
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,360
- What time is it?
- You've got hours.

370
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,720
Oh, God, I hate this. I
feel sick. How do I look?

371
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,200
You'll be fine. Want a chill pill?

372
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,560
You are a bad person.

373
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,410
Yeah.

374
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,590
- Hello, love.
- Mummy!

375
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,550
Look at you.

376
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,590
Do they have an electric chair here?

377
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,520
- I am afraid it's not that kind of place, my darling.
- Oh!

378
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,700
Why don't you go and
see my friend Carol,

379
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,990
- see if she will give you some sweets.
- Yeah.

380
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,920
Hello, Joshie.

381
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:48,090
I'm so sorry, for everything
I've put you through.

382
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,940
You'd better not do it again.
