1
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,240
Abigail.

2
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,181
'I have had it with you!'

3
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,021
Abigail?

4
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,557
Abigail.

5
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,301
Abigail! Abigail!

6
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,181
Don't say it.

7
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,717
Say what?

8
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,581
The job's too much for me.

9
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:40,837
Wasn't going to.

10
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,021
You said you needed to be up early.

11
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:01,021
I am absolutely fine.

12
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:07,981
I know what day it is, love.

13
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,821
How on earth did we all
squeeze into there?

14
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:22,901
I'll see you downstairs.

15
00:04:57,061 --> 00:05:00,501
Heavy goods vehicle.

16
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,717
Cool. I am on a roll.

17
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:04,957
Caravan...

18
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:08,941
Will you please just fuck off?

19
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:14,277
Oil tanker...

20
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:18,117
Ah, Dr Robertson!
I need your advice.

21
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,021
Would I be able to talk to you
about night shifts at some point?

22
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,581
Not right now, Addy, thank you.

23
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:36,141
Good morning, Constance.
Let's get started.

24
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,061
I'd like you
to take a look at these.

25
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:47,277
You're being very assertive today.

26
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,877
Very Helen Mirren.

27
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:51,077
It's quite sexy.

28
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,461
You need to try and remember
anything at all from that night.

29
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,077
I've been looking
at the weather reports.

30
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:01,421
That storm was pretty severe.

31
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,901
The rain would have been blowing
across the bridge in strong gusts.

32
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,661
However insignificant, Connie,
it doesn't matter.

33
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:22,917
What is it?

34
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,301
You're not going to throw up again,
are you?

35
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:29,357
I don't think DCI Tennison
would have done that.

36
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:32,477
You still don't get it, do you?

37
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:36,757
Right now, your alternatives
are looking pretty grim.

38
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:41,261
Life in prison,
or life in a psychiatric hospital.

39
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,221
Did you sleep badly?

40
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,421
You're being very irritable. OK.

41
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,861
Ah. I can see that you started on
the antidepressants three years ago.

42
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:04,677
And then in May, you were put
on corticosteroids for hair loss

43
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:09,557
and lorazepam for extreme anxiety
and insomnia. Is that correct?

44
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:12,397
If you say so.

45
00:07:12,421 --> 00:07:17,077
Did you know that
hair can fall out from stress?

46
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:18,621
Or shock.

47
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,437
Can it?

48
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,541
Had something happened?

49
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:29,421
Just one little question first.
Of course.

50
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,741
Who's Kenneth Baines?

51
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:44,381
OK.

52
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,781
Let's get back to Ness.

53
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:50,357
What do you want to know?

54
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:53,261
Did we have sex?

55
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,981
I'm jolly glad to see this.

56
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,317
It's very important, darling...

57
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:01,917
a healthy sex life.

58
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,477
Yep. Is anyone gonna get that?

59
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:07,117
God knows, I'm slacking.

60
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:09,477
Your father and I
hardly ever do it these days.

61
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,821
Well, maybe once a fortnight.

62
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,821
It's all right, I'll get it

63
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:22,421
Hello! How nice to see you!

64
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,301
What's up? Come in, come in.

65
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:30,917
Are you all right? Um...

66
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:34,197
Are you all right? What's wrong?

67
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,677
She's gone. Leah's left us.

68
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,717
What? Shit!

69
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,077
Darling, why don't you go upstairs?
Annie's up there.

70
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,797
Darling, go on. Connie?

71
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:47,157
It's all right, Mum.

72
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,941
What happened?

73
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:53,317
She says she's miserable.

74
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:56,477
Well, she's always bloody miserable.
Mm.

75
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,677
Oh, darling, it's all right.

76
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:01,317
Oh, I'm sorry.

77
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,901
I'm sorry. It's all right.

78
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:08,357
I'm gonna be
one of those single people

79
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,957
no-one invites to dinner parties.

80
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,717
We'll invite you.

81
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:15,221
You can have dinner with us
every night.

82
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:23,397
Am I unlovable?

83
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:27,101
Ness, no, don't be silly.
Of course not!

84
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:45,061
Connie! Connie!

85
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:49,877
Why doesn't she come?

86
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:54,117
Who? Ness?
No, my mum. Where is she?

87
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:59,357
I need to see her.
I feel all... wobbly without her.

88
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,437
I'll give you something
for the anxiety.

89
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:03,941
Sit down, I'll get you some water.

90
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:23,941
Where did you get this?

91
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,181
It's mine.

92
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:33,181
Underneath that chilly veneer,
I reckon you've got quite a temper.

93
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,037
What are you so angry about?
Don't talk to me like you know me.

94
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,661
You do not know me. No?

95
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:45,117
I know you got pretty wrecked
at dinner on Thursday.

96
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:49,397
And I know you ordered
a bad of cam-free sh“ on Ocado.

97
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:52,317
I also know when
“Si hubby“ has orchestra.

98
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:56,101
So you can have a furtive fiddle
to some MILF-y porn.

99
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:02,021
Hide notifications, Ems.
Schoolgirl error.

100
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:10,077
- You can be very tedious, Connie.
- Oh, "tedious", am I

101
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,781
I'm sorry, have I lost my gloss

102
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,757
Do you think it's inevitable
in female friendships

103
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:22,517
that after all the stories have been
told and secrets have been shared,

104
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,237
that a kind of sisterly irritation
takes hold?

105
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:27,717
I'm not your sister,
and I'm not your friend.

106
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,557
I'm your forensic psychiatrist.

107
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:31,917
And let's not forget,

108
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,157
I'm not the one
who drove a car into the river...

109
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:36,357
You've wanted to,
though, haven't you?

110
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:37,757
With children in the back. No!

111
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,037
That is not what fucking happened!

112
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:42,181
What did fucking happen,
then, Connie?! I'm waiting!

113
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,221
There...

114
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:48,981
I knew you had a temper.

115
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,701
Emma?

116
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,677
Emma Davies?!

117
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,957
Oh, my God - Dougie Thompson!

118
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,717
I thought I recognised that girl!

119
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:35,277
Do you live round here?
Yeah, it's me, Em. You look great!

120
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,317
Oh, I've put on weight and...

121
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,517
I saw your name in the paper.
You're working on that case.

122
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,277
Yeah, they should
never have got my name.

123
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,237
Amazing work you do.
Oh, not sure about that.

124
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,957
Well, you actually
make a difference.

125
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,317
You were always gonna do well.

126
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:51,117
Your mum once told me
that you were far too good for me.

127
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:54,397
Oh, my God.
My mother was a racist narcissist.

128
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,277
I still see the old crowd.
Seriously?

129
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:59,397
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um, Jim, Pete, Sally.

130
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:02,757
Sally P? Oh! How is she?
Oh, she's great.

131
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,517
She's having a birthday party
on Friday at The Bell.

132
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,397
You should come. She'd kill me if
she knew I'd saw you and didn't ask.

133
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,477
How are you, Dougie?
Me? Good. Good.

134
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:16,277
Yeah, um, married, mortgage, kids.
The works. You know. And you?

135
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:18,597
Yeah.

136
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:19,997
How many?

137
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:23,077
Um... just the one, actually.

138
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,957
Sensible. Hm. What flavour?

139
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:27,517
Girl. Girl.

140
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,877
How (Ad?

141
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,461
She, er...

142
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:36,037
seven, today, actually. Aw!

143
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:39,437
Is she, um... is she here?
Um... No, she's not. Um...

144
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,357
I've got to go, Dougie.

145
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:44,197
Yeah, yeah. Are you on Facebook?

146
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:47,917
No, I'm not, actually.
Look, I've gotta go, too.

147
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:49,557
Get on it! All right, I will.

148
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:50,677
Get on it.

149
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,797
I can't wait to tell Sally.
Bye, Dougie.

150
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:55,741
Bye... Emma Davies.

151
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:24,452
I'm very sorry...

152
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:27,732
for the way that I reacted
in our previous session.

153
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:33,388
It's often difficult
for patients to understand, but...

154
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:35,692
the line has to be kept very clear.

155
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:39,332
This is a professional relationship.

156
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:45,652
You try so hard, don't you, Doc?

157
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,332
To do everything right.

158
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:53,172
To keep everything in its place.

159
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:59,852
But you know as well as I do
that life is a messy business.

160
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,268
So...

161
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:19,092
did Karl find out
about your feelings for Ness?

162
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:23,988
Questions, questions, questions.

163
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:26,572
That's my job, asking questions.

164
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,852
Did he?

165
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:47,932
You don't have to, Connie.

166
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,268
I want to.

167
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:52,532
Don't you?

168
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,292
Dunno.

169
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:58,532
What's the matter?

170
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,428
I really don't know. I just, erm...

171
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:05,628
just feel like, erm...

172
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,812
What?

173
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:12,428
Just feel like I fell in love
with you all those years ago

174
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:15,828
because you were this livewire.

175
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,508
This artist, with big dreams.

176
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:21,852
Full of energy. Wildness.

177
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:25,372
Wow.

178
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,148
I notice you're using
the past tense!

179
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,452
Well, yeah, bubs.

180
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:34,068
Sometimes I feel like
I might have clipped your wings.

181
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,108
You haven't, Karl. I've...

182
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,108
I've just had to grow up.

183
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:40,308
Don't you feel like
you're not living any more,

184
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,132
you're just going through
the motions?

185
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,452
Maybe it's the antidepressants.

186
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:50,468
I think they make me feel
a bit numb.

187
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:54,332
Yeah, that's it, numb. I feel numb.

188
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:58,172
Don't you wanna feel alive again?

189
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,028
Are you having an affair?

190
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,628
No, I'm not having an affair.

191
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,508
But you fancy other people?

192
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:08,732
Well, do you?

193
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,908
Yes.

194
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:16,292
Now you.

195
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,292
Yeah.

196
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:26,212
OK, well...

197
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:31,028
I mean, we shouldn't
beat ourselves up about it.

198
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:34,652
It's natural
after 15 years together.

199
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,348
You're brilliant, you are.

200
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:44,252
God, why are these things
so hard to talk about?

201
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:46,196
Hm?

202
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:49,972
Admit it, Con...

203
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:53,988
you've always held a torch
for that professor bloke,

204
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,692
Jonathan Hapgood, haven't you?

205
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:04,212
He said...

206
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:07,868
he said What?!

207
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:13,612
He said he thought
that we should take lovers.

208
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,452
Well, say something! You seem...

209
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:21,668
disapproving?

210
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:27,228
Hm, no, it just sounds like Karl's
trying to have his cake and eat it.

211
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,588
Maybe.

212
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:32,772
But this could be really good
for me as well.

213
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,972
It means I'll be...

214
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,052
I'm available.

215
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:50,708
So... what?

216
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,628
You gonna get in touch with him?

217
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:55,812
Your old professor?

218
00:18:57,572 --> 00:19:00,468
Polly, no, can you not
snatch that off Annie, please?

219
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,892
Can you give it back? Thank you.

220
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:59,228
Wow! Connie de Cadenet.

221
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:01,892
Wow, indeed,
Professor Jonathan Hapgood.

222
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:05,668
It's so good to see you.
You, too.

223
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:07,348
Please. Thanks.

224
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,668
Er, wine? Yes, please.

225
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,068
Well, you look stunning.
Thank you very much.

226
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,628
And I thought I was going to be
overdressed for this interview,

227
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:18,028
but you look spectacular.
I thought I'd make an effort.

228
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:19,852
It's appreciated. Thank you.

229
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,172
Cheers. Cheers.

230
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:28,748
Listen, I'd better go.

231
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:30,228
W hy?

232
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:34,132
It has been a lovely evening.

233
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:39,732
I can't.

234
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:42,972
OK. Why not?

235
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:46,308
I'm kinda seeing someone.

236
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,108
Oh! Like, it's fairly new.

237
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:49,548
Oh, right.

238
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,828
I'm sorry, I should've
said something. It's just...

239
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,068
I thought you wanted
to write an article?

240
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:56,012
I do, I absolutely do.

241
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,028
I should go. Connie...

242
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:01,292
Yeah. I should go.

243
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:03,852
Connie...

244
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:14,068
Leave a message, and
I'll get back to you when I can.'

245
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:17,228
Hey, Karl, it's me.
I guess you're still at work.

246
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:20,468
Look, I know we agreed
not to talk about the details,

247
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:23,308
but that was such a disaster.

248
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:27,172
Now I feel like an idiot.
I mean, what was I thinking?

249
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:32,412
OK, well, I'll talk to you
about it when I see you.

250
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:36,892
OK. Um, love you. Bye.

251
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,252
H ello?

252
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,132
I'm home.

253
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,292
Can you turn that off now, please?

254
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,028
'Hi, it's Vanessa.
'Fraid I'm busy right now,

255
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:04,172
'but if you leave me a message,
I'll get back to you.'

256
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:09,308
Thanks, Billie. Where's Annie?

257
00:22:09,332 --> 00:22:12,468
She's dressing up.
OK, thank you. I'll see you soon.

258
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:15,548
Mum, can Billie stay for one more
game? No, she can't, Josh.

259
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:18,212
And I want you to clean up this mess
before you go to bed.

260
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:40,268
Idiot.

261
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,748
Mum!

262
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,412
Mum?

263
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,188
Mummy?

264
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:51,652
Polly and I
are going to be Catholics.

265
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:55,508
I thought you were Buddhists?

266
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:58,908
Yes, but Catholics
are into blood and stuff.

267
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:04,068
Annie-pops, promise me you won't
wear this nun's costume outside?

268
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,988
Josh says nuns do sex
with Jesus' peanuts.

269
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:10,572
Penis. Singular.

270
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:33,132
Karl?

271
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:36,108
Hello?

272
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,428
Sorry, darling.

273
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:40,412
It's a really bad line. Hang on.

274
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:45,388
Hold on. Hello.

275
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:47,988
'Oh, baby, oh...'

276
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:51,412
Hi, baby, I can't...
I can't hear you properly.

277
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:55,388
Hello.
'Oh, that's so good. It's so good.'

278
00:23:55,412 --> 00:23:59,068
'Oh, you're the best.'

279
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:01,988
'Oh, that's so good.'

280
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:07,068
'Yeah, yeah. Oh, my God.'

281
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:09,148
'No, no, stop, stop, stop.

282
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,092
'I have to fuck you.
Come here, come here.'

283
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:16,012
Oh, my God.'

284
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:21,428
'You're so beautiful, Ness.

285
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:25,988
'Oh! You're so good.'

286
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:29,708
'Oh, my God.'
'Closer, Ness. Oh, yeah, like that.

287
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:31,548
'Don't stop, don't stop.'
'Yeah.'

288
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:34,252
'Closer, closer.'

289
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,612
Hi.

290
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:03,868
I left you a message. Did you?

291
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:06,748
How was work? Erm...

292
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:10,908
Yeah, good. We, erm...
met in the pub, actually.

293
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:12,452
Fatal.

294
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,412
Which one? Coach And Horses.

295
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:21,508
Did they have a lock-in? Yeah.

296
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:24,932
You didn't stop in anywhere
on your way home? Nah.

297
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:27,908
Not even Ness's?

298
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:34,056
Yeah, erm, just briefly.
Her boiler was up the spout again.

299
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,336
And while you were fixing it,

300
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,216
you fell over and your cock
accidentally slipped into her mouth?

301
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,376
What? Your phone rang me.

302
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,296
You stupid prick!

303
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,456
How could you do that to me?!
Hey! Keep your voice down.

304
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,656
Oh!
I don't ask What you're up to,

305
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,776
you're out shagging
that Hapgood bloke. Wrong!

306
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,896
And that is not even the point!

307
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,080
This was the agreement, wasn't it?
Why should you mind?

308
00:25:58,104 --> 00:25:59,656
Because she's my best friend!

309
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,856
I knew it.
You were never gonna hack this.

310
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,176
Whoever I chose. Oh, I was.

311
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,320
I fucking was. Just not HER!

312
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,280
So, that was the shock... Doc.

313
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:34,360
And that was when my hair thought,
"That's it. I'm of"

314
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,976
How long do you think
that kite's been stuck up there,

315
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,840
all tangled up like that?

316
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:28,120
'Throw away the key, I say.'

317
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:29,920
Thanks for your call, Jamie.

318
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:32,560
'Ewan from Gravesend
has texted in to tell us

319
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:36,400
”chat people like Mortensen
are known as family annihilators.

320
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:39,320
'I've got a question.
Normally, they're men, right?

321
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:41,744
'But is this just because in most
divorce cases...?' Shut up.

322
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:12,640
'Hi, this is Simon Robertson's
voicemail. Please leave a message.'

323
00:28:12,664 --> 00:28:15,800
Erm... Hi, it's me. Er...

324
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:18,104
I thought I was going to be early,
but...

325
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,424
it's OK, I'll meet you there.

326
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:38,504
I've got something to say.

327
00:28:40,904 --> 00:28:45,024
A letter arrived on Tuesday
from Kenneth Baines.

328
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,584
It arrived Tuesday?

329
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,424
Do you think he knew the date?

330
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,464
I'll give it to you later.
I haven't read it yet. I...

331
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:00,720
wanted to wait
until we were together.

332
00:29:00,744 --> 00:29:03,224
Who's that?

333
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:06,064
Do you have it here with you?

334
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:10,304
Not now.

335
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,821
Go on.

336
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,301
What does he want?

337
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:43,941
He wants to meet.

338
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:47,701
No.

339
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:49,941
No.

340
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,461
Come on.

341
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:27,157
I...

342
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:29,821
I can't remember
where we are in our relationship.

343
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,301
We're at the end.

344
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,741
Oh.

345
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:42,821
How are Josh and Annie?

346
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,141
Brought you some magazines
and stuff.

347
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:50,821
Bye.

348
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:55,141
I've got to go.

349
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:22,861
'It was as if he wished
he'd never met me.'

350
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,781
But I'm the mother
of his children.

351
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,701
You know what really got me?

352
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:44,821
It was the fact
that I'd been left out.

353
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:51,301
The two people closest to me
had started a club without me.

354
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:55,101
I felt like such a fool.

355
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:58,901
Thank God you had your mum.

356
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:04,517
Horse. Apple. Tuesday.

357
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,717
Horse. Apple. Tuesday.

358
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:10,477
That's it.
All right, Mrs de Cadenet.

359
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:13,301
Erm...
What day of the week is it today?

360
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:20,941
Tuesday.

361
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,621
No, it's Thursday, Mum.

362
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,917
But that's not really fair,
because you just said Tuesday.

363
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:32,197
Don't worry. It's OK.

364
00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:34,901
Erm...
What might I put up in the rain?

365
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:44,597
A shelter. You could light a fire.
OK. All right.

366
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:48,221
And what is nine plus five?

367
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:53,301
Nine plus five...

368
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,397
Come on, Julia, you know this.

369
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:01,197
It's all right, don't worry.

370
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,261
And what are the three words
I asked you to remember?

371
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:10,597
Come on, Mum. Think of...

372
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,661
galloping across the fields.

373
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:19,757
Starlight! Starlight.

374
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:22,797
She had a pony called Starlight.
That counts, right?

375
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:26,101
Yes, very good.
You're doing really well, Mum.

376
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:32,197
I think I need the loo.

377
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,621
It's just through that door there,
first on the left.

378
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,701
Well, we...

379
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:51,437
It's OK to say you're not coping,
Connie.

380
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:52,981
I feel so low!

381
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:55,541
Despite the anti-depressants?

382
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:00,277
I'm so tired.

383
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:04,141
I haven't slept in nine days.
My hair is falling out.

384
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,557
My chest feels like it's exploding.

385
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:11,157
We have something for the hair loss,
no problem.

386
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,981
And the insomnia is also anxiety,
Connie.

387
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,077
I've got just the thing for you.

388
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,637
Lorazepam.

389
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,541
Between you and me, Leah Worthington
swears by these little beauties.

390
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:38,141
# Why does the sun go on shining? #

391
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:42,021
'Beauties was the right word.'

392
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:49,037
'I felt like someone had taken
my brain out of my aching skull

393
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:52,557
'and put it in a warm, soapy bath.'

394
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:56,437
# Cos you don't love me
Any more... #

395
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,157
'It's massaged away all the pain.'

396
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:06,517
# Why do the birds go on singing? #

397
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:09,541
'But I don't need to tell you that,
do I, Doctor?

398
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,821
'How the second one
is never quite the same.'

399
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:18,661
You're always chasing
that elusive feeling...

400
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:24,941
until you find you need a pill
just to feel normal.

401
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:30,981
And then right when you really,
really...

402
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:34,901
need to ask for help...

403
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:41,541
you don't have
the strength to do it.

404
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,821
Can we stop now?

405
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:55,261
I don't want to do any more.
Of course.

406
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:58,901
You've done really, really well.

407
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:06,901
Emma...

408
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,821
who is Kenneth Baines?

409
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,101
He's a lorry driver.

410
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,800
Hello?

411
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:07,841
Hello, Mrs de Cadenet?

412
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:15,361
Hello? The door's open.

413
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:32,097
Are you here for the books?
Er, no, I'm...

414
00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:34,457
I tried the front door.
I left a few messages.

415
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:38,817
I'm Emma Robertson, Connie's doctor.
What?

416
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:41,001
Is Mrs de Cadenet in?

417
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,561
We were having a clear-out.

418
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:49,601
It's so hard, deciding.

419
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:53,641
Yes. Yes, it is.

420
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:57,681
Is it just you in, then?

421
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,961
'Fraid so.

422
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:04,481
Let me help you with that.

423
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:07,201
Here.

424
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:23,017
Would you like me to get that?

425
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:26,361
Oh, I never answer the phone.

426
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,561
You're here to collect the books?

427
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,241
No, I...
I'm here to talk about Connie.

428
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,497
I'm her psychiatrist.

429
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,017
Of course you are.

430
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,097
'This is Julia de Cadenet...'

431
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:43,017
Terrible.

432
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,641
It's... terrible.

433
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,657
Although I'm more than happy to take
some bags to the charity shop,

434
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,177
if that would help?

435
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:53,201
Karl said you call it...

436
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:55,761
something fancy.

437
00:39:57,281 --> 00:40:01,601
Connie's condition.
Yes. Dissociative amnesia.

438
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:07,737
It's a mechanism that the brain has
to cope with trauma.

439
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:11,737
Like locking events away in a box
and then burying the box.

440
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:14,817
Sounds damn sensible to me.

441
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:17,481
What good does more pain do?

442
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:24,041
But I just
don't understand this.

443
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:28,417
How could she do that?

444
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:30,401
Those poor little girls!

445
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:33,641
Well...

446
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:38,057
that's what we're trying
to find out, Mr de Cadenet.

447
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:40,137
We must have done something
terribly wrong!

448
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:42,617
No, no, you did nothing wrong.

449
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,161
Perhaps it might help to visit her.

450
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:51,761
I can't. I wouldn't know
what to say to her.

451
00:40:57,441 --> 00:41:01,657
Julia always knows what to do
when things go wrong.

452
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:05,401
Well, where is she? I told Connie
I'd bring her mother to visit.

453
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,361
Where is she?

454
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:11,641
She's dead.

455
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:15,481
Julia died before all this.

456
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:19,177
Thank God!

457
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:21,161
I am so sorry.

458
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,817
He's in urgent need of home care.

459
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:26,057
He's showing signs of confusion
and living in squalor,

460
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,977
and I need to know
what's being put in place.

461
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:30,241
Please call me on this number
as soon as possible.

462
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,137
Phil?

463
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,577
No, I'm not.

464
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:40,161
Why was this not on our notes,
for Christ's sake?

465
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:42,497
Her mother had just died.

466
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:46,361
Didn't somebody perhaps think that
that might be a contributory factor?

467
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:55,121
Ah, Doctor!
Did you mention the night shifts?

468
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:58,361
Leave us alone.

469
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:07,761
Sit down, Connie.

470
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:24,841
Connie...

471
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:31,921
do you remember your mother died
six weeks ago?

472
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:47,161
Did I know this?

473
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:49,841
Yes, you did.

474
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:56,401
She took a lot of paracetamol
accidentally.

475
00:42:57,681 --> 00:42:59,761
Just kept forgetting
that she'd taken them.

476
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:11,761
What was her name?

477
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,121
What was whose name?

478
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:18,481
Your daughter.

479
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:28,521
Please keep my daughter out of this.

480
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:31,241
How can I...

481
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:37,641
when your grief runs through
every syllable you utter?

482
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:42,361
We are the wrecked people.

483
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:49,521
You and I.

484
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:07,681
Abigail.

485
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:19,481
Abigail.

486
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:42,881
Happy birthday!

487
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:50,457
You look great. Thank you.

488
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:52,881
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, I'll have one. Thank you.
