1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,086
Excuse me, waitress?

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,424
I'm afraid the teriyaki
chicken's no longer on the menu.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,094
Oh, I'm sorry, that's
what you had last time.

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,013
We've never been here before.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,181
I definitely remember you.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,432
No, we never get up north.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,117
We're just up to see a friend of
ours who moved here last summer.

8
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,271
Your hair was lighter,
you had little round glasses.

9
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,733
Sounds like you.
Henry, don't play along,

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,611
it's a gimmick for tips.
Could we get some water?

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,283
It was last August,
Saturday the 14th.

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,094
You were wearing a
blue dress with polka dots,

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,037
your eyes were puffy
like you'd been crying.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,208
The 14th is Darren's birthday.

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,709
He said he had to
cancel his party

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,192
'cause his old
girlfriend showed up.

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,296
They got in a huge fight.
Henry...

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,714
I knew it. Damn it.

19
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,383
Ever since that ski trip, when
the two of you disappeared...

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,260
I'll go get your water.

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,060
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,151
I can't move my legs.

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:46,189
Picture a door, unlocked
with the key of the mind.

24
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,776
Two medical cases, both
more fascinating than the last.

25
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,112
That actually
makes no logical sense.

26
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,781
This is not
a door to logical sense.

27
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,116
Also, shut up.

28
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,037
Case number one:
a 33-year-old woman,

29
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,207
named something
I can't remember,

30
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,418
you'll see
the irony in a second,

31
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,295
presenting with
temporary paralysis,

32
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,507
high CK levels,
and a perfect memory.

33
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,469
How perfect is perfect?

34
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,138
Perfectly perfect.

35
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,390
Hyperthymesia, complete recall

36
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,892
of every moment of
every day since puberty.

37
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,646
All 7,600,049 of them.

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,982
That's cool, huh?

39
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,234
One of only a handful
of recorded cases...

40
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,571
So we have two symptoms:
temporary leg paralysis and elevated CK.

41
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,882
Obviously, you're not suffering
from the same condition,

42
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,409
'cause you've already
forgotten my dramatic voice over.

43
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,493
There's a third symptom.

44
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,578
Her memory's unrelated.

45
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,580
Why? It's a strange
medical phenomenon...

46
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,082
Hyperthymesia's known
to manifest in adolescence.

47
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,418
Yeah, in the whole
five documented cases.

48
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,338
To be related, it'd mean
20 years between symptoms.

49
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,840
Plus, I don't know of any
diseases that cause great memory,

50
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,759
only ones that destroy it.

51
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,552
MRIs show no
evidence of a stroke

52
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,262
or tumors, so probably a toxin.

53
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,682
She's a waitress. They're no
strangers to botulism or alcoholism.

54
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,684
We should search the diner
and where she lives.

55
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,019
Or you could search her brain.

56
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,105
You know, where her
memory lives, and save the gas.

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,192
You two, check her home, you
two, get a complete patient history.

58
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,611
We'll see who
gets an answer first.

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,030
You said there
was a second case.

60
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,033
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

61
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,289
The case of
the 45-year-old doctor

62
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,709
who just failed his pathology
re-certification exam

63
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,879
is going to lose his board
certification and get fired.

64
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,191
How did you fail it? You
spend half your life in the lab.

65
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,052
I was recovering from the flu. I'm
retaking it next week. It's not an issue.

66
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,429
Normally, I'd let
Darwinism run its course

67
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,933
but Cuddy's in a big tizzy about
her poster boy getting canned.

68
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,269
So, how are we gonna get
the short guy off the short bus?

69
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,953
What about a tutor?
I don't need a tutor.

70
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,232
Tutor it is.
Choose your poison.

71
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,901
Chase, if you prefer
pounding Aussie beers

72
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,278
and commiserating over
the suckiness of divorce.

73
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,156
Masters, if you want
nervous energy, flash cards,

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,992
and obnoxious
pieces of arcane trivia.

75
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,746
Foreman, if you need to be
berated by a humorless hardass.

76
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,165
- Foreman.
- Interesting.

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,293
You must be more
worried than you look.

78
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,509
Need a consult,
Dr. Wilson.

79
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,553
So, call me in a
week if it still itches.

80
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,637
Thank you.

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,390
And be sure to give
Sarah a kiss for me.

82
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,766
Will do.

83
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,477
Who's Sarah?

84
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,104
Her granddaughter, I think?

85
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,982
Early stages of dementia.
What's the consult?

86
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,233
I need your medical opinion,

87
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,610
on what bar we're gonna
hit for happy hour tonight

88
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,156
to kick-off the official end to your
three-month pity-party over Sam.

89
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,782
I can't tonight.

90
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,950
Because of Sarah?

91
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,203
Yes, because of my senile patient's
granddaughter, you caught me.

92
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,621
I'm busy.

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,713
Who's Sarah?
Wilson's friend?

94
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,801
My computer crashed. Lost my
database of his acquaintances.

95
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,053
Or you're both lying to me.

96
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,932
I know nothing about Wilson
having a friend named Sarah.

97
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,392
Satisfied?

98
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,230
Ooh!

99
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,692
What are the eight
types of vomitus?

100
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,446
I can show you four right now if
you ask me one more review question.

101
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,781
Hey, you picked me and you
said you wanted a hardass.

102
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,617
No, House said that,

103
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,553
and I pretended to agree
to get him off my back.

104
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,579
I picked you because
I wanted the guy

105
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,165
who doesn't like getting involved
in other people's problems.

106
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,601
I guess I thought
you'd want to skip

107
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,002
the massive public
humiliation of getting fired.

108
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,545
By treating me
like I'm an imbecile?

109
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,341
I'm totally fine. I aced
my first pathology boards.

110
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,593
Medicine has come a long way
in the last 100 years.

111
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,390
You know, I heard of
a guy who knew a guy

112
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,018
who could get
the exam ahead of time.

113
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,271
It was something I heard.

114
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,815
Patient's file said she lost
some weight on a new diet, right?

115
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,275
Yeah, she went vegan.

116
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,902
Are laxatives vegan?

117
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,367
- Hello?
- Where are you?

118
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,578
In the parking garage,
searching Wilson's car.

119
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,997
We have an answer,
magnesium poisoning.

120
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,208
We found a pretty
large stash of laxatives.

121
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,126
Abuse can lead
to hypermagnesemia.

122
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,381
I admit, that's impressively
outside-the-box thinking.

123
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,718
House?

124
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,889
You still there, House?

125
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,394
Everything okay?

126
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,526
No. For a second, I thought
Wilson might have a drug problem.

127
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,821
Turns out it's much, much worse.

128
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,866
Okay... So we push fluids

129
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,970
and wait for her kidneys
to clear the hypermagnesemia?

130
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,621
You'll be waiting a long time
since that's not what she has.

131
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,665
Her BP and respiratory
rate are normal.

132
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,543
While you two were so busy
being impressively outside the box,

133
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,503
you missed the actual box.

134
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,631
Chase and Masters done yet?

135
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,384
Two light beers November 16th,

136
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,846
one really bad glass
of Pinot on the 17th,

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,515
nothing from the 18th...

138
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,809
Shouldn't you be working
for NASA or something?

139
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,477
You mean,
why am I just a waitress?

140
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,605
No, I didn't mean...

141
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,773
I'm sorry I...

142
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,192
It's okay.

143
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,653
Remembering something is
not the same as understanding it.

144
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,155
I'm not a genius.

145
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:31,075
I love my job. I'm great at
it. It keeps my mind busy.

146
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:38,458
Hi, I'm Dr. House,
and you're not pooping.

147
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,171
Question is,
are you also a klutz?

148
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,092
I guess I'm no clumsier
than most people...

149
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,386
What are you guessing for?
You've got a perfect memory.

150
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,139
I was told there'd be
numbers, dates, fireworks.

151
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,643
What do you want to know?
Let's go back to 2008.

152
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,897
How many trips, stumbles,
falls did you have?

153
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,693
Eleven.

154
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,822
This really works. Cool.

155
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,033
How about 2009?

156
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,077
Twelve.

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,370
Even cooler.
Last year?

158
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,246
Twenty.

159
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,875
That's a big spike
in dyscoordination.

160
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,836
If you add constipation,
it's early onset Parkinson's.

161
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,049
Give her a full neuro-exam
and start her on levodopa.

162
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,851
I'm so surprised you broke into
my apartment without telling me.

163
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,936
What is this?

164
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,145
An intervention.

165
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,107
Exhibit A:
a baggie filled

166
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,360
with Nepeta cataria,
also known as...

167
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,237
That better not be
what I think it is.

168
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,698
If you mean your new
junkie girlfriend, then yes.

169
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,950
House...

170
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,913
Okay, fine, I got a cat.
Release the Kraken.

171
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,541
I don't think you appreciate
the severity of your situation.

172
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,877
You're rapidly approaching
end-stage male spinsterism.

173
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,590
That cat, that diabetic cat, that
you're shooting up with insulin

174
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,801
and buying dime
bags of catnip for,

175
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,721
that means you've given up
on ever finding anyone.

176
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,306
Don't you think you're
completely overreacting?

177
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,600
If I'm completely overreacting,
why'd you lie to me?

178
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,562
Because I knew you'd
completely overreact.

179
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,688
Its name is Sarah.

180
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,775
Cats aren't named that, women
are. What the Freud is that about?

181
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:32,947
Look, I didn't name her, my
neighbor did. She died and I felt bad.

182
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,742
Sarah would've been
destroyed at the shelter.

183
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,785
Who wouldn't want
a cat that croaks

184
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,704
if you're not home
twice a day to shoot it up?

185
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,790
It's like having
your own button on Lost.

186
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:48,004
You know, I'm pretty
sure there's a river nearby.

187
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,007
I'm keeping her.

188
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,681
Okay, shrug your shoulders
and don't let me push them down.

189
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,478
So, I have to ask,
is there a trick you use?

190
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,938
Mnemonics, meditation?

191
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,356
No. No tricks.

192
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,860
I don't even try, really.
It's just there.

193
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,032
Is my memory going to go
away with the Parkinson's?

194
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,325
It's quite possible.

195
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,844
But we still have
a lot of tests to do

196
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,345
before we have
a definitive diagnosis.

197
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,205
Well, here's hoping for cancer.

198
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,459
Nadia?

199
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,378
Your boss called me.

200
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,799
Sorry, I'm Elena,
Nadia's older sister.

201
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,885
You don't have to be here.

202
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,556
But I'd like to pretend you'd
visit me if I were in a hospital.

203
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,267
You brought daisies.

204
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,350
They're your favorite. No,
they're my least favorite.

205
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,567
I was stung in
the face six times by...

206
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,988
Oh, God.
What's wrong?

207
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,990
My heart...

208
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,076
Fast, wide-complex rhythm.
Get the paddles.

209
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,554
Cardiac involvement
rules out Parkinson's.

210
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,836
So we're back to transient paralysis
and high CK, plus arrhythmia.

211
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,964
Masters, when you finally
blossom into a woman,

212
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,817
would you ever sleep
with a man who had a cat?

213
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,509
Sure.

214
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,262
Wrong, the answer is "no."

215
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,513
Slut.

216
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,266
Any of you ever had a cat?

217
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,518
Any of you ever had sex?

218
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,189
I think as your people say,
"Quod erat demonstrandum."

219
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,608
An excess of catecholamine
could set off an arrhythmia.

220
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,253
It's not a pheo,
her blood pressure is fine.

221
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,653
Maybe we're missing the obvious.

222
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,196
The heart could be
behind everything.

223
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,867
If it's not pumping effectively,
the muscles shut down,

224
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,035
CK elevates,
coordination suffers.

225
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,453
Why are you asking about cats?

226
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,664
Curiosity.

227
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,875
Can we focus here?

228
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,004
Her heart problem started
when Nadia saw her sister.

229
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:57,508
Stress-induced arrhythmia could
be caused by long QT syndrome.

230
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,432
Her sister was barely
in the room five minutes.

231
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,597
She said they'd been estranged for
over six years. That's a lot of tension.

232
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,765
Run a stress test
to confirm long QT.

233
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,309
It'll have to be drug-induced,

234
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,661
a treadmill would
pull her stitches.

235
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
Drugs are never the answer.

236
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,063
We want her heart to go crazy,

237
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,547
there's something
simpler and safer.

238
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,610
Use the sister.

239
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,452
You lied to me.

240
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,455
No, I said I didn't
know anything about

241
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,290
Wilson having
a friend named Sarah.

242
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,542
Under House rules,
that's not a lie.

243
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,087
He's lonely.

244
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,107
The cat's a nice way for
him to get some affection.

245
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,317
That's not the kind of puddy tat

246
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,581
he needs to be getting it from.

247
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,177
He needs the puddy tat
he can tap.

248
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,845
Why is this so important to you?

249
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,681
After divorce number two,

250
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,101
he fell into a committed relationship
with a three-legged Siamese,

251
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,605
stopped answering his phone and
redecorated his place like Gray Gardens.

252
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,166
He wasn't able to
come back to humanity

253
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,985
until a window was left,
suspiciously and heroically, open.

254
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,197
How that cat opened the
window, I will never know.

255
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,949
He just needs more time.

256
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,037
Leave him and the cat alone.

257
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,373
I won't if you will.

258
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,294
Sorry about the daisies.

259
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,546
I always get it confused
if you love or hate them.

260
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,899
Do you want to know
exactly how many times

261
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,299
I've told you that I hate them?

262
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,717
I didn't do it on purpose.

263
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,305
Her heart rate isn't moving.

264
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,516
The sister stress
pot needs stirring.

265
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,352
You want me to start a fight?

266
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,646
Just agitate a little.

267
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,064
Use something from the history.

268
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,315
You're not lying to them.

269
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,501
In fact, you'd be
telling the truth

270
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,068
and serving their medical needs.

271
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,789
You haven't seen each
other in a while, huh?

272
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,961
I heard the story about the
time you hit Nadia with the car.

273
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,379
That must have
been pretty scary.

274
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,174
Why would you tell them that?

275
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,968
They asked about broken bones.

276
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,696
I swear that
I checked my mirrors.

277
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,929
You know that's a lie.

278
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,181
You knew I was getting the mail

279
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,392
and you just didn't
care enough to check.

280
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,520
Just like you didn't care that
you ruined my 23rd birthday...

281
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,646
Nadia, don't start.

282
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,566
You started it by coming here
and acting like you give a crap.

283
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,485
Here we go again! I'm such a
monster because I brought daisies!

284
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,756
You need to leave right now.

285
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,781
Is she going to be okay?

286
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,491
Elena, get out!

287
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,169
You said you'd be 10 minutes.

288
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,962
I couldn't decide on the cheese.

289
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,633
When are you getting an
apartment? Or at least a storage room?

290
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,178
I'll get to it.
I like it here.

291
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,679
They have Video on Demand.

292
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,451
I pulled a practice test
I hate practice tests.

293
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,226
Hey, I never saw
The Usual Suspects,

294
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,454
you want to check it
out before we start?

295
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,188
What are you doing?
You've got three days.

296
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,647
Why is everyone's
first assumption

297
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,091
I'm going to fail
this stupid test?

298
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,358
Maybe because you did?

299
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,069
I was recovering from the flu.

300
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,792
I don't care if you
were dying from Ebola,

301
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,572
you shouldn't have
gotten less than a 70.

302
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,375
You're nothing but
excuses and distractions.

303
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,328
Well, it's a nice match with your
condescension and superiority.

304
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,748
Enjoy the movie.

305
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,169
Kevin Spacey is Keyser Söze.

306
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,225
How is she?

307
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,562
We've started her
on a beta blocker,

308
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,564
it should keep her heart
rhythm under control.

309
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,483
She'll be fine
while we run more tests.

310
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,568
Did you hear she
banned me from her room?

311
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,531
I know I'm not perfect,
but she's...

312
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,617
She can be such a bitch.

313
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,204
She never, ever,
ever lets anything go.

314
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,752
Tell Nadia she doesn't need
to worry about seeing me again.

315
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,131
I started the fight.

316
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,303
We needed her heart rate
to rise, so I provoked you.

317
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,559
You can't play
with people like that.

318
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,424
Maybe if I explained to Nadia...

319
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,855
No, it doesn't matter.

320
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,066
It's just one more
fight for her to remember.

321
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,197
Guess you're both bitches.

322
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,625
Masters.

323
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,506
Smell her breath.
Breathe out.

324
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,051
Ammonia.

325
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,429
What is it?

326
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,890
I think your kidneys
are shutting down.

327
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,229
Failing kidneys puts the heart
back on the list as a symptom.

328
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,583
Maybe she went vegan because
she lost the taste for protein.

329
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,900
Could be amyloidosis.

330
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,277
We would have seen a stiff
heart on the nuclear study.

331
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,321
But autoimmune could account for

332
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,323
multiple organ
systems and paralysis.

333
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,534
There are a number that'd fit:
Guillain-Barre, polymyositis...

334
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,121
MS, polyarteritis nodosa... SLE.

335
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,492
Why are you giving me these?

336
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,959
"Cause while they're off
running all these tests,

337
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,753
you'll be submitting
the insurance forms.

338
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,272
There's an entire
department for that.

339
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,756
Exactly, the Foreman Department.

340
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,633
Of which you're
the foreman, Foreman.

341
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,986
I know you've got the time,
since a little wallaby told me

342
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,554
that you recently vacated
your post as Taub's savior.

343
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,765
He asked.
You're worse than Masters.

344
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,534
How's this my fault?
He doesn't need a tutor,

345
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,227
he needs Ritalin
and a babysitter.

346
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,187
Consider the forms incentive.

347
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,064
If Taub doesn't pass,

348
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,987
they will become a
permanent part of your life.

349
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,405
This isn't really about
Cuddy, is it? It's about you.

350
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,160
You don't want to lose me.

351
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,081
I think you care.

352
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,502
You don't think
you can disgust me

353
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,795
into pulling Foreman off you.

354
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,005
Pulse the patient with
steroids for the autoimmune

355
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,132
and start her on dialysis
for the kidney failure.

356
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,470
Treat the Taub with insults
and small slaps for the obstinacy

357
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,556
and start him on studying
for the brain failure.

358
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,397
No, that's not gonna work.
I have a haircut at 4:00.

359
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,735
I'll be in the... I'll be in the
office in about 20 minutes.

360
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,739
Yeah, okay.

361
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,299
You planted something
in my apartment

362
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,092
to make me think
I'm allergic to Sarah.

363
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,222
Paranoia is the first sign
of Toxoplasma gondii,

364
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,308
the parasite linked to
crazy cat lady disease.

365
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,392
I'm not paranoid.

366
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,187
I'm allergic to ragweed and
dandelion. I am not allergic to cats.

367
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,373
You're trying to gaslight me.

368
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,024
Maybe your subconscious

369
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,984
is afraid that you're
gonna die alone,

370
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,070
and it just comes out
as gibberish and sneezing.

371
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,490
Prove that I'm
overreacting. Boy's night out.

372
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,742
Good Time Charlie's.

373
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,702
They just changed
their slogan to

374
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,954
"Where the trashiest
ladies get trashed."

375
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,248
You do see the hypocrisy
in all this, don't you?

376
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,168
Until recently your lifestyle
of choice was self-exile.

377
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,086
But I never had a cat.

378
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,881
Why don't you
pick me up at 8:007?

379
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,846
You're gonna need
another round of steroids.

380
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,099
In the meantime,
we'll start your dialysis.

381
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,896
So I heard Elena
won't be coming back.

382
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,609
You think I was too hard on her?

383
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,694
We all hold our grudges...

384
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,529
It's not a grudge.

385
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,366
It's common sense,
it's simple math.

386
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,117
She's hurt me more
than she's helped me.

387
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,453
Most people edit their memories.

388
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,207
They add small little lies so
they don't have to face the truth.

389
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,542
My memories remain the same.

390
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,129
My truth never changes
because my truth is the truth.

391
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,800
So no one ever gets forgiven?

392
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,636
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.

393
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:26,600
No, I do forgive, as long as the
good things they do outweigh the...

394
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,147
I can't...
I can't breathe.

395
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,995
Huh.

396
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,248
What?
Nothing.

397
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,626
I just always pictured
your place with shag carpet.

398
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,879
Like kind of a Mod Squad vibe.

399
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,715
Not because of the black thing.

400
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,093
I always thought you
were more of a Pete...

401
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,113
You're limited to this room
and Marcus's old room.

402
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,138
Where's Marcus?

403
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,223
He tells me he's working
with our uncle in Florida.

404
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,349
He tells you?

405
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,834
You don't look at
or touch anything

406
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,572
that doesn't belong
to you, including food.

407
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,312
You will study
and you will sleep.

408
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,148
You will not leave my
sight until the exam.

409
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,692
Great. I'll be back bright and
early tomorrow and we can...

410
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,987
This is no longer just about
your future, it's about mine, too.

411
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,490
You fail, and I will kill you.

412
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,455
Respiratory distress means we
were wrong about autoimmune.

413
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,875
Could be pulmonary
oedema from the renal failure.

414
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,297
Pulmonary oedema
doesn't give you hives.

415
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,507
You think this is
an allergic reaction?

416
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,385
It can't be, we pumped
her full of steroids.

417
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,226
It can be if it was a
really, really bad one.

418
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,452
I have good news and bad news.

419
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,871
Good news is,
I was right about you

420
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,874
having some autoimmune disease.

421
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,709
You're just allergic
to the dialysis.

422
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,048
But if I can't have dialysis
and my kidneys are failing,

423
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,594
won't that mean I'll die?

424
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,057
Well, you figured
out the bad news.

425
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,809
What do we do?

426
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,353
We look for another case.

427
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,830
Even if we're
right about autoimmune,

428
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,314
we now don't have
time to prove it.

429
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,209
The transplant board will
never give her a kidney.

430
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,944
Maybe we could go around them?
Get a relative to donate.

431
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,070
Which relative?

432
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,423
The sister who walked away and
told you she was never coming back?

433
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,615
We caused this, you know.

434
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,301
They were estranged,
but we made it worse.

435
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,245
That relationship was broken
long before we got there.

436
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,623
Nadia literally keeps score.
She tallies everything.

437
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,293
She decided Elena's done
more bad things to her than good.

438
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,878
Doesn't deserve her affection.

439
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,004
I'm sure she's right.

440
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,260
Unlike everybody
else in the world,

441
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,011
her memory seems to
let her keep a pure,

442
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,639
objective view of
people and relationships.

443
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,809
There's no petty emotions or
agendas fogging the windshield.

444
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,102
Why's that so wrong?

445
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,980
Because it's making her die
alone of kidney failure in Room 2057

446
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,857
Not necessarily. Nadia's
sister is not like her.

447
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,652
I'm sure she's got plenty of
subjective emotions we can exploit.

448
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,171
Why don't you go
channel your guilt,

449
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,989
see if you can get her
to cough up a kidney?

450
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,532
Me?

451
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,760
I'm not good at that type of
thing. Someone else should go.

452
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,120
Someone else
didn't screw this up.

453
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,620
I didn't...

454
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,665
You were just
obeying orders, right?

455
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,041
Go fix this.

456
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,093
I didn't mean to
make you hate her.

457
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,471
And now that her
kidneys have failed...

458
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,685
I've always been a book
and equations person.

459
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,898
People are problematic
and random and messy,

460
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,319
and with sisters,

461
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,531
I mean, I had a cousin
who I was close to

462
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,241
and when our
menstrual cycles synched,

463
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,201
it was like gladiator school...

464
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,330
Do you want me to donate
a kidney to my sister?

465
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,166
Yes.

466
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,544
Okay.

467
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,673
Really? It might not
fix your relationship.

468
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,052
Probably shouldn't
have said that.

469
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,803
Your left.
On your left!

470
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,388
Stop whining already.

471
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,473
I was getting a sniper.

472
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,891
Five minutes left in the break.

473
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,226
But the next level is just
past the cooling tanks.

474
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,854
That was the deal. We take
this break, you do a practice test.

475
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,695
I didn't have the flu.

476
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,907
I just choked.

477
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,583
You make life and death
decisions every day.

478
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,252
You work for House.

479
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,336
You're under constant
pressure and you never choke.

480
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,259
I got a perfect score on
my first pathology boards.

481
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,514
I kept thinking
whatever my score is now,

482
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,684
it's going to be
a measure of the distance

483
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,687
between me and
the man I used to be.

484
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,189
You gotta stop
psyching yourself out.

485
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:29,194
Well, the last test was before
I lost my wife and my home.

486
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,406
So I'm sure the next
one will go much better.

487
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,047
Sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night,

488
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,299
and I can't sleep
for hours because

489
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,301
I'm worried I got
the diagnosis wrong.

490
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,057
These things work out.

491
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,151
We found a donor.

492
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,404
It's your sister.

493
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,323
Just thought you should know.

494
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,776
Nadia, can you hear me?

495
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,463
You're coming out
of your anesthesia,

496
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,863
you're going to
feel a bit groggy.

497
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,619
You did great.
Everything's looking good.

498
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,872
Nadia? Come on now,
open your eyes.

499
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:12,130
Get me three milligrams of lorazepam,
and I'm going to need suction.

500
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,471
Seizures mean the
steroids aren't working.

501
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,474
And we got the tests back. We
were wrong, it's not autoimmune.

502
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,892
Could be acute porphyria.

503
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,560
No abdominal pain.

504
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,188
Did the patient
thank her sister?

505
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,650
No, not yet at least.

506
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,901
See if she will.

507
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,045
What are you trying to find out?

508
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,237
If she's telling the truth.

509
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,156
She claims she
objectively sees reality,

510
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,741
weighing the good
and bad in people.

511
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,576
If that's true, I don't
care how many times

512
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,246
her sister borrowed her
scrunchy without asking.

513
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,331
The free kidney ought
to trump all the bad stuff.

514
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,582
And if it doesn't?

515
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,918
Then she sucks
like the rest of us.

516
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,336
We haven't considered her blood.

517
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,922
Clots could hit her leg,
heart, kidney and brain.

518
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,175
Factor V Leiden: easiest
to treat if we're right.

519
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,512
Start her on heparin.
And ask for the thank you.

520
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,767
How did I do?

521
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,602
Great.

522
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:11,273
Great? How great?
How many did I miss?

523
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,358
It's not about the numbers.
Don't...

524
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,860
Fifty-four percent?

525
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,445
They make the practice tests
harder than the actual exam.

526
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,865
Oh, my God, now I'm
choking in your living room.

527
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,241
This isn't going to work.

528
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,534
Who are you calling?

529
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,537
I found the guy. He can
sell me a copy of the test.

530
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,083
I know it's cheating,
and I suck as a person,

531
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,377
but the test is
tomorrow morning.

532
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,130
It's not about the cheating,
it's about your confidence.

533
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,175
You steal that test and
you'll never get it back.

534
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,511
I can't handle failing at
one more thing in my life.

535
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,849
You're a good doctor.

536
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,201
I've seen what
you're capable of.

537
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,352
You're fast, you're
decisive, and you're bold.

538
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,480
Those are not the qualities of
someone who needs to steal a test.

539
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,441
There's nothing on it
you don't already know,

540
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,901
you just need to
know you know it.

541
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,320
Keep talking.

542
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,363
We need you on the team.

543
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,899
So we're gonna sit here
and take another practice test,

544
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,452
and we're gonna keep taking
them until you've kicked its ass.

545
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,913
You can do this.
You feel me?

546
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,540
Yeah!

547
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,230
I feel like we just buried
a hooker in the desert.

548
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,499
There'll definitely
be another time

549
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,108
to rise up and
turn things around.

550
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,443
You'll come back from it.

551
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,819
Next time.

552
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,120
How're you feeling?

553
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,541
Not any better.

554
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,878
It will take some time
for the clots to resolve.

555
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,215
Your sister's recovering well.

556
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,719
If you're really adding
up the good and bad...

557
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,683
Can I see her?

558
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:16,940
Too fat.
Too thin. Too desperate.

559
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,984
Not desperate enough.

560
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,278
Come on, you can
insult them, too.

561
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,822
I'd rather not.

562
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,741
If you objectify them now,
you'll feel more comfortable

563
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,286
when you tie them to a
table in your basement later.

564
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,205
Or whatever.

565
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,332
Okay.

566
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,044
Too armpit-fatty?

567
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,963
Whoa. Too hot.

568
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,551
I actually know her. She's the
new barista at my coffee shop.

569
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,302
She's getting her
masters in finance.

570
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,804
Brains and boobs.

571
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,930
The mother lode.

572
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,515
Total moron
as a barista, though.

573
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,934
Every drink I order, ends
up with whipped cream on it.

574
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,769
Even when I say,
"No whip."

575
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,355
Girlfriend, that means
she's into you.

576
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,443
Okay.

577
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,993
"Hi, there.

578
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,203
"Wilson, James Wilson.

579
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,329
"I'm a doctor.

580
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,664
"Hoping that's enough to close,

581
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,583
"but I'm also a social moron.

582
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,084
"And I have a cat."

583
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,265
She said my coffee
is not the only thing

584
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,684
she'd like to put
whipped cream on.

585
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,645
But is she interested?

586
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,904
Oh, my God.

587
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,327
Bartender!
Champagne for everyone!

588
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,841
Hi.

589
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,885
Hi.

590
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,474
Thank you for saving my life.

591
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,143
I love you, you know.

592
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,525
I was thinking about those times

593
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,444
we went up to Spofford
Lake in the summer.

594
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,590
Whenever we took out the canoe,

595
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,658
you'd tie up my
life vest for me.

596
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,552
And in the afternoons,
you'd sneak me

597
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,579
into the lodge so we
could steal popsicles.

598
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,501
Maybe we could go back.

599
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,711
I could drive us up there.

600
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,965
We could get a cabin,
and maybe rent a canoe.

601
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,512
Wow, I haven't
thought of Spofford in...

602
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,684
Nadia, are you okay?

603
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,855
Elena, I'm sorry.
I can't do this!

604
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,914
Can you stop? Just stop
pushing me for a minute.

605
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,339
I understand now why you
stuck yourself in that diner,

606
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,050
away from friends,
away from family.

607
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,430
You can't forgive anyone.

608
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,183
I don't think
you weigh anything.

609
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,101
I think you're
like a lot of people,

610
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,813
you focus on the bad
memories instead of the good.

611
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,150
I don't have a choice.

612
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,073
Nadia, put your hand
in your lap for a moment.

613
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,912
I'm not doing that.

614
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,996
I know.

615
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,624
It's an involuntary
movement called chorea.

616
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,209
What does it mean?

617
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,003
It means we still don't
know what's wrong with you.

618
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,807
Thank you.

619
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,898
Do you know if that OR
nurse that Wilson liked

620
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,900
ever broke up
with her boyfriend?

621
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,860
I thought your
Wilson fetish was over.

622
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,862
I'm putting together
a second string

623
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,615
in case things don't go well
with the well-breasted barista.

624
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,742
You've got to
let that guy alone.

625
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,202
He's not supposed to be alone.

626
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,080
Is that what this is about?

627
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:46,251
You feel guilty because Wilson's
the one that's alone and not you?

628
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,378
You still don't
think you deserve this.

629
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,673
Have you met me?

630
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,842
Your happiness
doesn't take his away.

631
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,594
It's okay to enjoy it.

632
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,644
Yeah?

633
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,938
Chorea. Rules out
the clotting disorder.

634
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,207
It means we're
back to square one.

635
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,501
If it's hit her brain, that could
mean she doesn't have long.

636
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:14,070
So then the question becomes,
"Will the sister show up at the funeral?"

637
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,405
She tried to reconcile.

638
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,116
But the bad memories crowded
out the good and she ran.

639
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,617
Nobody's perfect.

640
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,035
What else?

641
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,707
Come on, the woman has
all the information we need,

642
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,167
she's a bottomless
diagnostic library.

643
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,587
Maybe we're missing something
from the apartment, some lifestyle thing.

644
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:35,216
Yeah, it's all muscle strain from
doing her hundreds of jigsaw puzzles.

645
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,278
We should do another MRI.
A brain hemorrhage would...

646
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,763
Hey, how many puzzles?

647
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,224
Okay, I was exaggerating dozens.

648
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,022
Do a peripheral blood smear,
look for acanthocytes.

649
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,148
I'll be right in.

650
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,237
Remember me?

651
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,239
Just kidding.

652
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,367
So, jigsaw puzzles.

653
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,997
I find them calming.

654
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,999
You ever left one unfinished?

655
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,667
No, that would drive me crazy.

656
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,503
Speaking of...

657
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,012
Why are you doing that?

658
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,531
More important
question is, why are you?

659
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,556
It's just a habit.

660
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:29,687
It's a habit that compels you in
an obsessive way that's so bad

661
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,772
it's a disorder.

662
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,065
I don't have OCD.

663
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,776
Each brain with OCD has
its own way of filtering it.

664
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,570
Some people wash their hands
and hoard TV Guides,

665
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,198
you do puzzles
and hoard memories.

666
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,369
So what we thought was a gift,

667
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,331
was just you literally
obsessing over your own life.

668
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,419
That's why I can't stop the
memories even when I try.

669
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,383
But everything else?
My kidneys...

670
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,720
Your memory was a symptom
of a symptom of a larger disease.

671
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,473
You have McLeod's syndrome.
It's a rare genetic disorder

672
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:10,478
that affects the nervous
system, blood and can cause

673
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,315
OCD.

674
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,486
Am I gonna die?

675
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,238
It can't be cured.

676
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,075
But your various symptoms
can be managed with medication.

677
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,915
Best case scenario, you
can live another 20 years.

678
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,967
If it's any solace,
everybody dies alone.

679
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,391
Probably isn't.

680
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,067
How'd it go?

681
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,405
Well, it's hard to choke when
you have all the answers.

682
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,575
Look at it this way, it's better
to suck at taking one test

683
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,369
than to suck at
saving people's lives.

684
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,580
Wow!

685
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,875
Rachel thought it was too big,
and I can't keep it in my hotel room.

686
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,501
You're giving it to me?

687
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,587
I couldn't stand
the thought of you

688
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,214
having company over
with that other TV.

689
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,049
It's embarrassing.

690
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,511
Thanks.

691
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,389
Thank you.

692
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:38,191
Hey, look.
I have the room.

693
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,943
You could stay if you wanted to.

694
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,237
Just until you
find your new place.

695
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,990
Who else am I gonna play
SavageScape with?

696
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,618
We could do that online
from separate houses.

697
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,162
Will you shut up?

698
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,581
Okay.

699
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,382
How're you feeling?

700
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,800
Much better.

701
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,096
I don't believe what House said.

702
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,183
I'm not sure even
House believes it anymore.

703
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,939
You said you didn't have a
choice to be the way you are.

704
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,107
Now you do.

705
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,904
These are SSRIs. They've
been effective in treating OCD.

706
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,364
You mean lose my memory?

707
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,450
Not lose it entirely, it'll just
become more like anyone else's.

708
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,663
My memory

709
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:39,919
is the only thing that has
ever made me special.

710
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,005
Maybe so.

711
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,594
But if you want to be special,
you're going to have to be alone.

712
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,741
Hey!

713
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,676
Hey!
Hey.

714
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,470
Those are for Sarah.

715
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,680
Are they poisoned?

716
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,851
You and your paranoia.

717
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,770
Now, if you'll excuse me,

718
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,110
I really should find a better
place to store my ragweed.

719
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,364
It's a very nice gesture,
but it's still in the apartment.

720
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,969
So, I want to hear all the
dirty, dairy-specific details

721
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,888
of your night
with Java the Slut.

722
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,392
All right.
First of all, all real.

723
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:25,399
Second, a true connoisseur
of the dark arts of...

724
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,156
I flaked. I walked her to
her car and said good night.

725
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,911
I will get back into it. You just
need to give me a little more time.

726
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,961
I'll give you 10 days.

727
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,635
Fine.

728
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,017
Ew!
