1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,300
House?

2
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,723
House?

3
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,813
Oh, my God!

4
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,273
What the hell?

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,651
Gotcha. Did you
actually wake up early

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,976
and hide under the bed just
to scare the crap out of me?

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,907
Set an alarm and everything.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,658
It's like dating a 10-year-old.

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,286
God, I hope not.

10
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,885
Now that we're down here...

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,428
Hold that thought.

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,471
Seriously?

13
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,598
I have to pee.

14
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,103
I'll wait.
I brought a book.

15
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,067
Didn't know what time
your alarm was set for.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,235
House?

17
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,362
You know, you could rent
this space out down here.

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,113
In Japan, that would
be like a deluxe...

19
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,282
House, shut up.

20
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,787
There's blood in my urine.

21
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,258
You really don't
have to be here.

22
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,093
You're my girlfriend.
I'm being supportive.

23
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,845
I'm mainly talking about them.

24
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,058
Well, given that there's almost

25
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,434
certainly nothing
wrong with you,

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,496
and my patient definitely has
something wrong with him...

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,980
That can't wait an hour?

28
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,898
Afraid not. He's...

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,652
Chase?

30
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,320
Sixteen-year-old
male spit up blood

31
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,947
during a pick-up
basketball game.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,992
ER couldn't find the source
in his lungs or GI tract.

33
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,618
See? Serious.

34
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,955
Could be vasculitis,
bronchiectasis, inhaled particles.

35
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,164
What about angiodysplasia?

36
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,417
Ready when you are.

37
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,668
Get them out of here.

38
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,421
My urethra is not for
public entertainment.

39
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,923
But it is good-time adjacent.

40
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,010
Feed the kid a camera, check
his gut for angiodysplasia.

41
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,429
All right, scoot up here.

42
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,683
I'm missing a watch. If you
could keep your eyes open while...

43
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,935
Okay. You, too.

44
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,858
This little camera

45
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,402
transmits images
to the data recorder

46
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,238
SO we can see if you've got any

47
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,074
vascular malformations
in your GI tract.

48
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,287
Your records show you've lost
some weight over the past year.

49
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,998
Was that intentional?
Not really.

50
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,892
Well, he's been eating less
since he quit the swim team.

51
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,711
You have to get
up early for swim.

52
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,421
It wasn't fun anymore.

53
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,549
I need to talk to your son
about sexual activity.

54
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,235
Generally, it's less
embarrassing for everyone...

55
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,802
We're leaving.

56
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,850
Actually, I've only ever...

57
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,770
How long have you
been cutting yourself?

58
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,734
Those are from a layback
grind that went wrong.

59
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,445
Came off my skateboard,
straight into a fence.

60
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,491
So, no to cutting but yes to
appetite and sleep changes,

61
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,994
and you quit something
you used to enjoy.

62
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,121
How long have
you been depressed?

63
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,293
Imaging showed no
sign of upper GI issues,

64
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,420
but the kid did admit
to being depressed

65
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,714
and to smoking pot
to take the edge off.

66
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,674
You are very pleased
with yourself, aren't you?

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,944
His marijuana could be laced
with formaldehyde or lead,

68
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,404
which could cause
a pulmonary hemorrhage,

69
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,097
which could make
him spit up blood.

70
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,476
Yes. Yes, I am.
It was a good catch.

71
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,524
Run a lead level and
push five liters IV fluid.

72
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,488
Feel free to tip
your other server.

73
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,617
Cystoscopy was clean,

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,244
cytopathology was normal...

75
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,037
Why do you have my lab results?

76
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,666
I don't. If I did,
I'd know you were fine.

77
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,668
Unless the blood
came from my kidneys.

78
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,877
Come on.

79
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,423
Your hypochondriac mom had
a brush with mortality last month.

80
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,759
It's understandable that
you're worrying more than usual.

81
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,637
Worrying that you
might turn into her.

82
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,518
You're right.

83
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,814
Odds are this is nothing.

84
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,234
Meet me in the cafeteria in 10.

85
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,028
There'll be a corn dog
with your name on it.

86
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,866
I mean an actual corn dog.
They fixed the deep fryer.

87
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,379
I need to schedule
an ultrasound.

88
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,009
My dad's head is
still in one piece,

89
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,969
so I'm guessing you
didn't mention the pot.

90
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,512
What'd you tell them?
The truth.

91
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,223
You had a minor
chemical exposure

92
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,517
and we can't be 100%
sure how it happened.

93
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,893
Thanks for covering.

94
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,271
I know what it's like to be 16.

95
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,273
You also know what
it's like to be depressed.

96
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,359
You figured out my deal
after only a few minutes.

97
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,862
I've been fooling my friends
and parents for months.

98
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,239
It's my job to notice things.

99
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,076
Maybe talking to your parents
would make things better.

100
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,203
I've tried.

101
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,371
They take it personally
that I'm not happy,

102
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,416
and then I end up having
to make them feel better.

103
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,211
They don't get me.

104
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,296
No one does.

105
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:47,931
In med school, it seemed like
everybody else could handle the pressure.

106
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,098
I couldn't.

107
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,604
I ended up hurting myself.

108
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,982
Stupidest thing I've ever done.

109
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,785
You've got red spots in your
eyes. They weren't there before.

110
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,627
You have nice skin.

111
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,128
Thank you. Shut up.

112
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,340
Sorry, just thought it would
be rude not to comment.

113
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,384
Just treat me like
any other patient.

114
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,593
Right.

115
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,931
Are you sucking in your stomach?

116
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,099
No.

117
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,936
Now hurry up before I pass out.

118
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,440
Wilson?

119
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,323
Ultrasound isn't definitive. We
should run other tests before...

120
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,826
Stop talking like a doctor
and tell me what you see.

121
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,621
There's a mass in your kidney.

122
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,506
We still don't know why
Ryan coughed blood,

123
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,301
and now he's got small
hemorrhages in his eyes.

124
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,011
Sounds like an
acquired coagulopathy,

125
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,655
which gives us a
pretty wide differential.

126
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,889
Gets a lot narrower if we
factor in his depression.

127
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,182
Oh, don't do that.

128
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,519
Mood swings can be a symptom
of physiological illness.

129
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,687
Not talking to you.

130
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,779
Mood swings are also
a symptom of adolescence,

131
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,066
along with emo music
and masturbation.

132
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,943
More importantly,
his weight loss

133
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,504
and sleeping issues
started a year ago.

134
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,768
Infection makes the most sense.

135
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,990
He shoots hoops at school,
showers in the locker room.

136
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,742
- I'm thinking staph or...
- Damn.

137
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,369
You don't think...
Not talking to you.

138
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,124
- Everything okay with
Cuddy? - She's fine.

139
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,834
She's just too
stupid to accept it.

140
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,503
Start him on
nafcillin for staph.

141
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,759
All that's in the
First Mutual safety deposit box.

142
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,218
The retirement accounts...

143
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,557
You're freaking out
because of one ultrasound

144
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,893
performed by an
incompetent bonobo monkey.

145
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,063
As demonstrated by my sitting
here calmly, going about my business.

146
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,856
Calling in a lawyer,
drafting a will.

147
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,069
Okay. I hacked into
your on-line schedule.

148
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,112
Look, tests always
show something.

149
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,758
Mass in your kidney could be a
complex cyst, it could be benign...

150
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,991
I'm a single mom.

151
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,993
I need to set up a trust,
appoint a guardian.

152
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,837
It's silly that I haven't
done it before now.

153
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,765
But you're doing it
now because you think you're sick.

154
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,207
The freaking out
can at least wait

155
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,768
until after the biopsy
this afternoon.

156
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,126
The biopsy's not till tomorrow.

157
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,730
It's the first opening
in the schedule.

158
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,423
For the Dean of Medicine, the
first opening in the schedule is...

159
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,633
Oh, look. Now!

160
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,260
My worry isn't any more
important than anyone else's.

161
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,386
Actually, it is.

162
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,138
But I'm not sick, right?

163
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,811
Good point.

164
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,151
I want my stuff, asshat.

165
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,778
I told you, man,
I don't have it here.

166
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,740
Hey, guys.
Everything okay?

167
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,786
On my way out.
I'll see you later.

168
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,087
You want to tell me
what's going on?

169
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,887
My friend gave me some
leftover Klonopin he had

170
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,181
when he switched
to seizure meds.

171
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,058
I sold them to Roid
Rage for 80 bucks,

172
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,310
but I landed in here
before I could deliver,

173
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,396
and now he's gonna
rip my arms off.

174
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,106
How often do you sell drugs?

175
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,525
It was a one-time thing.

176
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,153
I needed the cash, I had the
pills, so I thought, "Why not?"

177
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,197
It was a bad idea.

178
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,952
The pills are at my house. I
could have a friend go get them.

179
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,131
Give the thug his money back.

180
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,552
One time only.

181
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,682
I mean, if you're
okay with this.

182
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,629
You have three kids of your own.

183
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,480
It's not even a question. Of
course, I'll be Rachel's guardian.

184
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,939
And House is cool with this?

185
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,107
I mean, you guys...

186
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,984
We've only been
together a few months.

187
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,360
It seems like a lot longer.

188
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,006
Probably because you've been
talking about him for 10 years.

189
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,656
And by "talking,"
I mean ranting about

190
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,036
wanting to smash his teeth in
with a stapler for being such a jerk.

191
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,164
People change.

192
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,378
I'll get it.

193
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,713
That better be her.

194
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,179
Rachel Cuddy, you were supposed
to be home half an hour ago.

195
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,388
Don't blame me.

196
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,232
He's the one who
wouldn't run any red lights.

197
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,398
Mouth on that kid makes Mel
Gibson sound like Nelson Mandela.

198
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,942
Where'd she learn that?

199
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,032
I don't know why you're
here, but I didn't do it.

200
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,827
What's the problem, Officer?

201
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,620
She was shoplifting
down at the mall.

202
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,853
Are either of you
this girl's father?

203
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,919
Nope. But since her mom died,
she's my favorite tax write-off.

204
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,089
Officer, you have my word,
it won't happen again.

205
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,967
Because next time
she won't get caught!

206
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,614
It's no big deal.

207
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,075
Good for you.

208
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,954
You could have just assumed
he was a drug dealer,

209
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,788
but instead you
took his word for it.

210
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,708
It's nice to finally
see someone have

211
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,835
a little faith in
humanity around here.

212
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,963
Why would you do that?

213
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,216
Ryan, you okay in there?

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,426
I'm not sure.

215
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,806
I think I just peed blood.

216
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,939
Looks like peeing
blood is the new black.

217
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,900
Peeing blood after
a night on antibiotics

218
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,568
means we can move
on from infections.

219
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,337
Scoping showed no sign
of a bleed in his bladder,

220
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,422
which points to
a kidney problem.

221
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,947
Probably some kind of mass.

222
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,174
A kidney mass wouldn't explain

223
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,742
the coughing blood
or the hemorrhages.

224
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,869
Antiphospholipid syndrome,
on the other hand...

225
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,163
Makes sense. But
doesn't rule out a mass.

226
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,539
You think it's cancer?

227
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,334
Mass doesn't have to be cancer.
It could be a renal hematoma.

228
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,920
But the patient doesn't have
any other abdominal trauma.

229
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,505
He's not talking
about the patient.

230
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,635
Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?

231
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,639
It's probably just a complex
cyst or angiomyolipoma.

232
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,015
It's a mass, not a mystery.

233
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,181
They'll do the biopsy,
then you'll have your answer.

234
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,853
Just have to wait.

235
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,815
Patient admitted to using pot.

236
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,139
Who knows what else he's doing.

237
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,277
This could be
heroin-induced nephropathy.

238
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,546
I thought you trusted this kid.

239
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,739
And then you pointed out
how sweet that was.

240
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,908
If it were heroin, he'd
be going through withdrawal.

241
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,868
Antiphospholipid
syndrome's a better fit.

242
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,204
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

243
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,749
While he's doing that, can I at
least search his house for drugs?

244
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,710
Have I ever said
no to that question?

245
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,548
What are you doing here?

246
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,051
Pie-eating contest.

247
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,389
Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour. You
should be keeping her company.

248
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,934
Okay, you've been worried

249
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,561
that your relationship is getting
in the way of your diagnoses,

250
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,230
you're protecting your patient.

251
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,024
Either that, or you're an ass.

252
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,527
Three, I hate
the smell of death.

253
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,406
The chances of Cuddy
having renal cell carcinoma...

254
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,408
I'm talking about
our relationship.

255
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,867
She needs support and comfort,

256
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,787
both things that
I famously suck at.

257
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,205
Which will inevitably lead to...

258
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,624
You know what's good
for that? Practice.

259
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,752
Doing it, I don't know, once.

260
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,933
I'm not gonna act like there's a
crisis before we know there is one.

261
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,692
There's no proof that there's
anything wrong with her.

262
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,427
There's no proof she's being
stalked by ninja squirrels either,

263
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,429
but if she's scared of them,

264
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,305
as her boyfriend, it's your job

265
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,392
to figure out how to
help her feel better.

266
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,440
You're right.

267
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,285
House told me to
keep you company.

268
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,662
Nurse told me to
give you antibiotics.

269
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,665
Tell House I'm fine.

270
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,461
Hmm.

271
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,882
Tom Cruise got married.

272
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,728
Do you want me to quote from First
Corinthians? Because I can do that.

273
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,272
As a Jew, I'm gonna
have to decline that offer.

274
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,458
Don't know what you're missing.

275
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,359
Saint Paul was
really on his game.

276
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,366
He'll show up eventually.

277
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,106
You don't actually believe that.

278
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,997
But I do.

279
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,458
All these years,
he's never stopped

280
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,628
trying to annoy me for
more than 15 minutes.

281
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,506
Now he can't even
walk into the room.

282
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,011
"Love hopes all things."

283
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,766
What is it with
you and this kid?

284
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,646
He's doggie-paddling in a sea of
misery. I remember what it's like.

285
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,816
How far do you have to reach
back for that memory? Last night?

286
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,568
Sometimes I hear you in the
living room watching TV at 3:00 a.m.

287
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,155
That's when classic Doctor
Who comes on the BBC.

288
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,032
Yeah, if only they
had some device

289
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,701
that allowed you to record
them, watch them another time.

290
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,414
I'm just saying, don't think
fixing this kid is gonna fix you.

291
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,166
Yeah.

292
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,336
We're on our way back.

293
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,256
Our patient lost all
feeling in his right arm.

294
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,882
Look at this.

295
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,620
Chase?

296
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,583
How'd it go with Cuddy?

297
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,753
Chase?

298
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,295
Good thing I brought my ax cane.

299
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,715
House, help me!

300
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,426
I'm coming.

301
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,889
House, please!

302
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,811
Looks like we've got company.

303
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,374
House!

304
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,103
No!

305
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,399
Are you okay?

306
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,278
I was sleeping.

307
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,363
What could go wrong?

308
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,578
Patient lost feeling in his arm

309
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,789
while on steroids,
rules out autoimmune.

310
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,959
So what causes bleeding, kidney
problems and unilateral numbness?

311
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:51,338
And a complete absence of any
record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy.

312
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,382
She must've put it
under a false name

313
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,384
so I couldn't rush the results.

314
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,672
What if we had it backwards,

315
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,698
and it's not a bleeding
problem, it's a clotting problem?

316
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,141
And there's no patient file
created in the last two days

317
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,018
for anyone having
that procedure.

318
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,104
She backdated the file?
That's very clever.

319
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,939
Hands off. She's mine.

320
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,224
Clots could explain everything,
including the numbness.

321
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,715
We should do an angiogram
of his brain, see if we can find it.

322
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,660
House. We're worried, too.

323
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,329
How sweet.

324
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,892
I'm not worried. I just want to get
the results so she can stop worrying.

325
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,002
Okay. But in the meantime...
Do an angiogram.

326
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,379
And you two go to pathology
and look at Cuddy's slides.

327
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,757
You just said you didn't
know which sample was hers.

328
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,640
I guess you're gonna
have to look at them all.

329
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,806
Bigger question,
what's the deal with Taub?

330
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,185
Just because House is too
distracted to notice your distraction,

331
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,686
doesn't mean we didn't.

332
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,230
Clots, angiograms, I'm focused.

333
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,399
The kid scratched out
the faces of half his class.

334
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,502
You don't think that's a
problem? It's not our problem.

335
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,986
Why is it anyone's problem?

336
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,614
I violently executed my
10th grade geometry teacher

337
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,324
about five different
ways in my mind.

338
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,700
I didn't want to kill anybody.

339
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,827
I just wanted to
torture them slowly

340
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,205
in my basement,
preferably with acid.

341
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,460
You guys ever think about
what you might do to House?

342
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,636
Maybe it's no big deal.

343
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,471
Unless it is.

344
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,932
Somebody shot House.

345
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,984
What are you doing?

346
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,528
Pie-eating contest.

347
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,073
I was going to
send Chase to tell you

348
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,033
what the obvious
right thing to do here is.

349
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,451
But then I realized

350
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,121
if you were too stupid
to know how stupid that was,

351
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,747
you might miss the irony.

352
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,333
You have to be with her.

353
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,709
Yeah, I get it.

354
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,712
She needs artificial support
for an artificial problem.

355
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,631
She's fine.

356
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,591
Chase did an excellent job.

357
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,093
She doesn't sleep with Chase.

358
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,386
We don't know that.

359
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,722
Hey, eating pie in here.

360
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,810
House. I'm not gonna
tell you a third time.

361
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,395
Do not screw this up.

362
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,857
Because I really don't
want to clean up the mess.

363
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,569
He was referring to the pie.

364
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,571
Fourteen patients
with kidney biopsies.

365
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,657
I tabulated them against
their urinalysis results.

366
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:27,703
Six men, three diabetics, one
LCDD, one kid, two seniors.

367
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,414
And, by default, one Cuddy.

368
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,586
The biopsy was inconclusive.

369
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,629
The mass is near the
center of her kidney.

370
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,923
They couldn't get
a readable sample.

371
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,819
Means they'll have
to remove the mass

372
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,470
to know if it's cancer or not.

373
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,889
File says they're
doing some imaging now.

374
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,212
Give the surgeon a better
idea of what he's dealing with.

375
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,359
Can we order pizza?

376
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,278
There's nothing in the fridge.

377
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,697
At least, not anymore.

378
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,100
What's happening
with the patient?

379
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,661
Angio showed a clot in a branch
of his middle-cerebral artery.

380
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,956
We started him on
streptokinase to break it up.

381
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,251
Although maybe we should've
just played a few rounds

382
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,794
of Savagescape 2:
The Revenge,

383
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,839
because that's obviously the best
way to make someone feel better.

384
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,468
You keep talking like Wilson,
your face will freeze like that.

385
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,803
However bad you think
you're gonna be in that room,

386
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,306
not being in the room is worse.

387
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,982
When she breaks up with you,
you're playing by yourself.

388
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,780
Honey, I'm home.

389
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,908
Just in time.
The pot roast is ready.

390
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,910
It smells wonderful.

391
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:54,289
I cured all my patients, so I came
home to spend time with Rachel.

392
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,749
And how was your day today?

393
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,253
It was great, Ma. I got
100% on my spelling test.

394
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,463
And 170 on my LSATSs.

395
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,466
Your LSATSs?
You're eight years old.

396
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,218
We've been studying together.

397
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,678
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

398
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,764
Well, that's wonderful.

399
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,560
I think Rachel deserves a treat.

400
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,104
No, thanks, Daddy. It
might spoil my appetite.

401
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,149
Well, who could that be?

402
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,572
Delivery for you,
Mrs. House.

403
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,365
Happy 29th birthday.

404
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,158
I'm not 29.

405
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,788
You're not limping.

406
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,042
This isn't possible.

407
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,629
None of this is possible.

408
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,215
A girl can dream.

409
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,312
You run out of sugar?

410
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,190
I got your scans
back from today.

411
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,334
Yeah.

412
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,470
Okay.

413
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,682
What's going on?

414
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,438
Imaging shows enhancing masses

415
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,066
across multiple lobes
of Cuddy's lungs.

416
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:51,031
That's what kidney cancer
looks like when it metastasizes.

417
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,620
She's dead.

418
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,587
What's up, losers? I hope
you're enjoying being alive.

419
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,131
Today's lesson,
natural selection.

420
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,217
Excellent system,
made us who we are today.

421
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,803
But then we invented seat
belts and grocery stores.

422
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,263
Things that keep
idiots and weaklings alive.

423
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:20,143
And let's be honest, most
of you don't really deserve it.

424
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,731
Here's to the natural order.

425
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,322
Yes!

426
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,616
Whoo!

427
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,955
Copied from his flash
drive. Do I go to the cops?

428
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,749
Yes. "Officer, I'd like
to report an assault.

429
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,168
"The victim was
a pile of leaves."

430
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,546
It goes on. He talks
about bombing his school.

431
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,089
Which you know because you stole

432
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,091
his flash drive and
broke into his house.

433
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,968
How's that gonna play?

434
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,053
Ryan's not
responding to streptokinase.

435
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,265
We don't have very long before
the damage becomes irreversible.

436
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,810
So we either up his dosage, or go
into his head and get the clot out.

437
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,478
- Where's House?
- Hopefully with Cuddy.

438
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,689
She did just get
some pretty awful news.

439
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,066
I called her. She doesn't
know where he is, either.

440
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,032
Have you seen House?

441
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,117
No.

442
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,915
He left my place last night after
you called. No one's seen him today.

443
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,959
Any idea where he'd be?

444
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,043
No.

445
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,631
And you're not
worried about that?

446
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,050
He's not good with bad news.

447
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,136
Yes, I'm worried.

448
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,221
But this isn't about
House, it's about Cuddy.

449
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,490
She's the one who could be dying

450
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,266
and he's trying to
make this about himself.

451
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,101
I'm not playing.

452
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,394
Okay.

453
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,150
She still believes
he'll show up.

454
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,989
He'll either get over himself
and be who she needs him to be,

455
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,741
or he won't.

456
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,579
We'd like to do an embolectomy.

457
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,539
We'll run
a corkscrew-shaped instrument

458
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,709
into Ryan's brain
and pull the clot out.

459
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,797
Okay. Have you
talked to him about it?

460
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,050
Yes. But I wanted
to see you alone.

461
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,470
I saw some videos that
Ryan made a few weeks ago.

462
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,724
He's blowing up pipe bombs and
threatening people in his school.

463
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,809
Oh, God!

464
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,952
He was probably
just messing around.

465
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,176
Our son wouldn't hurt anybody.

466
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,521
I'm not so sure.

467
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,316
I know this looks bad,
but Ryan's a good kid.

468
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,669
He's had a rough couple of
years since he started high school,

469
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,320
but I really think
he'll come out of it.

470
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,488
He needs help.

471
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,989
Maybe he does.
But this gets out,

472
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,908
he'll be suspended,
maybe expelled.

473
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,591
How about you focus
on keeping him alive.

474
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,831
What are you gonna do?

475
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,207
What do you think I should do?

476
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,751
So you can do the opposite?

477
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,796
There are kids
all over the country

478
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,881
doing dumb, potentially
violent things,

479
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,365
but the percentage
of them who would

480
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,802
actually kill anybody
IS minuscule.

481
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,428
So I shouldn't do anything?

482
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:05,016
Hmm, while the odds are
low, the fallout could be huge,

483
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,602
tens or even hundreds of lives.

484
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,937
So I should call the cops.

485
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,983
Of course, over-identification with
the subject could skew the calculation

486
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,903
towards being extra
protective or alternatively...

487
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,780
You suck at this.

488
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,621
Hate the statistics,
not the statistician.

489
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,169
Give me a little more dye.

490
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,465
There's the clot.

491
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,890
It just disintegrated
when you touched it.

492
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,310
What was that thing?

493
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,283
I got a great idea
where we should go.

494
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,409
I don't want to hear it.

495
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,661
You're gonna love it.

496
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,707
Australia's Finest. It's a
great karaoke bar in Newark.

497
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,335
I hate karaoke.

498
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:18,048
They've got every song
by every Aussie artist,

499
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,594
Midnight Oil, Men at
Work, Olivia Newton John.

500
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,763
I do a mean version of Physical.

501
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,182
And the barbecued
shrimp is amazing.

502
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,686
What about the fries?

503
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,064
Hot, salty and delicious.

504
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,951
Talking about food
made me hungry.

505
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,579
You had candy in
my other dreams.

506
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,582
Means you're stressed at work.

507
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,043
All dream symbols mean
you're stressed at work.

508
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,128
Or castration anxiety.

509
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,254
No.

510
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:04,135
I was hoping you'd figure
out a way to handle all this.

511
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,933
Maybe you can't
because you're still a child.

512
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,936
I can do better.

513
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,486
Might be too late.

514
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,620
House?

515
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,942
I should have been here.

516
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,112
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,495
I knew you'd come.

518
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,088
What was that thing?

519
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,300
And why did it just dissolve
in the middle of surgery?

520
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,052
And why is his
liver shutting down?

521
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,447
That thing in his brain goes
away, the kid slips into a coma.

522
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,889
We've started him on lactulose,

523
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,016
but at the rate his liver
function is declining,

524
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,434
he'll be dead in a day.

525
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,603
Should we page House?

526
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,146
He's busy.

527
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,028
House can't do
anything for her now.

528
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,696
We need him.
By his own logic...

529
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,174
Patient's blood
tests were negative

530
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,158
for barbiturates
or acetaminophen.

531
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,285
He's not on a high-protein diet.

532
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,913
House couldn't concentrate on
the case before she was dying.

533
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,207
You think he's gonna
get in the game now?

534
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,293
If you don't make it,

535
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,146
I won't sleep with anyone
for at least a month.

536
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,630
Make it two.

537
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,881
Bitch.

538
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,471
AIP can cause
uraemia, tank the liver.

539
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,890
It causes abdominal
cramping not abdominal bleeding.

540
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,059
Because fucosidosis
was such a brilliant idea.

541
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,393
Guys.

542
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,107
Type 2 citrullinemia fits.

543
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,485
There are no signs
of hyperlipidemia or pancreatitis.

544
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,986
Those can take years to emerge.

545
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,279
Closest we've gotten.

546
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,115
Start him on IV sodium benzoate

547
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,325
to reduce the ammonia
levels in his blood.

548
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,161
Run a genetic test
for citrullinemia.

549
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,602
Hi.

550
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,279
Guess who doesn't have cancer?

551
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,990
Me.

552
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,241
Also, you.

553
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,786
Actually, you for
sure. Me... House...

554
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,165
The tumor was benign.

555
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,833
It was an oncocytoma.

556
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,753
They got it out, you'll be fine.

557
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,882
Then what was in my lungs?

558
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,508
Well, once they
ruled out cancer,

559
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,595
I remembered that your
mom was allergic to antibiotics,

560
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,013
so I had them test your blood.

561
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,265
Your IgE levels
were through the roof.

562
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,559
Because the lung masses
were an allergic reaction.

563
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,936
So, now that you're
off the antibiotics,

564
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,980
your lungs should
clear right up.

565
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,112
And I brought you something.

566
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,282
Say hello to your tumor. Oh!

567
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,493
Wait.

568
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,440
There are so many things
that I could be afraid of,

569
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,885
and most of the time I manage
to lock them up behind doors.

570
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,138
Then this happens.

571
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,142
All those doors just burst open.

572
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,796
You just figured something out

573
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,364
about your patient, didn't you?

574
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,409
Go. Do what you do.

575
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,209
Take him off the meds.
He's got a staph infection.

576
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,920
You treated him for staph
three days ago. It didn't work.

577
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,589
Bacteria already
in his system responded.

578
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,509
But once a door's been busted
open, more just keep coming.

579
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,720
Oh, he's talking
about an abscess.

580
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,764
I got that.

581
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:47,932
For the cheap seats,

582
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,978
an abscess is a gooey little
cream puff of infection

583
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,980
that probably burst
when your little pride

584
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,940
and homicidal joy
took a hard foul.

585
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,609
It's good news.

586
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,194
If we can find the door.

587
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,450
I think I know where it is.

588
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:11,080
What if these aren't
from skateboarding?

589
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,001
The kid has been
blowing up PVC pipe bombs.

590
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,504
If he got hit by shrapnel, the
body walls off the foreign object,

591
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,048
which, because it's plastic,
doesn't show up on imaging,

592
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,217
and provides
a perfect home for bacteria.

593
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,804
Antibiotics attacked the infection,
causing pieces to break off.

594
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,474
Some hit the liver,
one lodged in his brain

595
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,100
and dissolved when
Foreman touched it.

596
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,644
Once we drain the abscess,
and remove the shrapnel,

597
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,730
the antibiotics
can do their job.

598
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,440
He'll be fine.

599
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,945
Which just leaves,
what are you gonna do now?

600
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:50,119
All right. I put the rest
of the soup in the freezer

601
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,747
so you'll have some for later.

602
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,624
Thanks for everything.

603
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,125
Yeah.

604
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,960
Here you go.
I got it.

605
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,128
Okay.

606
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,089
Are you gonna tell Mom?

607
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,717
So she can show up
here to take care of you

608
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,594
by harassing the housekeeper

609
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,971
and criticizing your bathrobe?

610
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,099
Yeah. I think I'm
gonna wait a few years.

611
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,602
Okay.

612
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,856
Oh, and I moved your sleeping
pills back in the medicine cabinet,

613
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,318
because I just worry. Rachel
always calls them candy.

614
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,540
You took Vicodin.

615
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,671
When you came to my
hospital room that night,

616
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,590
you were stoned.

617
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,643
How did you know?

618
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,567
How did I not know?

619
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,862
How did I make myself forget
for months that you're an addict?

620
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,450
My subconscious
was trying to tell me

621
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,786
you could never get
through this without drugs.

622
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,250
It was a one-time thing.

623
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,168
It's not about the pills, House.

624
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,170
It's about what they mean.

625
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,341
I was scared because I
thought my girlfriend might die.

626
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,551
No.

627
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,804
You don't take Vicodin
because you're scared.

628
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,598
You take it so
you won't feel pain.

629
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,100
Everything you've ever
done is to avoid pain.

630
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,519
Drugs, sarcasm,

631
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,896
keeping everybody at arm's
length so no one can hurt you.

632
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,457
As opposed to everyone
else in the world

633
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,192
who goes looking for pain
like it's buried treasure?

634
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,239
Pain happens when you care.

635
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,827
You can't love someone

636
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,874
without making yourself open
to their problems, their fears.

637
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,085
And you're not
willing to do that.

638
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,296
I came to be with you.

639
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,090
But you weren't
with me, not really.

640
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,011
I wanted to be.

641
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,016
Well, that's not enough.

642
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,231
I can do better.

643
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,739
I don't think you can.

644
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,830
You'll choose yourself over
everybody else, over and over again,

645
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,583
because that's just who you are.

646
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,217
I'm sorry.

647
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,387
No. No, no, no.
Don't. Don't.

648
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,971
I thought I could
do this. Don't.

649
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,682
Please don't.

650
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,480
Goodbye, House.
