1
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,142
Book you
for 9:00 o'clock?

2
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,435
Uh-huh.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,730
Take the day off.
All right.

4
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,664
So, what did you do?

5
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,753
You figured out I was in
jail, but you don't know why?

6
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,671
I've been busy.

7
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,424
Excessive prescribing.

8
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,925
Not that busy.

9
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,928
I know that you pled down
to excessive prescribing.

10
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,182
My question was,
"What did you do?"

11
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,189
Thirty-six-year-old, non-smoking,
junior high science teacher

12
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,274
started coughing blood
in the middle of homeroom.

13
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,278
House says he's gonna be out
for the next three days.

14
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,197
Sweet. If I go straight
to the airport,

15
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,698
I can make Cabo for last call.

16
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,284
He also said to call
him if we find a case.

17
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,762
Which we didn't. MARTHA:
What do you call this?

18
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,122
It could be a case, it could be
nothing. Sadly, we'll just never know.

19
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,124
He's coughing blood.
A lot of people are.

20
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,529
Right now I have
to get to Vernon

21
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,228
while there's still
enough powder to ski on.

22
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:35,423
This is where a lesser man
would make a "black guy skiing" joke.

23
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,384
You owe me a body shot.

24
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,721
Make it fast, I'm driving.

25
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,432
I don't want
to end up in jail, like

26
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,312
a person should who used
their phone illegally while driving.

27
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,898
Thirty-six-year-old
male with hemoptysis, headaches,

28
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,733
chills and chest pain.
Where are you?

29
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,487
On my way to the Greater Schenectady
Chili Cook-Off and Spud Gun Competition.

30
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,781
That's your honeymoon?

31
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,283
Nope. Dominika went to A.C.
with her boyfriend.

32
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,245
ER ruled out bronchitis,
pneumonia and lung cancer.

33
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,747
So, diagnosis boring.
It's epistaxis.

34
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,476
It's a nose bleed. Blood runs into
his lungs, he coughs it back out.

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,811
The flu explains
the rest of the symptoms.

36
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,504
Going once, going twice...

37
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,341
Toxic exposure to ammonia or
sulphites can traumatize the lungs,

38
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,427
cause neuralgias or fevers.

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,429
Fits better because of
his radiating chest pain.

40
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,597
Sold to Masters.

41
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,935
Do a home search for toxins.
Draw cultures for bacteria and fungi.

42
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,856
You're married?

43
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,858
You were gone so long.

44
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,319
Green card.

45
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,031
Thanks for not saying anything.
I just need some time to...

46
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,494
I didn't do it for you. Some
puzzles are just too good to share.

47
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,205
This is my exit.

48
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,131
Chili?

49
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,299
Hate chili.

50
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,217
Love spud guns.

51
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,432
You get nose bleeds?

52
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,808
Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,369
You think that's where
the blood came from?

54
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,562
I don't just
think it, I hope it.

55
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,998
When was the last
time it happened?

56
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,064
At the quarterfinals.

57
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,691
I coach volleyball,

58
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,134
and during warm-ups, I got hit
in the nose a few months ago.

59
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,700
You coach volleyball
in a gym?
Yes.

60
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,243
With showers?
Yes.

61
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,495
Clean showers?

62
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,079
Not particularly.

63
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,599
Blood you were
coughing out wasn't blood.

64
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,042
Dirty gym washroom
means Serratia infection.

65
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,002
Your lungs are full
of red bacteria.

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,214
You're right.
It was an interesting case.

67
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,258
You start him on Levaquin, I'll
start looking for my good flip-flops.

68
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,603
I think that might be blood.

69
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,066
What's this really
all about, House,

70
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,611
as convincing as I find your deep
devotion to vegetable trajectory?

71
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,820
First of all, it's a tuber.

72
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,698
And you're just jealous
because your potato-related plans

73
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,825
are more of the
serving-up-fries variety.

74
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,247
You did time,

75
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,040
means your license Is suspended,

76
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,961
which means your leave of
absence is definitely indefinite.

77
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,964
What exactly are you
going back to?

78
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,134
I'd only have to serve up fries

79
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,928
until the medical board hearing.

80
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,888
I stand corrected.

81
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,100
You obviously have a
rich, full life waiting for you.

82
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,102
I'll slow down the car
and you can roll out.

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,772
I don't even have
a change of clothes.

84
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,982
Damn.

85
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,110
If only I had planned for that.

86
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,621
Okay, here's what I got.

87
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,457
One, you were in jail
for six months,

88
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,126
but you were gone about a year.

89
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,062
Which means that when you
left, you hadn't been arrested.

90
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,840
Two, you enjoy being
known as a number.

91
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,510
You don't want people to know the real
you 'cause you think the real you is weak.

92
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,264
You were running

93
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:16,728
a bleeding heart medical
consulting business for illegals

94
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,605
or some other
sympathetic underclass.

95
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,772
No.

96
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,567
Overclass? This interrogation
thing is getting annoying.

97
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,902
Studies have shown that
un-annoying interrogations,

98
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,154
50% less effective.

99
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,643
Why are you so determined
to bring me to this competition?

100
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,907
Why don't you bring Wilson?

101
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,367
Wilson thinks it's stupid.

102
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,286
I think it's stupid!

103
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,333
Junior year of high
school, you placed fourth

104
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,336
in the West Virginia
All-County Science Fair.

105
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,505
Your project, clean combustion.

106
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,467
Yeah. I also wore a training
bra. Things have changed.

107
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,635
Not that much.

108
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,722
I've been going to this
contest for four years.

109
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,683
And for four years,
I've come second

110
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,103
to a pissant named Harold Lam.

111
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,149
This is serious?

112
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,110
Second!

113
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,282
Okay.

114
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,533
I can help you.

115
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,078
But, I'm going to need to make
a personal stop along the way.

116
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,245
What kind of stop?

117
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,123
Personal. Did I
not mention that?

118
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,062
You gonna tell
me where you were last night?

119
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,587
I ran into a friend.

120
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,216
We had 50 bucks on the Bulls. I
had to eat a large pizza by myself.

121
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,384
You missed me.

122
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,136
Not as much as I missed my $50.

123
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,744
Where'd you meet her?
At the hospital.

124
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,187
If it's Masters, just lie to me.

125
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,190
It's the new CNA
in the third floor.

126
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,567
The redhead? She's hot.

127
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,736
Yeah, and I'm seeing her
again tomorrow night.

128
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,863
I don't know how you do it.

129
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,117
Is it the cute, harmless vibe,
the self-deprecating humor,

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,702
or just straight-up roofies?

131
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,122
If you're interested,
I do seminars.

132
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,021
No electric. No gas,
either. It's cold in here.

133
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,358
The good thing is, I found a guy who
makes you look like a good roommate.

134
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,486
Maybe hoarding's a symptom.

135
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,699
Could be caused by brain
injury, or early onset Alzheimer's.

136
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,367
Most likely
that it's psychological.

137
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,661
As to what's making
him cough blood,

138
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,871
dealer's choice.

139
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,957
Declutter Your Home.
The Hoarder's Handbook.

140
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,625
He's hoarding books on hoarding.

141
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,502
Ugh.

142
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,380
He doesn't have running water.

143
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,132
How does this guy live,

144
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,694
let alone make it to work every
day, and teach a bunch of kids?

145
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,138
Fridge is on. He's hooked it
up to a neighbor or something.

146
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,100
Cat.

147
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,231
I might have to throw up.

148
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,275
He'll wanna keep that, too.

149
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,448
Aspergillosis.

150
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,492
Explains the coughing blood,

151
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,535
and if he's formed
small aspergillomas,

152
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,379
it could explain the
headache and chest pain.

153
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,372
I'll be in the car.

154
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,796
Okay. Turn right.

155
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:36,803
You were writing bogus
prescriptions for medical marijuana.

156
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,016
Please say no because you have to
be an idiot to actually screw that up.

157
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,018
No.

158
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,062
I mean, I was,
but I didn't get caught.

159
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,108
I have to admit, you have one of
the best game faces I've ever seen.

160
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,362
Also one of the best
game bodies.

161
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,614
Pull over.

162
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,285
Just a second.

163
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,623
Didn't know you were
a Jehovah's Witness.

164
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,753
Yeah, the weak lost faith when Christ
didn't return in '75, but I still believe.

165
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,217
So you're really not gonna
tell me what just happened.

166
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,471
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

167
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,403
You broke into my home?

168
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,906
We slowly pushed into your home.

169
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,575
So, what did you find?

170
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,327
A compost heap in your fridge.

171
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,162
We think you have aspergillosis.

172
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,414
It's treatable
with anti-fungals.

173
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,751
You do remarkably well
for living like you live.

174
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,171
I use bottled water
and flashlights.

175
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,756
Just like camping.

176
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,592
Fun.

177
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,155
We're also gonna need
a psych consult.

178
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,345
I'm not a hoarder.

179
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,807
Just a major slob.

180
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,518
You save ear wax.

181
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,527
You know, I'm actually kind of
hurt that you don't know what I did.

182
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,782
I'm not worth bribing a court
official or hacking into police records?

183
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,033
What's the fun in that?

184
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,620
You could've at least hired
Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

185
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,331
Lucas?
Mmm-hmm.

186
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,042
You don't know?

187
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,378
What, is he dead or something?

188
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,380
No.

189
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,803
Actually, until a couple of weeks
ago, I was Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

190
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,890
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

191
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,654
Are you okay?

192
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,490
Yeah, I'm fine.

193
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,868
It's not a big deal.

194
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,214
I killed a man.

195
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,024
Psych eval gave us nothing.

196
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,527
So our patient is just an average
Joe with a 2-foot pile of used Q-tips?

197
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,696
Whatever he is, he
doesn't have aspergillosis.

198
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,573
Pain's intensified
and now he needs oxygen.

199
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,634
There's gotta be all kinds
of toxins in that place.

200
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,927
Exposure issues
don't make sense.

201
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,096
He's been here a full day,
he'd be getting better, not worse.

202
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,665
Unless exposure was
keeping him from getting worse.

203
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,670
Gas was off at his place.
How does he stay warm?

204
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,961
Portable heater?
Or portable gas heater,

205
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,379
which emits carbon monoxide...

206
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,131
Which is a vasodilator.

207
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,800
The low-grade exposure was
actually improving his lung capacity.

208
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,153
We bring him here,
he gets worse.

209
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,929
If we're right, don't need House
and we still get two days off.

210
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,139
Still have to prove it.

211
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,476
Someone's gotta go back
into that place and test for CO.

212
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,020
Chase and I can go.

213
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
It's only fair.

214
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,442
Fairness is important.

215
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,326
You're awfully quiet.

216
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,622
Sorry. It's just how I get around
people who've recently killed a man.

217
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,624
It wasn't...

218
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,810
You know, I've had
a pretty rough year.

219
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,937
Do you think maybe we could
just give this whole thing a rest?

220
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,671
You killed a man!

221
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,967
You pled out to drugs.

222
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,845
Hit and run,
under the influence.

223
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,347
The guy you kneed in the groin

224
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,990
was your date who
dropped a dime on you.

225
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,226
I'm asking you to let it go.

226
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,020
Yeah, I really wish I was the
kind of person who could do that.

227
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,241
Ruby, right?

228
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,867
Yeah.

229
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,702
Hey, how are you liking PPTH?

230
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,663
It's great.
Everyone's so friendly.

231
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,040
Yeah. Especially Dr. Taub.

232
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,337
Don't worry. I'm not gonna bust your
chops. I just wanna know one thing.

233
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,048
How did he get you
to go out with him?

234
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,551
Why? Is there something...

235
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,469
No, no, no. He's great.

236
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,222
You know, I'm just
asking because...

237
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,726
Well, he's...

238
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,771
Um...

239
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,567
You know what? Never mind.
It's none of my business.

240
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,026
You guys have fun tonight.

241
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,361
I'm not seeing him tonight.

242
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,071
We had plans but, he canceled.

243
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,968
This thing's got no fuel valve.

244
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,970
Means you can't
regulate the input.

245
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,056
What is this?
A barbeque lighter?

246
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,563
Your gun sucks.

247
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,576
We should treat
this like an archeological dig.

248
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,288
Grid the site, excavate,
catalog, analyze.

249
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,457
You like it here?

250
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,764
What, you don't think
this is fascinating?

251
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,588
Not nearly as fascinating as the
fact that you think it's fascinating.

252
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,758
But this guy kept everything
he ever came into contact with.

253
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,135
An interactive life history.

254
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,971
It's an indiscriminate
pile of rubbish.

255
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,473
Mmm.

256
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,309
For the most part,
SO are our lives.

257
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,147
There's no carbon monoxide.

258
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,775
A bit of a blow to Foreman's
exposure hypothesis.

259
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,401
And my plan to get
out of here quickly.

260
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,991
Maybe we don't just figure out
the "what," we figure out the "why."

261
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,076
Then, maybe...

262
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,703
From the size
and the undigested seeds,

263
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,581
I'm guessing this
came from a raccoon.

264
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,333
If you're thinking Q fever,

265
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,168
it fits.

266
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,437
So, why are you still looking?

267
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,672
Well, we only found one thing.

268
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,965
And it fits perfectly.

269
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,408
Yeah, but that
doesn't mean it's...

270
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,845
Chase?

271
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,744
You missed
something at his place.

272
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,705
His wife.

273
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Nina.

274
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,267
I didn't know where you were.

275
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,043
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't get home.

276
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,920
You okay?

277
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,006
We think you both have Q fever.

278
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,900
We found raccoon feces
in the kitchen cupboard.

279
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,260
We're gonna start you
on doxycycline.

280
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,112
Why wouldn't you
tell us you're married?

281
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,140
Fewer people who
know about it, the easier it is.

282
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,390
When can I go back?

283
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,477
She gets anxious when
she's away from her things.

284
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,144
She's the hoarder.
He just lives there.

285
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,895
On purpose?

286
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,734
She's my wife.

287
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,045
How do they not have
half-inch drill bits?

288
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,659
By the way, Harold's
probably gonna hit on you.

289
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,872
Everything I have, he wants.
Just turn him down flat.

290
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,540
Unless...
Yes.

291
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,877
Let's stop shopping. I'll just do
him and get him to throw the contest.

292
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,754
I'm not suggest...

293
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,257
Would you do that?

294
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,009
How is this thing judged?

295
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,845
Hang time, distance
and accuracy.

296
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,096
Okay, how about this?

297
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,183
You met a guy in a club, you
brought him home, he ODed.

298
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,560
So, the guy now
writhing on his front porch

299
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,687
was the dealer who
sold you the faulty goods.

300
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,873
Categories weighted the same?

301
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,898
Yup.

302
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,262
Screw accuracy, we're gonna
double distance and hang time.

303
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,610
Beat Harold on points.

304
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,779
We need raw power.
Where's the fertilizer?

305
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,865
By all means, Kaczynski.

306
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,964
Hi.

307
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,633
You and Taub sharing phones now?

308
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,635
He's seeing the
redhead on the third floor.

309
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,864
Please tell me you're not talking
about the hot, new CNA with the dimples.

310
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
She confirmed it.

311
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,893
What she didn't confirm was
her date tonight. He bailed on her.

312
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,205
He's standing her up. He must
have something better going on.

313
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,689
Better than sex with a
22-year-old?

314
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,816
Who's RT-927

315
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,318
Presumably a 21-year-old.

316
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,529
Whoever it is, Taub's meeting
him at my place at 8:00,

317
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,489
which is usually
when I go to the gym.

318
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,534
Guess you'll be
missing spin class.

319
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,667
Okay, contestants.
Field is now open for practice.

320
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,210
You've got one hour.
Have fun.

321
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,713
Schedule 80 PVC is
pressure-rated for 220 psi.

322
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,259
Fuel valve 300. We
can easily push it to 250.

323
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,845
Have your friend, Harold,
peeing in his pants.

324
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,447
Damn.

325
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,992
Be cool.

326
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,924
Harold.

327
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,010
House.

328
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,803
You look good.

329
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,722
I like that jacket on you.

330
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,557
Thanks.

331
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,976
You filled out a little.

332
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,769
Who's the babe?

333
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,317
She's the boot in your ass.

334
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,696
Perhaps you've heard of famed
Russian physicist, Olga Petrovich.

335
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,576
Olga Petrovich is 72-years-old.

336
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,455
And her granddaughter

337
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,208
works in a little
place called JPL.

338
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,461
I did an internship
there last summer.

339
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,839
She killed a man.

340
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,055
I'm guessing she didn't
do it with a spud gun.

341
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,225
Just a bad combustion valve.

342
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,648
Shut up.

343
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,117
On my sofa.

344
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,661
Oh!

345
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,621
Hey.

346
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,835
You remember my wife?

347
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,462
Hi, Eric.

348
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,925
Hey.

349
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,927
RT-92.

350
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,694
I hope you like rhubarb.

351
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,156
We're celebrating.

352
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,033
We're going rogue.

353
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,037
We rip out the combustion
valve, replace it with this,

354
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,916
so there's enough pressure to
blow out at maximum velocity.

355
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,045
Turning the spud into spudnik.

356
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,839
What do we use for discs?

357
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,467
Here's a hint.
I actually hate rhubarb.

358
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,679
Pie tins.

359
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,348
You're a genius.

360
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,104
You know that I'm a doctor?

361
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,274
Any interest I have in the
human body is purely clinical.

362
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,359
Yeah, that line never
works for me, either.

363
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,362
That line always works for you.

364
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,835
So what did you do?

365
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,422
No more guessing?

366
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,923
I need to know.

367
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,848
I could make some phone calls,

368
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,934
see if we can speed up
your medical board hearing.

369
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,686
In the meantime,

370
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,939
no one can stop me
from hiring an assistant.

371
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,371
You were right this morning.

372
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,294
I met a guy at a coffee shop,
we went back to my place,

373
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,922
and he ODed.

374
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,093
Damn.

375
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,137
Could've saved myself
a job offer.

376
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,557
We both acted like idiots.

377
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,768
And I ended up doing time.

378
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,271
Guess he did more.

379
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,954
When we first moved into the
house, we had people over all the time.

380
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,083
And then she just
started collecting things.

381
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,168
I figured it was a hobby.

382
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,921
Piles turned into art projects,

383
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,800
and art projects
turned into what you saw.

384
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,681
So why do you stay?

385
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,436
To everyone else,
the world is full of junk.

386
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,314
Meaningless, ugly,
broken things.

387
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,943
But to Nina, every shape,

388
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,822
every color, texture, smell,

389
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,742
they all tell a story.

390
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,536
They're all worth treasuring.

391
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,329
I wouldn't wish what
she has on anyone,

392
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,915
but every now and then,
I get a glimpse

393
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,376
of what she sees,

394
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,296
and it helps.

395
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,306
Your lungs are
clearing up nicely.

396
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,392
Respiratory rate's
normal, temp's normal.

397
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,228
Looks like you're gonna be fine.

398
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,567
Is she okay?

399
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,570
Something's wrong
with her heart.

400
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,944
The husband is fine, the wife
is worse. She had a heart attack.

401
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,196
Her heart attack could
be from a complication.

402
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,325
Q fever would've caused congestive
heart failure, not myocardial infarction.

403
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,245
So she had Q fever and something
else that causes heart attack?

404
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,872
And the hoarding. Now that
the wife is the only patient,

405
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,123
hoard is back on the board.

406
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,167
Or we were wrong about Q fever.

407
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,603
I don't buy that
it's just a coincidence.

408
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,630
It's not a coincidence.
Diagnosis X caused the hoarding,

409
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,715
which caused the Q fever
when the raccoons came

410
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,384
to spend spring break
at her house.

411
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,135
Now all we have
to do is solve for X.

412
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,180
I remember somebody saying
that hoarding could be a symptom.

413
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,765
We should do an MRI.

414
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,642
Hydrogen sulphide.

415
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,187
It's given off
by eggs and rotting food,

416
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,648
long-term exposure could
cause the pulmonary issues,

417
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,917
- headaches...
- And the heart attack.

418
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,026
Hydrogen sulphide
is also a vasodilator.

419
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,654
Which my crack team
never tested the place for,

420
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,824
whereas half my crack team
never tested the place for people.

421
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,285
So we should
go back. Check it out.

422
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,808
Might be safer to just assume
we're right and start treatment.

423
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:29,332
Go with God.
And some air freshener.

424
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,042
You know, maybe Taub was right,

425
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,419
so I'm gonna stay here with him

426
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,170
and help him with the MRI.

427
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,601
Shine up your spuds, folks.

428
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,312
We're gonna start shooting for
hang time in just a few minutes.

429
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,064
Okay, wind's coming
from the south-east.

430
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,692
So we're gonna have to aim
five degrees to the left.

431
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,694
We're gonna
break 14 seconds. I can feel it.

432
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,907
When I was 10 or 11, my dad
used to take us to this county fair,

433
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,659
and there was this kid.

434
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,203
What?

435
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,872
Who's "us"?

436
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,917
My mom and me.

437
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,339
Your mom, who had
advanced-stage Huntington's.

438
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,719
You have a sibling,
which you've never mentioned.

439
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,264
Why did you slip up now?

440
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,892
Not everything means something.

441
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,603
We're gonna be up soon.
I wanna check the pressure.

442
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,569
You don't wake up in the middle of
the night to cry over a dead stranger.

443
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,405
You don't confess to killing a
man and then hide the details

444
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:47,118
unless the details reveal more
about you than the crime itself.

445
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,704
You pled down to drugs,

446
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,916
you've got a horrible
genetic disease

447
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,086
and a sibling who's
suddenly on your mind.

448
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,133
You euthanized your brother.

449
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,177
And the guy back at
the house was the doctor

450
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,721
who wouldn't help
you cover it up.

451
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,601
Guy back at the house,
he's my cellmate's boyfriend.

452
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,937
He cheated on her
when she was inside.

453
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,483
But I was right
about everything else?

454
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,737
Congratulations.

455
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,381
You're mad.

456
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,341
No.

457
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,802
Actually, I'm impressed.

458
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:50,181
Messing around on a 22-year-old
hottie with your wife, on my sofa.

459
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,742
You're a full-throttle
head case.

460
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,727
I was doing you
a solid with the sofa.

461
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,170
Rachel wanted
to do it in your bed.

462
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,064
You've got the memory foam top.

463
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,691
Let's make this really simple.

464
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,111
If I own it, I don't
want you doing it on it.

465
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,823
You might wanna get
rid of your kitchen table.

466
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,410
Look, I'm sorry.
But it was worth it.

467
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,578
Yeah, I bet.

468
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,597
You get to mess with her
physically and emotionally.

469
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,706
I still care about her.

470
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,000
Not enough to let her
move on with her life.

471
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,005
And while we're talking
about your bad ideas,

472
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,757
MRI is clean.

473
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:29,262
There has to be some kind of
inciting psychological incident.

474
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,264
This is perfect for you.

475
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,975
You get all the human
interaction you crave

476
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,935
without any actual
human interaction.

477
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,354
She was a cheerleader. Hah.

478
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,624
You know, when you're interested
in something and nobody else is,

479
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,567
the polite thing is
to keep it to yourself.

480
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,320
Popular, beautiful, gregarious.

481
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,741
Hydrogen sulphide is about two parts
per billion, the size of a healthy fart.

482
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,538
I'll be back for you in July.

483
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,436
He couldn't do it himself.

484
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,396
He was...

485
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,023
The disease had
progressed too far.

486
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,608
He was flailing,

487
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,195
he didn't have any
control over his own body.

488
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,451
He'd pretty much lost
control of his mind, too,

489
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:39,332
but every once in a while, he
would have a few seconds of lucidity.

490
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,002
He turned to me, and he said,

491
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,171
"It's time."

492
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,592
I hooked up the IV,

493
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,305
I used gloves. I knew
they'd get me on the drugs,

494
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,559
but they couldn't prove
who pushed the plunger.

495
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,116
I put in the needle, and he just

496
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,619
got quiet.

497
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,289
And it was over.

498
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,670
And I was alone.

499
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,843
And one day,
I will be that sick,

500
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,138
and there will be no
one there when it's time.

501
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,080
I didn't expect
compassion from you.

502
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,124
I would've taken commiseration.

503
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,211
Hell, I would've
taken revulsion.

504
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,214
Any emotional engagement at all.

505
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,262
It's no wonder
Cuddy broke up with you.

506
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,539
Folks, Chad Mochrie
just won first place in the Chili Cook-Off.

507
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,794
Congratulations, Chad, that
cocoa powder really did it.

508
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,547
Dumped in a field
in Schenectady. Ouch!

509
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,967
You mind if I make a move?

510
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,792
I know she's out of my league,

511
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,929
but she's at a spud gun
contest with a soon to be

512
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,931
five-time runner-up,

513
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,142
so she's probably got
some self-esteem issues.

514
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,402
You wouldn't.

515
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,315
So?

516
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,734
Warning.

517
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,110
They gave you a warning?

518
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,195
Well, it turns out
our friend, Harold,

519
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,115
felt up the Sheriff's daughter
last night at the potato mash mixer,

520
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,534
so Sheriff's feeling
kind of ambivalent.

521
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,079
You always get
your way, don't you?

522
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,624
Not always.

523
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:15,465
Today would have been
our one-year anniversary.

524
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,550
Hmm.

525
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,512
Which is an incredibly
arbitrary thing to celebrate.

526
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,203
If you want to get to
the bottom of something,

527
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,313
you literally have to
dig down to the bottom.

528
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,232
So, stratigraphically,

529
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,444
the oldest stuff I found
was in the bedroom,

530
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,322
and the oldest stuff in the
bedroom was in the closet.

531
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,949
And at the bottom
of the closet...

532
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,330
Tell me about this.

533
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,380
We have a new
symptom, infertility.

534
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,256
They wanted kids
but couldn't have them.

535
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,550
She started collecting
things to fill the void.

536
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,511
We should run a full
hormone blood panel.

537
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,346
Hey, Harriet the Spy,

538
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,889
before you get
too full of yourself,

539
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,808
you might want
to go back to Bio 101.

540
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,476
It takes two to not tango.

541
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,895
Hubby could be shooting blanks.

542
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,565
So, either it's a new symptom
that will help us save her life,

543
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,929
or it's a complete
waste of time.

544
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,904
Figure out which is fried,
the bacon or the eggs.

545
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,406
I'll start the hormone work-up.

546
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,783
There's another option.

547
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,785
House,
who's that? Radio.

548
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,204
Sounded a lot like Thirteen.

549
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,914
It's a Thirteen tribute band,

550
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,583
with their new song, I Got A
Better Theory Than Masters.

551
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,293
She said they never had kids.

552
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,545
Oh, my God.

553
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,838
Where the hell have you been?

554
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,464
I think we've all got something

555
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,383
a little more important
to worry about than...

556
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,302
No, we don't.
She's been missing for a year.

557
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,930
And you can ask her all about it
when she comes in on Monday.

558
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,057
Monday? This Monday?

559
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,517
Can I talk?

560
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,812
She said they never had kids,
and you all jumped to infertility.

561
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,648
You never considered
the other option.

562
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,823
And the bitch is back.

563
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,249
We think you have
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

564
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,043
It would explain the symptoms.

565
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,881
It also causes miscarriages.

566
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,304
Is that something you
think you might have?

567
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,276
Were you pregnant?

568
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,781
Three times.

569
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,872
The miscarriages
trigger the hoarding.

570
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,209
Hoarding eventually
made you sick, too.

571
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,754
Can you cure her?

572
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,883
We can treat the physical
symptoms as they arise,

573
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,968
make her life a lot better,

574
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,179
but the hoarding,

575
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,557
we're the wrong kind of doctors.

576
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,188
You lied to me?

577
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,857
For nine years?

578
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,445
I was so afraid of losing you.

579
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,410
What have I ever done
to make you afraid of that?

580
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,418
I need to get some air.

581
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,521
I've been selfish.

582
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:03,067
I need to let you move on.

583
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,738
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

584
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,324
No.

585
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,995
I just want you to be...

586
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,746
The last time
you got all noble on me,

587
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,332
we ended up dividing our dishes.

588
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,459
This time, I want
to make the decision.

589
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,504
You don't feel weird about this?

590
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,465
Of course I feel
weird about this.

591
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,093
It's confusing, and messy,

592
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,722
and dirty, dumb.

593
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,891
But we spent our whole lives trying
to do everything right, and it sucked.

594
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,059
Wasn't all bad.

595
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,185
It sucked, Chris.

596
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:43,024
And this, whatever it is,

597
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,067
it's fun.

598
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:50,031
So, I'm not taking
advantage of you?

599
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,742
The fun is fading.

600
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,662
You know,

601
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,167
there's something
seriously wrong with us.

602
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,420
I know.

603
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,562
Home sweet home.

604
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,527
You owe me 87 bucks for gas.

605
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,498
I'll kill you.

606
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,879
When the time comes,
if you want me to.

607
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,969
I'd do it now if you like.

608
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,763
Yeah. I've got a
baseball bat in the back.

609
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,988
I'll see you Monday.
