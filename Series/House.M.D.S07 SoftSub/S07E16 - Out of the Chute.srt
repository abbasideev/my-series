1
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,254
One. Don't tense
up now, go with him.

2
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,428
Two. That's it stay in rhythm.

3
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,518
Three. What are you doing,
Lane? You're tipping in.

4
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,315
Four. What's your problem? Get
your ass down. Get back in the middle.

5
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,947
Five. You're weak, you've got
all kinds of daylight under you.

6
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,494
Six. Damn, Lane, you
should be schooling this bull.

7
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,126
Seven. Get up, set your hips
before the kick comes down.

8
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,131
Nice recovery.

9
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,717
Now, just wait till he turns
back away from your hand.

10
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,406
Whoo!

11
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,039
Lane! Lane!

12
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,460
What the hell just happened?

13
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,004
I was about to
ask you the same thing.

14
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,045
I'm fine.

15
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,631
Okay.

16
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,634
I assume Cuddy told you
that she dumped me?

17
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,844
She did.

18
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,262
And that I'm back on Vicodin.

19
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,473
She told me you had
taken a Vicodin.

20
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,642
And then I took a lot more.

21
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,227
And so on.

22
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,188
But you're fine.

23
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,523
Well, I'm not fine as in fine,

24
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,109
but I'm fine as in you don't
have to worry about me.

25
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,628
Because you cleared out
your bank account,

26
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,280
checked into a hotel and
started back on Vicodin.

27
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,033
Because I'm going to be fine,
as in fine, very soon.

28
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,537
Until that happens,
are you sure Vicodin is...

29
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,663
My leg hurts.

30
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,040
You've been able
to handle the pain.

31
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,167
It's gotten worse.

32
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,418
Not physically worse.

33
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,837
Worse is worse.
Pain doesn't discriminate.

34
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,922
Neither do the pills.

35
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,592
The Vicodin and
the five-star pampering

36
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,319
that I'm going to get
over the next few days

37
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,887
should be enough to
get me through it.

38
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,650
So, you don't want to
just avoid the issue.

39
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,432
You want to avoid
avoiding the issue.

40
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,600
Sorry.

41
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,311
Nothing is either as bad or as
good as we think it is at the time.

42
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,522
It's why T.O. mocks his opponents
immediately after scoring.

43
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,166
He doesn't wait till
his friend shows up

44
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,832
the next day to
tell him to deal with it.

45
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,695
Two weeks from now,

46
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,198
maybe a little more,
maybe a little less,

47
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,159
my life will be back to its
usual level of crappiness.

48
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,442
Till then, the only real issue

49
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,246
is how much I'm going
to spend on hotel charges.

50
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,334
Good morning, sir. I've got
your deluxe breakfast for two.

51
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,169
Do I have to count
the strawberries?

52
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,838
Don't worry, you
can trust me with anything.

53
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,381
Including your food.

54
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,717
After he and I have sex,

55
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,929
I'm going to slit his throat and
then disembowel him in the bathtub.

56
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,139
No problem, I'll cancel
the morning maid service.

57
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,783
Would you like me to
have them clean up later

58
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,434
when they come to
turn down your bed?

59
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,145
Why didn't I meet you
six months ago?

60
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,522
Thank you very much.

61
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,041
And if there's
anything else I can do

62
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,459
to make your stay here
more enjoyable,

63
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,861
just ring the concierge
and ask for Carnell.

64
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,365
Eat fast.

65
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
We're expecting company.

66
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,662
Okay, this might not be
such a bad idea.

67
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,253
What do you think
he meant by "anything"?

68
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,424
Take some time
for yourself, relax.

69
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,094
I know it's a figure of speech,

70
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,013
but he really did seem
to underline the "anything".

71
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,349
Maybe, talk to someone?

72
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,934
Already scheduled.

73
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,436
Really?

74
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,399
I'm not an idiot.
I know I need help.

75
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,861
Okay, that's great.

76
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,408
I meant like a counselor.

77
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,951
I know.

78
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,328
But you meant a hooker.

79
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,454
Yeah.

80
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,708
Baby steps.

81
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,545
House screwed us.

82
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,965
Ten years of doctors
cobbling him back together.

83
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,675
Metal rods in every limb,

84
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,553
pin stabilizing his spine,
five screws,

85
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,722
and a titanium plate
in his skull.

86
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,183
Can't do MRIs, X-rays are
probably going to be useless as well.

87
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,267
Every piece of metal
is going to obscure something.

88
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,729
And House isn't sick.

89
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,896
Why would you say that?

90
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,400
Cuddy dumped House. He's out
somewhere expecting us to indulge him

91
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,569
while he ignores his job
and licks his wounds.

92
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,737
Cuddy dumped him?

93
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,156
Don't do that,
don't get sucked in.

94
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,365
He loves her!

95
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,302
What, you can't feel bad
for him for five minutes?

96
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,368
I can feel bad for him

97
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,330
while still expecting him to act
like an adult, show up for work

98
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,708
and not go on a booze,
Vicodin, and hooker-filled bender.

99
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,186
Which is why for now, we're going
to handle the case without him.

100
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,629
Oh! Is that
the reason?

101
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,316
I thought it was because you can't
pass up any chance to seize control.

102
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,980
I said "we'", you want
pretty please, too?

103
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,720
Wait, I understand the booze
and the hookers, but why Vicodin?

104
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,557
Wow, you really don't have
any friends in here, do you?

105
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,894
House is a Vicodin addict.

106
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,562
He's been clean for two years.

107
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,522
He's used here at work?

108
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,524
Yes, that is very troubling.

109
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,210
Almost as much as
the fact that our patient

110
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,695
has a ruptured diaphragm,
cracked sternum, broken nose,

111
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,863
and partial hearing loss,

112
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,799
which can be explained
by a bull jumping on him.

113
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,284
And a neurological disorder,
low-grade fever,

114
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,370
nausea, and peripheral
muscle weakness that can't.

115
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,705
What if the hearing loss
wasn't caused by the bull?

116
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,029
That's just when he noticed it.

117
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,751
Inner ear pathology
can affect the equilibrium

118
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,002
and cause disorientation.

119
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,421
Making it appear to be
a neurological disorder.

120
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,923
So how do we confirm?

121
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,925
CT is just going to show us
the plate and screws

122
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,093
holding his skull together.

123
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,136
We can do calories and an ENG.

124
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,722
If he has inner ear damage,
it'll affect his balance.

125
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,641
Sounds good, go ahead.

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,726
Go ahead?
Really?

127
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,645
What if one of us disagrees?

128
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,277
I happen to agree
with Foreman. Go do it.

129
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,739
You knew he was an addict
before you got involved.

130
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,157
Didn't end the relationship...

131
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,343
You knew he was an ass before...

132
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,410
I didn't end it...

133
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,121
You told him you did
not want him to change.

134
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,707
And I was wrong.
You don't know that!

135
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,543
You thought you
were going to die.

136
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,171
Do you really think that was the
right time to make this kind of decision?

137
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,589
No.

138
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,924
But I thought about it.

139
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,592
A lot.

140
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,722
I haven't changed my mind.

141
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,351
He thought you
were going to die.

142
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,147
Nobody knows the right way
to react in that situation.

143
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,441
Just give him another chance.

144
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,276
He deserves it.

145
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,945
I know.

146
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,782
But this isn't about
what he deserves.

147
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,330
When things go wrong, I don't
want to hope that I'm not alone,

148
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,082
I want to know it.

149
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,959
With House,

150
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,422
every time I needed
him to step up...

151
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,259
It's just never
going to be that!

152
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,054
It's not his fault, it's who
he is. I should've known it.

153
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,182
This is my fault.

154
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,900
Well, he's back on Vicodin.

155
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,777
So you might want

156
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,614
to keep an eye on
his new patient.

157
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,038
ENG was normal,
means his inner ear is...

158
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,164
Morons.

159
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,916
It wasn't...
Whoa, wait a sec.

160
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,001
The acoustics in here
are beautiful.

161
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,212
Morons!

162
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,839
You say it.

163
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,299
Morons.

164
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,801
Who was that?

165
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,219
Something Carnell got me.

166
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,970
It wasn't that
ridiculous of a theory.

167
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,096
Great theory.

168
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,723
It's a ridiculous test.

169
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,644
You can't give a standard
balance test to a champion bull rider.

170
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,980
If you're going to test Superman's
strength, you need a bigger barbell.

171
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,816
Find one, make him
lift it, then call me,

172
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,193
and tell me how high it got.

173
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,863
And tell Cuddy that
spying is for cowards.

174
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,285
Just keep me posted.

175
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,912
I will.
I will.

176
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,291
You said my inner ear was fine.

177
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,210
Previous test was
for regular people.

178
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,021
You were banged up
pretty bad in the accident,

179
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,463
but given your
athletic ability...

180
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,383
Wasn't no accident. That bull
had malice and forethought.

181
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,261
Ah... You mean afterthought.

182
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,346
Whatever, he was pissed.

183
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,472
Can you blame him?

184
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,765
Not at all.

185
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,284
If he don't do
what he gets paid for,

186
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,744
I don't get to do
what I get paid for.

187
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,854
Ever think of getting paid
for doing something else?

188
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,373
You're running out
of bones to break.

189
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,858
You ever think of doing
something you don't love?

190
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,777
It has its downside,
but everything does.

191
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,531
There ain't nothing
like those eight seconds.

192
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,092
And traveling around
getting to meet the fans,

193
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,743
that ain't so bad either,
if you know what I mean.

194
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,079
All right, now what?

195
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,598
We're going
to start rocking the platform

196
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,583
and changing your visual field

197
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,459
while you balance on
just your right leg.

198
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,003
Here you go, Lane.

199
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,298
I'm going to start slow.

200
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,134
If you start to experience
any nausea, disorientation,

201
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,817
just let us know and
we'll stop the test.

202
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,970
You got it.

203
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,144
Whoa.

204
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,277
That is amazing.

205
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,576
We can stop. There's obviously
nothing wrong with his inner ear.

206
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,330
Now what?

207
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,875
And I direct that
question not to my boss,

208
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,627
but to anyone who has an answer.

209
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,921
If it's not in his ear,
it's got to be his brain.

210
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,316
But if we can't get any
images, then how do we...

211
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,967
You guys got some rusty pipes.

212
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,053
This water's brown.

213
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,222
That's not from the pipes.

214
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,475
It's from your mouth.

215
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,076
Can you pass me the...

216
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,707
What took you so long?

217
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,191
There's
nothing wrong with his ears,

218
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,585
but he's got
blood in his sputum.

219
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,295
Doesn't answer the question.

220
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,421
We weren't avoiding you.

221
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,524
It took us a little time to
think up a diagnostic test

222
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,175
no one's ever thought up before.

223
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,343
Apology accepted.

224
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,095
It could be a tumor
in a salivary gland.

225
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,763
We should get a parotid biopsy.

226
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,556
Aww! That's so cute.

227
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,642
You're fighting
over who's in charge.

228
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,436
GI bleed's more likely to
explain the nausea and weakness.

229
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,646
Who's in charge?

230
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,873
House, as
long as you're not here,

231
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,041
someone has to have the final...

232
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,108
Let me rephrase.

233
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,235
- Who's your daddy?
- Let me rephrase.

234
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,546
You have to decide if you're
going to buck up, get out of bed

235
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,031
and do your job, or if you're
going to wallow in self-pity.

236
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,492
Those my only two choices?

237
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,578
Or can I also point out the
self-pity coming from you?

238
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,099
You're just annoyed because
when your relationship ended,

239
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,083
no one gave a crap,
including you.

240
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,127
That is not true
in SO many ways.

241
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,504
And Chase? Stop
screwing with Foreman.

242
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,922
And Foreman? No.

243
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,841
Until the telephone
gets un-invented,

244
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,902
no one in that room needs
more authority than I give them.

245
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,845
And right now, I
give you the authority

246
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,305
to scope his GI tract
and biopsy his parotid,

247
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,474
then you can
pick up the phone...

248
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,310
House, should we be
more worried about you?

249
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,937
Are you on Vicodin?

250
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,773
Because if you are, you probably
shouldn't be ordering procedures.

251
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,655
I am not on Vicodin.

252
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,699
Do the tests.

253
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,410
I have to see a man
about a hurdy gurdy.

254
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,833
You really think
House isn't using Vicodin?

255
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,668
Does it actually worry you?

256
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,628
If he's self-prescribing meds,

257
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,005
that could affect his judgment.

258
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,506
And does that worry you?

259
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,216
Are you being sarcastic?

260
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,844
If his rule-breaking
is affecting his judgment,

261
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,596
then you can step in,
then you can worry.

262
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,848
But if he's just
coming up with ideas

263
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,059
that we haven't thought of
but we should have,

264
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,519
then our job is to
shut up and do it.

265
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,855
And what do you see in this guy?

266
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,857
Hmm? What? Who?

267
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,029
Oh. You think I'm
attracted to our patient.

268
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,532
Right. It's against the
rules. So, you wouldn't do it.

269
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,578
He's a macho half-wit.

270
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,514
You have every reason
to not be attracted to him,

271
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,165
which is why I ask the question,

272
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,250
why are you attracted to him?

273
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,460
Stop it.
I'm just...

274
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,545
No, no, no, take out the
scope. I don't see any...

275
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,067
No, not the monitor,
look at his eyes.

276
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,096
Sclerae turned yellow. Did x-rays,

277
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,531
looks like there's
a mass in his liver,

278
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,100
but the conductive metal rod
in his ribs is blocking it.

279
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,310
Making it, as they say,

280
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,814
as tough to find as a hooker
who can play the hurdy gurdy.

281
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,291
If you have a point,
can you please...

282
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,358
It's an expression.

283
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,984
Means it's tough,

284
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,903
but apparently it can be done.

285
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,196
We don't have any equipment.

286
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,322
You have eyes.

287
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,032
Not that see through stuff.

288
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,158
Obviously.

289
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,244
You want us to cut him open?

290
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,830
Only if you want to see
what's wrong with him.

291
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,544
Do you know Free Bird?

292
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,302
Do you see what I see?

293
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,470
No.

294
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,514
Exactly.

295
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,392
More suction.

296
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,228
That's impossible.

297
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,232
I definitely saw
a mass in the x-rays.

298
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,859
It's gone now.

299
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,072
It's a mass,

300
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,492
and then it's not.

301
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,245
You, uh, going to introduce us?

302
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,332
Team, meet Duke.

303
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,917
Anke.

304
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,003
Anke?

305
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,379
How'd I get Duke?

306
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,090
House, how many
prostitutes have you had?

307
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,508
As in, eaten?

308
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,677
Ever? This year?

309
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,263
Slept with since
you've been here.

310
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,764
All but one.

311
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,932
She did my taxes.

312
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,435
On the other hand,

313
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,371
tape worm that burrowed
outside his intestinal...

314
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,274
We would've seen eggs on a
faecal smear or systemic eosinophilia.

315
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,318
Detached cysts?

316
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,195
Couldn't migrate that far
in one hour.

317
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,678
We haven't been
sitting on our hands

318
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,656
just waiting for your
brilliance to kick in.

319
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,159
Okay, so how did you shoot down

320
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,620
intermittently
swollen lymph node?

321
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,602
That would mean
it's some kind of infection,

322
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,544
which would mean we'd
have to do a spinal tap.

323
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,797
But with his recent skull
fractures, it could be increased ICP.

324
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,382
His brain could herniate.

325
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,092
What about
a ventricular puncture?

326
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,220
Sounds good.

327
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,473
You think sticking a needle
directly into his brain

328
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,808
would be less dangerous
than sticking it in his spine?

329
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,227
It's probably a push.

330
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,746
I'm just trying to
get you out of here

331
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,648
because underneath this
sheet, stuff is going on.

332
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,456
Just pick a spot and
stick a needle in it.

333
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,740
You want to drill
through my skull

334
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,326
because of a mass
that's not there?

335
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,662
It was there, which
means something is wrong.

336
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,080
We need to find it.

337
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,249
Is there anybody
you'd like us to call?

338
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,711
Someone that you'd like to be here
with you, maybe a wife or girlfriend?

339
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,713
No, my family's
all back in Oklahoma.

340
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,300
And the guys in the circuit
are in Calgary at the next rodeo.

341
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,135
Ah! That's too bad.

342
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:20,182
It's nice to have somebody
nearby you can talk to who cares.

343
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,479
You okay?
Hmm?

344
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,648
I'm just saying,
it's good to have

345
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,818
somebody nearby
to talk to, who cares.

346
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,861
Okay, fine, I like him. So what?

347
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,155
No kidding. I just
can't figure out why.

348
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,908
Neither can I.

349
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,330
Looks clear, nothing
to suggest inflammation.

350
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,417
Something's wrong.

351
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,545
02 sats are plummeting. We
need to intubate. Drop the table.

352
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,344
I can't get it in!

353
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,988
The airway's blocked.
Get the trach Kit.

354
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,867
02 are going back up.

355
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,744
What's that smell?

356
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,620
Did he defecate?

357
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,876
Doesn't look like it.

358
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,086
I think it's his feet.

359
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,798
Oh.

360
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,633
Oh, man.

361
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,760
Oh.

362
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,430
Oh, it's definitely his feet.

363
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,642
Please, don't.

364
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,813
That is a nice bow.

365
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,274
That was a nice door.

366
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,609
Put it on my tab.

367
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,446
What say we take it up a notch?

368
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,323
Yeah,
right. Very funny.

369
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,908
You don't trust me?

370
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,159
No!

371
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,994
I'll do it!

372
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,664
And we have a gamer.

373
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,501
Oh, come on, man.
You can't be serious.

374
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,627
Why not?

375
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,046
Anything goes wrong,
we just take her to the doctor.

376
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,881
And I'm only eight paces away.

377
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,633
House...
I like you, Carnell.

378
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,301
Don't ruin it.

379
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:25,724
Stinky feet, could point to
diabetes, athlete's foot or gangrene.

380
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,142
- Pick one.
- No!

381
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,977
None.

382
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,855
None of those cause bloody
sputum or disappearing masses.

383
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,024
No, no, no! No!

384
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,609
You're going to kill her.

385
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,319
Don't do that, Carnell.

386
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,863
They might get the idea
that I'm shooting at a hooker.

387
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,163
Fungal infection cause
ulceration between the toes.

388
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,290
Bleeding can be from
recurring abscesses

389
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,042
that appear to be
recurring masses.

390
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,420
Symptoms in the head or feet
mean the infection

391
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,630
would have to be in
the heart or the brain.

392
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,382
I say we start
by looking in the heart

393
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,385
because looking at his brain
with a metal plate is problematic.

394
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,886
So is MRI-ing his heart.

395
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,181
He's got a seven centimeter conductive
metal rod holding his rib together.

396
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,766
- It'll rip him in two.
- No,

397
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,854
it'll just feel like it's ripping
him in two, which is much better.

398
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,399
We could minimize the damage by injecting
ice-water into his abdominal cavity.

399
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,985
No! Please, no!

400
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,911
Oh, God!

401
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,329
Oops.

402
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,706
Got to go.

403
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,917
Call an ambulance!

404
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,209
Why?

405
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,587
What do you mean, why!

406
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,380
She's hurt!
She doesn't look hurt.

407
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,721
No, you didn't.

408
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,972
Yes, we did.

409
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,605
You're an ass.

410
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,233
Okay, go get me
General Patton's Colt .45.

411
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,818
The one with the two notches.

412
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,445
He's not getting you a gun.

413
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,158
Your friend knows how
to have a good time.

414
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,706
The MRI magnets are
going to heat the metal.

415
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,209
It could get to over 300
degrees in 15 seconds.

416
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,630
Which is why we're injecting
ice-water into your abdominal cavity.

417
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,216
You'll
feel colder than you've ever felt.

418
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,927
And then you'll be hotter...

419
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,430
You'll feel hotter
than you've ever felt.

420
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,602
We'll try to be
as quick as possible.

421
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,314
Why...
Shut up.

422
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,116
It's interesting.

423
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,201
No, it's not.

424
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,411
It's mundane and simple.

425
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,829
He's obviously

426
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,125
a very blessed specimen, so
from an evolutionary point of view,

427
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,877
he'd produce healthy off-spring.

428
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:03,131
So my pre-frontal cortex is telling
me I should have sex with him.

429
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,424
Oh. Is that all?

430
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,636
Yes. My rational brain knows
he's a hillbilly and an idiot.

431
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,889
And yet somehow your rational
brain is losing the argument.

432
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,391
Which is interesting.

433
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,602
You were bored.

434
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:19,356
You must have spent about
two days setting up a fake murder,

435
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,816
and you were bored.

436
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,068
I'm fine.

437
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,194
You're not.

438
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,823
And I'm worried you might
do something even stupider.

439
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,267
Why don't you
move back in with me?

440
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,494
At least until you
get back on track.

441
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,080
What an ego.

442
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,500
You think you're some sort of
emotional paragon, you're my rock.

443
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,085
I'm trying to be a friend.

444
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:44,548
At least I had the good sense not to
marry every woman I fall into bed with.

445
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,508
Maybe you should
move in with me.

446
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,176
Either way, if you prefer...

447
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,012
I prefer you to stop
talking about this.

448
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,055
House, we haven't even
started talking about this,

449
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,783
except to establish
the fact that you're fine,

450
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,975
which clearly you aren't.

451
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,852
Leave me alone!

452
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,524
No.

453
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,568
We are going to talk about this,

454
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,029
and we're going
to deal with this.

455
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,866
So I have no choice.

456
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,368
Fine.

457
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,038
Unless...

458
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,206
Unless...

459
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,541
Yes!

460
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,044
I do! I do have legs!

461
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,466
I see you didn't factor those
into your brilliant plan.

462
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,144
Lane, can you try to hold still?

463
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,562
I'm trying.

464
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,439
Real hard.

465
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,277
Guy is tough,
I'll give him that.

466
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,614
My pre-frontal cortex
is a little aroused.

467
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,032
Just get the damn picture.

468
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,575
Rib temp is at 158.

469
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,555
I don't have a clear
view of his aorta yet.

470
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,219
This isn't going to work,
we have to stop.

471
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,833
No, you're trying to protect
him instead of trying to save him.

472
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,628
He's smoking!

473
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,129
Literally. You ass!

474
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,756
Five more seconds.
No!

475
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,692
Getting a good image
isn't going to mean anything

476
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,343
if he doesn't have a rib cage.

477
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,096
Got it!

478
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,028
The images,

479
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,989
they're normal.

480
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,053
You're going to have to
talk to him eventually.

481
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,472
He needs you.

482
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,352
I love him.

483
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,147
And I know he loves me.

484
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,274
But I just can't...

485
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,484
He needs you in his life.

486
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,321
Even if you're not sleeping
with him, he needs you.

487
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,326
Without you... You
can't go backwards.

488
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,749
I can't fix his problem.

489
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,337
I am his problem.

490
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:47,272
If the infection is not in
his heart, it's in his brain.

491
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,274
You're in my sun.

492
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,400
Do a CT.

493
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,236
We can't. He has a titanium
plate and a bunch of metal screws.

494
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,362
Get rid of them.

495
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,364
His skull has multiple
hair-line fractures.

496
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,200
Removing the metal plate
will be like

497
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,578
removing half an eggshell
without cracking the rest of the shell.

498
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,581
And not removing the plate will
be like leaving the egg out to rot.

499
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,209
We can't cut off the top of his
head based on a few symptoms

500
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,712
that disappear whenever
we try to test for them.

501
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,384
What if the one symptom
that hasn't disappeared,

502
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,762
was never actually there.

503
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,181
Any delays when he
answers questions?

504
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,352
He doesn't have
partial hearing loss,

505
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,938
he's missing moments.

506
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,856
He reported
having something like

507
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,108
a complex partial seizure
during the bull ride.

508
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,420
He said it hadn't happened
since, but what if he's wrong?

509
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,755
What if the infection
in the brain

510
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,048
is causing it to
happen all the time?

511
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,699
His EEG didn't show
any sign of seizure activity.

512
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,261
I didn't say it was a seizure, I
said it was something like a seizure.

513
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,263
I'm guessing you're about
to tell us we need to find

514
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,747
something like
an EEG to prove...

515
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,250
Nope. Because
I already got one.

516
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,337
You want me to sing?

517
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,923
How's singing My Bonnie going
to help you see inside my brain?

518
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,049
It won't.

519
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,845
This is going to prove that
we need to cut into your skull.

520
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,513
Which is going to be
kind of dangerous,

521
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,932
So you've got a real incentive
to sing like an angel.

522
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,655
We think you're having mini
black-outs, but your brain compensates.

523
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,979
It can't compensate
if there's a pre-set rhythm.

524
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,861
One, two, three.

525
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,447
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

526
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,199
My Bonnie lies

527
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,910
over the sea

528
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,745
My Bonnie

529
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,665
lies over the ocean

530
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,501
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me

531
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,212
See? Told you.

532
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,382
Lane, that wasn't even close.

533
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,346
That was brilliant.

534
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,141
Yeah.

535
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,826
It's understandable.

536
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,415
I hate when you do that.

537
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,959
You respond to what
you think I'm thinking

538
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,795
because you think that
I think like you do.

539
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,339
It's insulting and annoying.

540
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,927
You're scared because
nothing excites you.

541
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,179
Fun doesn't excite you.

542
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,056
Puzzles don't excite you.

543
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,933
What's left?

544
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,602
And I was saying, you're right.

545
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,689
You're upset, you're depressed.

546
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,068
Everything's going to taste
a little worse right now,

547
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,070
but it'll pass.

548
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,782
It's understandable.

549
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,785
You're scared because
you think I'm falling apart,

550
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,914
and you're trying to convince
yourself that you're overreacting.

551
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,876
Keeps ringing.

552
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,379
Yeah.

553
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,422
House, there's no infection
in this guy's brain.

554
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,924
CT's clean.

555
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,926
Well, that sucks.

556
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,263
Now we're going to
have to blow up his heart.

557
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,726
We're not blowing up his heart
because we've ruled out his heart.

558
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,146
MRI and transesophageal echo
reveal no swelling, no masses,

559
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,232
no vegetation,
no sign of anything.

560
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,154
Because we're
looking the wrong way.

561
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,448
There's an imperfection.

562
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,075
How do you find where?

563
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,452
I don't know, I'd get
a magnifying glass...

564
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,787
You suck.

565
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,707
Feel free to interpret
that both ways.

566
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,210
You suck on the straw,
see where the drink leaks.

567
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,053
So you're saying
we put pressure on his aorta

568
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,839
until it rips open?

569
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,549
You do realize
the downside of that?

570
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,136
If we don't rip it, the
damage from the infection will.

571
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,263
Probably not when he's got
his chest open in an OR

572
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,306
where it can be repaired
inside the 60 seconds

573
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,100
it'll take him
to bleed to death.

574
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,019
It's a ridiculous idea,
it won't work.

575
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,311
If you don't mind,

576
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,314
I have to go get this guy's
approval to rip his heart open.

577
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,704
Hey.

578
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,459
We think you have
a Bartonella infection,

579
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,046
which caused a mycotic
aneurysm in your aortic wall.

580
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,632
We need to find it, which means
we need to blow up your heart.

581
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,386
And yes, I'm as
serious as a heart attack.

582
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,555
We're going to increase
your blood pressure

583
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,017
until the weak spot in
your aortic wall explodes.

584
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,770
Hopefully we'll be able to fix
it before you bleed to death.

585
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,563
Any questions?

586
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,108
No.

587
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,861
Really?

588
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,990
You don't even want to know if
you'll be able to go back to bull riding?

589
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,450
I assume no.

590
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,494
I mean, you've already
cracked open my skull,

591
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,370
and now you're going to
blow up my heart.

592
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,334
I thought you loved
those eight seconds.

593
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,092
I do.

594
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,720
And now you're telling me

595
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,806
that I got to give them up.

596
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,395
I can always find
something else to love.

597
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,401
House.

598
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,531
We need to talk.

599
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,335
You didn't expect me to say yes

600
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,045
to rupturing his aorta, did you?

601
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,715
Since I didn't ask, I wasn't
expecting you to say anything at all.

602
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,844
You have no reason to believe
this will save his life.

603
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,011
Really?

604
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,097
No reason.
None at all.

605
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,820
I'm just planning on cracking
open his chest, blowing up his heart,

606
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,018
what, to pad his bill?

607
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,021
Or you think that since you
broke my heart I want to break his?

608
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,316
I don't know.

609
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:11,072
I think maybe you're looking
for something that can excite you,

610
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,741
fill a void.

611
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,119
And it's affecting
your judgment.

612
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,039
You're right, I am.

613
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,418
But my damaged, depressed,
drug-addled judgment

614
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,421
is still better than yours or
any other doctor in this hospital.

615
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,257
And my team is going to do
this procedure and save his life.

616
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,926
So, you can either have
security arrest me and my team,

617
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,970
or you can get
the hell out of my way.

618
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,391
And she caves.

619
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,571
Rib spreader in place.

620
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,864
Heart looks good.

621
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,699
Aorta is exposed.

622
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,501
I take it you ratted
me out to Cuddy?

623
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,298
I think your
judgment is compromised.

624
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,508
No, you don't.

625
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,012
Come on, I got a
squash game at 2:00.

626
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,597
Let's give this cowboy a ride.

627
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,432
If I inject more,
there won't be any room

628
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,435
for the blood to go through
the rest of his body.

629
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,478
You're right.

630
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,856
Just make damn sure we don't damage
his toes while we blow up his heart.

631
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,287
No bubbles,
no bruising, no gaps.

632
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,622
It's not working.

633
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,209
Yes, it is.

634
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,714
I was wrong.

635
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,425
Not yet.

636
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,320
Let's switch him
over to bypass for debridement.

637
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,637
Come on, we don't
have much time.

638
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,013
Slow the heart down.

639
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,139
Damn.

640
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,643
You can't clamp
the aorta at this pressure,

641
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,954
even if we can see
through all the blood.

642
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,938
Do it anyway. We
need suction and more sponges.

643
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,650
The leak is too fast.

644
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,318
No, it's not, we can fix this.

645
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,264
It worked.

646
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,103
House, it worked!

647
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,107
I heard you.

648
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,852
Hey!

649
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,605
I'm awake, so I guess it worked.

650
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,692
As long as you don't get
your heart rate too high.

651
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,821
You probably shouldn't
have sex for a while.

652
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,616
I'll keep that in mind.

653
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,705
Want to hang out,
see your ranch some time?

654
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,625
Uh.

655
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,925
That'd probably be inappropriate

656
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,303
because I'm your doctor,
and everything.

657
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,936
Good luck with everything.

658
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,447
It...

659
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,913
Double Scotch,

660
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,289
doubled.

661
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,708
Blended, single
malt, any preference?

662
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,293
No.

663
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,885
Yeah, sorry about the noise.
I guess their team won.

664
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,347
Although, I got to tell you,

665
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,892
sometimes I wish I could still act
like that, you know? Just let loose?

666
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,693
I guess it's a little easier,
though, when you got no troubles.

667
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,820
Parents still paying your bills.

668
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,656
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

669
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,666
No!

670
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,965
Cannonball!

671
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,177
What the hell are you doing?

672
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,554
What do you do when you win?

673
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,431
Party!

674
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,682
What do you do when you lose?

675
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,726
Party harder!
