1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,170
Damn it.
I waited too long.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,713
Please, come on, do something.

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,256
Come on, do something!
Do something!

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,507
Couldn't have saved her.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,182
It's your choice if
you want to go back on drugs.

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,895
You think I can fix myself?

7
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,690
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

8
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,255
Let me see.

9
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,643
It's okay.

10
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,065
It's gonna get infected.

11
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,006
Hey, you're not gonna...

12
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,676
You are.

13
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,065
Don't... Don't... It's okay.

14
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,985
I love you.

15
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,159
So now what?

16
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,453
Everything's good. We
don't have to talk through it all.

17
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,414
No, I meant it literally.

18
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,583
Now what?

19
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,545
I can make breakfast,
we could go bowling...

20
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,883
We can stay here.

21
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,723
I have to go home,
get dressed. Go to work.

22
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,812
So that's it?

23
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,902
I'm hoping this is
the beginning of "it."

24
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,906
Yeah.

25
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,410
Mmm.

26
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,375
Your assistant's new.

27
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,129
It's a 50-50 chance he just
can't find the light switch.

28
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,382
Hello?

29
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,343
Dr. Cuddy?

30
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,261
No, this is
Dr. Cuddy's nanny.

31
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,972
She's feeling a little
under the weather now,

32
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,336
so she won't be coming in today.

33
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,975
Oh, I hope she's all right.

34
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,299
Would you mind asking her if...

35
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,938
No, can't do that, I'm afraid.
She's locked in the bathroom.

36
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,357
Terrible bug going around.
What's the problem?

37
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,527
Well, I'm sorry to disturb
her, but it's Dr. Richardson.

38
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,779
He must have
the same stomach flu.

39
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,591
He threw up in the OR, and I'm not
sure how she'd want me to handle...

40
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,367
Hold on a second.

41
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,048
I've talked to Dr. Cuddy, and she
would like you to do three things.

42
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,500
One, send him home, two, sterilize
the OR, three, use your own brain.

43
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,627
See ya.

44
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,884
It was about puke.
That's what's so important.

45
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,262
Puke.

46
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,306
Well, I guess I don't
have to rush back in.

47
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:36,271
But whatever "now what"
we do decide on,

48
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,648
it comes after you take a bath.

49
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,195
Here's one.

50
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,198
Twenty-five-year-old man with
numbness and tingling in his legs

51
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,534
and a speech disorder, three...

52
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,743
Anybody see House?

53
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,372
It's 10:00 a.m. I'd be worried if he
was here. Twenty-five-year-old...

54
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,417
He was in pretty bad shape
yesterday, after his patient died.

55
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,085
House has lost patients before.

56
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,087
We all have.
He's a big boy.

57
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,171
You didn't see him.

58
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,942
Best thing we can do for him now
is find him a new puzzle to solve.

59
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,926
Thus bringing us back
to my 25-year-old...

60
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,680
Yet you're the only person here
without a potential case in front of you.

61
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,932
- I haven't found the right
one yet. - Oh.

62
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,852
I thought maybe it was because
you were asking for a leave of absence

63
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,021
and wouldn't have time
to see a case through.

64
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,586
- I didn't say anything.
- He didn't.

65
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,001
I saw an envelope on House's
desk with your name on it,

66
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,194
so naturally I steamed it open.

67
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,239
What's wrong with you? You
steam an envelope to keep it secret.

68
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,033
Which is why I just ripped it.

69
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,287
You gonna tell us
where you're going?

70
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,960
It sure sounds
like a "no."

71
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,715
There's glass everywhere.

72
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,719
Couldn't you have just put the
mirror down nice and gentle?

73
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,638
I was in a mood.

74
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,855
I'll be right back.

75
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,024
Don't get that.

76
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,317
It could be important.

77
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,402
This is important.

78
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,174
Right now, we are more important

79
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,158
than what's going
on at the hospital.

80
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,411
So, I say we turn off our phones

81
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,749
and give the morning to us.

82
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,588
Okay. I'll go turn it off.

83
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,132
Thank you.

84
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,185
You're distracted.

85
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,269
I'm not.

86
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,188
You are. You turned
off your phone,

87
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,441
but you're still wondering,
"What could it have been?

88
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,111
"What emergency will bring
down the entire hospital,

89
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,794
cause I decided to
take the morning off."

90
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,322
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,660
The clinic is facing reduced
funding from the state,

92
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,789
Nurse Jeffrey is filing
his 12th HR complaint,

93
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,541
and Richardson's
threatening to quit,

94
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,085
because he's basically
been a prisoner at the hospital

95
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,337
for almost a week.

96
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,047
Richardson?
The neurosurgeon.

97
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,316
He's the only one
I have right now,

98
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,135
which means he has to stay
on the premises at all times

99
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,722
or else the hospital technically
isn't a level-one trauma center.

100
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,806
Which means?

101
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,266
I'd have to shut down the ER,

102
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,827
transfer all the patients
out of the ICU...

103
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,895
Okay, stop.
Turn around.

104
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,979
Why?

105
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,398
Because you need to relax.

106
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,737
Where are we going?

107
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,115
I am going to make
you a magical bath.

108
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,037
It'll have bubbles
and Eastern spices,

109
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,459
and blue diamonds, green
clovers, transformative powers.

110
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,379
But I must have solitude to
focus my creative energies.

111
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,189
Hello?

112
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,815
Interesting factoid.

113
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,918
Did you know that if we
don't have a neurosurgeon

114
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,277
on the premises,

115
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,489
all the puppies in the world will
choke to death on all the babies?

116
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,992
Yeah. You got
a note from Thirteen...

117
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,120
So how come we don't
have, like, five neurosurgeons?

118
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,915
Well, we had three,
but Kapur retired,

119
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,292
and then Nichols just took
off for his daughter's wedding.

120
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,502
I got good news.

121
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,422
For the next 16 hours,
you are the new neurosurgeon.

122
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,842
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

123
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,262
Which would matter if you actually
had to do some neurosurgery.

124
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,388
House, it's a hospital.

125
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,783
The odds of having
to do neurosurgery

126
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,225
are higher than in most places.

127
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,520
If an EMT calls in with
a brain or spinal trauma,

128
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,480
just divert him to
the nearest hospital.

129
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,150
All you got to do is stand
around and keep the ER open.

130
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,314
This is an administrative
problem, not a medical one.

131
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,270
House, where the hell are you?

132
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,698
Great. Glad you're on it.

133
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,370
All systems go!

134
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,502
Why are you going to Rome?

135
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,964
I found the flight
information in your locker.

136
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,675
I love how everyone thinks
it's so quaint and childlike of me

137
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,635
to expect a modicum
of privacy around here.

138
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,221
Your flight's tomorrow.
What's so urgent in Rome?

139
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,892
I hear they wanna tear down the
Colosseum to build a karaoke bar.

140
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,771
The Buona Speranza Medical Center
in Rome is doing a Huntington's trial.

141
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,231
Seriously, I live to sing.

142
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,817
I know that they've been doing
fetal neural transplantation.

143
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,169
I also know that their subjects

144
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,529
have increased risk of
intracranial hemorrhage.

145
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,489
This isn't the time
to join their trial.

146
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,366
This research is in its infancy.

147
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,617
So is your condition.

148
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,580
You read my note,
you go through my locker,

149
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,266
and then you decide
you wanna round it off

150
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,125
by lecturing me
on my life choices?

151
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,294
I'm worried about you.

152
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,754
Oh, well, that makes
it all right, then.

153
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,770
So what exactly is this?

154
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,066
It's soapy, open and
casual, and fun if you want.

155
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,902
Open?

156
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,238
You think I want
to see other people?

157
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,991
Well, last night
was emotional for you.

158
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,412
We both lost that patient,
we watched people die.

159
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,165
I came back here,
and I went for the Vicodin,

160
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,584
and you dumped your fiancé,
and you came here.

161
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,294
Which I don't regret.

162
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,274
I'm not saying you do. I'm just
saying it was an impulsive move.

163
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,509
Don't do this.

164
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,988
Why do you have to
analyze things to death?

165
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,098
Why can't you
just let it be nice?

166
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,521
You're right. That was
very anti-secret-bath.

167
00:12:58,945 --> 00:12:59,946
House?

168
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,030
Yeah?

169
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,535
The secret bath is
burning my lady parts.

170
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,623
How do you think my anus feels?

171
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,544
Burning means it's working.

172
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,379
Can we get out now?

173
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,632
I was so waiting
for you to say that.

174
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,054
Could I speak
to Dr. Jankowski?

175
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,309
No. I don't need to
disturb him in Bermuda.

176
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,519
Everything okay?

177
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,271
Dr. Cuddy's phone keeps
going directly to voice mail,

178
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,315
and I need to get a neurosurgeon

179
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,150
to replace
Dr. Richardson for the day

180
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,354
or else she's screwed and...

181
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,903
I'm a neurosurgeon.

182
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,281
No, you're not.

183
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,884
I've cut into people's
heads more often than...

184
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,178
You did a residency in neurosurgery
at the University of Melbourne

185
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,554
but you were
never board-certified.

186
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,080
You've worked here
two days, how...

187
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,415
Dr. Cuddy's
first assignment

188
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,710
was for me to get to know
everything about Dr. House's team.

189
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,254
And not to believe anything
any of them told me.

190
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,717
I am not a neurosurgeon.

191
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,514
And voila!
The first course.

192
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,393
I have flaked some
tender young ears of corn

193
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:17,898
with a side of assorted exotic
breakfast meats in a chili sauce reduction.

194
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,192
And the second course?

195
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,154
A single grape.
To cleanse the palate.

196
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,365
Which is kind of a waste,
'cause there's no third course.

197
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,161
I'm glad we stayed in.

198
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,246
This is actually pretty good.

199
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,999
I can always tell when you lie.

200
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,627
I mean, always.

201
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,506
I slept with my
freshman roommate.

202
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,383
A lie.
A truth.

203
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,218
You have a tell.
What is it?

204
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,721
First admit that you were lying.

205
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,806
Fine. I was lying.

206
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,933
My sexual history is
boring and predictable.

207
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,977
What is my tell?
Are you kidding?

208
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,064
If I tell you your tell, you'll get
rid of it, and I won't be able to tell.

209
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,167
Well, then you have
to tell me something

210
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,376
I don't already know about you.

211
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,295
Even though technically
you didn't tell me something

212
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,904
that I didn't already
know about you.

213
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,823
Quit being so damn
logical and just tell me.

214
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,954
I used to have an intimate
relationship with a photograph of you.

215
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,583
Well, actually,
a sock and a photograph.

216
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,959
I know.

217
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,377
I was lying.

218
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,797
The photo you took of me as
Sleeping Beauty on Halloween.

219
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,299
Why else would you
take that picture?

220
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,428
I have to pee.

221
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,101
Ha! You can't tell, 'cause
I actually have to poo.

222
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,651
What?

223
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,946
Cuddy's assistant decided
to "use his own brain."

224
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,281
Who put that idiot
idea into his head?

225
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,991
Perhaps you could
follow the same advice.

226
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,620
He notified DPH that there's no
neurosurgeon on the premises.

227
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,540
Said he legally had to.
Which he legally had to.

228
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,586
Sounds like you got the
situation under control.

229
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,086
No, I don't.
You know I don't.

230
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,547
When DPH shows up, they're
gonna shut down our ER.

231
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,799
This can't be fixed.
It is what it is, House.

232
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,927
Great. I've got every faith in
your ability to solve the problem.

233
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,518
I have called every neurosurgeon

234
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,645
within a 45-mile radius.
Nothing.

235
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,039
Do you think House
is just testing us?

236
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,398
He's always testing us.

237
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,899
Test or not, it's a problem.

238
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,819
It's not our problem. Why
the hell is it House's problem?

239
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,279
Where the hell is Cuddy?

240
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,448
We either report this and half
the hospital gets shut down,

241
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,367
or we cover it up
and run the risk

242
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,244
that the entire hospital
gets shut down.

243
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,121
Or we get Richardson.

244
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,204
He's sick.

245
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,666
And we're doctors.
We get people better.

246
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,085
Fing, Fong, fooey?

247
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,343
Can I open them yet?

248
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,761
Just a second.

249
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,098
Okay. Hold out your hand.

250
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,854
Oh!

251
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,942
I've always wanted to open a bottle
of champagne with one of these things.

252
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,862
You might want to
stand behind me for this.

253
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,282
Okay.

254
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,493
Oh!

255
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,537
Yeah.

256
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,459
Mmm, I think I might have
got that slightly wrong.

257
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,712
Well, good thing I got a case.

258
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,302
House! Open up.
We need to talk.

259
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,639
We should just let him in.

260
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,890
House!

261
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,373
If we just ignore him,
he'll go away.

262
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,812
House!

263
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,444
I think he finally left.

264
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,326
But just in case he hasn't, what can
we do that does not involve talking?

265
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,169
You turned on my ringer?

266
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,172
I know you're in there.
I can hear your cell phone ringing.

267
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,507
Just let him in.

268
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,675
No.

269
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,095
He's like a stray.
He'll eat everything,

270
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,139
shed all over the place
and crap on the floor.

271
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,686
Hi, this is Gregory House.

272
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,169
I can't take your call at the
moment, please leave a message.

273
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,026
If this is Wilson, I'm fine,
not suicidal, not on drugs,

274
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,004
coping very well with
the loss of my last patient,

275
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,698
so feel free to go about
your day without worry.

276
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,116
Beep!

277
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,245
House, you can't
just not show up to work.

278
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,455
What's Cuddy gonna say?

279
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,875
If this is still Wilson,
she gave me the day off.

280
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,545
And tomorrow.

281
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,465
Okay, maybe not tomorrow,
but today. I'm fine. Now go away.

282
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,305
Beep!

283
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,017
If you're not
in tomorrow, I'll be back.

284
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,779
Look, you're the only
neurosurgeon we've got.

285
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,198
You have to suck it up
and go back to the hospital.

286
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,160
We're not asking you to
operate. Just to be there.

287
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,581
Unless you can transport this toilet
with me, I'm not leaving the room.

288
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,790
I'll get a bucket.

289
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,878
You're missing the point. I ate
bad sushi, I'm sick. Go away.

290
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,307
We can give you
promethazine for the nausea.

291
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,175
Already took it.
And trimethobenzamide.

292
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,470
Maybe this isn't food poisoning.

293
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,075
Whatever it is, it must have
damaged the lining of his stomach.

294
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,974
Till that heals,
nothing's gonna work.

295
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,101
So we need to
treat both that and the nausea.

296
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,520
And whatever's wrong with him.

297
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,231
We give him ondansetron
and prostaglandins.

298
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,515
And whatever's wrong with him.

299
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,569
Neither of those will treat any
possible underlying condition.

300
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,946
Who cares? He's not
our patient, the hospital is.

301
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,865
I can hear you.

302
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,457
You're pretty
miserable, aren't you?

303
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:14,296
Would you be willing to take a fairly
risky drug if it would make it all go away?

304
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,271
Why didn't you let him in?

305
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,736
You were thinking about
Wilson while we were having sex?

306
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,947
That's so cool, so was I

307
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,158
You were hiding me from him.

308
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,619
Why?

309
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:50,207
I wasn't hiding you. I was
protecting your privacy.

310
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:57,214
I wasn't sure if you were ready to
go public with the whole "us" thing yet.

311
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,719
Why would I be doing all
this if I wanted to be private?

312
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,065
I never even asked.

313
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,195
Maybe you're not ready yet.

314
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,203
You read the list of side
effects on those drugs?

315
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,621
We could crash his BP.

316
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,875
I haven't heard a thump, so I
assume he's still quietly puking.

317
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,793
We could be making him worse.

318
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,546
Bigger picture, we're
making the hospital better.

319
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,673
We can test for whatever
you wanna test him for

320
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,800
once he's stable enough
to get back to the hospital.

321
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,219
Now stop being a girl and move.

322
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,598
So, you gonna ask me
about this Huntington's trial?

323
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,225
And by "ask," I mean,
"Give me your opinion."

324
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,560
No.

325
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,687
There is one thing, though.

326
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,732
Will you have sex with me?

327
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,152
What?

328
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,654
Well, this trial means
you're leaving right away.

329
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,866
I was playing a long game.
Deadlines have been moved up.

330
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,790
Wow. That stuff is good.

331
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,602
Think you can make it
back to the hospital?

332
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,710
Uh-huh.

333
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,420
That lamp is shiny.

334
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,089
I mean, the way it shines is

335
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,010
shiny.

336
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,513
I take it this is one of the
side effects of the drugs.

337
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,473
Who cares?
Let's go.

338
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,691
What are you doing?

339
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,278
You think I'm afraid to go
public? I want to prove you wrong.

340
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,821
With a tripod?

341
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,156
With a sex tape.

342
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,451
We'll send it to Wilson.
It's a win-win.

343
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,871
We get to do it again, and he
might actually learn something.

344
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,094
It sounds like
someone's trying to break in.

345
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,757
It's probably nothing.
Stay here.

346
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,020
Stuck?

347
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,816
Bummer. Looks painful.

348
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,152
Chamomile or English Breakfast?

349
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,992
Would you stop being an ass
and pull me out of here?

350
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,120
You didn't get
my message earlier?

351
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,749
Yeah, but someone once
told me everybody lies.

352
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,587
I'm fine. Just staying
home, chillaxing.

353
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,007
Your patient died, you ignore my
calls, and you won't open the door.

354
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,174
I don't think you're fine.

355
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,011
I think you might be throwing
away a drug-free year.

356
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,847
Or I'm ignoring you
for a different reason.

357
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,724
Sex with my girlfriend.

358
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,809
Hmm.

359
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,355
Will you please just...
Please let me in.

360
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,622
Thank you.

361
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,627
And since when did you start
referring to hookers as girlfriends?

362
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,753
She's not a hooker.

363
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,049
What... Really?

364
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,427
Begins with
ends with "Uddy."

365
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,640
How many Vicodin have you taken?

366
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,724
I'm serious.

367
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,478
Cuddy and I are now Cuddy
and I. There's an "I" in "Cuddy."

368
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:44,650
House, it's okay. Almost all
addicts relapse a few times.

369
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,652
She's in my bedroom.

370
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,781
You're hallucinating, House.

371
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,742
Honeybuns, we got company!

372
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,636
Pupils are normal,
pulse is normal.

373
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:17,224
Better than that, they're
both totally awesome.

374
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,934
I'm not on drugs.

375
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,478
So, why did you lie about Cuddy?

376
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,398
To make a point.

377
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,694
Probably something to do with
shutting you up. That's my go-to idea.

378
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,363
You do seem okay.

379
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,234
You want me to stick around?

380
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,825
I could do my usual
thing of pretending

381
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,493
I like watching
monster truck rallies,

382
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,762
if that would
make you feel better.

383
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,371
No, you go.

384
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,208
House, you could have died.

385
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,879
You had a patient who did die, in
your arms. You shouldn't be alone.

386
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,424
I know. That's why
I called a hooker.

387
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,302
Now go away, you'll be extra.

388
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,889
Are you really okay?

389
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,808
Are you gonna break in again?

390
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,853
You checked my pulse,
you checked my pupils,

391
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,980
I'll mail you the urine sample.

392
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,873
How come I've never
even met you guys?

393
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,417
You're like the greatest guys.

394
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,628
You know fluorescent lights flicker at
the same frequency as the human brain?

395
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,523
You know the human
brain doesn't flicker?

396
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,150
It doesn't take a brain
surgeon to figure out

397
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,468
that he can't perform
brain surgery.

398
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,511
What's wrong with him?

399
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,430
High blood sugar.

400
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,599
He'll be fine as soon
as we rehydrate him.

401
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,682
That's a relief.

402
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,436
Thank God. All right, the DPH
guy will be here in 20 minutes.

403
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,733
What is wrong with him?

404
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,068
High blood sugar.
You just said so.

405
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,403
Chase is running labs.

406
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:57,407
Right now, the top two contenders
are hepatitis and peptic ulcer disease.

407
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,369
So, is today
really your last day?

408
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,705
Flying out tomorrow.

409
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,041
How long a leave are you taking?

410
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,085
Depends. On the
drug trial. Sounds risky.

411
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,130
Yada yada, you don't think I
should do it. Message heard.

412
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,715
No, I approve.

413
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,551
Living fast and
dying young is crap.

414
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,722
If you have a chance to
get better, I say good for you.

415
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,394
I brought Wilson in here
specifically to go public.

416
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,813
Just like you requested.

417
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:33,235
I pressured you. Wilson coming
through the window pressured you.

418
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,489
If you're forced into this,
it's not gonna work.

419
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,787
Do you have any
response to that?

420
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,460
Game on.

421
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,170
Is he better?

422
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,338
Yep.

423
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,607
You're lying to me
again, aren't you?

424
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,632
Yep.

425
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,968
Then we're screwed.
Don't we have to tell...

426
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,763
Oh. Damn. Dr. Richardson's
prepping for surgery.

427
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,932
Yeah, I need to talk to him.

428
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,100
He's prepping for surgery.

429
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,184
So you said.

430
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,770
I just need to confirm
he is who you say he is,

431
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,856
and that he's
a licensed neurosurgeon.

432
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,065
Well, here's his paperwork.

433
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,694
His hospital ID is right
there. You can see it's him.

434
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,529
Yeah, I should
still talk to him.

435
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,757
They've already scrubbed,
he'd have to be re-sterilized,

436
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,534
the patient's anesthesia
would have to be adjusted.

437
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,370
Why did you report
he wasn't here?

438
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,208
I must have misunderstood.

439
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,763
Why is it so hot in there?

440
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,312
La de da.

441
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,316
Woodstock, baby.

442
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,525
Is he stoned?

443
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,569
No, we're
pretty sure he's got...

444
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:01,156
Oh, I'm sure you have an
explanation, but I don't care.

445
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,074
See, you need to have
a doctor on the premises

446
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,535
who can actually
do neurosurgery.

447
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,788
Tell the attending to
divert all ambulances away.

448
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,206
And start calling
other hospitals

449
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,918
to see who can take your
stabilized ICU patients.

450
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,920
Those departments
are shutting down.

451
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,925
"Design" for five points.
Got it.

452
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,092
"Hear."

453
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,552
Got it.
Both versions.

454
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,554
"Love."

455
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,641
You didn't see "love"?

456
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,519
Wow. I didn't think you'd take my
lack of board game skills so personally.

457
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,316
Why didn't you
tell me you loved me?

458
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,528
Didn't a wise woman once say,
and by once I mean, two hours ago,

459
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,572
"Why do you have to
analyze everything to death?

460
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,282
"Why can't this
just be nice?"

461
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,285
I told you I loved you. You
didn't tell me you loved me back.

462
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,413
You don't think that should
give me cause for concern?

463
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,083
No. Because words don't
matter. Actions matter.

464
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,920
You're really gonna
take a stand here?

465
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,254
You can't say it?

466
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,382
Why?

467
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,010
Because I forgot to grab a

468
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,353
"Lobe" gets you one point.

469
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,189
One.

470
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,125
Labs show he's
negative for everything.

471
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,252
I'm guessing at least
one of them is wrong.

472
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,754
Who cares? The ER and
the ICU are half empty,

473
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,923
the place is crawling
with suits, it's over.

474
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,010
You do know we still have
a sick patient here, right?

475
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,388
He's the guy sitting right behind
you taking off his clothes again.

476
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,099
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

477
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,060
Why don't you just sit
down and take it easy?

478
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,413
He should be coming down by now.

479
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,772
And yet I'm not.

480
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,861
What if his behavior isn't a
side effect of the ondansetron?

481
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,069
What if it's a symptom?

482
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,113
Thank you.

483
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,948
What causes delirium and nausea?

484
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,884
He's been stuck here
in the hospital a few days.

485
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,327
Nobody else is sick, so it
can't be environmental...

486
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,246
Not exactly stuck.
I snuck out.

487
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,916
Freedom is my birthright.

488
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,418
Where did you go?

489
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,301
The seafood festival
at the convention center.

490
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,647
We're screwed.
The seafood festival

491
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,065
has stuff from all
around the world,

492
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,758
in combinations
nobody ever thought of.

493
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,010
We could be here all year.

494
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,846
You had shrimp? And crab?
Lobster? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

495
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,723
And?

496
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,391
I ate whatever looked good.

497
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,271
Did you eat any roe?
Little tiny eggs?

498
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,355
Nummy.

499
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,650
Toad eggs will cause nausea,
and they can get you high.

500
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,278
If I'm right, the
antidote is fast-acting.

501
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,339
If we can get him to keep
his clothes on long enough,

502
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,450
he can pass as a
functioning neurosurgeon.

503
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,497
Um...

504
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,584
France. And not
Paris or the Riviera.

505
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,379
But there's this place in
Normandy. It's on a tidal island.

506
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,424
Everyone who's not staying in
one of the small inns has to leave

507
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,592
before the tide comes in.

508
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,513
You have this 900-year-old
fortress all to yourself.

509
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,392
It's called...
Mont-Saint-Michel.

510
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,771
That's it. Have you
been there? Nope.

511
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,065
But I got a pretty good
idea what it looks like.

512
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,276
How did you know?

513
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,362
You used to have a
picture of it as a screensaver.

514
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,114
And that was years ago.

515
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,865
I guess it's a memorable place.

516
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,077
Now unfortunately, we
can't fly straight to Normandy,

517
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,704
but the layover in London
is only a couple hours.

518
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,848
What are you talking about?

519
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,872
It's all there.

520
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,458
All you got to do
is click "confirm,"

521
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,960
and we'll be eating croissants

522
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,462
and being insulted by stinky
people this time tomorrow.

523
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,925
Don't worry. I used
Wilson's credit card.

524
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,218
I can't.

525
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,302
I'm kidding.

526
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,972
I used your credit card.

527
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,807
House...

528
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,851
The hospital does
not need your body.

529
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,644
I do.
So does my daughter.

530
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,481
Well, she can come, too. Or to
Grandmother's house she can go.

531
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,526
This is crazy.

532
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,907
So, you can break
off your engagement,

533
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,534
but you won't
adjust your schedule.

534
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,622
I can't.

535
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,084
Not tomorrow.

536
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,130
But two weekends from now.

537
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,591
If Rachel's gonna
stay with my mom,

538
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,342
I'm gonna need
a little bit of prep time.

539
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:34,929
Okay.

540
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,021
What if it doesn't work?

541
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,397
What if I stay this way forever?

542
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,690
The antidote works quickly.

543
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,085
If we're right, you should be
back to your old self in no time.

544
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,695
My old self was boring.
Can't we keep the new self?

545
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,364
Just lay down and
stop unbuttoning.

546
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,246
I'm sorry that I read your
note and looked in your locker.

547
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,248
You get used to that
kind of thing around here.

548
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,043
Do you have anyone
going with you to Rome?

549
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,353
Is that your
passive-aggressive way

550
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,129
of asking me if I'm
seeing somebody else?

551
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:12,008
I hope you are. I mean, I hope
you have someone with you.

552
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,804
If I'm scared about this, I can't
imagine how you must feel.

553
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,431
You shouldn't be alone.

554
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,435
If you want, I could
fly over for a few days.

555
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,270
Friends.

556
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,983
I appreciate that,
but I think I'll be okay.

557
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,404
I guess we took the long way
round to being friends, huh?

558
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,868
I guess we all did.

559
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,752
Thank you for everything.

560
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,673
You're welcome for everything.

561
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,802
I'll see you tomorrow.

562
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,519
I really do have to leave.

563
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,023
I know.

564
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,028
Then what's the problem?

565
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,825
This isn't gonna work.

566
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,255
That's it? You can't
just say that and shut up.

567
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,676
It's a statement of fact. It's
not a debatable proposition.

568
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,180
Right. Because you
can see the future?

569
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,766
No. But I can
see the past.

570
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,729
And you're gonna remember
all the horrible things I've done.

571
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,524
And you'll try to convince
yourself that I've changed,

572
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,627
but then I'm gonna start doing
those horrible things again

573
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,778
because I haven't changed.

574
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,073
Then you'll realize that

575
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,079
I am an insane choice
for someone who has a kid.

576
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,999
And from there,
it's a short step

577
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:11,627
to the inevitable
conclusion that all of this

578
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,590
was a mistake.

579
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,013
Tell me any of that isn't true.

580
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,608
Mercy doesn't have enough room in
their ICU to handle the overflow, so...

581
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,734
Don't worry about it.

582
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,196
I believe you wanted to talk to
Dr. Richardson, our neurosurgeon.

583
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,907
I'm sorry that we met under
such trying circumstances.

584
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,576
I hope you'll restore our rating
as a level-one trauma center

585
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,703
and re-open the ER
and the ICU immediately.

586
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,538
An accidental case of poisoning.

587
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,666
Dr. Richardson has been treated
and is ready to resume work.

588
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,671
Touch your nose
with your index finger

589
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,799
and tell me how you'd
treat a cerebral contusion.

590
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,762
I would watch for edema
and transtentorial herniation.

591
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,350
Good enough.
Turn it around.

592
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:13,106
You're gonna be up late.
Next time, avoid responsibility.

593
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,691
Cake?

594
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,694
Taub thought we should have a
little party to see you off properly.

595
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,405
He gets sentimental
about these things.

596
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,907
I never should have flashed him.

597
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,702
Speaking of which, earlier
today I asked you about

598
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,497
having sex.

599
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,084
You gave me a look that almost
certainly could only mean no.

600
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,211
However, on the other hand,

601
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,339
I'd be remiss if I didn't
follow up and confirm.

602
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,968
See? That's the same look.

603
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,137
So if it didn't mean
"no" the first time, then...

604
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,432
No. No, no, no.

605
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,475
No pressure.

606
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,685
Does that method ever work?

607
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,730
At least once.

608
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,950
I'm getting mixed signals.

609
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,786
I'll see you at the cake.

610
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,376
The only time you're
afraid is when you're happy.

611
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,838
You just don't
expect it to last.

612
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,047
Because it doesn't.

613
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,468
You don't know that.

614
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,847
I've done
horrible things to you.

615
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,308
I will do horrible things again.

616
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,642
To you.

617
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:37,190
But because of one stupid moment
with a dying girl in a pile of rubble,

618
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,276
you think I can change.

619
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,031
Tell me where I'm wrong.

620
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,745
I don't want you to change.

621
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,665
I know you're screwed up.

622
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,793
I know you are always
gonna be screwed up.

623
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,172
But you're the most
incredible man I've ever known.

624
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:11,224
And you are always gonna be the
most incredible man I have ever known.

625
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,145
So unless you're
breaking up with me,

626
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,940
I am going home now.

627
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,828
I love you.

628
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,389
Where's Thirteen?

629
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,307
I don't think she's coming.

630
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,476
What's going on?

631
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,895
She's not going to Rome.

632
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,259
You mean she changed her mind...

633
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,275
I called the hospital in Rome to see
when she was scheduled for surgery.

634
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,859
Why would you...
It doesn't matter.

635
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,987
The point is
she's not even in the trial.

636
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,907
Never heard of her.

637
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,369
She's been lying to us all day.

638
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:14,995
Well, have you tried...

639
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,757
Both her phone lines
have been disconnected.

640
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,251
She's just gone.

641
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,845
It's gonna be great.

642
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,346
Yeah.
