1
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,590
Let's hear it for Della Cart.

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,510
Dude, your sister
kicks serious ass.

3
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,804
Competed in the boys'
league this year.

4
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,223
Kicked their asses, too.

5
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,562
Nice job, Del. You...

6
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,326
I went faster on the 50-50.
You were right.

7
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,774
All right.
Who wants next?

8
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,985
Yeah, yeah, I'm a little biased.

9
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,378
Custom decks.
Start the bidding at 400 bucks.

10
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,481
Trust me, the kids'll force
their parents to buy them.

11
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,048
You got to see this.

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,184
You made a great
event today, hon.

13
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,727
Fast enough for you?

14
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,355
I'm already in a wheelchair,
what are you so afraid of?

15
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,316
All right!

16
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,987
That wasn't what I meant!

17
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,327
Della? You okay?

18
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,413
Mom, Dad!

19
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,546
We got to stop parking like
this. People are gonna talk.

20
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,342
Well, that's why I plan
on doing some talking first.

21
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,804
I want us to formally report our
relationship to Human Resources.

22
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,766
Okay. You get them,
I'll cover everybody else.

23
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,436
I would appreciate it if we could
keep it quiet until we had that meeting.

24
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,456
It's gonna be hard with me
grabbing your ass all day.

25
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,939
Grabbing stops at the threshold.

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,318
Of the parking garage.

27
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,071
Handicapped plates.
I get special access.

28
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,620
I just don't want our
relationship affecting our jobs.

29
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,747
Or the other way around.

30
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,254
Why, Dr. Cuddy,
how was your weekend?

31
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,134
I got a call about
a case for you.

32
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,012
14-year-old. EMTs think
her heart stopped while she...

33
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,597
Sounds great.

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,557
You haven't seen it yet.

35
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,267
I sense something
fascinating about it.

36
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,645
I'm gonna get us in to
see HR this afternoon.

37
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,647
Think you can hold
your tongue till then?

38
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,232
Mom!

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,943
Fine.

40
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,346
People are gonna
know soon enough.

41
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,488
I think I can
hold it till lunch.

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,626
I'm seeing Cuddy.

43
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,754
Generally without
her clothes on.

44
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,675
Use your imagination. Hope it's
got a wide-angle lens.

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,636
You don't actually need that.

46
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,864
I'm gonna go check my
office for whoopee cushions.

47
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,223
This is not a prank.

48
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,808
This is not me
walking out the door.

49
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,687
Really? You and Cuddy?

50
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,188
For reals.

51
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,481
Foreman can translate.

52
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,650
So, junior miss everything.

53
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,821
Skateboarder, basketballer,
science clubber, seal clubber.

54
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,005
I'm actually guessing
with that last one.

55
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,242
Healthy one day,
heart arrhythmia the next.

56
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,994
Are you sure it's
a good idea to be

57
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,745
yanking on the chain of command?

58
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,205
Way to go, House.

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,209
I'm surprised you two
didn't get together sooner.

60
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,668
EKG, echo and head
CT are all spotless.

61
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,503
There's nothing on
her neurological exam.

62
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,215
Interesting. In favor,
indignant, indifferent.

63
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,176
I think I'd like
the female perspective.

64
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,094
Or Thirteen's.
Where is she?

65
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,179
She's gone.

66
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,264
She said was
taking a leave of absence,

67
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,476
wanted us to think it was for
a Huntington's study in Rome.

68
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,639
They've never heard of her.

69
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,145
Cell and home phone
are disconnected,

70
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,730
apartment's
already been vacated.

71
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,774
And what's with
the death's head cane?

72
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,986
They didn't have a
death's ass cane in my size.

73
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,156
I guess we'll just have to wait.

74
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,826
Conditions that cause intermittent
heart arrhythmias. Taub?

75
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,996
Three years you've been trying to
game out Thirteen. Now you don't care?

76
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,915
Sorry, not caring
about Thirteen is not

77
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,875
part of the differential
for heart arrhythmia.

78
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,519
But you do get a home
version of the game.

79
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,630
Patient's brother has severe
congenital muscular dystrophy.

80
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,217
Life expectancy of about 25.
If she's had a latent case of it...

81
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,260
Wouldn't be sudden-onset.
Foreman?

82
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,906
Do you know something
about Thirteen that we don't?

83
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,433
She's entitled to her privacy.
Just as I'm entitled to a diagnosis.

84
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,186
And you're glossing over
Thirteen's departure

85
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,855
because you actually respect
somebody's privacy.

86
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,107
I agree. It's weird
of me not to care.

87
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,068
So either I'm a changed
man because of Cuddy,

88
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,545
or I'm pretending
to be a changed man

89
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,880
because I do know
something about Thirteen

90
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,173
and I'm trying to
throw you off the scent,

91
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,437
or I've just gone nutty-bananas
because I lost a patient.

92
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,786
All of which you are free to
discuss after I get a diagnosis.

93
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,454
If it's long QT syndrome,

94
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,517
any startling stimulus in that skate
park could've triggered the arrhythmia.

95
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,000
Loud noise, flashing lights.

96
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,628
Scare the patient to death
to confirm long QT.

97
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,592
Fine. If you insist, do it in a room
with one of those thingamabobs

98
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,956
that brings people back to life.

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,222
Scare test is insane.

100
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,849
The scare test is legitimate,
simulates real-world conditions.

101
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,893
This fling with Cuddy's insane.

102
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,728
Flare gun? Scary enough?

103
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,132
How about just telling her
we're planning this stupid test?

104
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,417
And I'm hoping House and
Cuddy are more than just a fling.

105
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,670
It's clearly mellowed him out.
He didn't even care about Thirteen.

106
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,614
Right, the guy who ordered us to
stop the patient's heart is mellowed out.

107
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,657
It's gonna be horrible,
because it's doomed.

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,940
Which is just gonna make
House 50 times more of a crank.

109
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,412
Firecrackers. We can
hide them under

110
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,039
one of those covered food trays.

111
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,337
Find any itching
powder in your hanky?

112
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,257
Any fake poo in
your desk drawer?

113
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,426
Yes, the lack of
dime-store pranks

114
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,720
is proof that you're
actually dating Cuddy

115
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,843
and not just mocking me
for being worried about you.

116
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,279
What do I have to do
to prove this to you?

117
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,393
Tattoo a cane on
her inner thigh?

118
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,312
Tattoo her inner
thigh on my cane?

119
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,398
You told everybody, didn't you?

120
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,858
Repeatedly.

121
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,627
This one's not buying it.
Need a little help.

122
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,944
I'm not selling it.

123
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,448
And it's time for our
meeting at Human Resources.

124
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,451
Human Resources. Now why would
I need to go to Human Resources?

125
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,161
House, you've been
to Human Resources

126
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,038
74 times in the last six weeks.

127
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,915
Never after doing this.

128
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,168
Well, I'm convinced.

129
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,962
Come on, one peck. Just
enough to arouse him a little.

130
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,049
Hey, I'm not even...
I didn't mean you.

132
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,343
If I confirm it, can we leave?

133
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,510
Yes.

134
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,180
It's true.

135
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,829
I've been more passionate
with my great-aunt.

136
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,813
Mabel? Up high.

137
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,407
Are we done here?

138
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,834
She didn't even ask me to cough.

139
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,253
I think you straightened
out my limp a little.

140
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,635
Now, how would you describe
the exact nature of the relationship?

141
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,929
Have you ever seen Wild Kingdom?

142
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,516
Those insects that rip their
partners' heads off after copulating.

143
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,693
It's a sexual relationship.

144
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,031
Go slowly now.
He's writing it down.

145
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,327
I believe that I can still
supervise Dr. House effectively,

146
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,288
but we both want to follow
hospital policy to the letter.

147
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,042
Our concern is to make sure
that there's no conflict of interest,

148
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,294
no liability for the hospital...

149
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,380
You think we're gonna
sue if things go south?

150
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,215
Let me tell you,
she actually does go...

151
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,508
House.

152
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,302
Let him talk.

153
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,805
I know that
you're not going to sue,

154
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:20,143
because you are both
going to sign love contracts,

155
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,979
consensual
relationship agreements.

156
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,022
Well, obviously
outside counsel will have

157
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,358
to review the crotchless
undies clause.

158
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,698
We'll also need to watch for
any favoritism toward Dr. House.

159
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,290
Does that mean she has
to sleep with everyone?

160
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,579
I promise not to give him a
raise or a promotion of any kind.

161
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,165
There's got to be a joke there
about keeping up with inflation.

162
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,168
Or bias against him.

163
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,297
Are there any supervisory issues

164
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,798
with Dr. House's
current caseload?

165
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,425
Nope. Current case
Is solved.

166
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,469
Patient has long QT,
we're gonna scare her

167
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,304
into a cardiac
arrest to confirm.

168
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,597
No, we're not.

169
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,390
Okay. No, we're not.

170
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,226
See? Everything
is under control.

171
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,231
I know you're still planning
your ridiculous scare test.

172
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,775
But the patient is nowhere near

173
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,693
sick enough to justify the risk.

174
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:15,448
An angiogram and an EP study
are much safer, and very effective.

175
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,534
Fair point. I'm not
doing the scare test.

176
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,956
I'd invite you to watch me
not doing the test,

177
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,640
but having not done
it many times before,

178
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,543
trust me,
it's pretty not interesting.

179
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,054
House?
Scare test was not approved.

180
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,972
Do an angio and
an EP study instead.

181
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,974
First of all,
that's not as effective as...

182
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,688
How come you're not doing
the more specialized test?

183
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,024
This test is virtually
just as effective.

184
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,610
And Dr. House puts a
premium on patients' safety.

185
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,403
But frequently changes his mind?

186
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,906
Hugo, give him
a break. I'm fine.

187
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,699
You should go
to the bathroom before we go.

188
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,463
We've been hydrating
you for quite a while.

189
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,828
I don't have to pee.

190
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,081
Once we start the test, you won't
be able to move for at least an hour.

191
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,166
I really don't have to pee.

192
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,751
How much fluid
have we given her?

193
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,421
2.5 liters.

194
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,982
When's the last time
you went to the bathroom?

195
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,466
Last night, I guess.

196
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,385
What does that mean?

197
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,262
Your daughter's kidneys
seem to be failing.

198
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,815
So what could cause her heart
to stop, and her urine not to drop?

199
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,944
House, I was expecting
your relationship with Cuddy

200
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,821
to complicate
our work long-term.

201
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,533
I am now concerned it might
be affecting us short-term.

202
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,701
All due respect.

203
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,952
None taken.

204
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,789
I listen to Cuddy all the time. She's
my boss. Also yours, by the way.

205
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,833
You'd listen, then tell her she's being
an idiot, and do whatever you want.

206
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,378
I find I can skip the idiot part
when she's not being an idiot.

207
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,464
And since the scare test
would've led to this same dead end,

208
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,801
she was right to stop it. Which
means your problem's about you.

209
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,761
This should be interesting.

210
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,346
Losers love company.

211
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:06,601
And if even a misanthrope like
me has a chance at happiness,

212
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,644
it's gonna be pretty
lonely on that landfill

213
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,646
of loser-dom you
call a marriage.

214
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,149
Heart, kidneys, go.

215
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,069
Could be Fabry disease.
Lipid deposition in her tissues.

216
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,195
Dad's history was clean.

217
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,490
What about protein deposits? They
wouldn't show in her parents' history.

218
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,077
Amyloidosis.
Explains both the symptoms.

219
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,704
Marrow transplant to treat.

220
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,247
Her brother's a match.

221
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,999
Confirm and do.

222
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,505
I've been experiencing
fatigue and weakness.

223
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,969
Wouldn't have anything to do with
the fact that you're 102 years old?

224
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,013
Usually he's strong as an ox.

225
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,264
102-year-old ox.

226
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,476
He has tingling in
his feet and his legs.

227
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,561
I want a full battery of tests.

228
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,646
Carbon dating?

229
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,190
I'll pay cash if
it's not covered.

230
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,833
It's nice of you to
float your friend...

231
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:00,529
He's not my friend, he's my
father. He's 22 years older than me.

232
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,033
Well, if that's true, he's
definitely had his jowls done.

233
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,330
Statistically, if he didn't
have these symptoms,

234
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,287
he'd be like most
people of his age,

235
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,206
dead for the past
several decades.

236
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791
Do the tests, I'm sick.

237
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,876
You have a bad case
of natural causes.

238
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,878
Do the damn tests.

239
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,218
If the vial fills with sand,
we take that as a bad sign.

240
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,763
Hugo should be here.
Why'd you ask him to leave?

241
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,608
We wanted to be able
to discuss this openly.

242
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,475
But it obviously affects him.

243
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,768
Honey, let the doctor finish.

244
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,936
It's a standard procedure.

245
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,814
We use general anesthesia,
harvest a very small amount of his...

246
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,149
No. I'm not taking
my brother's marrow.

247
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,277
Del, it's... These
harvests are harmless.

249
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,697
With the meds we give,
there's almost no pain,

250
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,782
almost no risk of
infection... Almost?

251
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,661
His life's hard enough as it is.

252
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,415
Small problem
with the treatment.

253
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,668
Patient won't take marrow
from steel wheels?

254
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,504
We're finding another match.
And how do you know?

255
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,924
What other problem could there
be with a problem-free procedure?

256
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,928
Boys' sports, science club.
She's living his life, not hers.

257
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,264
Makes sense she's being
a self-denying moron.

258
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,642
She loves her brother, she's
thinking selflessly. How is that at all...

259
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,312
Moronic? Hmm. If I could only
think of a harm-free medical treatment

260
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,439
she'd turned down lately.

261
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,083
You're right. If everyone
were more selfish,

262
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,525
the world would
be a better place.

263
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,112
See? I can skip the idiot part
when you're not being an idiot.

264
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,368
Yeah, I had that same facial
expression for the first 48 hours.

265
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,955
Had another one, too, but
only for 15 seconds at a time.

266
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,625
I'm happy for you. You're
happy for you. This is huge.

267
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,377
So who's gonna supervise you?

268
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,795
Cuddy.

269
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,757
I guess maybe that can work.

270
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,134
Maybe? Nothing's changed.

271
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,512
You showed up for
clinic hours, voluntarily.

272
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,347
Fine, a little bit has changed.

273
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,309
House, everything's changed.
You're sleeping together.

274
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,394
You want something
from her besides

275
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,730
sign-off on scaring
your patient to death.

276
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,856
You talked to Taub.

277
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,442
He's worried about you.
He's a jerk.

278
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,693
I'm worried, too.

279
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,819
Do I need to say it?

280
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,654
I want this to work.

281
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,698
I'm not doing
anything differently.

282
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,117
She changed my mind
about one diagnostic test.

283
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,036
And she was right.

284
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,040
Even though it's your
emotional default, stop worrying.

285
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,834
I can handle it.

286
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,505
I hear you're a pretty
fierce skateboarder.

287
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,215
I do okay.

288
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,676
All your activities,
don't they seem

289
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,513
like things a 16-year-old
boy would do?

290
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:35,392
Some people might think
you're trying to live his life for him.

291
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,852
I am.

292
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,437
Sort of.

293
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,524
I got into skateboarding when
some of Hugo's classmates did,

294
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,360
and he realized
he could never do it.

295
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,697
It's the same with a lot of
things. We live through it together.

296
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:54,036
And you're not worried you're being
selfless to the point of self-denial?

297
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,915
You've never been
inspired by someone?

298
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,669
Why don't you take your pills.

299
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,590
Need some help in here.

300
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,718
Hemothorax, we need
to brooch her now.

301
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,388
Clear an OR. She's
drowning in her own blood.

302
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,681
It's not amyloidosis.

303
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,067
She's bleeding to death,
out of her lung.

304
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,736
I want to fill
a quarter of it with foam.

305
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,239
That'd stop the
bleeding, all right.

306
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,242
Thought it made more sense
than diet and exercise.

307
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,328
And if she doesn't have enough
lung function left, you'll have killed her.

308
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,165
The only alternative is
slowly suturing the lung,

309
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,833
hoping the bleeding
stops in time

310
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,418
and she doesn't die on her own.

311
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,753
But we would walk
away with clean hands.

312
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,964
Except for all the blood.

313
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,929
You're right. Faster and
riskier is better. Foam the lung.

314
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,938
You got a green light?

315
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,445
No. Suture the lung.

316
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,990
Scalpel, rib spreader.

317
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,121
I can't handle it.

318
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,918
What happened?

319
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,253
She said yes, I heard no.

320
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,839
But I didn't actually hear no.

321
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,967
I just was sure
that's what she meant.

322
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,262
The way she tilted her head
and half-arched her eyebrow.

323
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,451
But what do I even
care what she meant?

324
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,310
She said yes,
that's all that matters.

325
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,647
I'm screwing this up.

326
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,441
It's not completely bad, House.

327
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,277
You care enough to pull your
punches. That's not a bad thing.

328
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,071
But you and Cuddy
have got to figure out

329
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,822
a way of avoiding this problem.

330
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,200
Set some ground rules.

331
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,372
Yeah. I have to
avoid this problem.

332
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,708
If I can restrict
our interactions

333
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,544
to places where neither
of us are wearing pants.

334
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,006
Yeah. That's not avoiding the
problem, that's avoiding the issue.

335
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,386
Since avoidance is my plan
for dealing with the issue,

336
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,222
technically,
that's not avoiding it.

337
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,391
Thanks.
No problem.

338
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,563
The stitching worked.
This time.

339
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,857
No guarantee bowing
to Cuddy'll work next time.

340
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,196
Heart arrhythmia, kidney
failure, and now a bleeding lung...

341
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,007
I don't want to criticize
your girlfriend, but...

342
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,118
Hey, you've been on me for
years to respect someone's opinion.

343
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,680
Just because I had to go outside
this group to find one I respect...

344
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,540
Multi-system involvement
centered in the lung. Sarcoidosis.

345
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,041
Doesn't explain the hemothorax.

346
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,043
TB can infect all three organs.

347
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,130
Skin test was negative.
What about Goodpasture's?

348
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,714
Affects the lungs, kidneys.

349
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,969
And autoimmune explains
the out-of-the-blue arrhythmia.

350
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,220
Goodpasture's it is.

351
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,056
Immunosuppressants
and plasmapheresis to treat,

352
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,392
kidney biopsy to confirm.

353
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,736
Dr. House!

354
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,738
Don't tell me.

355
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,574
Your father's hairline is
receding and he needs more tests.

356
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,036
He's 102, his next test
is an autopsy.

357
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,999
Look, I love the old man, but I've
got to get him out of the damn house.

358
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,168
He can't do anything without me.

359
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,671
He needs to be in
a care facility.

360
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,465
So tell him.
He's a big boy now.

361
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,674
I can't.

362
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:40,429
I'm his whole life. But if
it comes from a doctor...

363
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,936
That's very generous.

364
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,438
When you were 30.

365
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,860
Pretend to run the tests.

366
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,865
And then tell him he
can't live with me anymore.

367
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,045
I didn't run into
you all afternoon.

368
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,671
I missed you.

369
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,964
Busy day.

370
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,261
Maybe we should plan
on lunch tomorrow.

371
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,475
Problem is, at lunch
you tend to wear tops.

372
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,438
This is much better.

373
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,246
Cuddy and I are naked. So
I'm having trouble focusing.

374
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,497
Use small words.

375
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,748
Kidney biopsy was clean,

376
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,834
SO we re-checked a piece
of her lung from the OR.

377
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,754
You lost me. Sorry,
who is this calling again?

378
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,922
It's not Goodpasture's.

379
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,007
There's intimal thickening
of the blood vessels.

380
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,844
And lymphocytic infiltrate.
We tested for LAM, it's positive.

381
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,346
Plus her lung's fried. She
needs a donor lung to live.

382
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,473
Which is the only
treatment for LAM anyway.

383
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,034
Taub's gone to
the transplant committee.

384
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,435
They may have
found a donor lung.

385
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,646
So this call is
purely expositional?

386
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,778
We should really get dressed. I
told the nanny I'd be home by 9:00.

387
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,366
And I slipped the nanny 40
bucks, told her to stay till 10:00.

388
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,034
Really?

389
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,369
Really.

390
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,343
Good news.

391
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,851
Surgery was uneventful.

392
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,146
But the donor lung started
failing about an hour into recovery.

393
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,398
We know we're right about
LAM, tests confirmed it.

394
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,025
Well, that leaves
us with two options.

395
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,818
Her body is
rejecting the new lung,

396
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,487
or we should've
rejected the new lung

397
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,738
because it's infected.

398
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,239
Let's biopsy,
see which one it is.

399
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,408
No guarantee we'd
hit the affected spot.

400
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,077
If we give steroids for rejection,
it'd make an infection worse.

401
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,681
If we give antibiotics for
infection, it'd make rejection worse.

402
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,582
Which worse is worse?

403
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,394
If we treat her for infection and we're
wrong, she'll be dead within hours.

404
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,253
And if we treat for
rejection and we're wrong?

405
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,005
She'll probably
hang on a day or two.

406
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,175
You're assuming her rejection's
hyperacute. Odds are it isn't.

407
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,011
Got to head off
the worst worse first.

408
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,223
I studied under Dr. Seuss.

409
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,434
Start with IV methylprednisolone
for hyperacute rejection.

410
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,604
If that fails, we'll switch her
to broad-spectrum antibiotics,

411
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,065
and hope we're not too late.

412
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,111
Cat got your legs?

413
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:47,449
We just decided to give meds that
could kill the patient, based on a guess.

414
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,117
You need approval from Cuddy.

415
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,678
And she'll want to
take the safer course.

416
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,871
And you're gonna fold
like an origami crane.

417
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,625
So I'll just wait here until
we get our actual orders.

418
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,086
Fine. You do it.

419
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,966
Tell her she's being an idiot for
always choosing the safer course.

420
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,135
She's sitting on her ample, if
well-formed, bureaucratic ass

421
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,720
while our patient's dying.

422
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,556
We'll see who folds
like an origami shrimp.

423
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,308
You want me to
get Cuddy's approval?

424
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,893
I've gotta be
somewhere important.

425
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,311
Sitting at your desk?

426
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,313
I'm running late.

427
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,957
Forget the tests.

428
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,085
I think junior might have a
few words to say about that.

429
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,671
I love him but he can't let go.

430
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,258
40 bucks says he can.

431
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:51,179
I can't do anything without
him helping me like I'm senile.

432
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,141
If I go back there,
I'm gonna rip his throat out.

433
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,435
You sure you won't warm up
to him over time?

434
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,442
Skip the blood work.

435
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:08,155
Tell my son it's grim news, I
need to be in a nursing home.

436
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,866
A private room.

437
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,035
Make it a suite.

438
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,870
It'll be our little secret.

439
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:20,709
I sit around on
my "bureaucratic ass"?

440
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,127
I was relaying your words.

441
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,339
I said "well-formed."
I said "well-formed"!

442
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,312
What were you...
I needed to be aggressive.

443
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,718
You're an idiot.

444
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,321
She was siding
with Foreman's analysis.

445
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,389
The odds are against it
being hyperacute rejection...

446
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,682
Stop.

447
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,228
I agree with you. That was
our analysis from the start.

448
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,733
If you've got a problem with a
team decision, you come to me.

449
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,027
I'm sorry.
I'll deal with him later.

450
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,739
I said "well-formed."

451
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,750
People who have not seen Cuddy
naked should not throw stones.

452
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,544
She does have great cans.

453
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,590
Cuddy has House on
such a short leash,

454
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,434
she might as well
start giving him chew-toys.

455
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,428
Let's give the antibiotics
at least another hour.

456
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,264
Amazing. And House hasn't
given you one ounce of grief

457
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,684
for your complete lack
of interest in his love life.

458
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,436
Did it ever occur to you
that House is just happy,

459
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,040
and could give a crap about
other people's lives because of it?

460
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,025
Well, that's ironic
and depressing.

461
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,444
And by that logic,
the reason you don't

462
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,530
give a crap is
because you're happy.

463
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,283
Which means you've got
someone new giving you chew-toys.

464
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,035
You're one-fourth right.

465
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,538
Wait. Are you saying...

466
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,541
You're dating four women?

467
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,133
BP's dropping. Means the
antibiotics aren't working.

468
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,384
Put her in Trendelenburg.

469
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,969
Can we save the lung?

470
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,014
Believe it or not,
we've got a better chance now.

471
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,030
This means it's rejection,
not infection.

472
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,308
We'll start her on IV
methylprednisolone right away.

473
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,570
Wow. You hate salad. She's
really got you tied up in knots.

474
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,489
I caved. Through
an intermediary.

475
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,658
I need a plan C.

476
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:21,246
What you need is a plan that
you actually develop with Cuddy.

477
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,002
Antibiotics didn't work.
And then steroids didn't work.

478
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,671
Her new lung's ruined and
it's not rejection or infection.

479
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,506
The only two options were wrong.

480
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,674
Unless it's not LAM.

481
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,301
It is LAM,
the test was positive.

482
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,845
Then the test had to be wrong.

483
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,182
Deep fryer's working again.

484
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,018
Still working on that?

485
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,937
That was here when I
sat down. I need to think.

486
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:19,012
I want to make sure you're
trying everything to save my sister.

487
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,016
Everything.
That must be it.

488
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,852
See, I thought you guys
checked the box marked,

489
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,562
"Try every other thing."

490
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,981
I'm the one that's
supposed to die first.

491
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,025
I'm the damaged one, not her.

492
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,735
She never even gets a cold.

493
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,029
Damage has a way of
spreading to everyone around you.

494
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,281
For example, your
obvious emotional damage

495
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,450
is now making me have a
philosophical conversation,

496
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,077
instead of dealing
with your sister.

497
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,913
See how that might be damaging?

498
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,714
Never?

499
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,426
When's the last time
you had a cold?

500
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,513
Any minor aches,
swelling, anything?

501
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,601
It's been years.
She never gets colds.

502
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,062
I didn't ask when's the
last time she mentioned it,

503
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,148
I asked when she had one,
even a tiny one.

504
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,528
It's nothing. Sometimes
my ears ache a little.

505
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,906
So now tell me
the rest of the nothing.

506
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:26,496
My chest, soreness,
some congestion...

507
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,248
You never said
anything about that.

508
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,502
I barely noticed it until that
skateboarding tournament in Denver.

509
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,628
How long ago?

510
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,047
A year?

511
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,468
Cold's nothing. When I think of
what Hugo goes through every day...

512
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,639
Yeah, we get it. Your brother,
the saint, his sister, the martyr.

513
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,271
Thank God you followed me.

514
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,194
Now you can go back to
the transplant committee

515
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,608
while I get confirmation.

516
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,775
Confirmation of what?

517
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,153
What causes low-level
cold symptoms for a year,

518
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,530
can ruin two lungs,
is immune to drug therapies

519
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,241
and gets worse in cities
nicknamed Mile-High?

520
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,534
A clotting disorder?

521
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,494
She has a nasty case
of sickle cell trait.

522
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,413
Her heart arrhythmia
wasn't sudden at all.

523
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,790
The screwed up blood cells
screwed up the blood vessels,

524
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,710
which gave us the
screwed up positive for LAM.

525
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,712
If she'd told us
about her symptoms sooner,

526
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,714
like, ever,
she might not be dying.

527
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,882
You were right after all.

528
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,008
I never said sickle...

529
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,095
If everyone were more selfish,
the world would be a better place.

530
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,973
So she's gonna die.

531
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,311
Unless we can find...

532
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,729
She burned through
one donor lung,

533
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,357
transplant committee's never
gonna give her a second one.

534
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,652
Well, then, I guess
you're right again.

535
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,450
Unless we don't
need their approval.

536
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,462
You can't advise
your patient's parents

537
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:01,049
to take marrow and
half a lung from their son.

538
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,552
Guess I could just chat
with them about the weather.

539
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,305
But the blood tests just
confirmed sickle cell trait,

540
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,142
so they might be curious
about the only treatment option.

541
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,061
Though we are having
weird weather lately.

542
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,940
There is a huge reason not to
take lungs from living patients.

543
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,233
So their siblings can die?

544
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,276
Their son has CMD.

545
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,154
As it is, he's gonna die
of respiratory failure by 25.

546
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,078
We could cut whatever
time he has left in half.

547
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,867
That qualifies as a bad reason
for them to reject the idea.

548
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,971
It's a much worse reason
for them not to get the choice.

549
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,163
It's coercive to tell them.

550
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,748
You ever hear of "do no harm"?

551
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,334
That was second year, right?
I had mono all that fall.

552
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,711
Their son's not
even our patient.

553
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,314
Why don't we just
take half a lung from

554
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,856
some guy in the clinic
with a toothache?

555
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,109
It's a great idea. Now I can
give the parents two options.

556
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,094
We don't compromise
one life for another.

557
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,100
Okay.

558
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,441
"Okay"? Seriously?

559
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,402
You made an argument.

560
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,767
If you don't want me to defer
to you, why make it at all?

561
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,909
But are you deferring to me just
because we're seeing each other?

562
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,748
Maybe.

563
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,877
Yeah. I think so.

564
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:23,590
Look, this is screwing me up.
Why is it not screwing you up?

565
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,634
It is.

566
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,681
I don't know why I okayed
you foaming that lung.

567
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,933
I realized it was wrong
as soon as I said it.

568
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,895
I knew it! I knew when
you tilted your head.

569
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,440
House, we are screwing this up.

570
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,443
I'm gonna call HR.

571
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,822
And find someone else to
supervise you, as soon as they can.

572
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,467
I've got your test results.

573
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,888
You have the metabolism,
blood counts,

574
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,265
liver and kidney function
of a 92-year-old.

575
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,142
Which is great
'cause you're 102.

576
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,729
What's not so great is the
average life expectancy is 78.

577
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,540
It is my recommendation
that you move into a home

578
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,233
with round-the-clock care.

579
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,736
I can't believe it.

580
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,406
Can't my son give me
round-the-clock care?

581
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,867
Not unless you've done
your two-year certification

582
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,786
in Tiburon swab technology.

583
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,579
There must be some other way.

584
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,040
Just because he has
a little tingling,

585
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,459
and some trouble
feeling hot and cold,

586
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,794
and some difficulty...

587
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,129
You can't feel hot and cold?

588
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,673
Not lately.
But at my age...

589
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,591
Show me your teeth.

590
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,640
Dentures. Fairly worn.
I'm guessing 10-years-old.

591
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,018
Show me your denture cream.

592
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,105
Why would he
carry denture cream?

593
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:08,361
Because he has zinc poisoning.

594
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,322
To get it from denture cream,
he'd have to take so much of it.

595
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,050
Trust me, he never
leaves home without it.

596
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,492
How much do you use, Pop?

597
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,035
About a tube a day.

598
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,122
I buy it online.
So what does this mean?

599
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,916
Bizarrely, this explains
all your symptoms.

600
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,252
Better-fitting dentures,
you'll be fine.

601
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,129
Medically, there's no
reason to go anywhere.

602
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,349
Hospital rebate.

603
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,021
You might want to put it
toward couples therapy.

604
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,372
The transplant committee's
never gonna give

605
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,499
my daughter another
lung, are they?

606
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,626
No.

607
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,628
Are there any other options?

608
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,048
We're looking into it.

609
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,176
Looking into what?

610
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,555
Please.

611
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,392
Tell me, give me
some kind of hope.

612
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,977
I'm afraid I can't do that.

613
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,232
We're talking about my daughter's
life, what can't you tell me?

614
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,905
If there's any chance
you can save her,

615
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,699
anything you can try.

616
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,126
We can take marrow and
half a lung from your son.

617
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,423
It would likely shorten
his life significantly.

618
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,680
He'd never be able to go on
a respirator if he needed to.

619
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:03,101
Most people with CMD need to as
their respiratory function declines.

620
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:15,321
How long do we have to decide?

621
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,700
Morning at the latest.

622
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,999
Thank you.

623
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,955
Where are my parents?

624
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,250
They're probably dealing with
committee issues or something.

625
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,419
They were arguing.

626
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:16,257
I saw my mom crying, looked
like my dad was yelling at her.

627
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,218
They care about you a lot.

628
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,854
Hugo was a marrow match.

629
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,399
We're way past that now.

630
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:39,530
They want a lung from him,
too. Is that what this is about?

631
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,620
No. It's nothing you
need to worry about.

632
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,165
Everybody's working on getting
you the best care possible.

633
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,601
How do they expect us
to go on from here?

634
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,774
We make a choice,
we live with it.

635
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,530
There's no living with it,
no matter what we decide.

636
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,136
Still cold and clammy,
she had a respiratory arrest.

637
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,638
Oh, my God!

638
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,848
What is she doing here?

639
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,711
She figured out
what was going on.

640
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,935
She's pinking up.

641
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,229
She must have
yanked off her IVs and oxygen.

642
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,357
Came here to die.

643
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,620
By unhooking
herself from everything,

644
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,623
she delivered
a hypoxic insult to her body.

645
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,001
It started a downward spiral.

646
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,422
If you're gonna make a
decision, you're running out of time.

647
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,057
HR can't find you
a new supervisor.

648
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,517
How come?

649
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,395
Because you're
unsupervisable, House.

650
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,079
Two department chairs
threatened to quit.

651
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,566
Well, I guess we're
stuck with each other.

652
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,654
I have no idea why
I'm making this call,

653
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,073
or if it's
the right call to make.

654
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,327
But if you feel
strongly about presenting

655
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,455
the parents your
treatment option,

656
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,831
you can do it.

657
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,586
Thank you. I will.
Several hours ago.

658
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,672
You told them?

659
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,258
I told him.
He came to my office.

660
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,181
I'm sorry.

661
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,104
Well, I should probably
be more mad at you.

662
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,274
Yeah.

663
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,028
Dr. House?

664
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,198
We've decided.

665
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,952
We're not gonna take
the lung from our son.

666
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,706
She's still on the waiting list.

667
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,434
We're gonna do whatever
we can to find her another...

668
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,295
What ginormous crack pipe
have you people been sucking on?

669
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,505
House!

670
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,774
Are you gonna
pretend that you're not

671
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,025
choosing your own
daughter's death?

672
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,342
Our daughter doesn't want it.

673
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,594
Probably doesn't want
to floss her teeth either.

674
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:49,887
She's a mindless teenybopper.

675
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,180
Don't put this on them.

676
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,950
What do you mean
"put it on"? It is on them.

677
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,952
As much as they may want
to "pass the lung" here...

678
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,563
Of course they do. You're
handing them an impossible choice...

679
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,148
Life has handed them
a crappy choice.

680
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,817
And they're picking
the crappier option.

681
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,819
Trading who-knows-how-many
healthy decades

682
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,572
for four or five years in which
roller-boy will be a limp rag.

683
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,198
Not everything is
a math equation.

684
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,343
You need me to explain the
difference between decade and year?

685
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,785
Their son is a human being.

686
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,329
You know what they are,
right? Intrinsic value.

687
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,539
We don't get to decide...

688
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,702
Come on.
We do it every day.

689
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,226
The two of them
needed the same lung...

690
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,876
He needs to keep
the one he's got.

691
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,212
You don't get to
play God by ripping out...

692
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,840
That train left the station when
we learned to do transplants.

693
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,341
The rest is just paper-pushing.

694
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,177
And of course now, we're
onto your real area of expertise.

695
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,179
I thought we were
moving onto yours,

696
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:37,018
bullying your patients into
embracing your own lack-of-a-moral...

697
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,772
Hugo, honey...

698
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,619
We didn't mean for
you to hear any of this.

699
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,027
Hugo, please.

700
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,754
I want you to take half my lung.

701
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,921
No.

702
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,051
I am not.

703
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,056
You do so many great things.

704
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,558
I just watch.

705
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,730
I get to watch
and coach and cheer.

706
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:28,444
But that's not me out there.
Never will be.

707
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:35,743
If you take this piece
of me, carry it with you,

708
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,247
then I really can share
in everything you do.

709
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:46,087
This is the great thing
I can do with my life.

710
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,300
Don't make me live without you.

711
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,628
We got lucky.

712
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,010
I did give them
an impossible choice.

713
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,263
The kid took it away from them.

714
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,348
That fight

715
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,061
was the first honest interaction

716
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,605
you and I have had
since we came back to work.

717
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,528
If we're painfully, brutally
honest with each other,

718
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,489
maybe we'll get lucky again.

719
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,494
You've got a big ass.
