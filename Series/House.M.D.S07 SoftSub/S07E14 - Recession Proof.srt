1
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,293
Hey, sweetie.

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,380
Yeah. No, I'm sorry. The
meeting's running a little late.

3
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,800
Well, you know Matheson,
guy loves to hear himself talk.

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,722
Yeah, yeah, I'll meet
you at the restaurant.

5
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,486
Hey, we're going over the contracts
now. I got to get back in there.

6
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,645
I love you, too.

7
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,076
You're getting
paid to clean, not window shop, Vesky.

8
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,452
You calling me a thief?

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,829
Take it easy, I'm just
yanking your chain.

10
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,666
Damn, it's freezing in here.

11
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,167
Better the cold than the smell.

12
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,543
I used to think my job sucked.

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,712
How much you make an
hour anyway? Not enough.

14
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,799
The difference is, this job
is just a temporary setback.

15
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,051
You, on the other hand,
will always be a schmuck.

16
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,346
Yeah. A schmuck with a
guaranteed pension and benefits.

17
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,056
I'll take it.

18
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,867
Sorry I'm late.

19
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,621
No talking about
real estate tonight.

20
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,790
I really want you to
just enjoy yourself.

21
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,042
Seeing you in that dress,
I'd say mission accomplished.

22
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,754
It gets a little better. Wait till
you see what's on underneath.

23
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,381
Fresh tako
with lemon. Enjoy.

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,301
I ordered the appetizer special.

25
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,388
Oh, I thought tako was a kind
of tuna. We're so not eating this.

26
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,265
Well, we should at least try it.

27
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,933
Please. It's moving, Bert.

28
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,272
That's so gross.

29
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,524
Actually, it's not that bad.

30
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,608
Really?

31
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,901
I'm not eating it.

32
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,660
To us, on our third anniversary.

33
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,580
The day I met you was...

34
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,624
Was...

35
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,419
Bert?

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,922
Bert? What is it? What...

37
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,759
Honey, what's wrong?

38
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,762
Oh, God. Someone,
please, call 911!

39
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,433
Can you breathe?

40
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,979
House!

41
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,928
I assume you're avoiding
me because of the charity gala.

42
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,931
This Friday? It must have
completely slipped my mind.

43
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,433
So you'll be there.
No, I meant

44
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,868
it slipped my mind to
tell you I'm not going.

45
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,036
What do you think
it'll look like

46
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,660
if you don't show up
when I get an award?

47
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,774
Like I don't give a crap about
awards, charities, what it looks like.

48
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,736
If you ever want... I
RSVP'd two days ago.

49
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,238
What, you think
I'm a complete ass?

50
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,287
If you were already
going, why did you...

51
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,705
Foreplay.

52
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,630
What?

53
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,424
Are you wearing my tie?

54
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,302
I saw it in your closet, and it
happened to match my shirt.

55
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,595
Why were you in my closet?

56
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,472
Looking for a tie.
What's the big deal?

57
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,141
Obviously he wants you out
of the closet for some reason.

58
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,351
I suspect marriage,
but I'm liberal that way.

59
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,354
Now tell me how someone
can have an allergic reaction

60
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,316
when all of their tests were
negative for known allergens.

61
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,402
Environmental. File says
he's a real estate developer.

62
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,173
He could have been exposed to
something visiting a construction site.

63
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,615
He's lying.

64
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,452
He's not an executive.
I saw his hands.

65
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,954
They're covered with
calluses and little cuts.

66
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,581
He works with them, a lot.

67
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,167
Stand up.

68
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,595
Our little girl is
finally growing up.

69
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,348
I mean, you dream of this day,
but when it finally happens...

70
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,686
So, what did Mr. Meat Hooks
say when you called him a liar?

71
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,104
Uh...

72
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,941
I didn't.

73
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,695
Baby steps. Go
down there and do it.

74
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,698
Um...

75
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,450
But what if I'm wrong?

76
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,857
I'll just end up offending him.

77
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,912
Consider that part a bonus.

78
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,584
All right, I'll send along one
of your big brothers to help.

79
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,670
You want scary,
smarmy or shorty?

80
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,927
We need to ask you
a few questions.

81
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,346
Alone, if you don't mind.

82
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,228
Uh, they tend to be
personal in nature...

83
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,312
I'm his wife.

84
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,065
I can probably answer
them better than he can.

85
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,277
They're about his job.

86
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,532
Well, what does that matter?
He sits in an office all day.

87
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,242
Honey, take a break.

88
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,410
No!
It's okay.

89
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,246
Seriously, if there's something
really wrong with him,

90
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,914
I want to know about it.

91
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,416
It's not...

92
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,919
Our questions are about
what he eats for lunch at work

93
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,203
and what comes out at the end.

94
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,880
Bowel movements mostly.

95
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,924
Color, texture, smell.

96
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,009
Okay...

97
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,386
Pretty sure you
can't help with that.

98
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,179
Maybe I could use a break.

99
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,641
Thank you for your honesty.

100
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,519
You're welcome.

101
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,486
I can't let my wife find out about
this. You have to promise me.

102
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,172
That depends on if
it's considered...

103
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,740
We promise.

104
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,660
I lost everything
because of the recession.

105
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,496
My entire real estate company.

106
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,416
And she has no idea.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,311
So what do you do
for a living now?

108
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,629
I used to be a janitor
when I was in college,

109
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,215
and now I'm almost 40 and doing
it for the people I built homes for.

110
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,508
Why?

111
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,762
Why do you think?
Because I need the money.

112
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,264
No, I mean, why lie
to your wife about it?

113
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,100
None of our business, really.

114
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,394
What kind of cleaning?

115
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,773
Industrial jobs.
Crime-scene clean-up,

116
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,651
septic tank repair,
mold removal.

117
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,611
It's physically killing me.

118
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,697
It's the holy grail
of potential diseases.

119
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,949
Caustic cleaning chemicals,
raw sewage,

120
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,785
mold spores, fungal infections.

121
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,287
Not to mention cleaning up
blood and other body fluids

122
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,413
from a homicide yesterday.

123
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,266
We should check
out the crime scene.

124
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,977
He might have picked up a bacterial
infection from the victim's blood.

125
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,462
The place has been
cleaned and sanitized by our patient.

126
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,731
We sent for the autopsy report,

127
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,899
probably take a week to get it.

128
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,343
When he's not working, where
does he go all day to hide out?

129
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,678
His old real estate office?

130
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,221
Treat for bacterial infection.

131
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,974
Meantime, Bert, take Ernie and
check his office for environmentals.

132
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,727
I'll talk to Cuddy about getting
the autopsy results faster.

133
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,607
You're Bert.

134
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,109
He's Ernie.

135
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,696
And they're both roommates.
That was a good one.

136
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,804
Well, at least the Alzheimer's
patient in room 202

137
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,348
won't remember she only
got half a ham sandwich.

138
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,016
I'm doing her a favor.

139
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,938
You're really going
to the charity gala?

140
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,107
Why?

141
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,710
I wanna do something
nice for my girlfriend.

142
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,153
You never do anything
unless it stands to benefit you.

143
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,779
I realize that three
failed marriages

144
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,823
can leave a man
twisted and bitter inside.

145
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,951
But in a good relationship, people
sometimes do things for each other.

146
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,038
A hundred says
you don't show up.

147
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,128
You're giving me an
incentive to actually show up?

148
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,963
A personal, selfish incentive.

149
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,798
I'm just making easy money.

150
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,675
Two hundred.

151
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,347
How high did Cuddy
authorize you to go?

152
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,809
She... She...

153
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,771
Three.

154
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,314
She really wants you there.

155
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,901
Why do people believe that I'm
incapable of doing anything nice?

156
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,444
Experience.

157
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,825
It's a tie.

158
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,994
I'm not wearing your underwear.

159
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,039
I said I was sorry.
You want the tie back?

160
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,207
Can we get to work?

161
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,167
I can't tell if you're
being passive-aggressive

162
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,170
or if this is just your regular
fun-loving personality.

163
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,380
Both. And you
can keep the tie.

164
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,965
It went out of style
five years ago.

165
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,074
Vicodin, and he doesn't
have a prescription.

166
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,828
We didn't test for an
allergic reaction to narcotics.

167
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,331
Or it's the obvious.
Take a look at this.

168
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,096
We think you're suffering
from boric acid exposure.

169
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,347
Which is causing the rash.

170
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,015
We need to
decontaminate your skin

171
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,899
and hope you didn't
inhale it into your lungs.

172
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,227
I feel like I'm...

173
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,438
Never seen a fever
spike this fast before.

174
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,358
Acid exposure burns, literally,
it shouldn't be causing this.

175
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,609
What's happening to him?

176
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,695
Bert? Honey,
are you all right?

177
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,172
We have to get his
fever down right now.

178
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,596
If it gets any higher, it could
cause permanent brain damage.

179
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,931
We used cooling
blankets to get his temperature down.

180
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,456
He stabilized at 102.

181
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,210
Problem's not boric acid. We
found no traces of it on his skin.

182
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,213
Infection from
the murder victim's blood?

183
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,301
Autopsy report was negative
for communicable disease.

184
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,554
Cause of death was an
overly stabbey girlfriend.

185
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,222
We found Vicodin in his office.

186
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,557
Give it to me.

187
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,645
It might look like Vicodin,
but be something else.

188
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,791
It's real.

189
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,669
Unfortunately.

190
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,840
Because Vicodin doesn't
cause rash, fever and joint pain.

191
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,736
It does make Taub considerably
less annoying, though.

192
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,095
Maybe we're thinking too
far outside the box here.

193
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,323
Just because he
could have picked up

194
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,015
any one of a hundred
exotic diseases

195
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,409
from his job,
doesn't mean he did.

196
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,435
Taub's life partner has a point.

197
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,021
We started treatment with
antibiotics and he got worse.

198
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,441
The simple answer begins
with "M," ends with a "Mia."

199
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,609
Meningococcemia?

200
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,944
That works, too.

201
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,695
Confirm with a lumbar puncture.

202
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,140
And on the off
chance we're wrong,

203
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,633
find out what else
he's been lying about,

204
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,700
besides his job
and his drug use.

205
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,252
You sure do hide
a lot from your wife.

206
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,381
Your job, your
drug use, what else?

207
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,299
What does it matter?

208
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,569
We can't help you unless
you're completely honest with us.

209
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,179
I was doing manual labor.

210
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,014
If I came home
barely able to move,

211
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,378
Diane would know something's up.

212
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,810
That's why I take the
Vicodin, to hide the pain.

213
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,561
I'm not an addict.

214
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,230
Is that all you're hiding?

215
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,401
I didn't just lose my job.

216
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,528
I mean, that's how it started,

217
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,448
but I figured it'd just
last a couple of months.

218
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,367
I maxed out our credit cards,

219
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,995
took a double mortgage
on the house

220
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,206
and I sold all of
our investments.

221
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,603
Who'd have thought the
recession would last this long?

222
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,547
So it's Obama's fault
you're lying to your wife?

223
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,425
Look, I screwed up,

224
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,928
but it's too late now.

225
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,932
I need you to roll over on
your left side for the procedure.

226
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,748
Haven't you ever done
something in a relationship

227
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,932
you wish you could take back?

228
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,777
Maybe.
How'd you handle it?

229
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,115
I told the truth, eventually.

230
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,993
How'd that work out?

231
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,328
Not well.

232
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,424
I need some Intel on this
charity event on Friday night.

233
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,427
If I go, do I have to actually
give money to charity?

234
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,474
I'm going.

235
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,601
I just don't want it to suck.

236
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,811
There has to be a
way to make this fun.

237
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,773
Show up and behave.
Problem solved.

238
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,608
Your problem solved.

239
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,990
Don't you think she
deserves more than a plaque

240
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,489
and a round of applause for
15 years of running this dump?

241
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,115
It's a watch, not a plaque.

242
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,658
It's a cliché.

243
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,536
I want to make
things more exciting.

244
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,914
Something she'll remember
for more than 10 minutes.

245
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,501
Okay. By fun and exciting, you
mean screwing this up for Cuddy

246
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,045
so she won't even dream of
asking you to go to one again.

247
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,591
You really can't stand
seeing me happy, can you?

248
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,224
Gram stains are negative
in the first CSF samples.

249
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,226
One down, three to go.

250
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,247
I'm starving.
You want to get a bite...

251
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,522
Already have plans.

252
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,689
A date?

253
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,917
What difference does it make?

254
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,421
We're roommates,
not a married couple.

255
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,166
We don't have to eat
every night together.

256
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,905
So you're saying it's a date?

257
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,325
Yeah, it's a date.

258
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,952
I don't have plans.

259
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,870
Ooh. Shocking.

260
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,580
Are you mad
because I picked you?

261
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,541
You're stuck actually
doing your job?

262
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,224
A little hazing never
hurt a med student.

263
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,044
I doubt it ever helped either.

264
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,755
I'm sorry that I
think our patient

265
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,024
shouldn't be lying to his wife.

266
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,093
I'm a woman, I guess I just
have a different perspective.

267
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,930
You're sharing this unique
insight that women don't like lying?

268
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,267
No, I'm sharing my unique insight
that you don't respect women.

269
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,727
You sleep with a different
one every few days.

270
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:24,233
Or maybe you find meaning
in meaningless relationships?

271
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
At least I have relationships.

272
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,195
I'm seeing a high lymphocyte
count in the CSF sample.

273
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,719
And that couldn't wait until they
finished mocking each other?

274
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,952
Means it's not meningococcemia.

275
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,749
He's getting worse. He
can barely move his legs.

276
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,335
I can't feel them.
I can't feel my feet!

277
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,464
What is it?

278
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,008
What is happening to him?

279
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,264
Luckily,
he didn't lose his feet.

280
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,891
We were able to
restore his circulation

281
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,726
before any serious
damage set in.

282
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,812
It's not meningococcemia.
CSF was negative for bacteria.

283
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,773
But high on lymphocytes.
It's some kind of viral infection.

284
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,358
Serum sickness fits everything.

285
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,236
There'd have to be a cause,
some drug he's been exposed to.

286
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,906
In rare cases, a tick or
spider bite could set it off.

287
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,240
Show of hands.

288
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,164
Who's going to this
charity thing Friday night?

289
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,286
Already got a date.

290
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,455
Cuddy's getting an award.

291
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,916
I think we should all be
there, show our support.

292
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,709
I assume you're
planning on screwing it up,

293
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,336
SO you want to
maximize the witnesses.

294
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,921
Why does everyone go to that?

295
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,047
Experience.

296
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,635
Shut up. How about go or
work the clinic all weekend?

297
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,887
I hear it's Genital
Herpes Awareness Month.

298
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,514
Serum sickness fits.

299
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,310
Take him off the antibiotics,
start him on corticosteroids.

300
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,604
If we're right, he'll
be better by morning.

301
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,027
Canceled date, huh?

302
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,946
You're bugging my cell phone?

303
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,407
No, I just noticed
you're not wearing it.

304
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,784
What?

305
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,995
Your first-date shirt.

306
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,622
You're tracking my wardrobe?

307
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,706
I'm just observant.

308
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,375
It's why I'm good at my job.

309
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,018
It's also the reason you're
starting to annoy the crap out of me.

310
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,298
Forgive me for trying to
connect a little with my roommate.

311
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:22,559
I just found out that Rachel is now
officially more than just emotional

312
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,104
with her online friend.

313
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,898
You're getting divorced,
what'd you expect?

314
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,027
I know. You're right.

315
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,699
Just thinking about it kind of
makes me want to throw up.

316
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,329
You still want to
get something to eat?

317
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,332
I could cook.

318
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,171
- That had to hurt.
- You suck.

319
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,133
Not as bad as you, and you
just missed a free upgrade.

320
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,260
You just did it again.
You ran past a power up.

321
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,803
Double damn.

322
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,309
Are you just letting me win?

323
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,311
Of course I'm not letting you...

324
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,731
Okay, maybe a little.

325
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,649
You're having fun, right?
Not anymore.

326
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,919
I used to think
the whole brooding thing

327
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,445
was just part of
your work persona,

328
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,571
but now I live with you.

329
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,823
You need to lighten up, Bert.

330
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,784
And you think I need you to show
me what? How to have fun? Relax?

331
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,037
It was working
until you flipped out.

332
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,641
If I was going to take
advice on how to live my life,

333
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,375
it would not be from you.

334
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,294
You're broke, you
ruined your marriage,

335
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,421
and yet you act like
you're the victim here.

336
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,882
Like somehow we're all
supposed to feel sorry for you.

337
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,259
You screwed up your life,

338
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,303
not some emotional friend
your wife met on the...

339
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,473
What's wrong?
My stomach.

340
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,475
You poisoned me!

341
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,560
I ate the same thing you did.

342
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:50,272
How come I'm not... Oh! Oh.

343
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,401
Oh, dear God.

344
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,365
Open the door, Bert.
Please. Baby, talk to me!

345
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,744
He locked himself inside.
He went crazy. He hit me.

346
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,038
Bert.

347
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,624
Open the door, Bert.

348
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,417
Bert, talk to us.

349
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,545
- Bert?
- Open the door, Bert.

350
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,818
I can't get out!
Why? I can't get out.

351
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,611
No, no!

352
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,821
God! No!

353
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,739
Why can't I get out?

354
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,868
The skin rash is gone.

355
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,121
But whatever it is, it
obviously moved into his brain.

356
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,997
Or not. MARTHA: He
had a psychotic break.

357
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,500
I'd say that usually indicates
neurological involvement.

358
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,377
Usually, not always.

359
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,222
The hallucinations
stopped once the steroids

360
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,005
we gave him cleared his system.

361
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,884
I think...
I think we caused this.

362
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,178
What happened to you?

363
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,556
Taub tried to
kill me last night.

364
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,724
The steroids probably
did clear up the rash,

365
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,060
but the rest of his
symptoms are the same.

366
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,479
And now bilateral
conjunctivitis.

367
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,606
Excuse me, I'll be back.

368
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,029
I better go check on him.

369
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,252
Swollen joints, high
white count, fever, conjunctivitis.

370
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,837
Anyone?

371
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,089
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

372
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,134
What, you two can't think
and poop at the same time?

373
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,927
There's a life at stake here.

374
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,640
Could be Familial
Mediterranean fever.

375
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,309
Not likely, that almost always

376
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,271
presents with abdominal
pain or diarrhea.

377
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,567
Given his job, the skin
and eye involvement,

378
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,236
it's more likely a
systemic fungal infection.

379
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,572
We would have seen
it in his blood work.

380
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,911
Unless the saline used to recover
and store the tissue samples

381
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,096
has been shown in
recent studies...

382
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,788
Get new blood and CSF samples

383
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,707
using formaldehyde
instead of saline.

384
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,753
And start him and his wife
on triple antifungal therapy.

385
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,879
His wife?

386
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,006
Well, if he's really
trying to keep her happy,

387
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,675
I assume they've
shared bodily fluids.

388
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,765
I hate you.

389
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,644
You could have picked
it up from your job.

390
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,563
The real one, not the fake one.

391
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,083
If you would've been
more honest about...

392
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,150
How is that relevant?

393
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,611
If his wife knew about his job,

394
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,697
they both might have been
more alert to the early symptoms.

395
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,241
We could have caught it earlier.

396
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,742
That's ridiculous.

397
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,998
Oh, my God, sweetheart.
I'm so sorry.

398
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,459
Whatever you're doing,
it's obviously not working.

399
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,003
We think he has a
systemic fungal infection.

400
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,506
We're starting him on a
parenteral antifungal regimen.

401
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,309
It can be transferred
through bodily fluids,

402
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,303
so we have to start you
on the treatment as well.

403
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,220
A fungus?
Where would he...

404
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,463
Could be from anywhere. The
spores can become airborne.

405
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,140
But why would he
be the only one?

406
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,685
No one in our neighborhood,
no one in his office building.

407
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:19,565
Sometimes it just happens
that way. It's hard to explain.

408
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,109
No, it's not.

409
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,990
I need to talk to my wife
in private for a moment.

410
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,671
Your numbers
indicate the medication

411
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,234
isn't helping with
your cholesterol...

412
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,854
Hey!

413
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,066
Huh?

414
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,151
What are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing?

415
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,753
I'm auditioning
a band for Friday night.

416
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,032
So you're trying to ruin
Cuddy's moment in the spotlight.

417
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,952
Ruin? These guys recorded
with Juan Gabriel.

418
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,316
They're gonna cost me two grand.

419
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,538
This is not a prank.

420
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,625
These guys are the beginning
of Cuddy's evening to remember,

421
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,315
which in turn will
make my evening...

422
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,629
I think if you do this,

423
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,172
your evening will end with you

424
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,716
in your apartment
alone with a sock.

425
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,819
This is all for the best.

426
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,864
Yeah. Either that
or the opposite.

427
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,243
If it means anything,

428
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,120
I think he's
honestly just trying

429
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,039
to protect you
and keep you happy.

430
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,916
Oh, God!
Of course.

431
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,319
He would tell a bunch of
strangers before he would tell me.

432
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,880
I mean, why not? I'm just
a stupid housewife, right?

433
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,258
You know, I have something
you can share with him. It's over.

434
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,552
He's a liar, and I never
want to hear from him again.

435
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,906
You may want to go check
on him, his fever's back.

436
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,391
But I'm done worrying about him.

437
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,353
She was right, he's at 101.

438
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,604
Diane?

439
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,606
We're gonna have
to get your fever down.

440
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,010
What's wrong?
What are you saying?

441
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,947
I can't hear you!
I can't hear anything.

442
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,949
Why can't I hear anything?

443
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,953
His hearing's
almost completely gone.

444
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:43,125
The new blood and CSF tests
were negative for spores and fungus.

445
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,210
Tumor necrosis factor syndrome?

446
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,963
Fits the conjunctivitis and
painful swelling in his joints.

447
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:52,092
Except it's never been documented
to cause hearing loss. Ever.

448
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,177
Oh, no, she didn't.

449
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,303
This isn't the classroom.

450
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,055
In the real world,
real doctors know

451
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,450
that patients can have more
than one thing wrong with them.

452
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,892
Zing. CHASE: He
was taking Vicodin.

453
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,811
Extreme abusers can
experience hearing loss.

454
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,148
Except his drug levels never
got into the ototoxic zone.

455
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,482
You have a better idea?

456
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:08,900
Ugh!

457
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,068
I do.

458
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,838
Only in the sense that you're

459
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,131
wasting my time with a bad idea,

460
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,948
and she's wasting
my time with no idea.

461
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,743
Maybe we should hear
from silent and silenter.

462
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,077
It's probably neurological.

463
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,162
Brain tumor?

464
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,973
Or a viral infection
that's reached his brain.

465
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,333
I say we go with Ernie on
this one. Get an MRI. Find it.

466
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,337
I'm gonna move out next week.

467
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,507
I'd rather stay friends
than be roommates.

468
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,344
Just make sure
I get my keys back.

469
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,054
It's not my fault.

470
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
I cooked it thoroughly!

471
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,187
Looking forward to Friday night?

472
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,355
Yes and no.

473
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,192
Yes, because it's a great honor.

474
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,528
And, no, because... Well,
you know the because.

475
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,133
You think House is
gonna embarrass you?

476
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,699
Well, not intentionally.

477
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,620
Maybe intentionally.
I know what you mean.

478
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,331
I picture him
doing something stupid,

479
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,375
like hiring a mariachi
band or something.

480
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,130
Actually, I could
get behind that.

481
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,484
I tried to hire one last year,
but the board wouldn't let me

482
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,718
because they thought
it was too expensive.

483
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,682
I'm freezing.

484
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,236
Is Diane coming back?

485
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,826
Mmm-mmm.

486
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,306
Bedside 101.

487
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,017
When a patient IS near
death, try to be nice.

488
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,103
She's not coming back.
I'm not gonna lie to him.

489
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,689
Stop. What? You
heard what she said.

490
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,066
He's seizing. We got
to get him out of there.

491
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,452
Both his kidneys are fried.

492
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,539
He's in a coma. He
has maybe a few days left.

493
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,959
We could try and get him on the
transplant list, but in his condition

494
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:35,213
and without a diagnosis, I
don't see him getting selected.

495
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,549
He wouldn't survive the surgery.

496
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,801
Hence my previous comment.

497
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,054
What do you want
us to do, House?

498
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,437
If it's a tumor, we start chemo,

499
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,731
bombard his head with radiation.

500
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,150
Which will probably
kill him in this state.

501
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,737
And without an MRI, we
don't even know if he has one.

502
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,741
He's definitely dead
if we do nothing.

503
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,077
If I'm wrong, all we do
is shave a few hours off.

504
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,829
We'll need his wife's consent.

505
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,831
Masters will get it.

506
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,917
Probably not a good idea.

507
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,710
- Uh, he's right.
- No, he's not.

508
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:17,464
Consider this me officially
booting you out of the nest.

509
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,481
Just wanted to watch.

510
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:35,815
Do you even like me?

511
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,444
Why?

512
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,780
I put making friends and
having relationships on hold

513
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,615
so I could
concentrate on studying.

514
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,327
I always thought there'll be
plenty of time for that in the future.

515
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,540
But now, when I do want them...

516
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,130
I can't even get a date
to this charity event.

517
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,510
If I can't establish
relationships in my personal life,

518
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,679
how will I ever do
it with a patient?

519
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,815
Be honest with her.

520
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,167
But if it comes down to a choice

521
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,193
between the brutal
truth and hope,

522
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,820
side with hope.

523
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,915
He's in a coma.

524
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,211
We think it's a brain tumor. We need
your permission to start treatment.

525
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,550
Due to his current
condition, the risk factor...

526
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,841
You mean it could kill him?

527
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,428
It's possible,

528
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,265
but there is still hope.

529
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,770
Can he hear me?

530
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,941
They say that people in
comas can still do that.

531
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,944
Sometimes, but your
husband's hearing

532
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,532
is fine.

533
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,639
I didn't mean any of
those awful things I said.

534
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,642
I'm so sorry.

535
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,900
I love you, Bert.

536
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,488
I've always loved you.

537
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,457
I also kept a secret from you.

538
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,669
I was going to tell
you at the restaurant,

539
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,297
but you got sick.

540
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,637
Then I wanted to wait
until you felt better.

541
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,315
I'm pregnant, sweetheart.

542
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,456
You're going to be a daddy.

543
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,052
Why rash again?

544
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,347
It went away, it needs
a reason to come back.

545
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,766
We know it's not
an allergic reaction

546
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,018
so we must have done
something to set it off again.

547
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,728
What?
We put him on dialysis?

548
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,938
Moved him to the ICU?

549
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,023
We also did a partial MRI.

550
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,427
Two hours before the rash
came back. They're not connected.

551
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,987
What was he doing two hours
before he broke out the first time?

552
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,280
Cleaning a crime scene.

553
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,157
A crime scene and an MRI.

554
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,342
Still not seeing the connection.

555
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,410
We've been missing
connections this entire case.

556
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,455
Did he say anything? Did he show
any signs of stress in the MRI room?

557
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,168
He said he was cold, but
it's always freezing in there.

558
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,753
Cold then rash.

559
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,547
Cold urticaria causes rash,

560
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,924
but it's almost instantaneous,
not time delayed.

561
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,510
And it wouldn't
explain his other symptoms.

562
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,013
That's what we did.

563
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,765
We made him cold.

564
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,438
CAPS.

565
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,650
A genetic disorder
caused by a mutation

566
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,070
in the cold-induced
auto-inflammatory syndrome 1 gene.

567
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,198
Muckle-Wells syndrome?

568
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,284
There's only been a couple of
thousand documented cases in the US.

569
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,370
Well, now there's a
couple thousand and one.

570
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,663
Fits every symptom there.

571
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,125
We're idiots for
not seeing it before.

572
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,753
Treat with rilonacept.

573
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,714
He'll live a long
and healthy life

574
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,926
filled with lies to his
wife and future child.

575
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,712
You okay?

576
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,422
Why wouldn't I be?

577
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,216
I solved my case.

578
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,218
But your patient died.

579
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,929
I didn't say in time.

580
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,685
It happens,
we can't save everyone.

581
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,522
I just came to apologize.

582
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,526
You're right, I am turning
bitter and cynical inside.

583
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,070
You're finally
putting the cat down.

584
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,365
She loves mariachi, I told you.

585
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,537
Go home and change,
the party's in a few hours.

586
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,549
You don't have to move out,

587
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,927
if you don't want to.

588
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,313
I realize you might
have had a point.

589
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,775
I've been alone a long time,

590
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,986
and I don't want
to end up like House.

591
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,280
What you said about
me and my marriage...

592
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,199
I was being an ass.
True.

593
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,829
But you were right.
I needed to hear it.

594
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,003
So we're good?

595
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,941
You know, I have
a couple tickets to...

596
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,216
Don't push it.

597
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,100
Taub and Foreman done?
I'm hitching a ride with them.

598
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,476
Me, too.

599
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,353
You're not picking up your date?

600
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,189
No, going solo.

601
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,069
All those meaningless relationships
tend to wear a guy out after a while.

602
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,282
We've got 15
minutes to get there

603
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,509
if we want to
see the board freak

604
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,535
when House's mariachi
band marches in.

605
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,202
All of them are gone, Wilson.

606
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,998
They're all dead,
because I'm screwed up.

607
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,879
You lost one patient,
and it wasn't your fault.

608
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,132
What about that mom
who gave her baby cancer?

609
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:10,139
If I'd figured that one out
quicker, she'd still be a mom, alive.

610
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,767
She refused treatment
when it was offered.

611
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,019
How is that your fault?

612
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,607
Then there was that guy I spent
a day trapped in isolation with.

613
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,818
I was five feet
away the whole time.

614
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,030
Just watched him die,
like an idiot.

615
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,574
Yeah.

616
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,201
You've lost patients before,

617
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,619
and you'll lose patients again.

618
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,455
Exactly. Why?

619
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,795
Because love and happiness are

620
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,841
nothing but distractions.

621
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,680
The only thing my
relationship with Cuddy

622
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,182
has done for me is
make me a worse doctor.

623
00:39:55,977 --> 00:40:00,022
Right, the great Dr. House
doesn't deserve to be happy.

624
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,482
You know it's not true.

625
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,945
My happiness is being paid
for with other people's lives.

626
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,494
How is she?

627
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,166
She's worried. She's upset
that you didn't show up tonight.

628
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,595
I got to tell her
the truth, Wilson.

629
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,267
First... First, you're
not driving anywhere.

630
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,560
And second,

631
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,521
you're definitely not
talking to Cuddy like this.

632
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,066
Okay.

633
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,028
Then I'm gonna walk.

634
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,637
We really, really need to talk.

635
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,598
You're drunk and you
screwed up big time.

636
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,099
Go home!

637
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,647
You completely
disappeared on me.

638
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,398
You wouldn't even
answer your cell phone.

639
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,818
You're gonna want
to sit down for this.

640
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,446
Go ahead.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

641
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,249
I've made a decision.

642
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,630
Being happy and
being in love with you

643
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,092
makes me a crappy doctor.

644
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,803
Shut up!

645
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,264
You're too drunk to
end this relationship.

646
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,060
I am drunk, but I'm also right.

647
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,188
You have made me a worse doctor,

648
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,315
and people are going
to die because of that.

649
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,613
And

650
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,449
you

651
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,120
are totally worth it.

652
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,961
If I had to choose between

653
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,630
saving everyone

654
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,008
or loving you, being happy,

655
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,428
I choose you.

656
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,473
I choose being happy with you.

657
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,852
I will always choose you.

658
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,025
My head's on your vagina.

659
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,740
Go to sleep, House.

660
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,409
Yeah, I am kind of tired.
