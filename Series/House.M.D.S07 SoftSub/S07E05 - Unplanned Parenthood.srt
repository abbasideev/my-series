1
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,547
Okay, you're
doing good. You're doing good.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,842
You still got the
thing... The stupid thing is still on!

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,245
You don't have
to yell at me, Mom.

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,680
I've been in labor for over a
dozen hours, Justine, I have to yell.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,765
I thought you were gonna
miss the whole thing.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,226
Mom, it's a three-hour drive.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,062
That's why I called you
yesterday after my water broke.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,315
I'm sorry, a partner just
dropped a brief on my desk.

9
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,482
You're doing good.

10
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,318
Yeah. Right.

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,820
I remember what it's like,
but family comes first.

12
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,281
I need you to
keep pushing, I can see her head.

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,925
All right, come on,
we're doing good here.

14
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,242
Get this, this is what I wanted.

15
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,368
Gross.

16
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,746
Crowning.
Are you getting this?

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,208
Kind of. Well, not
the actual vagina.

18
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,460
It's your baby sister!

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,212
It's my mother's vagina.

20
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,421
Freeing the shoulders.

21
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,091
There she is! Oh,
my God! There she is!

22
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,219
Get the NICU team in here.

23
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,470
Baby's hypoxic.

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,763
Is something wrong?

25
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,765
What's going on?
I don't know, Mom.

26
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,184
My baby!
How's my baby?

27
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,103
- What are you doing?
- 02 sats are low 80.

28
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,690
Respiratory rate...
What are they saying?

29
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,108
I can't tell.

30
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,278
Find out what's going on!

31
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,197
You need to back up.
Turn that off.

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,406
She's not responding.

33
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,574
What's happening?

34
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,968
She's not
responding. She's not...

35
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,036
What's wrong with my baby?

36
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,663
Why doesn't someone talk to me?

37
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,740
Cancel your dinner plans.

38
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,369
Short on medical history,
she's only eight hours old.

39
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,205
What she's not
short on is doctors.

40
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,625
Unfortunately, none of them have
been able to solve her breathing problems.

41
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,876
Immature lungs?

42
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,255
Full term. And they gave her surfactant.
Looks like they're fully developed.

43
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,090
Need you a minute.

44
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,468
Silent reading
time till I get back.

45
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,056
My nanny called.

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,311
Her daughter has a dance
recital tonight. She can't work late.

47
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,771
And I have a board
meeting tonight.

48
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,023
That's a problem.

49
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,109
My mother can't come.
She has a cooking class.

50
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,147
You've really got a problem.

51
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,031
If only there were some
mature adult in my life

52
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,033
who could pinch hit
in emergencies like this.

53
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,576
Would love to.
But I'm catching up

54
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,870
on my back issues
of Nudist Circus.

55
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,223
You should see what the fat
lady's got under her big top.

56
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,334
All I need is a warm body. And
she'll be asleep the entire time.

57
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,544
I got a sick baby here who
needs me. Yours is healthy.

58
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,379
You can deal with
your team by phone.

59
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,524
How about a little something
extra when you get home?

60
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,592
I'm not bargaining sex
for babysitting.

61
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,968
Besides, you owe me.

62
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,553
For what?
Sex.

63
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,306
I still don't see a female
doctor in that room.

64
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,725
It's making me very unhappy.

65
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,353
Fine. Out of the
goodness of my heart.

66
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,687
Which will make you happy,

67
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,131
which will make you
desire me more,

68
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,940
which will turn into more sex.

69
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,819
Be at my place at 7:00.

70
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:24,079
The sperm donor card from the
father did note a history of asthma.

71
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,707
What if her lung problems
are not coming from her lungs?

72
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,376
Her heart looks fine.

73
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,252
Her liver enzymes are elevated.

74
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,214
When the liver fails,
it stops producing proteins.

75
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,842
Specifically the ones that keep
your plasma inside your blood vessels

76
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,969
and outside your lungs.

77
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,765
Fix the liver, she'll have enough breath
to keep the entire ward up all night.

78
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,521
Foreman, you need
to stay after school.

79
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,904
I apparently need to apologize.

80
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,449
Last week, I should not
have gone over your head

81
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,369
and allowed Chase
to hire a new team member.

82
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,455
So go hire someone who liked
The Bridges of Madison County.

83
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,417
You want me
to hire a white girl?

84
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,585
Go find a woman.

85
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,004
And wipe that self-satisfied
grin off your face.

86
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,465
This'll be quick. I've been
interviewing people all week.

87
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,984
Have it narrowed down
to two candidates.

88
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,218
Narrow it down to one,

89
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,679
before Cuddy starts
withholding sex.

90
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,015
She hasn't said anything
to me about that.

91
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,976
I said wipe the grin.

92
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,193
Yeah, she's fine. I can hear
her breathing in the monitor.

93
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,283
I just checked. I'm
checking every 10 minutes.

94
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,870
Fine, I'll check again.

95
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,963
Aw, she's so cute
when she's asleep.

96
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,176
You should see this. She's
got one hand over her head.

97
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,222
Okay. Well, you take
as long as you need.

98
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,888
I'm thirsty.

99
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,517
Your mommy says no,
"cause she's mean.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,976
If it was up to me...

101
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,645
Juice!

102
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,689
No. Go back to bed.

103
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,241
I said bed.

104
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,459
Wilson, hey! You up
for a boys' night in?

105
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:23,132
Believe it or not, breathing problems
can be caused by a liver problem.

106
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,592
Then what's wrong
with her liver?

107
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,094
Probably an abscess.

108
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,054
If we find it with
the ultrasound,

109
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,806
we can drain it,
make her better.

110
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,559
You'd be able to take her
home by the end of the week.

111
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,436
Is she bleeding?

112
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,063
She's oozing from her IV site.

113
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,746
It's a symptom of liver failure.
It's what we would expect to see.

114
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,110
Dr. Cheng, we might need
a unit of blood over here.

115
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,654
Echogenic area in
the liver. Can you make it out?

116
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,490
Doesn't seem to have the thick
walls you'd expect from an abscess.

117
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,301
Lift her left shoulder
so we can get a better look.

118
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,245
Can I do it? I haven't
been able to hold her yet.

119
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,163
She's hooked up to
too many tubes and IVs.

120
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,999
Can I at least donate blood?

121
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,018
Of course. We'll draw your
blood and see if you're a match

122
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,377
as soon as we're done here.

123
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,046
That's definitely
not an abscess.

124
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,674
It looks like
dilated bile ducts.

125
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,928
What does that mean? Can
I still take her home soon?

126
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,350
You were right about the liver.

127
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,020
On ultrasound, we found
intrahepatic dilated bile ducts.

128
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,563
Extrahepatic ducts were normal.

129
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,608
Are
there any masses causing an obstruction?

130
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,236
No.

131
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,613
Are you okay?

132
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,574
Just talking in
a soothing voice.

133
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,826
Not for your benefit.

134
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,078
Why, is it turning you on?

135
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,098
House, there's someone
here I need you to meet.

136
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,124
I just hired
Dr. Christina Fraser.

137
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,927
She's a board-certified...
Nice to meet you.

138
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,253
You're fired.

139
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,841
What? FOREMAN:
House, you're kidding, right?

140
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,093
I've done my due diligence.
She's the best there is.

141
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,219
What did I do?

142
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,390
You had the misfortune to be
the lesson that Foreman is learning.

143
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,810
That whooshing sound is
the air being let out of his ego.

144
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,204
You are such an ass, House. You
could've made the same point without

145
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,880
crushing the hopes of
a young doctor who was

146
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,489
actually excited
to have this job.

147
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,784
I'm not sure I could have. You
keep giving me far too much credit.

148
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:18,915
Taub, it's your turn to find a young doctor
who's actually excited to have this job.

149
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,083
For you to fire?

150
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,168
Not until you, or she, earns it.

151
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,253
Dilated bile ducts
could be congenital.

152
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,215
It means that it's a stricture in the
ducts themselves. Caroli syndrome.

153
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,800
So open her up.

154
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,510
Surgery?

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,012
This is a newborn
with liver failure.

156
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,556
She's oozing blood
from every puncture site.

157
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,266
It's insanely risky
to open her up.

158
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,186
Yes, it's unfortunately also
the only way to fix her.

159
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,148
So make teeny tiny incisions
with a really small scalpel.

160
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,734
Gotta go.

161
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,715
You told me you gave them
your credit card.

162
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,700
And you were dumb
enough to believe me.

163
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,721
Cuddy will be back in
an hour and 10 minutes.

164
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,455
I'll be back in
an hour and five.

165
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,375
Oh, no, you don't.

166
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,501
Oh, yes, I do.

167
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,187
You're not gonna
leave the kid. Yes, I am.

168
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,130
Because unlike you,
I don't have a conscience.

169
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,759
Unlike you, I'm not having sex
with Cuddy, so I actually can leave.

170
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,887
You're bluffing.
I'm leaving.

171
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,014
You're not gonna leave
a two-year-old unattended.

172
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,309
True. I'm leaving her with
you. A responsible adult.

173
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,987
You better get back in
there. The kid's all alone.

174
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,322
It's kind of bugging you,
isn't it? Not my problem.

175
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,324
Since objectively,
you care more about

176
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,285
leaving a child alone
than I do, it kind of is.

177
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,205
Objectively, since I never accepted
this responsibility, it kind of isn't.

178
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,168
True. And yet it is.
Because you're you.

179
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,046
I'm leaving.

180
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,882
I'm leaving.

181
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,347
You're not gonna leave.
You can't.

182
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,857
Fine. You're right.

183
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,692
You know what I can do?

184
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,653
I can go in there and call a
babysitting service for 15 bucks an hour,

185
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,865
then call Cuddy and tell her
who's watching her kid and why.

186
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,038
I'll stay if you stay.

187
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,257
We were gone two minutes.

188
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,512
What you got there, sweetie?

189
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,973
Come on now, spit it out.

190
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,102
Come on, sweetie. Open.

191
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,526
Open.

192
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,322
Ow!

193
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,083
Rachel.

194
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,919
How many coins did you eat?

195
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,147
Isolating the common bile duct.

196
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,401
And mobilizing the
distal end for cannulation.

197
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,921
BP's down to 50 systolic.
You've gotta stop the cannulation.

198
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,113
I haven't started yet.

199
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,382
Hit her with
a bolus of phenylephrine.

200
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,200
That should buy us enough time
to get in and dilate those bile ducts.

201
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,036
BP's rising, 70 systolic.

202
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,663
Nice.

203
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,582
I'm in the common bile duct.

204
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,083
Advancing past the cystic duct.

205
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,918
No strictures or
blockages so far.

206
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,083
BP's dropping again.
Another bolus of phenylephrine.

207
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,107
She can't take more,
the first bolus is still in effect.

208
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,800
BP's still dropping. You
gotta pull out. We're done.

209
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,218
I was barely in.

210
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,013
This doesn't make sense.

211
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,266
A liver problem alone is not
gonna mess with the baby's BP.

212
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,202
Whatever this is, it's
gotta be affecting her heart.

213
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,562
Heart plus liver, could
be tuberous sclerosis.

214
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,482
Or it could be a vascular malformation
in the liver causing both problems.

215
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,127
So what do you guys
think of Dr. Cheng?

216
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,279
Best treatment for a vascular
malformation is surgery.

217
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,133
And I think your wife thinks you
shouldn't think anything of Dr. Cheng.

218
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,160
No surgery. Newborn baby
can't handle another trip to the OR.

219
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,581
I didn't mean think think. I
meant think as a potential hire.

220
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,084
What if we start
the baby on steroids,

221
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,171
an anti-angiogenesis
agent and dopamine?

222
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,175
Could work just as well as surgery,
snap those bad blood vessels shut.

223
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,760
I'll call House to get approval.

224
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,722
So, what was that shrug? A
"Dr. Cheng could work" shrug?

225
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,893
Or a "House is gonna crush you
for even considering her" shrug?

226
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,645
You suck.

227
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,065
House is gonna hate anyone we hire,
because he doesn't want to hire anyone.

228
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,984
So you think I should abstain,
just give the decision back to him?

229
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,154
Then he'll just mock you for
being a wuss. You're screwed.

230
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,865
Unless

231
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,535
House feels like
hiring her is his idea.

232
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,912
He's still not answering.

233
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,830
We should just
start the treatment.

234
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,380
She opened up a Chinese
food bag to eat money.

235
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,547
What an idiot.

236
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,466
Okay, you ordered
the moo shu pork

237
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,259
and the orange
cashew chicken, right?

238
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,636
Like I always order.

239
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,055
Have you cleaned up in
there? Yeah, it's good enough.

240
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,977
Okay, so with tax, the change
should have been 68 cents.

241
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,814
There's only 58 cents out
there. There's a dime missing.

242
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,192
Well, they could have
short-changed you.

243
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,586
Fridge magnet is
not getting anything.

244
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,195
That's because
it's a fridge magnet.

245
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,864
And unless she swallowed a
Canadian dime, it's not magnetic.

246
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,282
Really?

247
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,202
I mean, kids swallow
things all the time, right?

248
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,430
She swallowed a dime, she
poops it out, she'll be fine.

249
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,457
Absolutely. Unless it gets stuck in
her intestines, causes a blockage.

250
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,334
Which could kill her.

251
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,338
Then she won't
be fine. You have to tell Cuddy.

252
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,965
Well, then, I won't be fine.

253
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,427
If you don't tell Cuddy, I will
go out there and tell her myself.

254
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,053
Yeah? What are you
gonna tell her?

255
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,474
You're gonna tell her that you left coins
out and you left her child unsupervised?

256
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,769
Hey, hey, hey! You are
not gonna pin this on me.

257
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,650
Rachel needs to be monitored for
24 hours to see that the dime passes.

258
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,445
You know, just to make
sure she doesn't die.

259
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,365
You're telling me to do the right
thing while climbing out a window?

260
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,246
Tell her!

261
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,214
She wake up at all?

262
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,301
One time.

263
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,845
That's not like her.
Is she all right?

264
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,514
She's fine.

265
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:58,439
How about I stay the night?
And you can really thank me.

266
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,734
I have to get up early. You
won't be able to sleep in.

267
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,819
I'm a deep sleeper.

268
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,792
Round two.
Did Justine go home?

269
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,795
She said she was going
downstairs for a few minutes.

270
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,004
A few hours ago.

271
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,131
So you two are close.

272
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,759
It's been getting
better, actually.

273
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,784
At least she's here
in the building.

274
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,721
That's pretty
supportive for her.

275
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,016
What is it?

276
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,018
She's pinker.

277
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,311
Is that bad?

278
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,814
That's good.

279
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,610
That's very good.

280
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,363
Is that her?

281
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,037
Can I hold her?

282
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,375
I think it's long overdue.

283
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,465
Oh!

284
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,217
My first time.

285
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,885
Finally.

286
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,680
Technically,
it's your second time.

287
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,892
I didn't mean...
I know, Mom.

288
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,578
Looks like it was a vascular
malformation. The Grogan baby is better.

289
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,246
Nice job.

290
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,416
Okay, ready, honey.
So stay very, very still.

291
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,335
And hold your breath.
Don't move.

292
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,923
She moved.
They always move.

293
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,844
It is a good job.

294
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,889
Diagnostics. Solve
a mystery, save a life.

295
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,433
But I suppose you're
pretty attached to pediatrics.

296
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,020
I'm sorry, Mrs.
Young, but I'm going to have to ask you

297
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,354
to restrain your daughter.

298
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,999
And now the mom's not
gonna want to do it,

299
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,784
because she'd rather I just keep
blasting her daughter with radiation.

300
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,947
You're telling me there's an
opening in House's department?

301
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,115
Would you be interested?

302
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,368
No more kids?
No more parents?

303
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,872
One case at a time instead
of 177 Set up the interview.

304
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,708
It's possible you won't
need to interview.

305
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,390
Relax, I got this.

306
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,808
Thanks.

307
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,500
Is everything okay?

308
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,796
Yeah. Sorry.
Just new to all this.

309
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,652
You want me to reset the alarm?

310
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,112
God, no.

311
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,865
Case is under control.
I'm sleeping in.

312
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,286
Your boss must really like you.

313
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,542
Hey, Marina.

314
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,460
There's pasta in
the fridge for lunch.

315
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,884
I assume, since
you're calling so early,

316
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,554
that the surgery was
a rousing success.

317
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,807
And I assume since you
still think we actually did the surgery,

318
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,035
you haven't checked your messages
in eight hours. Where are you?

319
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,062
I believe this is what your
people term a "poopy call."

320
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,689
Uh, the word's "booty."

321
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,209
I don't know what you're
doing, but this is a poopy call.

322
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,486
It's not Caroli
Syndrome. Dr. Cheng spotted...

323
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,946
What?

324
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,157
I knew about the Jew, the
black and the croc hunter.

325
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,159
But when did we get
our Asian persuasion on?

326
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:24,747
Dr. Cheng is the NICU attending
on the case. And she's not here.

327
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,750
Well, I just wasted a
perfectly good racial epithet.

328
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,670
She spotted a vascular
malformation in the baby's liver.

329
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,173
Good call. Except for
everything you just said.

330
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,925
There's no way that our patient
has a vascular malformation.

331
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,344
And you can tell that

332
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,263
from the vast amount of information
you've gleaned from not being here?

333
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,933
Don't need to be there to remember that the
patient's ALTs were three times normal.

334
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,437
The baby's liver damage is far
too extensive. Dr. Cheng's an idiot.

335
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,440
In fairness, it wasn't
completely her idea.

336
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,442
More of a Foreman kind of thing.

337
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,278
Well, then you're an even bigger
idiot for trying to cover for her.

338
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,281
House, we treated for
a vascular malformation.

339
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,616
And she got better.

340
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,037
No, she didn't. Call me
when she crashes again.

341
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,956
That went well.

342
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,467
Everything okay?

343
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,470
Come on.
I know that look.

344
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,141
I'm just not used to seeing
such emotion coming from you.

345
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,978
Well, I just gave birth. I'm like
one big vat of hormones right now.

346
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,397
It's not just the hormones, Mom.

347
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,565
You're different with her.

348
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,903
It's okay, it's good.
It's just...

349
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,784
I can't help thinking, "Where was
this mom when I was growing up?"

350
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,997
Well, I never realized you considered
me such a failure as a mother.

351
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,084
I don't consider you
a failure. I just...

352
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,464
I never knew that
there was an alternative.

353
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,095
Mmm.

354
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,847
I think she feels wet.

355
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,433
Can you hold her a sec?
I'm gonna grab a diaper.

356
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,436
Okay.

357
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,897
Mom, something's wrong.

358
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,023
Oh! Nurse!

359
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,484
She's bleeding again!

360
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,658
All right, she's in
her office. Move fast.

361
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:29,037
You see a double-wide tuchus
coming this way, you scream like a girl.

362
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,665
If Rachel wakes up, she's
gonna tell Cuddy everything.

363
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,167
She's two.

364
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,354
Last night she was whining about the
giant moose that lives outside her window.

365
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,882
Medusa at six o'clock.
Don't look back. Move, move.

366
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,440
Hello.

367
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,072
Hello.

368
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:08,076
I'm the friendly moose who
lives outside your bedroom.

369
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,579
She hates that moose.

370
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,914
Hand me the gel.

371
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,876
Okay.

372
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,088
Make it short. And
do not pardon the pun.

373
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,633
She's
crashing again. Where are you?

374
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,929
Is it actually important that
I understand what you say?

375
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,388
What?

376
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,357
Yeah.

377
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,025
The baby's bleeding again.

378
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,945
I'm shocked. Oh, no,
wait a minute. That's you.

379
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,571
Yes, you're a genius.

380
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,052
The bleeding
means her liver is still

381
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,759
failing. It's not a
vascular malformation...

382
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,785
House, come take a look at this.

383
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,412
Hold that thought.
House, no. I need to...

384
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,249
Just past the ileocecal valve.

385
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,833
It's nothing.

386
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,710
Just an irregularity.

387
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,003
It's a dime.

388
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,172
Or a pocket of air.

389
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,924
Yeah, with FDR's face on it.

390
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,676
That's not a face.
It's a shadow.

391
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,594
House, the thing
is perfectly round.

392
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,471
Move the wand to the side.

393
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,640
Tickles!

394
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,434
That's because
I'm the tickle monster.

395
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,647
Look at that.

396
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,650
We need an X-ray
to be sure. Great.

397
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,445
Just give her an unnecessary
dose of radiation? It's a dime.

398
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,659
House? I know
you're in there. Open the door.

399
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,960
I saw your extension
on the call.

400
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,253
What are you doing down here?

401
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,423
Uh, Wilson's got
a two-year-old with cancer.

402
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,758
She's in a lot of pain.
It's very sad.

403
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,639
He also has an outstanding
bedside manner.

404
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,391
Her liver failure
is getting worse.

405
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,059
You were right.
Now what?

406
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,314
The interesting question
is not why she's worse now,

407
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,190
but why she got better
in the first place.

408
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,860
Could've been something we
did that temporarily relieved the...

409
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,105
What'd you put her on again?

410
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,823
After the transfusion, we gave her
steroids, dopamine, and the anti...

411
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,284
Steroids can treat
idiopathic hepatic fibrosis.

412
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,127
Would explain why she
got better, then worse.

413
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,038
But not the multiple
dilated ducts.

414
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,873
House, I need you back in here.

415
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,877
Cancer kid trumps liver kid.

416
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,838
Sorry, confidentiality.
There are rules, you know.

417
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,593
That is a dime.

418
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,346
Looks mobile, it's
right in the middle of the colon.

419
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,140
Prime location for pooping out.

420
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,309
We'll give her some
laxatives to help it on its way.

421
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:42,189
Sounds to me like someone's
going to get some yummy chocolate.

422
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,940
Chocolate.
Yum, yum, yum.

423
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,944
You're gonna make
a great mommy one day.

424
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,079
Thanks for waiting.

425
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,040
Hook the mom up to the baby.
Direct blood transfusion.

426
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,375
And what else?

427
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,584
Nothing else.

428
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:14,763
It's amazing. She's
pink and healthy again.

429
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,684
Mother's touch.

430
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,103
It's a miracle.
Thank you.

431
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,065
A blood transfusion
isn't a cure.

432
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,442
Or a miracle.

433
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,779
Then why does the baby
seem like she's cured?

434
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,450
I have no idea.

435
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:48,922
Our patient can either go through life
with the world's longest umbilical cord,

436
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,800
or we can discuss the
differential for magic blood.

437
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,184
Baby's O2 sats are holding.

438
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,730
Either you're Dr. Cheng, or
you're early for my Mani-pedi.

439
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,815
I thought her expertise could...

440
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,775
Tell us the O2 sats?

441
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,569
I hope you come with
some original ideas.

442
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,237
Either the mom's
blood is special,

443
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,489
which would mean it's
treating something specific,

444
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,116
which means the baby
has a disease.

445
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:20,954
Or Mom's blood is just blood, and it's
replacing something the baby is missing,

446
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,457
which means the baby
has a simple deficiency.

447
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,837
Given the liver failure,

448
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,756
deficiency of clotting
factors, enzymes,

449
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,382
or vitamins are the most likely.

450
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,508
So let's find out.

451
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,987
Hook the baby up to someone
else's blood and see if she gets better.

452
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,680
Find a donor.
I'm O negative.
Universal donor.

453
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,390
Hook yourself up.

454
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,185
Dr. Cheng, hook
me up. Walk with me.

455
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,148
My team seems to have
taken a shine to you.

456
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,691
I like them, too.

457
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,110
I assume you're hanging
around, because you want a job.

458
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,487
That would be a fair assumption.

459
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,363
Well, I'm gonna
have to test you.

460
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,991
Let's say, two-year-old.

461
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,496
Swallowed a coin 20 hours ago.
She's gonna be fine, right?

462
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,206
Any signs of obstruction?

463
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,376
For the purposes of
this quiz, let's say not yet.

464
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,172
I'd give laxatives, although
I wouldn't wait too long.

465
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,467
Her bowel could become ischemic,
or worse, an intussusception.

466
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,927
Define "too long."

467
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,678
Another six hours, max.

468
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,473
By then, her system's clear. If
it's not out, it's not coming out.

469
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,558
And then what do I do?

470
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,727
I mean, what do
you do? It's your test.

471
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,438
I'd go in with a
scope and get it.

472
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,398
Did I pass?

473
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,068
It's not up to me.
Talk to Taub.

474
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,158
Men's room?

475
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,410
Turns out toilets are
handy in this situation.

476
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,913
And I felt relatively sure
that Cuddy wouldn't come in.

477
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,748
Oh, Cuddy's been in here.

478
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,710
Seriously? This must be
a terrible place to have...

479
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,922
Is there such a place?

480
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,342
We have six more hours, then we're
going in with a scope and pulling it out.

481
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,719
Scope a two-year-old?
It's dangerous.

482
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,056
And as you keep pointing out, so is
a dime ripping through her intestines.

483
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,016
Cuddy will be home from
work in six hours.

484
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,227
But no big deal. I'll just
scream, "Look over there"

485
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,771
while you quickly shove a
scope up her daughter's rectum.

486
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,083
I could offer to babysit again.
Let her have the night out.

487
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,150
Sure, that won't
raise any suspicions.

488
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,988
I wish I was nicer.

489
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,159
Give me your
radiation dosimeter.

490
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,411
Why?

491
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,620
Because it matches my eyes.

492
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,154
I think we can say
this isn't working.

493
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,656
We'll get her back on your
blood. That'll help for now.

494
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,533
But this means
there's an infection.

495
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,201
First we need to identify it.

496
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,246
We know it's in her liver,
so we'll get a sample.

497
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,832
Then we can figure out
how to help her get better.

498
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:17,047
I had this baby because I wanted
a chance to be a special mom,

499
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,966
but not this way.

500
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,856
Problems in radiology.

501
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,194
A radiation dosimeter
badge turned positive.

502
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:44,532
I could have a CT scanner that's leaking,
or a spilled vial of thallium somewhere.

503
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,052
I don't even know
whose badge it was.

504
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,535
The code was scratched off.

505
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,331
That had to be intentional,
I mean, why would anyone...

506
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:55,043
I don't know. All I know is that
I'm gonna need to work late.

507
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,879
I was actually hoping
that you could babysit.

508
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,841
No. Not two nights
in a row. Please.

509
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,009
Please?

510
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,260
I have a life, you know?

511
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,391
I will make it worth your while.

512
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,021
I am not going to bargain
babysitting for sex.

513
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,275
Who the hell said that?

514
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,736
Of course I will.
Thank you.

515
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,957
That thing's nearly
as big as she is.

516
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,460
Don't worry. I've done
this at least once before.

517
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,024
Advance another centimeter,
and you're in.

518
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,809
God, that looks awful.
Is that from the infection?

519
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,269
No.

520
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,813
Means we were wrong.

521
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,065
It's a melanoma.

522
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,819
You mean like skin cancer?

523
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,447
How did she get that?
She's never been outside.

524
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,907
But you have.

525
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,786
You're saying I gave
my baby cancer?

526
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,139
I found a mole under
the nail on her left index finger.

527
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,475
The biopsy revealed
it's melanoma.

528
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
That's it?

529
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,980
And how come no one got me food?

530
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,291
What do you mean,
"That's it?"

531
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,001
The woman has melanoma,
she could die if we don't...

532
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,193
Boring.

533
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,918
Since the baby has a melanoma,
we kind of already knew Mom had it.

534
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,447
Yes, but now we know
where it is,

535
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,450
SO we can treat it
much more effectively, so...

536
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,701
Great. So treat her.

537
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,328
Also boring.

538
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:57,999
What's interesting is that Mom's
melanoma spread to the baby in utero,

539
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,169
which means it's metastatic,
which means it's late stage.

540
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:06,341
How many people with late-stage
melanoma are as healthy as she is?

541
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,843
Clearly something's
going on in Mom's blood

542
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,863
that's treating her melanoma
as well as her baby's.

543
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,971
Antibodies.

544
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,895
If her immune system was
fighting the melanoma,

545
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,053
it never would have spread.

546
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,869
Exactly, which means
it's fighting something else.

547
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,229
And the melanoma cells are
getting caught in the crossfire.

548
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,564
So what's Mom's immune system
really shooting at?

549
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,609
Scleroderma can cause
cancer-fighting antibodies.

550
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,236
So can Churg-Strauss, pretty
much any auto-immune disease.

551
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,697
Or infections that cause
granulomas, TB, mycobacteria.

552
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,492
See, Dr. Cheng?
This is not boring.

553
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,578
Start with auto-immune.
Go test her blood.

554
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,705
And leave your food.

555
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,380
Just a little pinch.

556
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:53,888
So I'm not actually making
her better, I'm making her sick.

557
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,723
You can't blame yourself.

558
00:32:56,057 --> 00:33:00,061
I ate all the right foods, I read
all the books and the studies.

559
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,524
And I even hired a private detective
to research each sperm donor.

560
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,571
I just missed one big
thing, my own cancer.

561
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,285
I'm all done here.
We'll have the results soon.

562
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,496
And if that's what this is?
An auto-immune disease?

563
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,123
The treatment's fairly simple.

564
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,083
And if it's something else?

565
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,921
Let's just take this
one step at a time.

566
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,885
And stop beating yourself up.

567
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,270
I'm sorry, Mom.

568
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,733
Not just for this. But
for what I said earlier.

569
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,113
I was jealous and
angry and I lashed out.

570
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,367
You were a great mom.

571
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,953
You are a great mom.

572
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,210
I don't deserve
such a good daughter.

573
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,139
Negative for scleroderma.

574
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,601
So, what did House want earlier?

575
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,978
He just gave me a little quiz.

576
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,502
Then said he was
okay with hiring me.

577
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,273
But that it was your decision.

578
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,067
Negative for dermatomyositis.

579
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,653
He's just saying
that to set me up.

580
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,072
So, you're not
offering me the job?

581
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,158
If he wants me to offer you
the job, something's going on.

582
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,495
That was my thinking, too.

583
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,913
It's not lupus.

584
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,974
Things with House are never
as simple as they seem.

585
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,500
Trust me, he's got
an ulterior motive,

586
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,002
and I gotta figure it out
before I do anything.

587
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,128
Okay.

588
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,758
Mom's negative for
Churg-Strauss. This isn't auto-immune.

589
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,845
Time to scan her for infections
that could cause granulomas.

590
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,352
Third poop in
the last half-hour,

591
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,020
still nothing.

592
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,188
All right, that's it.

593
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:12,193
Time's up. Operation
Valkyrie is now in effect.

594
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,623
Either it's a trap or
it's not. Just hire her.

595
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,042
Lungs clear for granulomas.

596
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,794
Yeah, who cares?

597
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,714
Did you enjoy that bear trap
snapping on your leg yesterday?

598
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,216
You realize it's just
a metaphorical trap.

599
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,801
You'll still have
all your limbs.

600
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,471
Fourth rib, about
the mid-clavicular line.

601
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,557
You're over-thinking this.

602
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,392
House fired
my pick sight unseen.

603
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,477
He was never even
interested in Chase's pick,

604
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,980
he was only obsessed with
how she reflected on Chase.

605
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,483
Dr. Cheng is the only candidate
he's actually responded to.

606
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,820
You wanted House invested.
He is. Hire her.

607
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,157
And you think
I'm over-thinking this?

608
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,242
Shut up and hire her.

609
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,080
Look.

610
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,876
Oat cell lung cancer.

611
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,462
She has two cancers?

612
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,424
Cancer treating cancer.

613
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,849
You have lung cancer.

614
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,398
I thought I had skin cancer.

615
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,651
As unlikely as it sounds,
you have both.

616
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,239
Actually, the lung cancer is
basically treating the skin cancer.

617
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,866
It's why you're
not feeling sick.

618
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,910
And why your blood's
helping your baby.

619
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,037
We found it early,
so it should be treatable.

620
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,956
In a way, your daughter
saved your life.

621
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,501
We'll get you set up for the
surgery and start you on chemo.

622
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,213
What about Kayla?

623
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,590
She'll only need the chemo.

624
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,801
Can't you just keep
giving her my blood?

625
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,136
Not once we cut out the tumor.

626
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,890
Your body will stop making the antibodies
that are keeping your baby healthy.

627
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,476
Can you hold off on my surgery?

628
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,480
Over the last day, your baby's
liver tumors have shrunk 15%.

629
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,400
Projecting forward, it
would take eight or nine days

630
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,083
to completely eradicate
her cancer cells.

631
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,320
So let's take
the eight or nine days...

632
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:24,325
The cancer probably won't spread in the
next nine days, but there are other risks.

633
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,529
Cancer thickens your blood,
which could cause clots...

634
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,746
And what are the risks
to putting my baby on chemo?

635
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,918
It could damage her brain,
or affect her development.

636
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,130
But these risks are small compared
to the risks that you would be taking

637
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,298
by leaving your
cancers untreated.

638
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,471
I want to wait.
Mom, are you listening?

639
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,765
This is way too dangerous.

640
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,936
I'll take the risks. I want
what's best for my daughter.

641
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,521
I'm your daughter, too.

642
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,399
She's a baby.
You're an adult.

643
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,609
So, what? I don't need
my mom anymore?

644
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,406
No. You never did. Because
I wasn't there for you.

645
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,283
But look at you.
You turned out great.

646
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,536
You don't know if I'm great.
You don't know me at all.

647
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,873
And I'm not gonna let you martyr
yourself for a two-day-old infant

648
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,251
just because you feel guilty,
because you weren't around for me.

649
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,506
I'm not martyring myself.
It's nine days.

650
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,678
Let's hold off on the surgery.

651
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,394
You brought food?

652
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,147
This is a medical procedure,
not a dinner date.

653
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,733
I'm aware that this is
a delicate procedure.

654
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,402
I'm also aware that my hands
are shaking from low blood sugar

655
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,529
because I haven't eaten all day.

656
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,617
So while this may seem insensitive,
this crucial lifesaving moo shu...

657
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,413
Where are my extra pancakes?

658
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:56,125
Damn it. They forgot the extra
pancakes in my moo shu pork.

659
00:38:56,209 --> 00:39:00,421
Every time that new girl with the blue
streaks in her hair answers the phone,

660
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,589
they screw up.

661
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,778
Was she there when
you picked up the food?

662
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,513
You ordered extra pancakes?

663
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,265
How much do they cost?

664
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,774
55 cents.
I ordered two.

665
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,944
So that means the total
on the last bill was...

666
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,362
Was...

667
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,989
$18.42.
$18.42.

668
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,329
Rachel couldn't have eaten a dime,
because there was no extra dime.

669
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,416
Yeah.

670
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:45,466
So, the image that we saw
on the ultrasound...

671
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,427
Was obviously just a pocket
of air like I said all along.

672
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,180
But you saw
the worst-case scenario,

673
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,683
like every irrational,
worried parent.

674
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,978
You'd make a terrible mommy.

675
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,065
Throw me some dumplings.

676
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,413
Mom, I brought you some...

677
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,748
Mom?

678
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,835
Mom!

679
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,088
Mom?

680
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,095
We need help in here!
Somebody help us!

681
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:39,562
Massive pulmonary
embolism. She died in seconds.

682
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,249
Wouldn't have happened if
she'd let us remove the tumor.

683
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,858
Probably not.

684
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,653
Post-mortem, we were able
to harvest all of her blood.

685
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,197
It's enough to treat the baby.

686
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,533
That's something.

687
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,077
Pretty amazing case.

688
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,871
Thanks for your help.

689
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,206
I was glad for the chance
to work it with you.

690
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,542
I've thought about it,

691
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:06,088
and I'd like to formally
offer you the job.

692
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,719
It's funny. I wanted to
work on House's team

693
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,638
until I started working
with his team.

694
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,574
Yeah, I know. Chase and
Foreman can get a little...

695
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,932
Actually, it's you.

696
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,811
I get that House is an ass,
but at least he owns it.

697
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,857
You don't understand. This whole
thing was just a game to House.

698
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,442
I didn't have a choice, but...

699
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,653
You're a grown man,
Dr. Taub.

700
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,238
You can make whatever
choices you want.

701
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,202
And instead of hiring me
when he said you could,

702
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,911
you chose to act like a
paranoid, scared little kid.

703
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,413
I hate kids.

704
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,292
Goodbye, Dr. Taub.

705
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,931
I'll make sure
you never forget her.

706
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,600
And what she did for you.

707
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,650
She was just trying to be
the best mom in the world.

708
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,614
She was.

709
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,973
This one's all yours.

710
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,685
What happened to helping out?

711
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,437
I did.

712
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,207
CuDDY: Did someone go
poopy?
Mmm-hmm.

713
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,047
What... How did
you eat a dime?

714
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,176
House.
