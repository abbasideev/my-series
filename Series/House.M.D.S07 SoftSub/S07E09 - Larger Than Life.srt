1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,629
What's the difference
between a sea lion and a seal?

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:05,755
What's that, baby?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,134
What's the difference
between a sea lion and a seal?

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,304
Seals tell the truth, but a
sea lion is always lying?

5
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,140
A sea lion has ears.

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,850
Yeah, that's right.
I forgot.

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,602
I'll show you when
we get to the zoo.

8
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,023
Can we have pizza tonight?

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,150
I'm not gonna be here, Daisy.

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,236
I'm going back on
the road, remember?

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,447
You've only been
here for two days.

12
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,091
I'll be back in
three weeks this time.

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,950
Somebody help her!

14
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,329
She's having a seizure!

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,126
There's a lady down there.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,632
Daddy, come back! Daddy!

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,139
Hey, lady. Hey, lady, are
you okay? Come on. Come on.

18
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,475
Hey, wake up!
Come on, get up! Hey...

19
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,730
Come on.

20
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,524
Help me!

21
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,736
Somebody help me!
Come on!

22
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,363
Hurry! Hurry up!

23
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,715
Daddy!

24
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,179
Move the train!
Move the train!

25
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,868
Hey, man, are you okay?

26
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,249
Yeah, I think so.

27
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,047
She's epileptic.

28
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,466
Come on, let's get you up.

29
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,470
You all right?
Here we go.

30
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,432
Hey, sweetie, I'm okay.

31
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,100
Daddy?

32
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,598
I found this case in the ER.

33
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:07,270
White male, mid-30s, loss of
consciousness, abnormal EKG,

34
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,524
and he's the subway hero.

35
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,653
Your enthusiasm is impressive.

36
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,281
Wish I could say the same
about your presentation.

37
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,076
Everybody knows you lead with
your most interesting symptom.

38
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,997
You're right, EKG is more
interesting than loss of consciousness.

39
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,141
So I think we should do...

40
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,958
God! She's still talking,
make it stop.

41
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,796
House's world view doesn't
include random acts of self-sacrifice.

42
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,423
He's gonna count heroism as a
symptom until proven otherwise.

43
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,342
The guy did a wonderful thing.

44
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,010
Can't we just take
that at face value?

45
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,179
You are adorable.

46
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,972
Heroism does exist.

47
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,993
What about the guy who
landed the plane in the Hudson?

48
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,478
News flash, that guy
was already on the plane.

49
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,539
For all we know he would have
killed everyone else on board

50
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,940
if it increased his chances.

51
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,608
Faced with almost certain death,

52
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,360
a normal person rides the pine.

53
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,486
What about firefighters?

54
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,363
The guys who undergo
months of training

55
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,532
to deny their own instincts
for self-preservation?

56
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,200
And the patient
isn't a firefighter.

57
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,160
He plays a bass in a band.

58
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,498
So humanity is apathetic
and self-serving?

59
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,624
Yeah.

60
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,877
I was mugged once. When I
saw the gun, my legs went out.

61
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,438
I always thought
it was "fight or flight,"

62
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,190
didn't know it was
"fight or flight or faint."

63
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,426
Laugh all you want, the other
100 people stayed on that platform.

64
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,344
That's a normal
response to danger.

65
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,014
The coward has spoken. Our
patient's problem is neurological.

66
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,266
Sympathetic stimulation.

67
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,768
Stress to the brain triggers
a response in the heart.

68
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,812
Go forth and look for masses

69
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,564
in Clark Kent's limbic system.

70
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,786
Seems like you're
getting a bit of attention.

71
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,532
Everyone keeps going out
of their way, asking me if I need anything.

72
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,242
It's kind of nice.

73
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,120
So what happened out there?

74
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,997
I don't really remember.

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just images, like flashes.
I kind of went on autopilot.

76
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,920
My memory doesn't go back into
real time until I was in the ambulance.

77
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,965
I read that's pretty common for
people in life-or-death situations.

78
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,884
- Jack.
- Honey.

79
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,719
This is my wife Eva.

80
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,804
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

81
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,056
They're just doing some tests.

82
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,058
How's Daisy?

83
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,479
She's not so good, actually.

84
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,815
She watched her father
jump in front of a train.

85
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,401
She's still shaking,
she can't stop crying.

86
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,819
Why would you do that to her?

87
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,321
He saved a woman's life.

88
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,405
He could have died.

89
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,992
Did you even think
about your family?

90
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,578
I need your advice.

91
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,624
Dinner with your
mom on Thursday...

92
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,169
It's my birthday.

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,297
I know.
I'm definitely coming.

94
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,926
Wilson's got tickets to the
Hong Kong Film Festival.

95
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,969
Ever since his break-up
he's been a mess.

96
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,739
I haven't been able to
tell him that I'm not going.

97
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,556
So maybe if you
happen to see him,

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,808
you can mention how
important this is.

99
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,981
You should go.

100
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,776
What? I can't.
It's your birthday.

101
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:05,281
It's fine. It's sweet that
you care about your friend.

102
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,784
And frankly, as you will
find out sooner or later,

103
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,953
my mother is a handful.

104
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,123
Go.

105
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,836
I need your advice.
This film festival...

106
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,714
I have had these
tickets for two months.

107
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,009
Yeah, I know.
I'm definitely coming.

108
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,177
Okay.

109
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,889
But Thursday is Cuddy's birthday
and her mom's coming down.

110
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,015
It's a whole dinner thing.

111
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,726
And I thought,
maybe if you see her,

112
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,688
you could mention how
upset you've been...

113
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,856
You have to go.

114
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,193
Your girlfriend's birthday?
It's not even a question.

115
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,570
She has one every year.

116
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,947
How often do you break
up with the love of your life?

117
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,150
Okay, for you, it's more
often than most, but still...

118
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,243
I'm a big boy,
I think I'll survive.

119
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,042
I will definitely
make this up to you.

120
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,694
Hey.

121
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,571
Am I imagining things,

122
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,449
or did I see a billboard with your
face on it on my way home tonight?

123
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,076
Was my whole face there?
'Cause I just saw the nose.

124
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,287
I thought you
said they were taking a picture

125
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,830
of a bunch of doctors together.

126
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,292
They did. I have no idea
how it ended up just me.

127
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,961
Well, you are pretty cute.

128
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,798
You're flirting with me?

129
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,763
Don't see anyone
else in the room.

130
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,768
What?

131
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,311
I don't know.

132
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,022
Things have been a
little tense around here

133
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,983
since that whole
online-boyfriend thing.

134
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,112
Phil's not my boyfriend. I'm
not the one with the problem.

135
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,615
No, you're the one with
feelings for someone else.

136
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,826
You're still my husband,

137
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,915
I still love you,

138
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,754
and I want things
to be okay between us.

139
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,593
Also, you're a famous
model now. That's pretty cool.

140
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,720
Sexy, even.

141
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,943
So I advance through
the carotid bifurcation?

142
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,152
Are you asking?

143
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,696
Yes, I'm asking.

144
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,866
I've only read how to do it, but
practice is different than theory.

145
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,493
Just tell me how to do it.

146
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,830
You're gonna inject dye just
past the takeoff of the optic artery.

147
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,790
Now?

148
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,003
His BP's going up, the
procedure's stressing his body.

149
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,547
What do I do?

150
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,631
Hold on a minute.

151
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,300
Just give him a chance
to regain equilibrium.

152
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,428
BP's up, heart rate's 180.

153
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,512
What should I do?

154
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,472
Give me the catheter,
get the crash cart.

155
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,184
He's in cardiac arrest.

156
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,147
Maybe your second
time will go better.

157
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:32,905
So we finally know what Taub
would look like if he were life-size.

158
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,907
Can we go back
to the office now?

159
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,992
You kidding?

160
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,162
We got a differential to
run. Cardiac arrhythmia...

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,040
That poster got me laid when I got
home last night, SO do your worst.

162
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,042
Arrhythmia proves I was right.

163
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,628
Jack's problem is his
heart, not his brain.

164
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,089
So when you're not on a
billboard you sleep with nurses,

165
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,425
but when you are you
sleep with your wife.

166
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,760
I think you got that backwards.

167
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,344
That's my elbow in the corner.

168
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,721
What's your wife doing later?

169
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,347
Huh. They chose you
and cut out Chase?

170
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,394
Apparently, Marketing thinks
my face is the most trustworthy.

171
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,519
For real?

172
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,230
Both of our
patient's cardiac incidents

173
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,274
happened after physical stress.

174
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,860
I'm guessing vasovagal syncope.

175
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,028
Buzzkill.

176
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,280
Vasovagal syncope would
manifest at a much younger age.

177
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,364
Could be drugs.

178
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,491
Tox screen was clean.

179
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,785
What about autonomic
nervous system dysfunction?

180
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,912
Could cause arrhythmia
and fainting.

181
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,214
Inappropriate? I mean
because of the Jew thing?

182
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,301
Autonomic nervous
system dysfunction. I like it.

183
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,094
Let's biopsy his
pituitary gland.

184
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,138
Adrenal venous sampling
makes more sense,

185
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,224
and it is a less
invasive procedure.

186
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,852
Which you don't care about because
you just want to check the pituitary

187
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,231
because you still think there's
something wrong with the guy's brain?

188
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,774
Can't fool you.

189
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,151
He has no other symptoms
for pituitary disease.

190
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,861
We can't stick
a needle in his brain

191
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,214
because you don't
believe in heroism.

192
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,572
Fine, do it your way.

193
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,617
You'll waste half a day, but I'm
sure he's in no hurry to get better.

194
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,330
The autonomic nervous system
controls involuntary actions,

195
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,456
like your heartbeat.

196
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,209
If we're right, it's
manageable, but will progress.

197
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,753
Do you think we could
consult with him?

198
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,134
I didn't know
you knew Dr. Taub.

199
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,261
I don't.

200
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,888
You saw the ads.

201
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,890
Look, no offense, but
you were wrong yesterday.

202
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,785
And they wouldn't have made
him the face of the hospital

203
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,269
if he weren't
really good, right?

204
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,613
Dr. Taub.

205
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,449
The patient would
like to see you.

206
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,125
How can I help?

207
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,318
I forgot, you guys talk.

208
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,362
Look, no offense
to either of you,

209
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,489
but dinner with
your mom? Come on.

210
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,950
I'd have to act like
a decent human being.

211
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,702
You know what a strain
that puts on me.

212
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,287
And, you,

213
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,639
ever since you
broke up with Sam,

214
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,248
you've done nothing
but mope and whine.

215
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,708
It's an unbelievable bummer.

216
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,252
And just what is SO exciting

217
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,546
you have to blow off
both of us to do it?

218
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,386
I just want to sit on my couch
in my underwear, drink scotch,

219
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,388
and watch The Real
Housewives of New Jersey.

220
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,767
By myself. I just
want one night off.

221
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,101
Is that so much to ask?

222
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,394
Yes.
Yes.

223
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,022
You have to choose one of us.

224
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,442
I choose Wilson.

225
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,906
Good, because he's coming
to my birthday dinner.

226
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,745
I do not whine.

227
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,546
Jack's not exactly
the hero-type.

228
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,257
He started this band in college.

229
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,427
They gig around the country,
looking for their big break.

230
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,305
It's been 16 years.

231
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,848
That must be hard
on you and Daisy.

232
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,226
It's like I'm a single parent.

233
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,233
I love him so much,

234
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,154
but I'm at the end of my rope.

235
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,243
What Jack did yesterday
was so incredible,

236
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,580
our boss assumed his illness had
something to do with his behavior.

237
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,916
But if that's not the case,

238
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,503
there's more to
him than you think.

239
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,011
You think Taub
really comes across

240
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,138
as the most
trustworthy doctor here?

241
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,182
I knew it was bugging you.

242
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,685
They cut me out.

243
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,853
You're a pretty boy.

244
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,997
Works well with the ladies,

245
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,123
not so much with the patients.

246
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,816
No one wants an underwear
model performing their splenectomy.

247
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,003
I notice they weren't exactly
knocking down your door

248
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,107
looking for
Dr. Trustworthy.

249
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,154
That's 'cause I'm black.

250
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,116
Cortisol levels look
normal. We were wrong.

251
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,160
Which House will
interpret as him being right.

252
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,288
He's gonna make us biopsy
the pituitary gland.

253
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,129
You seem pretty calm for a
guy who's surrounded by racists.

254
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,883
80% of the Princeton
population is white.

255
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,301
Some are racist, some aren't.

256
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
White works with
both demographics.

257
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,387
So race IS your excuse,

258
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,014
not the fact that
you usually look like

259
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,475
you're about to punch
someone in the face?

260
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,062
We're good.

261
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
02 sats are dropping.

262
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,232
He's not breathing. Suction.

263
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,866
Sats are coming back.

264
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,578
Mucus plug. That's weird.

265
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,167
Fluid in the lungs.

266
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,251
Pneumonitis?

267
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,670
That doesn't fit
with anyone's theory.

268
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,845
Our tests finally
rule out the brain.

269
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,098
That leaves
the heart and the lungs.

270
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,016
Pneumonitis can be
caused by bacteria,

271
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,102
parasite, some kind
of obstruction...

272
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,853
Who was the girl on the tracks?

273
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,816
News story said her name's Chloe
Jefferies. Why does that matter?

274
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,752
'Cause there's another
reason besides being sick

275
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,820
that he'd risk his
life for a stranger.

276
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,113
She's not a stranger.

277
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,741
The damsel in distress
is an epileptic,

278
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,202
SO we assumed she was
having an epileptic seizure.

279
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,204
But what if she wasn't.
What if she's sick, too?

280
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,414
Jack is away a lot, on tour.

281
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,220
What happens on the road
stays on the road.

282
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,627
The most likely cause of
pneumonitis is infection.

283
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,546
Shouldn't we be getting
a sputum culture?

284
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,949
There's no significant elevation
in white blood cell count.

285
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,328
This is more like
toxic exposure.

286
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,383
He's got a point.

287
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,136
Why is your assumption
of his guilt

288
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,221
more valid than my
assumption of his selflessness?

289
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:17,476
Because my assumption is backed
up by millions of men, and Taub,

290
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,436
who've cheated on their wives.

291
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,898
Find the girl and the love nest.

292
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,984
Every hero has his Kryptonite.

293
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,863
Hello?

294
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,382
So we're breaking into
this girl's apartment

295
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,824
because House thinks
that two people

296
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,494
standing 30 feet apart on a
subway platform have to be lovers.

297
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,288
God, you're a drag today.

298
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,582
Let me guess. You're back
to fighting with the wife?

299
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,749
No.

300
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,920
We had sex again last night,
twice. And again this morning.

301
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,630
Oh.

302
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:53,053
Rachel hasn't wanted this
much intimacy in a long time.

303
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,807
I don't think it's me she's
hot for, it's this Internet guy.

304
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,103
She's just happy and
that's turning her on.

305
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,022
So she's not cheating on you

306
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,608
and you're getting all
the action you can handle.

307
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,151
I don't see the downside.

308
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,739
What was Jack's band called?

309
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,283
Suicide something.

310
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,036
Suicide Season.
She does know him.

311
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,205
Question is,
how'd they get sick?

312
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,540
Kryptonite.

313
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,799
EKG's unremarkable. Thyroid,
liver and kidney function seems fine.

314
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,384
You're perfectly healthy.

315
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,511
I wish that you would
take a second look.

316
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,848
I'm tired all the time
and when it's cold,

317
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,975
I get this weird
pain in my shoulder.

318
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,227
I have a pain in my leg,

319
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,978
you don't hear me complaining.

320
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,147
Except for just now.

321
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,819
How do doctors get this idea
you're better than everyone else?

322
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,490
Probably all that pulling people
back from the brink of death.

323
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,492
It's just a guess.

324
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,703
My own daughter's a doctor.

325
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,289
She makes a hobby of
dismissing my concerns.

326
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,666
She sounds smart.

327
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,210
Did she tell you to say that?

328
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,463
I've never met your daughter.

329
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,050
That's hard to believe, since
you're currently shtupping her.

330
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,864
We have a situation.

331
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,742
Roach bombs, where?

332
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,035
In Chloe's apartment.

333
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,537
Who's Chloe?

334
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,416
Look, we don't care
about your personal life,

335
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,559
we're not gonna
tell your wife...

336
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,211
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

337
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,464
Guess who showed up
looking for Jack.

338
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,632
Hey.

339
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,759
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

340
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,012
The EMT said you'd gone
to another hospital.

341
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,139
They held me overnight
for observation,

342
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,558
I'm fine. I had to
come here to...

343
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,148
I don't know why you
did it, but thank you.

344
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,943
You're welcome.

345
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,489
I should have brought
flowers, or something.

346
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,783
You're like my guardian angel.

347
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,578
No, I'm just a guy in a band.

348
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,913
Maybe you've heard of
them? Suicide Season.

349
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,666
One of my nurses gave me the CD.

350
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,752
I haven't had a chance
to listen to it yet,

351
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,172
but I have a feeling I'm
going to be your biggest fan.

352
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,342
I'm gonna need you to cough.

353
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,260
What are you doing?

354
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,803
Getting a sputum culture.

355
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,848
They obviously don't know each
other, so it's not toxic exposure.

356
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,601
Just leaves my theory,
infection.

357
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:50,647
If you could just cough up a
sample, we can test for pathogens.

358
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,445
Sorry. Sorry. There's nothing...
There's nothing coming up.

359
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,614
Well, maybe I can help you.

360
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,826
- It hurts!
- What's the matter?

361
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,541
Round, equal, reactive
to light, it's not a stroke.

362
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,629
No, it's not my head,
it's my ears.

363
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,596
When I saw her
lying there I thought,

364
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,807
I can't just stand
here and let her die.

365
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,394
She has her
whole life to live.

366
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,023
He didn't jump because he was
sick or because he knew that girl.

367
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,608
Even you have to admit that now.

368
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,403
Yes, but that doesn't make him
a hero, it just makes him an idiot.

369
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,963
The only reason that
headline doesn't say

370
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,948
"Moron crushed
by train" is luck.

371
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,951
Next headline is gonna be
"Moron goes undiagnosed

372
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,370
"because doctors won't
talk about his ear pain."

373
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,080
Ear pain fits with my theory.

374
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,958
Jack has an infection
that spread to his mastoid.

375
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,543
Great, we'll
confirm that in a week

376
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,461
when your secret
cultures have sprouted.

377
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,546
Am I in trouble?

378
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,381
I only get mad
when you waste my time,

379
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,258
I couldn't care
less about yours.

380
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,361
But let me know when they come
back negative and I'll mock you.

381
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,845
- You have a better idea?
- No.

382
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,056
So I'm gonna pick one at
random. Acoustic neuroma?

383
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,975
A tumor
in the ear. Makes sense.

384
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,620
And if it's putting pressure on
the breathing centers in his brain,

385
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,645
it explains the lungs.

386
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,272
The lungs explain the heart.

387
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,525
Evoked auditory potential test.

388
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,111
This counts as my time.

389
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,738
You guys got this?

390
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,995
I have been going out of my way

391
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,081
to be nice to old Jewish
ladies for months now,

392
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,459
on the off chance one of
them could be your mom.

393
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,252
You couldn't have
mentioned she's a shiksa?

394
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,547
She converted when
she married my dad.

395
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,882
You see, now is too late.

396
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,467
I'm not blaming you for this.

397
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,820
She's the one who ambushed
you to find out what you were like

398
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,244
because "I never
tell her anything."

399
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,033
I'd have to agree
with her on that one.

400
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,226
Anyway, I obviously
can't come to dinner now.

401
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,352
Obviously?

402
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,730
She's crazy and she hates me.

403
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,856
House,

404
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,401
I need you to come to
that dinner for two hours,

405
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,904
keep your mouth shut
and behave like an adult.

406
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,656
Yes, you will be in hell,

407
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,075
but I will feel better
having you there.

408
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,495
That is what a relationship is.

409
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,164
We average our misery.

410
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,587
That was

411
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,964
unexpected.

412
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,883
I'm having a good day.

413
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,944
I finally resolved
that thing with my sister.

414
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:25,969
What thing?

415
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,681
We had the worst fight over whether
it's time to put Dad in that facility.

416
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,517
I've been sick
over it for weeks.

417
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,977
You never mentioned
anything about your sister.

418
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,700
I actually talked
a lot about it with Phil.

419
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,110
I should be getting back.

420
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:48,283
It's fine now.
It's no big deal.

421
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,996
Are you in love with him?

422
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,293
I've never met him.

423
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,974
Waves one and three
normal at 70 decibels.

424
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,853
It's been 37 minutes
and everything is normal.

425
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,982
House was wrong again,
he doesn't have a tumor.

426
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,151
House doesn't usually accept
"we gave up halfway" as an answer.

427
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,575
If I could get fluid closer
to the sources of infection,

428
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,036
I could get better
cultures, prove my theory.

429
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,331
I'm gonna set up for an ear
drainage and a thoracentesis.

430
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,334
I'll only be wasting my time.

431
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,342
She's a student.
Somebody's got to go with her.

432
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,560
I saved that girl.
I did that.

433
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,230
I'm really proud of you.

434
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,859
This whole thing
has made me wonder

435
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,237
if things could be different.

436
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,115
I have spent so much
time away from you.

437
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,451
Yeah, well.
You love your music.

438
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,036
But it's not just that.

439
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,080
I think that I have been

440
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,459
afraid.

441
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:25,255
That I would screw things up,

442
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,885
that I couldn't be the man you
and Daisy needed me to be.

443
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,805
But maybe I'm better than that.

444
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,932
Hmm?

445
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,606
I am going to quit the band.

446
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,656
I think we'd like that.

447
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,407
Uh-oh.

448
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,470
- Hey, how's the ear pain?
- It's better with the drugs,

449
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,245
but it still really hurts.

450
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,707
We are going to take some fluid
samples from your ear and your lung.

451
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,378
Can you get up? Lean
forward. Lean on this.

452
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,090
Okay, this is Lidocaine.
It'll numb you up.

453
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,549
Okay.

454
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,559
This is weird.

455
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,103
What's the matter?

456
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,607
The pain in my ear is gone.

457
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,777
Gone? Completely?

458
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,614
Yeah. When you
stuck me in the back.

459
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,493
What does that mean?

460
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,007
Okay. I'm just
cutting that for you.

461
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,554
Is she going to
eat anything else,

462
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,848
or just the cheese and crackers?

463
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,475
She's going through a
picky phase, it won't kill her.

464
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,477
You're her mother.

465
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,732
All I know is, when you and
your sister were growing up

466
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,651
you ate what we ate, NO excuses.

467
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,827
Would you pass the salt?

468
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,084
She had eggs
this morning and lots of fruit.

469
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,295
Ah! That explains it.

470
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,379
Explains what?

471
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,424
She was a little vilder chaiah
at the park this afternoon.

472
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,634
She wouldn't listen
to anything I said.

473
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,052
Must have been all the sugar.

474
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,439
Actually, the whole

475
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,640
sugar-makes-kids-hyperactive
thing is a myth.

476
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,019
It's a study.

477
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,063
I'm sure it's very interesting.

478
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,734
I didn't read any studies,
I just raised children.

479
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,947
It's not your fault.

480
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,092
How are you supposed to keep
up with what she eats all day?

481
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,201
You're never home.

482
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,999
I'm sorry, I have to get this.

483
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,630
Tell me you need me.

484
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,964
Jack doesn't have cancer.

485
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,800
God, that's awful.
I'll be right in.

486
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,806
Masters stuck him in the back
with Lidocaine and his ear pain went away.

487
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,887
We don't need you here,

488
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,052
we just need to figure out why this
guy's body thinks his ear is on his back.

489
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,393
'Cause his ear used
to be something else.

490
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,813
When you're a fetus, your
cells are close together,

491
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,981
when you grow, they
spread out and specialize.

492
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,318
Sometimes the body screws up
and they keep the old area codes,

493
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,903
still report to
the same pain centers.

494
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,071
Referred pain.

495
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,031
Looks and brains.

496
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,407
When you stuck him in the back,

497
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,244
you cut off communication with
the pain centers in his spinal cord.

498
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,139
So we just need to figure out where
the message is actually coming from.

499
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,373
What about his thyroid?

500
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,018
Hyperthyroidism would
explain all his symptoms.

501
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,168
Or it could be his liver.

502
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,395
Good.
We'll take a look at both.

503
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,255
For the record,
referred pain does not

504
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,898
rule out infection.
If it's spreading...

505
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,151
Were you like this when you
were working for your math degree?

506
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,677
If Euclid had been
a guest lecturer,

507
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,571
would you have been the kid
sitting in the front row going,

508
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,740
"Actually, you haven't proven
the Pythagorean theorem."

509
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,349
Hello?

510
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,021
All right.

511
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,772
Mom?

512
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,066
Thank you, sweetie.

513
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,617
So say you two got married,
would you convert to Judaism?

514
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,786
We haven't gotten that far, Mom.

515
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,247
That's actually a really
interesting question.

516
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,418
I'm an atheist.

517
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,462
Honey, half the
Jews I know are atheists.

518
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,047
It's about community.

519
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,550
House isn't that
big on community.

520
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,052
And why do you call him House?

521
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:45,098
The man's name is Greg. It
makes it seem like you're not serious.

522
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,475
I'm just trying to help
you think about the future.

523
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,978
You're a certain age now.

524
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,189
The parade of boyfriends
can't be as amusing as it was.

525
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,817
You need to settle down,
like your sister.

526
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,069
Settling down isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

527
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,656
Next week is Sam's birthday and I
was gonna take her to the Poconos.

528
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,161
That's very sad.

529
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,664
Perhaps not the best choice
of topic for a festive occasion.

530
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,752
I just don't want Rachel
growing up thinking you're a slut.

531
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,465
Okay. I got this.
First of all, Mom...

532
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,972
Oh, my God.

533
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,399
Did you sedate my mother?

534
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,778
It kicked in just in time.

535
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,781
She'll wake up in a couple
of hours, be good as new.

536
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,283
Think of it as my
birthday gift to you.

537
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,954
You told me to
keep my mouth shut.

538
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,477
This was the only
way I had a chance.

539
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,084
Leaving aside the
fact that House Is a sociopath,

540
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,921
I have to admit that
I'm honestly relieved.

541
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,007
Your mom is quite a handful.

542
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,551
What? I feel...

543
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,932
You've got to be
kidding me. You drug...

544
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,227
Sorry. I honestly
thought you'd be worse.

545
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,314
That was my gift to myself.

546
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,866
I take it Jack's
thyroid levels are normal.

547
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,327
Foreman is doing
a liver biopsy now.

548
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,412
Good.

549
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,955
What's up with you?

550
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,332
Nothing. I'm peachy.

551
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,587
It's hard when you feel
like you've been replaced.

552
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,341
We got a new puppy once,

553
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,721
and our old cocker spaniel
just moped for weeks.

554
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,557
Have you even had sex?

555
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,660
We're not talking about me,
we're talking about you.

556
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,812
No, you're talking about
puppies, and I'm not listening.

557
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,569
She wants to do it all the time,

558
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,822
but it has nothing
to do with me.

559
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,198
I'm just a piece of meat.

560
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,325
Well, she likes someone else,

561
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,703
and you've slept
with other people.

562
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,954
Uh...

563
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,206
Why are you still together?

564
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,419
I love her.

565
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,838
We've been together
for 22 years.

566
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,466
I've never loved anybody else.

567
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,803
I don't know how
to not be with her.

568
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,224
So you're never
gonna cheat again.

569
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,561
I don't know.

570
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,418
That seems kind of
selfish, doesn't it?

571
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,117
Foreman found diffuse
inflammation in Jack's liver.

572
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,620
Looks like autoimmune hepatitis.

573
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,581
He's starting him on steroids.

574
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,601
Isn't this nice?

575
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,025
What's this note?
Does that sound like an A?

576
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,777
Remember if I put
my finger like this

577
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,404
without this
do-hickey on it, it's an F.

578
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,489
Hmm?

579
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,949
Hmm.

580
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,660
Can we read a book instead?

581
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,663
Yes, we...

582
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,541
Jack? Jack!

583
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,625
Help him!

584
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,293
Come on. Come on.

585
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,213
Okay. Okay.

586
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,596
He seized three
times last night.

587
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,014
We got him stabilized,
but barely.

588
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,934
If there was nothing wrong with
his brain before, there sure is now.

589
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,770
Any particular reason we
need to be looking at the patient?

590
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,188
Yes.

591
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,900
Cuddy's mom is in my
office. And she looks mad.

592
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,819
What did you do?

593
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,197
Our patient also developed
a raging fever overnight.

594
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,867
That means Masters was right
all along. This is an infection.

595
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,219
Should we give you
a minute to gloat?

596
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,953
We still don't know
what kind of infection.

597
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,664
It could be bacterial, viral,
fungal. Until the cultures...

598
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,374
You are the worst gloater ever.

599
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,168
Her starting those
cultures when she did

600
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,086
means we're 24 hours
closer to the answer.

601
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,546
"We're sorry
your husband croaked,

602
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,465
"but at least we were 24
hours closer to the answer."

603
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,551
Let's narrow it down, shall we?

604
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,388
Four days ago the guy was
face-down in the subway.

605
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,557
God only knows
what's in that sludge.

606
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,352
Toxic fumes make him pass
out. Rat pee does the rest.

607
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,397
If it's leptospirosis, it's the
fastest-moving case in history.

608
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,983
Leptospirosis can
turn into meningitis.

609
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,902
I can't confirm any of this yet.

610
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,070
We don't have time
to choose wrong.

611
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,781
It fits,

612
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,702
and since it's the only idea
on the table, I say it's a winner.

613
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,830
Start him on doxycycline.
No, wait.

614
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,540
I'll do it.

615
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,294
You guys have to go back to the
office, tell me when bubbie's gone.

616
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,482
You a doctor?

617
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,608
Sure.

618
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,070
You're on new meds.
Go back to sleep.

619
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,657
Am I gonna die?

620
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,741
I hope not.

621
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,327
'Cause then I'd have
to go back to my office.

622
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,996
Of course, if you do kick it,

623
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,542
then you get to be famous for
another two, maybe three weeks.

624
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,919
They're saying I'm a hero.

625
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,838
Yeah, but, you know,
in a few days

626
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,925
a panda bear will give birth
to triplets and we'll all move on.

627
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,054
Oh, I'm sorry. You actually
believe that you are a hero.

628
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,640
You should get yourself
some tights and a cape

629
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,893
and you can run around Gotham
pulling babies out of burning buildings.

630
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,812
Maybe you'll keep getting lucky.

631
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,232
You're still the same
guy you were last week.

632
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,824
Hey, how long are
you gonna sit there?

633
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,284
Could be hours.

634
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:24,372
Hiding behind a sick guy,
that's heroic.

635
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,483
Look, I can explain.

636
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,902
Sometimes I mix
up my medication...

637
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,946
I don't need you
to explain anything.

638
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,032
I think we both know

639
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,328
that I owe you an apology.

640
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,580
Say what?

641
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,333
I don't even remember
going to bed last night.

642
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,960
I must have had
too much to drink.

643
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,504
I do know I can be difficult.

644
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,632
You were a little bitchy.

645
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,552
In the clinic, you were
a complete schmendrick.

646
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:24,265
But once you knew I was Lisa's
mother, you held your tongue.

647
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,060
That's because you love her.

648
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,814
I still think you're a pain in
the ass with a God complex,

649
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,400
and I'll kill you
if you hurt her.

650
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,861
But I'm glad she has you.

651
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,518
We don't have to hug now, do we?

652
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,658
What do you think?

653
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,286
I've got a train to catch.

654
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,514
I thought you were
staying till Sunday.

655
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,540
I'm coming down with a cold.

656
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,959
Every time I stay
with Lisa or her sister,

657
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,504
one of those rugrats
gets me sick.

658
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,256
Children are awful.

659
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,816
Did she have a rash recently?

660
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,234
No. What's going on?

661
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,611
Feverish, itchy?

662
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,695
No.

663
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,993
What's she doing here, anyway?

664
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,930
It's the middle of the morning.
Shouldn't she be in school?

665
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,264
I'm keeping her
out for a few days.

666
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,349
There's been
a little outbreak of-...

667
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,374
Chicken pox.

668
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,395
Sorry, but if I'd let
you finish that sentence,

669
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,059
that would have been
much less impressive.

670
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,631
Chicken pox is no
big deal for kids,

671
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:43,553
but it's a terrible, horrible, no
good, very bad deal for grownups.

672
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,222
You think Jack has chicken pox?

673
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,058
But he doesn't have blisters, he's
not itchy. And Daisy never got it.

674
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,311
I know. Again, that's why it's
so impressive that I figured it out.

675
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,064
5% of cases present
without blisters.

676
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,482
The kid was just a carrier.

677
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,610
I'm gonna start you on
anti-varicella gamma globulin,

678
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,821
which will save your life.

679
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,699
But it won't make me a hero.

680
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,468
How are you feeling?
Hey.

681
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,678
Like I'm not gonna die.

682
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,601
I can't wait to take you home.

683
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,189
The guys called.

684
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,692
All this press has got
us a couple new gigs.

685
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:43,696
Just a few more dates.
Three weeks tops.

686
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,157
But you said... I know. I know.

687
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,341
Three weeks isn't so bad.

688
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,093
It's not three weeks.

689
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,263
This is what he's always
done. Just one more tour.

690
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,183
I'm sorry.

691
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,896
The pathetic thing is, I let myself
believe that he could change,

692
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,190
he could be this other guy.

693
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,791
There's nothing worse
than loving someone

694
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,403
who's never gonna
stop disappointing you.

695
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,378
Culture confirmed Jack
does have chicken pox.

696
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,797
It just took six hours longer.

697
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,924
Autopsy works, too.

698
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,052
FYI, it turns out
your hero is a loser.

699
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,303
He's going back on the road.

700
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,347
He still risked his
life for that woman.

701
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,099
That was impulse.
It was easy.

702
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,226
Dealing with family is hard.

703
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,312
Wait, that's another
thing I got right.

704
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,855
How many does that make?

705
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,401
And how many for you?

706
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,613
I'm also kicking
your ass at gloating.

707
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,912
Hi.

708
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,084
I think we should get a divorce.

709
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,092
You have feelings for him,
and I can't handle that.

710
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,725
But it's my fault you
needed someone else.

711
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,184
I keep hurting you.

712
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,603
We love each other.

713
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,729
I know.

714
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,441
But are you happy?

715
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,778
No.

716
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,116
Then what are we doing?

717
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,879
You know, you turned out
remarkably close to normal,

718
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,089
considering the genes in play.

719
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,215
Thanks.

720
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,802
Here. In case your
mom comes back.

721
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,263
Happy birthday.

722
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,101
You are a sweet, sweet man.

723
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,146
You coming over?

724
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,314
Yes.

725
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,983
Oh, no, I can't.

726
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,527
Wilson?

727
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,906
It's bowling night.

728
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,116
He'd never
forgive me if I don't.

729
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,328
No, screw it, I'm coming.

730
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,663
No, no, no.

731
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,207
I am not gonna be
responsible for that.

732
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,043
You drugged the man,
you go bowling with him.

733
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,922
But my chances for sex are
considerably lower with Wilson.

734
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,717
Fine.

735
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,975
Hey. You ready?

736
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,853
Here's the thing...

737
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,871
Well, it's about me, too,

738
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,414
and I have my boundaries, Dina.

739
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,375
And they're clearly being crossed
by you and your entire family,

740
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,478
making hate pages... WOMAN 2:
That's not true. That has nothing to do...

741
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,212
We all need improvements, Dina,

742
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,964
and I've formed my opinion
on you.

743
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,984
- No, don't shush me, Dina.
- No, I will shush you

744
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,885
because you're not
letting me finish.
