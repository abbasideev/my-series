1
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,509
Darrien?

2
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,353
What the hell happened?
We got to get you to a hospital.

3
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,296
No, no, you're a doctor,
just stitch me up.

4
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,815
It's more complicated
than that. We need to...

5
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,757
The cops will be waiting
for me at the hospital.

6
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,361
They're gonna bust me back
inside just for being with felons.

7
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,554
You stay here, they bust me.

8
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,181
I can't go back, Remy.
Neither can I.

9
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,267
God forbid, you die,
I'm up for manslaughter.

10
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,354
I'll find someone else.

11
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,064
You leave, you bleed out.

12
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,026
You're gonna die. Stop!

13
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,868
Promise me you won't
take me to the hospital.

14
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,622
I promise.

15
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,018
Look at how much
fun she's having.

16
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,502
That's because he has
two functioning legs

17
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,463
capable of supporting
her body weight.

18
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,173
So do I.

19
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,592
You told me most of
your muscle was cut out.

20
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,197
I was going for
the sympathy discount.

21
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,472
Been taking some
experimental medicine.

22
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,475
Yeah, I got a lot of clients
on experimental medicine.

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,226
You want proof?

24
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,400
Okay, this amp stack weighs
way more than you do.

25
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,159
See?

26
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,204
Now, even if those implants
were made of adamantium,

27
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,789
I'd still be able to...

28
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,172
Sorry. Cramp.

29
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,924
I'm sure.

30
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,854
I'm not gonna be needing
your services tonight after all.

31
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,119
Bowel's intact.
Inferior vena cava is fine.

32
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,788
Your liver got nicked,

33
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,040
but it feels clotted off.

34
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,548
I don't see any other
signs of internal bleeding.

35
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,801
So I'm okay?
Define "okay".

36
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,221
Just because I don't see
bleeding doesn't mean it's not there.

37
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,351
105 over palp. I'm gonna check
your pressure every two minutes.

38
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,354
If you dip below 90, it means it
is there and we have a problem.

39
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,028
Oh, sorry.

40
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,034
I should get to work.
Wait.

41
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,871
We'll talk more in
the morning. Ruby...

42
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,164
Goodnight, Eric.

43
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,043
You two breaking up?

44
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,214
She's pregnant.

45
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,054
I need a drink.

46
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,102
There was a raid.

47
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,105
Andre needed to do something
to slow the cops down.

48
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,566
He stabbed you as a distraction?

49
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,193
It didn't work.

50
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,237
Cops called an ambulance,
left me lying there.

51
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,534
Come on, give me crap.

52
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,138
I know what I told
you about him,

53
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,081
but it's not his fault
I started using again.

54
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,833
It's mine.

55
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,506
What? According
to this, you're dead.

56
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,840
You have no blood pressure.

57
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,426
You barely have a pulse.

58
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,595
Am I dying? You're
talking and alert,

59
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,515
SO your brain is getting blood.

60
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:57,065
Pulse in your right arm
is fine, so is your BP.

61
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,911
Hello. THIRTEEN ON
PHONE: Are you busy?

62
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,707
Yeah, I'm about
to go out. Great.

63
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,709
Can you do me a huge favor?

64
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,937
I need you to go to the hospital

65
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,939
and check out a portable
ultrasound machine for me.

66
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,132
Who's the father? I have
a leak in my bathroom,

67
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,718
and my guy won't come take a
look at it till tomorrow morning,

68
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,972
and an emergency plumber
is 200 bucks an hour.

69
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,107
Dr. House.

70
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,400
Dr. Riggin.

71
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,486
Figured you'd be
wrapping up the trial by now.

72
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,572
I just wanted to give
you a hearty mazel tov.

73
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,156
And don't forget the Nobel Prize

74
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,742
for developing an incredibly
expensive rat poison.

75
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,579
What do you mean?
What happened?

76
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,746
Tumors.

77
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,082
Just look at these things.

78
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,428
Any indication the rats
were getting sick?

79
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,596
Just some cramping.

80
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,698
Their legs would stiffen up.

81
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,074
They were having
trouble moving around.

82
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,827
We just thought their bodies were
adjusting to the increase in muscle mass,

83
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,771
but in a day or so,
they just started dying.

84
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,609
Oh, well, get a new compound
to play with next week.

85
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,450
One portable ultrasound,
extra pepperoni.

86
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,870
Thank you so much.
I might be late tomorrow.

87
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,123
Your socks are dry. And
unfortunately, So is your shirt,

88
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,018
which means you either
just changed to greet me,

89
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,562
or you need this
for something medical.

90
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,338
I am a doctor.

91
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,809
She's my friend.

92
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,313
I was in prison.

93
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,846
You killed your own brother?

94
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,183
Yes, it was awful and
devastating, but it wasn't murder.

95
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,810
He was sick and
he wanted to die,

96
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,103
and I promised I would help.

97
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,897
Now please stop pacing
and help me find this thing.

98
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,859
Have you talked to anybody
about it? I mean, are you okay?

99
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,861
No, I may have
an aortic arch aneurysm.

100
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,071
Oh, wait, that's her.

101
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,281
Either help me or leave.

102
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm having trouble
getting a clear look.

103
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,203
Try a long axis view
from the suprasternal notch.

104
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,081
Wait! Put on some
gloves, she's got Hep-C.

105
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,958
Wonderful.

106
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,585
I take it you two
were cellmates.

107
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,212
Just friends.

108
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,464
She saved me.

109
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,134
There's a culture in prison.

110
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,897
If you don't have someone to show
you how to get the stuff you need,

111
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,389
or stay away from the stuff
you don't, you're screwed.

112
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,808
Her fingers are turning
blue. Can you move those?

113
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,560
My arm's starting to go numb.

114
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,312
Arch of the aorta's clear,
this can't be an aneurysm.

115
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,731
Maybe the wound threw a clot.

116
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,019
Check in axillary arteries.

117
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,155
Stop. Right there.

118
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,407
Five centimeter gooey mass.

119
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,825
Not a clot, maybe a lipoma?

120
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,160
What the hell is that?

121
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,704
A fat filled sack, probably
aggravated by the stab wound.

122
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,509
You got any syringes
in here? Give me that.

123
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,833
I was stabbed in my
gut, not in my arm.

124
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,502
You lost a lot of blood, gave
the lipoma room to swell.

125
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,672
It's compressing the arteries in
your arm, blocking your blood flow.

126
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,090
Maybe we can suck
some of it out.

127
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,425
You'll be fine.

128
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,178
Little pinch.

129
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,310
That's not a lipoma.

130
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,615
I don't know why she's even
considering having my kid.

131
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,116
She barely knows me.

132
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,243
All she knows is I'm
a short, balding guy.

133
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,037
That doesn't even make
evolutionary sense.

134
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,206
You want her to keep it? No.

135
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,541
'Cause you'd make a crappy dad.

136
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,044
I said, "No."
You're too selfish,

137
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,522
that's why you cheated on your
wife, why your marriage fell apart...

138
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,548
Dude, I said...
I know you.

139
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,968
The only reason you're sitting in
a strip club, ignoring the strip club,

140
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,732
is because you actually
are considering it.

141
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,898
Although, without
crappy dads in the world...

142
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,278
Try moving your fingers again.

143
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,040
Good, means it's almost drained.

144
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,335
Not good enough.

145
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,604
We don't know if
it's gonna come back,

146
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,838
we don't even know what it is.

147
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,840
Drugs, viruses, toxins
from that crack house,

148
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,323
and God knows where
else she's been.

149
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,735
If this were
caused by the drugs,

150
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,095
she'd have kidney failure,
cardiac involvement.

151
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,596
What about her Hep-C?

152
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,933
Could have fried her liver,
loses its synthetic function.

153
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,298
Then her entire body would
be swelling, not just her arm.

154
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,271
Leaves us with toxins.

155
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,207
Where exactly were you
when you were attacked?

156
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,631
You're not doing a home search
in a crack den. That's insane.

157
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,961
Apparently we don't
have much of a choice.

158
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,194
It's a crime scene.

159
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,863
And it's not toxins or viruses,

160
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,532
or anything else you mentioned
because it's not a coincidence.

161
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,617
Her symptoms have to be
related to the stabbing.

162
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,058
What if her body used up
all the clotting factors

163
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,208
dealing with the stab wound?

164
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,294
Explains the bloody mass.

165
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,772
But if you're right, she could
start bleeding anywhere.

166
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,107
Like, in her brain
or in her heart.

167
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,592
Wait, one of those things
could start growing in my brain?

168
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,532
It's time to get you
to the hospital.

169
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,889
No. Remy, you promised.

170
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,787
All we'll do at the hospital
is stick her in a patient bed

171
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,955
and give her IV clotting factor.

172
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,019
We can do that right here.

173
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,815
We could also
embalm her right here.

174
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,650
I'll call the drugs
and you go pick them up.

175
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,611
If I'm right, she'll be fine.

176
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,655
Look, I know you don't know her

177
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,782
and you don't care
about her, but I do.

178
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,953
Please.

179
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,938
Lie down, elevate your shoulder.

180
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,116
You said Andre wasn't
responsible for the drugs. What is?

181
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,784
I don't know.

182
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,787
Yes, you do.
What happened to you?

183
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,641
If you don't deal with
the real problem...

184
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,043
I came here because
you were a doctor,

185
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,586
not a shrink.

186
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,527
Your lap is vibrating.
Oh, sorry.

187
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,863
Ah, it's my boss.

188
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,616
Probably drunk, wants a
ride home. Let him take a cab.

189
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,870
Do you have any kids?

190
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,039
Why? You like moms?
I could be your mommy.

191
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,624
Spank your little ass.

192
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,293
Uh, no, I...

193
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,441
What would you do
if you got pregnant?

194
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:33,469
Not by me, at all, but by
some hypothetical guy,

195
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,222
who didn't wanna keep
the hypothetical kid,

196
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,283
what would be the least awful
way for him to tell you that?

197
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,434
Don't talk. Just let
mama dance for you.

198
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,983
Should I send flowers?

199
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,737
Maybe write the clinic
appointment on the little card?

200
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,239
"Surprise."

201
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,574
I hate myself!

202
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,994
There's just no good way to...

203
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,788
How long have you had
this mole? It's asymmetrical.

204
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,500
No touching.

205
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,335
Sorry.

206
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,091
Have you been to
see a dermatologist?

207
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,510
Bobby.

208
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,972
Oh. I wasn't touching her.
I was just...

209
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,349
Oh, God.

210
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,950
No.

211
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,538
No, please don't. Please...
Please put the gun down.

212
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,716
Put it down on the
ground and get away.

213
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,513
D?
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,016
I'm sorry.

215
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,228
I'm sorry.

216
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,565
D, what is it?

217
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,151
I'm so sorry.

218
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,528
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,814
Why aren't you in your bed?

220
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:56,403
I'll give ye splinters in yer
arse, ye mangy bilge rat.

221
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,947
What are you watching?

222
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,575
TV, you bloody scallywag.

223
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,204
Mom...

224
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,959
Someone better be dying.

225
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,884
She hallucinated.
I need you to go back out.

226
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,320
I just called in
more clotting factor.

227
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,054
So, she's bleeding
in her brain now?

228
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,014
We double up the dose,
she'll be fine.

229
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,434
We bring her to the hospital, we
do a CT scan to locate the bleed,

230
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,894
drill a burr hole in her skull,

231
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,479
and maybe she'll be fine.

232
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,189
We can drill a burr hole here.

233
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,608
You're not just risking
our careers here.

234
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,611
You could go back to prison.

235
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,863
I made a promise.

236
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,948
You made a promise?

237
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,575
I will not take her
to the hospital.

238
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,785
Great.

239
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,203
Then I will.

240
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,329
No.

241
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,707
I'm gonna move you, then
I'm gonna pick your friend up,

242
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,876
carry her down to my car,
take her to the hospital,

243
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,503
and try to save her life.

244
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,422
She's staying here.

245
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,548
Move.

246
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,385
Move!

247
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,238
She's going to the hospital.

248
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,548
Sweetie, go wait for Mommy
by the couch, okay? Go on.

249
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,679
I tried calling everyone else.

250
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,082
You were the last one
on the list.

251
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,767
Any reason why 911
wasn't on the list?

252
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,186
It's not an emergency.

253
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,353
Right.

254
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,273
Are you suicidal?

255
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm not attempting
bypass surgery.

256
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,529
The tumors are small and
they're close to the surface.

257
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,782
I thought it'd be
like removing a wart.

258
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,982
You couldn't wait till morning,

259
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,537
bring your CT scans
to an actual surgeon?

260
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,581
Surgeons are idiots.

261
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,001
They just hack away at the
muscle till they get worn out.

262
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,086
Or you're just ashamed
you've been injecting a drug

263
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,589
that hasn't even gone
through safety trials.

264
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,025
It's never even been
in the human body.

265
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,510
I got one of the tumors.
The second one is close.

266
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,262
You can use the CT to
help you find the third.

267
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,907
I'm taking you to the hospital.

268
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,059
Just excise the tumor.
Absolutely not!

269
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,659
Elevate her head more.

270
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,743
Don't bother.

271
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,412
The cops are gonna be
waiting at the front door.

272
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,457
I'll go in first.

273
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,377
I'll find a patient on life
support who's just waiting to die.

274
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,940
We'll use that name
on all your tests.

275
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,714
No one will ever
know you're there.

276
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,466
Thanks.

277
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,184
What happened to your leg?

278
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,844
I was trying to make it better.

279
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,857
He was being reckless.

280
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,359
Sit back, honey.

281
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,004
This isn't about making
your leg better.

282
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,488
It's about making
your life better.

283
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,823
Oh, here we go.

284
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,075
Wish I had called 911.

285
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,036
Why else would you risk your
life doing something so stupid?

286
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,373
Well, you know, I've had
a lot of setbacks lately.

287
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,333
Don't blame our
break-up for this.

288
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,129
You're not unhappy because
of me. You're just unhappy.

289
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,216
Unhappy people
do reckless things.

290
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,929
Darrien!

291
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,556
Stop screaming, my head hurts.

292
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,141
I need you to stay
awake, talk to me.

293
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,851
About what?

294
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,354
When you were screaming in my
room, what did you think you saw?

295
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,358
You said, "Put it down on
the ground and get away."

296
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,569
Sounds like a cop.

297
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,822
Old habits, I guess.

298
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,490
You were a cop?

299
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,659
Back when I was a decent person.

300
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,746
How do I not know this?
You knew everything...

301
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,582
Not a good resume when
you're trying to survive in prison.

302
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,544
So who were you talking
to in my bedroom?

303
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,172
Why did you keep apologizing?

304
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,758
Because I'm sorry.

305
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,051
For what?

306
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,430
I killed a kid.

307
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,600
He was 19.

308
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:43,065
I went in first, saw
him going for his gun.

309
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,528
I tried to talk him down, but...

310
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,120
They told me I was a hero.

311
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,417
So that's when you
started using drugs.

312
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,380
I'm sorry.

313
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,967
Darrien.

314
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,055
Darrien!

315
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,598
She lost consciousness.

316
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,568
There are no cars
coming, just go.

317
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,738
The light is red,
you bloody scallywag.

318
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,615
Stop with the pirate talk.

319
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,829
If you don't want Brownbeard
to end up with two wooden legs,

320
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,958
you should get your ma to
move this ship, ye mangy bilge rat.

321
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,460
Of course.

322
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,462
You showed her
that filthy cartoon.

323
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,299
What kind of idiot lets a
three-year-old watch that?

324
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,136
If you wanna lecture me
on my poor judgment,

325
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,013
there would seem to be
more relevant examples.

326
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,854
There you are.

327
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,480
You were in the VIP room so long

328
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,725
I thought you were gonna
pay off that girl's mortgage.

329
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,609
I got tossed out
by Bobby the Bouncer.

330
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,320
You touched her?

331
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,989
I was looking at her mole.

332
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,325
Genius!
Let's go home.

333
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,456
I wanna wait for the girl,
make sure that mole's okay.

334
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,477
Bobby the Bouncer sees you
standing out here like a stalker,

335
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,003
he's gonna break
open your skull.

336
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,505
It was asymmetrical,
it could be cancerous.

337
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,468
You want to get your
skull cracked open.

338
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,653
You're trying to
punish yourself.

339
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,763
I want to fulfill
my oath as a doctor.

340
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,166
You think you're a screw-up
because you got a girl pregnant

341
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,142
and you deserve
to suffer. You don't.

342
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,395
You just need some sleep
and you'll handle this mess.

343
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,646
Let's get in the car.

344
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,816
She's probably off work soon.

345
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,736
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

346
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,409
I'll get a cab.

347
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,037
Good luck with everything.

348
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,875
You were defending
your friend beyond all rationality,

349
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,294
granting her the right
to die in your bedroom.

350
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,379
Was it really all
because of a promise?

351
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,924
That word means something
to some people.

352
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,050
Not that much.

353
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,345
I don't see the bleed, I'm
moving down to the brain stem.

354
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,357
You promised your brother
you'd euthanize him,

355
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,019
and you think you
won't feel bad about it

356
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,705
as long as you can
blame it on the promise.

357
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:32,067
That's why you have this twisted
obligation to keep all promises.

358
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,070
Or your carefully constructed defense
mechanism could crumble down.

359
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,366
I saved my brother
from a lot of pain.

360
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,539
Reconstructed image is clear.

361
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,582
There's no bleed
in Darrien's brain.

362
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,127
Image just blurred.
Did she wake up?

363
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,547
She's shivering.

364
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,549
She must have a fever.

365
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,343
Infection? It couldn't
be from the stabbing.

366
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,487
It has to be from the stabbing.

367
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,596
Wait, no, it couldn't
be acting that quickly.

368
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,001
Well then,
what's wrong with her?

369
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,614
Your heart rate's over
120. You're clammy.

370
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,283
I think you're going into shock.

371
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,410
Are you lightheaded?

372
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,619
I'm fine.

373
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,808
Did you see the new
Brownbeard episode?

374
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,416
It was so funny.

375
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,918
No, it was so lame.

376
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,714
A boat full of guy pirates and they
make the girl pirate walk the plank.

377
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,923
She floated.

378
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,884
That's 'cause
she had big boobies.

379
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,069
That's why he
should've kept her.

380
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,093
We gotta get you into
surgery. Where is that nurse?

381
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,973
Rachel, let's go find the nurse.

382
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,867
2:00 a.m. Nice of you
to call me back.

383
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,803
Chase and I are in the
hospital with a patient.

384
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,412
You've completely
run out of ideas

385
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,039
and you're calling
me to bail you out.

386
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,333
I'm touched. Hit me.

387
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,385
Command, please.

388
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,595
Call Ruby.

389
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,849
Would you like to
call Ruby on mobile?

390
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,853
No.

391
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,818
She on any medication
besides crack?

392
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,695
She was taking
interferon in prison,

393
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,073
so I'm guessing she's had
Hep-C for at least 10 years.

394
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,532
Can I guess stuff, too?

395
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,510
'Cause that's gonna make
the diagnosis really easy.

396
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,512
Prison infirmary isn't known
for stellar record keeping.

397
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,372
And we can't exactly
ask the patient.

398
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,207
Yeah, that
would've been pre-coma.

399
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,960
But how could you have known
that it would affect her that way?

400
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,295
We didn't think we had
anything mysterious until...

401
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,464
What about renal cancer
throwing clots?

402
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,383
Urinalysis was
negative. That's too bad.

403
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,386
'Cause that was my
one big idea. Really?

404
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,849
House?

405
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,229
House, you there?

406
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,900
Tell me more about the patient.

407
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,568
What was she doing
before prison?

408
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,154
She was a cop, shot
a kid in self defense,

409
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,740
never got over the guilt, started
taking drugs and got busted.

410
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,450
Way to bury the lead.

411
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,077
How long ago was this shooting?

412
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,245
I'm not sure. Why?

413
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,498
Again, you assumed she's
had Hep-C for 10 years.

414
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,059
But if you find out
when she shot the kid,

415
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,727
you'll find out when
she started taking drugs,

416
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,837
and when she actually
contracted the Hep-C.

417
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,213
And you think this is relevant?

418
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,590
It's more relevant than what
you got now, which is squat.

419
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,719
Three chicks just came
into my bedroom.

420
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,263
I gotta go.

421
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,312
Command, please.

422
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,439
Call Rachel.

423
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,609
Would you like to
call Rachel on mobile?

424
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,778
No.

425
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,827
What the hell?

426
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,912
I really am a doctor.

427
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,932
I just wanted... Cop another
feel? Get away from me.

428
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,250
No, that mole.
I just wanted...

429
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,794
Please don't call Bobby.

430
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,507
Just calm down.
Shut up!

431
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,952
Sick perv.
Get down on your knees.

432
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,241
You think I'm kidding? Turn
around and get down on your knees.

433
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,308
Please don't.

434
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,810
I said shut up!

435
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,605
You think you're the first guy
who thought he was special?

436
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,648
You think you can do
whatever you want?

437
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,984
I am not going
through that again!

438
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,338
Find anything?

439
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:07,050
Shockingly, a punk kid getting
shot pulling a gun on a cop

440
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,344
did not make national news.

441
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,597
Is your neck okay?

442
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,681
Yeah, it's fine.

443
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,435
I'll get you some ice.

444
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,229
I said it was fine.

445
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,608
I shouldn't have
grabbed you so hard.

446
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,696
You had to.

447
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,041
You were right about everything.

448
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,723
I got something.

449
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,602
Darrien must've had a
different last name then.

450
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,729
She must have been married.

451
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,231
20087 Is that possible?

452
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,026
We never actually talked
about how long she'd been in.

453
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,696
House was right. She could've
only had Hep-C for a few years.

454
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,157
There's no way the prison
would've prescribed interferon,

455
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,659
unless the lab showed
her Hep-C to be chronic.

456
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,453
So, what makes new
Hep-C look like old Hep-C?

457
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,623
What if she got a parasite?

458
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,417
The Hep-C made her susceptible,

459
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,252
and the parasite sped
up the liver damage.

460
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,004
Entamoeba.

461
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,257
Throw in a parasitoma, the stab
wound could have freed them,

462
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,969
sent them coursing through
her bloodstream, wreaking havoc.

463
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,221
A single bag of metronidazole.

464
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,516
If we're right, she could wake
up from the coma in a few hours.

465
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,989
They're ready for you.

466
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,790
Wait.

467
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,297
I want you in there.

468
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,549
I'm not a surgeon.

469
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,509
There's nothing I can do.

470
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,554
Well, you can make sure
that idiot butcher

471
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,306
doesn't cut more
than he needs to.

472
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,561
You already sighed a release.

473
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,340
He's gonna do what
he needs to do.

474
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,439
Yeah,

475
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,317
and if that involves
chopping off my leg,

476
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,156
I want to be sure that
that's damn well necessary.

477
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,993
House...

478
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,746
I don't trust him.

479
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,083
I trust you.

480
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,870
Can you hear me?

481
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,373
Yeah.

482
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,876
You had parasites in your liver.

483
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:34,132
Probably from a dirty needle,
or prison, or who knows what.

484
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,553
The stabbing made it worse,
but you're gonna be okay.

485
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm sorry. We had to.

486
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,574
I told you I couldn't go back.

487
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,290
I shouldn't have trusted you.

488
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,418
I never liked you.

489
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,423
I killed time with you 'cause
I was locked in a cage.

490
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,092
You were a distraction.

491
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,971
Someone to talk to so I
didn't have to think about

492
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,973
everything else.

493
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,311
You're lashing out, I get it.

494
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,105
But in a month, you'll thank me.

495
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,610
Or maybe you won't,
I don't know,

496
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,989
but I know I saved your life.

497
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,971
Is he going to be okay?

498
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,475
He'll be fine.

499
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,478
Close your eyes.

500
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,900
I wish House still
came over to play.

501
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,404
Well,

502
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,909
maybe you should
write him a letter.

503
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,496
Wanna do that?
Okay, let's do it.

504
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,840
Ruby?

505
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,884
You look like hell
and you smell like...

506
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,028
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

507
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,095
Is that glitter on you?

508
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,388
Just hear me out.

509
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,057
Back when I still
had my practice,

510
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,977
this patient came in, 50-year-old
guy wanting a tummy tuck,

511
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,246
but when we do some prelim work,

512
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,270
we discover that his
stomach is filled with cancer.

513
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,150
So instead of telling him that
he's gonna look great at the beach,

514
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,513
I gotta tell him
that he's dying.

515
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,611
Were you at a
strip club? Please.

516
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,072
The weird part was
I was more upset

517
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,490
about the whole thing
than he was.

518
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,535
He actually had to calm me down.

519
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,956
He said he had great
kids, raised them right,

520
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,377
knew that, because of them, he
was leaving the world a better place.

521
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,048
I thought I might
die last night...

522
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,800
At a strip club?

523
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,719
Yes, I was at a strip club.

524
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,889
And while it was happening,

525
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,225
I kept thinking
about that patient,

526
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,562
and how I wish I was like him.

527
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,068
I wanna have this baby.

528
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,128
Darrien had to shoot that kid.

529
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,340
It was the right thing,
completely justified.

530
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,509
But it didn't matter.

531
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,970
She destroyed her life
trying to forget.

532
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,768
I'm afraid that's
what's gonna happen to me.

533
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,856
You really should
talk to someone.

534
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,943
I've talked to a
therapist. It didn't help.

535
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,948
Maybe you should talk to
someone who isn't a therapist.

536
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,953
Do you really think
you have any idea

537
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,039
what it's like to live
with something like this?

538
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,045
Let's grab a coffee.

539
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,308
Late night?
No.

540
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,685
Just haven't had my coffee yet.

541
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,858
Sympathetic yawn.

542
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,032
Ooh, Amish kid collapsed
while picking up a hooker.

543
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,366
Top that.

544
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,038
I missed a call from
House last night. He in?

545
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,557
You're lucky.

546
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,606
What are you doing here?

547
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,900
You hoping for someone else?

548
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,987
Hot nurse, candy striper,

549
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,448
someone who doesn't
speak English,

550
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,743
someone who doesn't
speak judgmental.

551
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,289
You've got mail.

552
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,917
"I hope your leg feels better,

553
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:48,339
"and I hope we can be friends
again soon, you bloody scallywag."

554
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,345
I have to pee.

555
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,931
That's a good sign.

556
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,268
I'm a big boy.

557
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,271
Course you are.

558
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,543
You're an ass.

559
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:31,674
What? For trying to walk
on a freshly mangled leg?

560
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,509
Or for performing
surgery on myself?

561
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,387
For thinking I can solve my
emotional problems with rat medicine?

562
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,809
If you're gonna nag, at least
have the decency to be specific.

563
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,520
Come on.

564
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,065
Listen to me.

565
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:52,319
You can't keep going like
this. Something has to change.

566
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,489
Can I pee first?

567
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,705
I know.
