1
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,169
Cranial nerves.

2
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,965
On old Olympus' towering tops, a
friendly Viking grew vines and hops.

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,426
Olfactory, optic, oculomotor...

4
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,553
vagus, accessory.

5
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,973
Causes of edema.
Alive. Allergic...

6
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,726
Differential for
swollen scrotum.

7
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,396
Theaters, English spelling.
Torsion,

8
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,482
hernia...

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,487
Epididymal cyst.
S... Syphilis.

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,280
Enough with the drilling.

11
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,324
We're third year, no more exams.

12
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,284
You don't have to
face House every day.

13
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,869
And after today, neither do you.

14
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,622
Here's to no more
coming home in tears.

15
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,584
It's kind of like coming to the
end of an extreme roller coaster,

16
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,629
even with the terror,
nausea and whiplash,

17
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm a little sad that it's over.

18
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,800
Let's go.

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,635
You got your procedure log?

20
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,888
Oh, I'm not quite done, I still
have one more lumbar puncture.

21
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,056
It's due today.

22
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,059
Unless you wanna blow off
becoming a doctor and get another PhD.

23
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,769
I know. I'm gonna get it done.

24
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,456
I thought you'd have that thing
finished, like, six months ago.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,065
I've been busy.

26
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,039
Oh, come on, Cruz. Let me
do this. I need it for my log.

27
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,458
Wait, you aren't done yet?

28
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,127
I've been busy.

29
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,920
What's in it for me?

30
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,507
The satisfaction that comes
from helping out a classmate?

31
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,343
How about cash?

32
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,553
Have you talked to House?

33
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,645
It's 6:00 a.m. He won't
be in for a few hours.

34
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,433
I keep a roll of
quarters in the car.

35
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,483
I just turned in my log,
and guess what I saw?

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,147
There's an opening
in the diagnostics department.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,898
House wants an intern?

38
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,525
He's never had one before.

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,236
You got to figure.
He doesn't want an intern,

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,071
he wants you.

41
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,991
Uh, you must be Dr. Thirteen.

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,453
Remy Hadley. Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,621
You're back!

44
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,997
Hi.

45
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,004
What the hell happened to you?

46
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,398
Why did you lie
about going to Rome?

47
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:39,844
You'd lie too if you bottomed
out and ended up in drug rehab.

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,099
Thank you, House,
for respecting my privacy.

49
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,101
What a perfect
reminder that I'm back.

50
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,811
I didn't even know
you had a problem.

51
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,313
Loved ones are
always the last to know.

52
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,483
Loved ones and robotic,
estranged ex-boyfriends.

53
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,030
Our patient is Kendall Pearson,
16-year-old aspiring pirate.

54
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,633
She's that Canadian
kid who's trying to be

55
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,134
the youngest person
to sail around the world.

56
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,577
She collapsed yesterday
during a practice run.

57
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,413
Luckily for us,
cameras were there.

58
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,583
Her corporate sponsors want us
to check that she's seaworthy

59
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,962
before the clock strikes,
"You're too old to set a record."

60
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,880
Gives us three days.

61
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,799
You've still
only got one, right?

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,302
Uh, last day as a student.

63
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,012
Could be simple dehydration.

64
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,182
She told the Coast
Guard she had felt dizzy.

65
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,602
Pulse and BP were normal
at the time of the rescue.

66
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,479
It's not dehydration.

67
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,358
What about your internship,
did you sign up this morning?

68
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,069
Actually, I'm still deciding.

69
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,450
Maybe she had a seizure and
that's what caused her collapse.

70
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,577
Coast Guard reports there's
no sign of head trauma.

71
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,203
What about her back?

72
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,414
Look, right before the collapse,

73
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,299
she hit the small of
her back on the railing.

74
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,542
Damage to the adrenal glands

75
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,295
caused adrenal insufficiencies,
which caused the collapse.

76
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,547
Nice.

77
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,843
Blood draws every 15 minutes
for four hours, to track her cortisol.

78
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,387
Masters, there's no hurry.

79
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,222
There's no wrong choices.

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,684
At least, that's what they tell
people who make crappy choices.

81
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,567
What's with the sudden
interest in her future?

82
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,564
You know, a blacksmith
who spends this much time

83
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,358
hammering out a new
blade from raw Jell-O,

84
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,819
he gets curious about
who ends up wielding it.

85
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,783
No reason to be curious unless
you're interested in wielding it yourself.

86
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,824
You want her to intern here.

87
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,161
And you're considering this?

88
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,914
Before I make my decision,

89
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,292
I still have one
more LP I need to get,

90
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,712
so, I'd like to go to the ER.

91
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,926
Thirteen, why don't you take
Masters to do the blood draws.

92
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,637
You can remind her about
all the perks of working for me.

93
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,646
Behind the deck, port side.

94
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,525
If her adrenal hormone levels are
consistently low, we'll replace them.

95
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,968
You'll be ready
to launch Thursday.

96
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,819
Great.

97
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,405
Inside cabin, facing the bow.

98
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,741
Sorry, K, I need to borrow Mom.

99
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,909
The sponsors?

100
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,303
No, Couric's
people kicking up a fuss

101
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,662
about
rescheduling the interview.

102
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,333
Uh, I can take over.

103
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,756
Ceiling of the galley.

104
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,966
Right.

105
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,427
The last time I was on a boat
was my freshman mixer in college.

106
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,846
I didn't so much mix as hurl.

107
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,306
Too much to drink?

108
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,891
No, I was 13.

109
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
And in college?

110
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,020
Yeah, I know. Weird.

111
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,939
I was thinking cool.

112
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,109
We'll be back for the next
blood draw in 15 minutes.

113
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,694
Unless,
of course, you'd like to stay

114
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,659
and continue bonding
over your lost childhoods.

115
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,741
Listen, I have a ton of prep
work to do to be ready to launch.

116
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,505
Is there any way we
can speed the tests up?

117
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,828
Mmm, I'm afraid not.

118
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,706
Unless you're up for
getting on a treadmill.

119
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,542
We could stress her body,
see if her adrenals respond.

120
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,502
It would only take half an hour.

121
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,628
Hmm.

122
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,382
It's about an LP.

123
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,301
Go. I'll handle this.

124
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,021
Um, Dr. Cuddy, can I come by your
office later? I'd love to get some advice.

125
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,648
Uh, I'm in meetings
all afternoon.

126
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,816
Try me tomorrow.

127
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,026
Tomorrow...

128
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,696
This is my last day
as a medical student,

129
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,489
so I've got this
decision to make,

130
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,908
probably the biggest
decision of my career,

131
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,746
which means maybe the
biggest decision of my life.

132
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,041
Although,
I guess, if I get married...

133
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,003
House has opened
up an internship.

134
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,713
You do realize, if you take it,

135
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,465
he'll probably end
up firing you again.

136
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,799
He's always hired me back.

137
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,929
And he'll continue mocking and
insulting you whatever chance he gets.

138
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,309
It's certainly toughened me up.

139
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,954
You're trying to get me
to say good things about him.

140
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,396
No.

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,150
I'm trying to make you make your
own decision and leave me alone.

142
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,365
Working with House is great
and it sucks, often simultaneously.

143
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,587
Most people can't
work in that environment.

144
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,578
Question is, can you?

145
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,707
Thanks, Dr. Cuddy.

146
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,186
You paged me down here
and now you're doing my LP?

147
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,771
Got bored waiting.

148
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,939
It's been two minutes.

149
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,649
This is your 11th.
Fourteenth.

150
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,777
Listen, your roommate, is she
hooking up with that resident?

151
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,821
I gotta find House.

152
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,224
Rehab?
It's a great cover story.

153
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,351
Now, I can't ever drink
around those guys again,

154
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,061
thus eliminating my
main bond with Chase.

155
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,830
Save the attitude
for someone who didn't

156
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,565
just get you your
medical license back.

157
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,774
Price you pay.

158
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,723
There's
a chicken in your office.

159
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,487
No, there isn't.

160
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,115
You lied about rehab?

161
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,825
Oh, great.
Relax.

162
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,245
She's completely honest but
also completely boring. Watch this.

163
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,496
Don't tell anyone.

164
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,123
Of course not.

165
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,921
You did an LP?
Why didn't you page me?

166
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,214
Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,538
Did you want to do one of
those? You should've spoken up.

168
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,052
You want the job or not?

169
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,847
Um... I...
After careful consideration,

170
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,226
I have decided to accept
your offer for an internship.

171
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,271
Great.

172
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,858
My department has a
slightly different procedure log.

173
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,987
Uh, you forged the last one.
I only did nine LPs.

174
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,131
Do you know how to do an LP?

175
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,155
Of course.

176
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,366
Do you know how to do nine LPs
and say it was 107

177
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,370
It's time to grow up.

178
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,123
Turn that in, the job is yours.

179
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,378
Stop staring blankly and go.

180
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,299
No doubt something horrible
has just happened to our patient.

181
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,686
Her hand turned
completely blue during the treadmill test.

182
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,021
We put her on vasodilators,

183
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,357
restored enough blood flow
so she won't lose any fingers.

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,025
Rules out adrenal insufficiency.

185
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,735
Where's House?
He said to meet him here.

186
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,487
His chicken's gone.

187
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,447
Probably on the balcony.

188
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,657
You knew he had a chicken?

189
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,409
- How come...
- Down here!

190
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:06,082
Loss of consciousness
plus she's slowly turning blue.

191
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,501
Have we ruled out magical gum?

192
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,670
Low cardiac
output can cause both.

193
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,005
Patient possibly
has cardiomyopathy,

194
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,132
possibly caused by
mercury poisoning

195
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,968
from all the tuna
fish she eats at sea.

196
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,762
Uh, why are you putting
chicken footprints on the floor?

197
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,350
That clever bastard Wilson
got hold of an Australorp.

198
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,854
Hello.

199
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,106
The quietest and
calmest of all the chickens.

200
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,358
Damn him!

201
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,611
Mercury poisoning is out. Red
blood cells have normal morphology.

202
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,490
Raynaud's. Vasospasm in
the ulnar artery would explain the hand.

203
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,325
But not the loss
of consciousness.

204
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,202
Cerebral
vasospasm explains both.

205
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,413
Cerebral vasospasm makes sense.

206
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,831
Take Thirteen, give the patient

207
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,332
a calcium channel
blocker infusion

208
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,500
in the basilar artery.

209
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,795
Masters.

210
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,714
Thought you were
gonna turn that in.

211
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,926
I'm a bit busy with my patient.

212
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,511
You're not busy now.

213
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,078
Masters.

214
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,276
Still haven't
turned in your log?

215
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,918
Still haven't gotten my 10th LP.

216
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,671
I was thinking. Maybe you
should take House's internship.

217
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,235
First you act like
it's the equivalent

218
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,841
of volunteering to
be water-boarded,

219
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,260
and now you're supporting it?

220
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,680
You're weird.

221
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,141
You make paper airplanes for fun

222
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,559
and hang them from the ceiling.

223
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,228
You have a membership
to the Einstein Museum

224
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,773
and an overbearing obsession
with facial symmetry.

225
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,483
It indicates
freedom from disease.

226
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,193
We're
biologically programmed to...

227
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,695
Point is,
you rub people the wrong way.

228
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,865
But House is okay with
your lack of bedside manner,

229
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,283
he's okay with your willingness

230
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,785
to argue any point, with anyone,

231
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,620
even if they outrank you,

232
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,538
he's okay with your
peculiar fashion sense.

233
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,248
It's peculiar?

234
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,294
House doesn't think
you're weird, which is weird.

235
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,711
But good weird.

236
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,546
Is that a chicken?

237
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,056
I think it's an Australorp.

238
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,434
I'm gonna go
check on my patient.

239
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,350
Can someone please explain to me

240
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,699
what House and Wilson
are doing with those chickens?

241
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,134
They have a bet
to see who can keep

242
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,469
a chicken in
the hospital the longest

243
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,853
without getting
busted by security.

244
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,248
Advancing past
the vertebral artery.

245
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,417
And why are they doing this?

246
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,220
The place they bought them
only had one pig.

247
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,423
I'm glad you're gonna be
sticking around after today.

248
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,258
Really? You want me to stay?

249
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,885
It's good to add a different
perspective to the department.

250
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,431
Someone who still remembers
there are rules other than House's.

251
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,352
If I don't play by House's
rules, he won't let me in.

252
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,980
Find a way around them.

253
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,358
I'd have to lie to him,
which is still lying.

254
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,154
Lying about a lie, that's
practically telling the truth.

255
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,282
Catheter is in. Start the
calcium channel blocker drip.

256
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,034
Means I need another LP.

257
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,829
Luckily, I know where you
can get one. You good here?

258
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,289
Let's go.

259
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,463
Decent stick, very smooth.

260
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,341
Sounds like you've
had a few of these.

261
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,635
Suppose that comes
with the territory.

262
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,681
I have Huntington's. No need to
get hushed and solemn about it.

263
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,810
Why are you lying about rehab?

264
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,229
Because the real
reason I was gone

265
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,148
is not something
I want to share.

266
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,983
Couldn't you just say that?

267
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,903
Should be enough
for Foreman and the others.

268
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,186
How long have you worked here?

269
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,699
House's people have
personalities that range from nosy

270
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,994
to "Pardon me while I
do this cavity search."

271
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,831
Do you think there's room for
someone who does things differently?

272
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,544
No.

273
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,424
Not unless House decides
that's what he wants.

274
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,223
During catheter removal, I
got a good look at her cerebral midline.

275
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,682
Her pineal gland is calcified.

276
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,184
Case closed.

277
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,853
We'll start her on hormone
therapy and ship her out.

278
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,730
I handed in my log.

279
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,692
On your way to do that,

280
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,946
did you happen to stop
and give Thirteen an LP?

281
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,282
Thirteen's stiff gait,
small pupils,

282
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,077
and the raging headache
she's hiding gave you away.

283
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,123
Yes, and I still broke a rule.

284
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,749
My rule.

285
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,252
I told you to defy the
Man, not this man.

286
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,296
Why is it so wrong that
I don't like to cheat?

287
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,800
Can we go?
No.

288
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,552
Not liking it is fine,

289
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,887
not doing what you don't like
makes you an eight-year-old

290
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,305
and wastes your potential.

291
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,242
You want me to be like
you, it's not gonna happen.

292
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,600
That's the last thing I want,

293
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,603
'cause then neither one
of us would be exceptional.

294
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,481
You think I'm exceptional?

295
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,774
Not anymore.

296
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,945
I can do my job
without compromising.

297
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,283
No, you can't. 'Cause
I'm not gonna let you.

298
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,909
Internship's gone.

299
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,913
It's time for Masters
to say goodbye.

300
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,917
Enjoy being a surgeon.
You'll be fine.

301
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,939
Surgery.

302
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,651
Anatomy.

303
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,612
The branches off
the subclavian artery.

304
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,156
VITamin C and D. VIT.

305
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,035
VITamin. V, vertebral,
I, internal carotid.

306
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,497
Internal thoracic.

307
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,583
Internal thoracic.

308
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:27,880
T, thyrocervical,
C, costocervical...

309
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,641
Martha M. Masters.

310
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,808
That's me!

311
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,144
I'm gonna be a surgeon.

312
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,646
Next!

313
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,027
Welcome to your
surgical internship at PP TH.

314
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,529
The senior residents
stand behind you.

315
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,790
We'll all get to know
each other soon enough.

316
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,659
Grab a donut and get to work.

317
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,993
We're out of donuts.

318
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,995
Then get to work.

319
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,671
Little oozing.

320
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,548
- Isolated the left subclavian.
- Suction.

321
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,926
You gotta do better
than that. Can't see a thing.

322
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,013
Push calcium chloride.

323
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,853
It will supercharge the platelets
and increase the clotting.

324
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,359
Two amps of calcium chloride.

325
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,280
Tell the blood bank to send up
three units of packed red cells.

326
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,284
The field is clear.

327
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,287
Nice.

328
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,006
Generally speaking,

329
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,634
pledges aren't supposed to
talk unless asked a question.

330
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,428
That's because,
generally speaking,

331
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,305
pledges don't
have anything to say.

332
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,060
Um... "KP."

333
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,148
Is that patient Kendall Pearson?
I thought she was discharged.

334
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,482
Mmm. It's a House case.

335
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,860
I never know what
that guy is up to.

336
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,653
I want you to scrub
in on my lung harvest.

337
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,239
But it's my first day.

338
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,743
Yes, I know. I was there. Be
scrubbed and ready in 15 minutes.

339
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,398
What happened? Last I
heard, you were going home.

340
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,567
Kendall collapsed
in the parking lot.

341
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,820
They're doing something
called a sympathectomy.

342
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,574
She must have had
a hypertensive crisis

343
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,243
caused by neural
overstimulation of her kidneys,

344
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,120
so they're cutting the nerves.

345
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,290
It's like cutting the
gas line to an engine.

346
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,418
Yeah. Sounds like
what Dr. Taub said.

347
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,296
Said it's basic
surgery but... It is.

348
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,216
You should still be on pace
for a launch in 36 hours.

349
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,260
Her mom's packing the boat now.

350
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,638
I'm supposed to
pick up some dry ice.

351
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,807
But...

352
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,811
Nothing you can do for her here.

353
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,902
Um...

354
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,574
We're just trying to help our
daughter reach her dream.

355
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,245
She's different.

356
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,373
So, you have to be different.

357
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,003
I'll make sure she's okay.

358
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,090
Thanks.

359
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,684
You can see the full
lobular structure of the left lung.

360
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,603
Bifurcate innominate artery.
I've never seen one of those before.

361
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,938
Hold this, Masters.

362
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,273
Rib spreaders.

363
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,901
You guys okay if I pull a circulating
nurse? We got a train wreck in OR 10.

364
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,194
You got it.

365
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,446
Proximal end attached.

366
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,342
Can someone
take the retractors for me?

367
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,701
Not really.

368
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,119
I have to use the bathroom.

369
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,788
I know you're a
rookie, but you gotta be kidding.

370
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,123
- I'm not.
- It can wait.

371
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,289
I'm gonna have an accident.

372
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,463
Next one in line, grab it.

373
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,014
What's wrong?

374
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,379
Hypotension.
Low cardiac output.

375
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,683
Float the Swan.

376
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,310
Don't you have your own surgery?

377
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,730
I took a break.
I told them I had to pee.

378
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,982
You lied.

379
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,068
Small one but
it's a gateway lie.

380
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,945
I care about the patient.

381
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,238
Another lie.

382
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,115
You care about
being exceptional.

383
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,159
I told her dad I was
gonna take care of her.

384
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,496
A third lie. Welcome
to the slippery slope.

385
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,582
RA is 8.
Equalization of pressures.

386
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,667
I think she has
restrictive pericarditis.

387
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,503
Add that to a
calcified pineal gland...

388
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:22,841
When is a calcified pineal
gland not a calcified pineal gland?

389
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,568
I realize technically
it's never, but...

390
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,677
When it's a granuloma.

391
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,614
It's Wegener's. We
should start her on steroids.

392
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,140
But she had a high CK.
Wegener's wouldn't explain that...

393
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,350
Dehydration does.

394
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,520
Yes. But the calcified
pineal could be sarcoidosis.

395
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,941
You had me at,
"I had to pee."

396
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,320
But Thirteen's right. Start her on
three-fold immunosuppressants.

397
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,030
Masters, you want
to fight me on this,

398
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,075
fill out a consult form
SO you can stick around.

399
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,201
Welcome back.

400
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,327
I'm not back!

401
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,122
I'll just be
staying for this case.

402
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,630
You got really good
at this lying thing.

403
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,268
Hope it was one hell of a whiz.

404
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,770
I ran into Dr. House.

405
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,399
He requested a surgical
consult for his patient.

406
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,859
House never asks for a consult.

407
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,030
Something about this case,
he needed a little more help.

408
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,074
First day of your
surgical internship,

409
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,618
you want to be loaned out
to another department.

410
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,870
Interesting career move.

411
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,747
Drop the form by my office.

412
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:40,335
Don't stay away too long. I'm already
well on my way to forgetting you.

413
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,678
How about I take both you
lovely ladies out for a drink?

414
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,639
I'd love to except I
think you're a cretin.

415
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,726
And the last time she was
at a bar was ballet class.

416
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,893
I didn't take...

417
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,604
Oh.

418
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,813
That's funny.

419
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,191
I'm gonna stay and run a few
extra tests on House's patient.

420
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,736
This one lab value
doesn't make sense to me.

421
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,821
You're back with House? Mmm.

422
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,157
Just this one case.
I'm not staying.

423
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,367
I would kill for a
chance to work with him,

424
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,912
like, literally skin you and
wear you as a disguise.

425
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,927
You want yours extra
crispy or original recipe?

426
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,824
Chickens!

427
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,079
You ever get sick from poultry?

428
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,623
Um... A few months ago,

429
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,502
from this pheasant-in-a-can
my dad got me as a joke.

430
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,730
You think that's why I'm sick?

431
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,591
I think that can was chock-full of a
bacteria called salmonella enteritis.

432
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,260
Likes to hang out in the bones.

433
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,804
Let me know if any of
this is tender or painful.

434
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,100
This bacteria thing,
is this good news or bad?

435
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:46,438
Well, if I'm right, that means
all you'll need are antibiotics

436
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,524
and you'll be, well, shipshape.

437
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,985
Sorry, couldn't resist.

438
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,950
Did you always know
that sailing was it for you,

439
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,160
that it was the right thing?

440
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,538
Didn't even start till I was 10.

441
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,541
And at first, I was not a fan.

442
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,794
Certainly there's plenty
not to like about sailing.

443
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,046
But now that
you're so into it...

444
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,049
Oh, no, there's still plenty
of things I hate about it.

445
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,718
I hate being wet,
I hate being cold,

446
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,563
I hate eating nothing
but freeze-dried food.

447
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,389
That's quite the endorsement.

448
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,433
Sailing is amazing
but it doesn't mean

449
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,560
I love every second on the boat.

450
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,815
Doing what you love means
dealing with things you don't.

451
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,859
If there were nothing to
overcome, it might not be that...

452
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,444
Ow!

453
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,993
Salmonella
enteritis is a nice catch.

454
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,163
Thanks. Starting
on the soft tissue windows.

455
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,917
Once this case is over,
you going back to surgery?

456
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,669
That's the plan.

457
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,756
I think that's a mistake.

458
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,320
I think you should
go back to surgery.

459
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,761
I just said I was.

460
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,222
No, you said it was your plan.

461
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,432
Which means House might be right

462
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,643
and you might be
lying to yourself.

463
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,146
Would it be so terrible?

464
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,148
You chose House over surgery.

465
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,942
And my time here
changed me in ways

466
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,279
that not everyone in my life
thought was for the better.

467
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,656
No masses.
Moving on to bone windows.

468
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,705
Are those people right?

469
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:33,378
I think when you do change,
it's not so simple to go back.

470
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,298
There.

471
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,174
In the humerus.

472
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,346
Doesn't look like an infection.

473
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,016
That's because it
looks like cancer.

474
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,448
You have a lymphoid sarcoma.
A cancer in the bone in your arm.

475
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,703
Am I going to be okay?

476
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,080
It's a treatable cancer.

477
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,918
But part of that treatment
involves amputating your arm.

478
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,836
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,005
There's nothing else?

480
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,507
Um...

481
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,053
We can do chemo and
radiation, after the amputation.

482
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,056
I don't mean after,
I mean, instead of.

483
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,475
If I leave soon, I still have
time to break the record.

484
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,894
Honey, you can't be serious.

485
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,270
I feel fine.

486
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,915
Last night, they thought
it was an infection.

487
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,233
We know it's cancer. We
ran the biopsy three times.

488
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,237
You don't know how fast...
Postponing the surgery

489
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,600
could increase the likelihood
that the cancer will spread.

490
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,282
Kendall, you need to think
about what the doctor's saying.

491
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,409
I'm thinking about this sail,

492
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,704
like I have since I was 10.
Don't take this away from me.

493
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,624
It's just a month, I can
take extra precautions.

494
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,669
I'll Skype you every day. And I
can fly back if something goes wrong.

495
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,671
She'll be risking her life.

496
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,091
I think we need to
discuss this as a family.

497
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,678
You're considering this?

498
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,517
Your daughter's condition...

499
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,352
Thank you, Dr. Masters.

500
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,801
She's not budging.
She wants to launch tomorrow.

501
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:49,305
She's a minor. You sign the
consent form, we can do the surgery.

502
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,142
Amputation can
be an emotional...

503
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,769
She's talked my wife
into agreeing with her.

504
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,566
One parent's
signature is enough.

505
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,530
She needs you to be a parent.

506
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,533
You're asking me
to blow up my family.

507
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,494
I'm asking you
to save your family.

508
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,624
On her first solo
Atlantic crossing,

509
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,544
she scheduled a court date to
become an emancipated minor.

510
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,131
She'll do it again.

511
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,091
And she'll win.

512
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,139
She's gonna do what she's
gonna do with or without me.

513
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,101
I'd rather have it be with.

514
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,163
I'm stuck.

515
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,041
No, you're not.
Case is over.

516
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,167
You're back to surgery.

517
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,671
Fetch!

518
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,801
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

519
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,011
Good boy.

520
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,808
No one will stop Kendall's
sail. You need to step in.

521
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,393
Sign on the door says
I'm a diagnostician.

522
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,853
Cool diagnosis
means I'm finished.

523
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,939
She could die.

524
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,191
Pretty sure the law
of the land states

525
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,318
that everyone has
the right to be an idiot.

526
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,921
I think it's
the second amendment.

527
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,071
Fetch!

528
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,407
Bring it here.
Good boy.

529
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,326
Who's a good boy?

530
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,204
You are constantly
railing against hypocrisy,

531
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,581
forcing people
to face the truth.

532
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,625
This time, nothing?

533
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,586
Yeah, because
they've faced the truth.

534
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,423
And made a decision that will in
all likelihood Kill their daughter.

535
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,426
I'm fine with that.

536
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,179
I wanted a diagnosis, I got it.

537
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,682
What do you want?

538
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,059
I don't want her to die.

539
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,854
Break the rules.

540
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,482
I can't.

541
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,404
So coloring inside the
lines is more important to you

542
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,239
than saving this girl's life.

543
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,617
I was wrong about one thing.

544
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,412
You are not exceptional.

545
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,623
And fetch!

546
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,791
Oh, ho, ho!

547
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,209
Who's the good boy?

548
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,128
Good boy.
Good boy.

549
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,633
Dr. Wilson?

550
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,971
I'd like to get your advice
about a cancer patient.

551
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,764
Kendall Pearson?

552
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,767
Oncology rounds.
Everyone's talking about it.

553
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,852
Ow!

554
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,353
Are you okay?

555
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,897
Yeah. My back's acting up.

556
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,190
Oh.

557
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,067
Um... So...

558
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,527
What would you do?

559
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,947
I would keep trying to
convince her to have the surgery.

560
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,658
And if she kept saying no?

561
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,287
I would just keep...
Mmm... Keep... Keep trying.

562
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,605
I know there's
a chicken under there.

563
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,043
Oh, thank God.

564
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,339
He already pecked through
one pair of my loafers.

565
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,971
So, that's all you'd do?

566
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,474
That's all you can do.

567
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,768
Is it?

568
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,572
Isn't that House's chicken?

569
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,262
Disgusting beasts. I don't know
why I ever agreed to this bet.

570
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,493
So call it off.

571
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,828
And lose $20?

572
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,122
Listen.

573
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,125
House was in the exact
same situation Kendall's in.

574
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,294
He needed surgery
but he didn't want it.

575
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,380
Once he was in
a medically-induced coma,

576
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,924
his girlfriend signed the
consent form as his proxy.

577
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,967
They went ahead with
the surgery against his will.

578
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,679
Probably saved his life.

579
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,390
So, she did the right thing?

580
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,393
Depends on who you ask.

581
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,104
Fetch!

582
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,400
No! No!

583
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,326
Excuse me!

584
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,995
Who's responsible
for this chicken?

585
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,415
Does anyone know
who owns the chicken?

586
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,296
That bird belongs
to Dr. Gregory House.

587
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,919
You need to do the surgery.

588
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,297
I will.
Now.

589
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,759
We've been through this.
I'm leaving today.

590
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,302
It's a stupid record.

591
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,137
It's not about the record.

592
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,225
I used to race
against other people.

593
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,519
I could have the slowest
boat in the fleet and I'd win.

594
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,938
So it's about being
better than everyone else?

595
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,941
It has nothing to do
with anybody, except me.

596
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,363
The other racers
would think I was crazy.

597
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,033
I'd set off on some tacking
angle that made no sense to them

598
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,994
because they couldn't
see what I saw.

599
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,999
I could sense the changes in the
wind before they even happened.

600
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,006
At the top of the game,
you play by different rules.

601
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,016
Medicine's gonna
burn a little bit.

602
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,248
Bradycardic arrest.
Third-degree heart block.

603
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,999
Likely
a paraneoplastic syndrome.

604
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,420
Need to get her to the OR for a
pacemaker and plasmapheresis.

605
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,175
What's going on?

606
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,136
The cancer is causing
her heart to slow down.

607
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,596
We have to get her
to the OR and treat her.

608
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,181
This is what
I was worried about.

609
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,225
If this had happened at
sea, she would be dead.

610
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,726
Oh, my God!

611
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,855
We need you to
sign the consent form,

612
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,899
authorize us
to amputate her arm.

613
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,713
Subclavian access established.

614
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,465
- Temporary pacer ready.
- Don't need it.

615
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,718
Push calcium chloride.
It'll fix the heart block.

616
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,388
Bradycardia was me.

617
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,265
You did this?

618
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,394
Her parents signed
the consent form.

619
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,439
Amputate her arm.

620
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,960
What happened?

621
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,844
You had a cardiac episode that
required us to bring you into the OR.

622
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,221
That crisis resolved, but...

623
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,639
What did you do?

624
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,848
What did you do?

625
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,268
During the surgery, we found
cancer in a lymph node in your neck.

626
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,770
So you cut off my arm?

627
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,893
The cancer was already
spreading. It had to be done.

628
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,857
I told you I didn't want this.

629
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:24,362
If we had waited until after the
sail was over, you would have died.

630
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,366
That record,
that was everything.

631
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:32,203
It wasn't everything.
You have a life, a future...

632
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,914
You weren't supposed
to do this! How could you?

633
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,832
Because we love you.

634
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,043
I hate you.

635
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,212
I hate both of you.

636
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,631
Okay.

637
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,308
My arm...

638
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,283
My arm!

639
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,911
Dr. Masters.

640
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,373
Thank you.

641
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,115
Someone has got
their pouty face on.

642
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,702
I did things no doctor
in their right mind would do.

643
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,287
Good.

644
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,457
I manipulated,
lied, forged, stole.

645
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,309
I don't want to know the
specifics. I might be called to testify.

646
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,302
I broke the rules because
I believed I was right.

647
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,511
You were right.

648
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,639
Then why don't I
feel good or satisfied?

649
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,641
Instead I just feel
like throwing up.

650
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,267
And you're following me to ask

651
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,604
how I break the rules and
maintain my rosy demeanor?

652
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,608
I didn't do it to be happy.
I just thought I would be.

653
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,030
Well, you can't
always get what you want.

654
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,782
To the victor, the spoils.

655
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,242
Your bird recover okay?

656
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,577
Physically, yes.

657
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,163
Emotionally,
it was a long night.

658
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,415
Next week, ferrets?

659
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,586
House.

660
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,092
I can't do it.

661
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,303
I'm leaving.

662
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,974
Surgery?

663
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:07,274
I don't know what I'm gonna do
but I do know I don't want to be here.

664
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,328
Nothing will ever
be simple again.

665
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,875
I'm fine with that.

666
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,519
Oh!
