1
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:18,935
Jennifer Williams?

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,353
And you are?
Cyrus.

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:25,734
Cyrus Harry? You used to
call me Cy, if it's really you.

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,196
I'm trying to find the Jennifer
Williams I knew 23 years ago.

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,448
We spent a long weekend
at the Jersey Shore.

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,116
She was visiting a friend...

7
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,467
That lasted longer than usual.

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,928
That's it for Lansdale.
Pack it up.

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,304
Let's move on to Philly.

10
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,142
Seriously, you're
gonna complain?

11
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,811
How many limo drivers
are making six figures?

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,648
Cy, you're my little
cousin, and I love you

13
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,816
and you've been
more than generous.

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,236
I'm upset because you
are wasting your time

15
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,112
for some faded memory

16
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,574
when there is a world
of pleasure out there.

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,827
The kind of cash you got
buys a lot of it.

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,541
Come on.

19
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,003
Don't be like that. I've just
been driving around all day.

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,005
I'm a little cranky.

21
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,176
Hey!

22
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,886
My leg won't move.

23
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,015
Are you gonna stare
or are you gonna call 9117

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,466
Partial paralysis.

25
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,635
Head CT and LP showed nothing.

26
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,555
Spinal MRIs and EMG were clean.

27
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,723
Brain symptom,

28
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,201
and yet nothing seems
to be wrong with his brain.

29
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,520
Refrigerator mechanic, no
family, in and out of work.

30
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,565
He just won 42 million
dollars in the state lottery.

31
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,584
I think I read about this
lucky bastard in the paper.

32
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,319
You sure you don't mean
the lucky bastard

33
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,112
whose grandkids
snorted his winnings

34
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,281
till he drank himself to
death with drain cleaner?

35
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,700
Or the lucky bastard who
was found naked and penniless

36
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,160
in a strip club parking lot

37
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,912
with his winning number
tattooed on both testicles?

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,707
Neuro-otological pathology
could've caused loss of balance.

39
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,875
Calorics were normal.

40
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,711
Sure, some people will screw
up anything but some won't.

41
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,296
That kind of cash,
he has a chance

42
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,797
to turn a miserable life around.

43
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,215
Miserable stays miserable,

44
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,235
happy doesn't buy lottery
tickets in the first place.

45
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,511
Our level of happiness
is set. It's in our DNA.

46
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,430
No cash payout's
gonna change that.

47
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,615
It's like there's two of me.

48
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,807
The guy repairs appliances.

49
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,601
He's probably got
toxic brain damage

50
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,364
from years of working
with toxic chemicals.

51
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,938
Or his sudden disease
came from his sudden millions.

52
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,983
He's buying something,
collecting something, ceramics,

53
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,610
precious metals, which gave him

54
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,403
atherosclerosis of
his carotid arteries.

55
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,696
My mother's lawyer called.

56
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,700
She's threatening to sue the
hospital over our mistreatment of her.

57
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,078
Says it slowed her recovery.

58
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,331
I was just thinking how much I
want a relationship with no sex,

59
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,336
but where I still have
to deal with your mother.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,545
Go to the patient's
old workshop,

61
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,964
look for causative
toxic brain damage.

62
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,509
Go take a new history, and
see if there's any lifestyle change

63
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,470
that would explain
the atherosclerosis.

64
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,056
Go.

65
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,650
Medicinal.

66
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,693
I'm expecting a
shooting pain in my ass.

67
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,529
My mom and I got into a fight.

68
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,281
Because of our
replacement hip replacement,

69
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,925
she can barely get
around her own house.

70
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,202
I told her she has to live
with me while she recovers.

71
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,663
I'm starting to
get the connection.

72
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,833
Yeah, she has a house,
my name is House.

73
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,610
You're the doctor
that treated her,

74
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,796
that illegally switched her
meds after she fired you,

75
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,923
that went behind the back
of her actual doctor...

76
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,216
Those beads from Thailand.

77
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,178
If we're listing all the things
that you pressured me into.

78
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,848
The point is, you're the
one who's on the line here,

79
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,641
whose name is
on her hospital records.

80
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,726
Whose name is on her name? Fine.

81
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,689
We're both on the line, but she
won't discuss this with me alone.

82
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,276
She and her lawyer wanna meet
with both of us for settlement talks.

83
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,280
I need you in that meeting,
acting nice and respectful

84
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,615
while I diffuse this stunt.

85
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,009
Yeah, well, I'm not
going to that meeting,

86
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,370
so I'm guessing you're cool if
I'm not nice and respectful, either.

87
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,915
Picked up any new hobbies?

88
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,668
How's a hobby gonna
paralyze my left leg?

89
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,172
If you work on vintage cars, or
you've taken up painting, fumes could...

90
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,090
No cars, no paints.

91
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,676
You're a popular guy.

92
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,886
Popular wallet.

93
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,723
Three years ago, before I had
a dime, I had my appendix out.

94
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,933
Phil was there.
No one else even called.

95
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,436
What about drugs?

96
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,814
No drugs. Look, I've
seen all the documentaries,

97
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,232
I've read all the articles.

98
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm not gonna be
a tabloid cliché.

99
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,879
I'm know what I'm
gonna do with my money.

100
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,907
"Find and build a life with the
one woman I ever cared for."

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,325
Point is,

102
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:26,951
nothing's changed.

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,245
I live the same life,
I eat the same food...

104
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,914
The same crappy canned food.

105
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,210
How many of your meals
do you eat from a can?

106
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,336
Most of them.

107
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,924
I'm used to it. I order
them by the case, online.

108
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,175
Is that bad?

109
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,037
You're worried about
the trickle-down effect

110
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,355
of Cuddy versus
House versus Cuddy.

111
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,274
You're reading subtext
into my silence?

112
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,276
House gets to you
more than anyone.

113
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,946
House thinks I'm a robot,
you think I'm a wuss?

114
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,447
No. No, no, no.

115
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,949
I think you're repressed.

116
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,274
Well, it's out of your control.

117
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,038
Tough childhood, strained
relations with your family.

118
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,792
Can't be easy trying to
succeed in a white man's world.

119
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,295
First of all, white man, I've
done at least as well as you have.

120
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,381
Second, I didn't think
you'd take House's view

121
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,216
that life sucks and we're stuck.

122
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,551
I think you're stuck.

123
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,597
Last month, I turned my life
around. I'm happier than ever.

124
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,391
Sleeping with 10 women
instead of four?

125
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,142
Mmm.
Try none.

126
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,353
He was cutting metal,
inhaled the dust?

127
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,398
Unless he was
snorting lines of the stuff.

128
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,732
None?

129
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:45,029
I was having tons of sex and
I was bored, hating myself.

130
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,133
Was never gonna be ready
when something real came along.

131
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,368
So, you're becoming
some kind of super monk,

132
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,328
and I can't change at all.

133
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,873
I challenge you to
go one differential

134
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,835
without House or anyone else
getting under your skin.

135
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,713
Since I say nothing gets to me
and you won't take me at my word,

136
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,278
how am I supposed
to prove you wrong?

137
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,091
I guess you can't.

138
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,509
I hope that doesn't eat at you.

139
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,264
Off-brand solvent from China.

140
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,391
Made of God knows what.

141
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,727
Patient eats cheap
canned goods by the case load.

142
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,103
Could be metal poisoning.

143
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,896
He also worked with
cut-rate chemicals.

144
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,733
Could be inhalation of
the toxic volatile substrate.

145
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,651
Treatment for both is chelation.

146
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,194
Great work.

147
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,155
Alkalinize his urine,

148
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,199
and force diuresis for
heavy metal poisoning.

149
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,202
If that doesn't work, put him
on dialysis for toxic inhalation.

150
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,747
I just said treatment
for both is chelation.

151
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,043
I said force diuresis and try
dialysis. You need a transcript?

152
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,588
You wanna put him on dialysis, risk
infection and hemodynamic swings,

153
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,756
when we can just chelate?

154
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,840
Whoa! Whoa!

155
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,050
Settle down.

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,346
If we chelate, we're not gonna
know what disease he had,

157
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,656
which means we're not gonna know

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,307
if the problem was
in his lousy, old job

159
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,643
or his still lousy new life,

160
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,646
which, for the purposes of a
metaphorical argument, is very important.

161
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,276
Pointless to argue. He's the
boss, he needs his puzzle solved.

162
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,721
Why bang our
heads against a wall?

163
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,883
When you're done
with the patient,

164
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,910
treat Foreman by banging
his head against a wall.

165
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,787
Where's the dialysis machine?

166
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,914
Who cares, since I
ordered chelation?

167
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,893
We'll flip a coin, tell House it
was one disease or the other.

168
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,145
Worst case, he finds out, and
he's impressed we defied him.

169
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,797
I'm sorry, I asked you to
remove the dialysis equipment,

170
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,257
not the chelation equipment.

171
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,301
And Dr. Cuddy asked me
to remove all equipment.

172
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,012
She de-authorized all treatment.

173
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,713
She won't let us make
a move until you agree to a sit-down

174
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,978
with the Godmother
and her consigliere.

175
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,605
Bitch to king four.

176
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,441
Checkmate. Patient
can't use his leg.

177
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,276
You have to concede.

178
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,324
Or I could just knock all
the pieces onto the floor.

179
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,910
You're discharging me?

180
00:08:55,993 --> 00:09:00,164
We really don't
have a good lie here.

181
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,126
You got caught in some
politics between our boss and his boss,

182
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,770
but you'll be out of
here 20 minutes, tops.

183
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,271
I'm not better,
but you're kicking me out?

184
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,606
Which is why it'll
only be 20 minutes.

185
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,775
See, the Dean of Medicine
acts tough, but she's not, really.

186
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,984
She'll step in, readmit you...

187
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,778
So, you're saying that she
cares more about his treatment

188
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,488
than the doctor who's
actually treating him?

189
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,139
Phil, shut up.

190
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,144
Cyrus.

191
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,981
Jennifer?

192
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,483
It's good to see you.

193
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,821
I read about you in the paper, so I
hopped the first train from Virginia.

194
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,490
So you read that
he struck it rich?

195
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,371
He's right.
It must look weird.

196
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,331
It kind of is weird.

197
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,918
But we're a long way
from the 3rd Street Jetty.

198
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,337
I just wanted to see
you again and say hi.

199
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,631
So, hi.

200
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,509
Hi.

201
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,283
I was starting to
think I'd never find my...

202
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,975
Baby Bear.

203
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,156
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

204
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,908
I'm so sorry.

205
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,409
I don't even feel nauseous.

206
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,619
I don't know why...

207
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,245
Your hand is shaking.
Okay.

208
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,529
You're having a focal seizure.

209
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,081
What does that mean?

210
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,667
It means you're not
getting discharged.

211
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,689
We were right
that it's a brain issue

212
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,508
but wrong about toxic
inhalation and metal poisoning.

213
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,634
Everyone else is waiting.

214
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,344
That was totally
courageous of Khloe

215
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,137
to tweet about her weight gain.

216
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,681
House, we've got a patient
with a seizure disorder

217
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,183
who can't walk.
Another one?

218
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,894
I thought we
kicked out the last one.

219
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,039
Obviously, I'll let you
treat your patient...

220
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,773
What are you doing?

221
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,235
We've got a patient with a
walking disorder who can't seize.

222
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,571
No, wait.

223
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,576
- I'm close, though, right?
- I wasn't finished.

224
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,952
Of course, I'll let you treat your
patient if you meet me halfway.

225
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,204
I guess I'm not finished either.

226
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,456
No clinic hours
for the next quarter.

227
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,210
And three parking spots next to
each other, so I can park diagonally,

228
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,920
and three pairs
of your underwear.

229
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,382
I'm thinking of
taking up sailing.

230
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,594
Forget it.

231
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,531
Treat your patient,
don't treat your patient,

232
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,395
come to the meeting,
don't come to the meeting,

233
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,511
I'm done playing your game.

234
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,228
You realize the game is automatically
over when the loser loses, right?

235
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,609
Neurological Lyme disease
explains the seizures and the paralysis.

236
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,153
But not the fact that Chase
seems to be treating you.

237
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,948
He claims he can
swear off sex indefinitely.

238
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,827
Also claims that I'm a boiling
cauldron of repressed rage.

239
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,293
Your theory is idiotic.

240
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,963
Patient's antibody titers were
negative for Lyme disease.

241
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,468
And I shared a motel room
with your ex-girlfriend.

242
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,474
You make a good point
about the antibody titers.

243
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,435
He's a rock.

244
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,021
How's your brother?
Homeless guy.

245
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,426
Haven't heard
from him in months.

246
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,190
I don't know.
Wish I did.

247
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,525
Postural hypotension,

248
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,903
which could've reduced
the blood supply to his brain.

249
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,613
Then he'd be a miserable wretch.

250
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,239
Actually, the prognosis is...

251
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,326
Oh, I'm sorry. I just meant
his life is gonna unravel.

252
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,662
In fairness, that
applies to any diagnosis.

253
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,789
Why do we do this?

254
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,250
It's not postural hypotension.
He's not orthostatic.

255
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,960
His life may unravel, may not.

256
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,879
He's not chasing
after material things.

257
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,756
Too bad. He might
actually get those.

258
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,467
He's looking for love. Just
tracked down an old girlfriend.

259
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,344
And she'll
never live up to the memory,

260
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,346
and the thrill of
finding her will wear off,

261
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,140
and he won't even be able
to dream about being happy.

262
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,851
Interesting.

263
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,079
The patient may have found
some long-ago nookie,

264
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,998
but it doesn't mean he hasn't
had some in the meantime.

265
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,774
Herpes encephalitis.

266
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,193
Explains the
neurological symptoms.

267
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,527
EEG to confirm,

268
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,780
IV acyclovir to treat.

269
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,032
How's Foreman's BP holding?

270
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,117
- Same.
- That's strange,

271
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,745
since I unplugged the
lead 30 seconds ago.

272
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,385
Admirable effort. And
I'm not just saying that

273
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,731
'cause I'm scared
you might turn green

274
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,035
and rip through
your own clothes.

275
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,138
Down on the patient's romance

276
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,267
because your own life span is
shorter than dinner and a movie?

277
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,604
You're the one who said
miserable stays miserable.

278
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,232
But you keep saying it
several times a day.

279
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,858
I love being back,

280
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,986
having every theory
you and I share

281
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,738
used as proof of
my own personal damage.

282
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,957
I'm afraid we'll need you to
step out when the EEG begins.

283
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,601
The waiting area is
just down the hall.

284
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,603
I gotta catch an early train
in the morning, anyway.

285
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,129
No, don't.

286
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,424
I'll put you up in a nice hotel
or rent you a furnished place.

287
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,094
I came for the night 'cause I
wanted to see how you were,

288
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,304
and maybe get back
in your life a bit.

289
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,593
But if I take your money...

290
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,516
What's wrong with
a nice place to stay?

291
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,854
Unless, of course,

292
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,772
you don't wanna stay.

293
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,111
I guess I could keep my
motel room another night or two.

294
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,538
Need a consult.

295
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,331
Did an EEG on my patient.

296
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,292
Turns out the reason
that prior doctors

297
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,918
thought it wasn't
a neural problem

298
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,046
is because it's
not a neural problem.

299
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,674
The EEG did show signs
of metabolic distress.

300
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,342
Scan his abdomen.
Yeah.

301
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,671
Let's assume we'd already
figured that out on our own,

302
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,805
and found a mass
on the pancreas.

303
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,729
Mass looks solid.
I'd say it's cancer.

304
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,565
Paraneoplastic syndrome would
explain the neurological symptoms.

305
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,068
You need to get a piece of it.
Schedule a CT-guided biopsy.

306
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,404
Yeah. Let's assume we'd
already figured that out on our own.

307
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,158
Then what's this consult?

308
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,497
Why haven't you been yelling
at me about the Cuddy twins?

309
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,688
Because you're
doing the right thing.

310
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,128
We talking about the same issue?

311
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,481
Is there something
I don't know about

312
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,507
that I'm responding to
appropriately?

313
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,426
Cuddy wants you in the
middle of this, so does Arlene,

314
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,096
because they don't wanna
face their own problem.

315
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,807
Somehow, in your
knee-jerk, juvenile way,

316
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,352
you tripped and fell into an
actual adult response to this.

317
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,189
You're right.

318
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,738
That was Cuddy's
strategy all along.

319
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,618
She wanted me to think that she
desperately needed me to be there

320
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,953
so that I wouldn't be there.

321
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,379
Where is Dr. House?

322
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,131
I didn't want him here.

323
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,883
This isn't about her treatment
at Princeton-Plainsboro,

324
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,219
it's about the fight
we had last week.

325
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,681
I'd like a moment with my mother

326
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,933
to try and work
this out on our own.

327
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,452
I'm afraid my client
doesn't want...

328
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,103
It's Mother's Day Sunday.

329
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,897
We can't have five
minutes alone to fix this?

330
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:26,277
Relax, you can still bill me for
the time standing in the hallway.

331
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,909
I know you're mad at me, but you
can barely make it up those stairs.

332
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,287
How many nights have
you spent on your couch?

333
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,892
This has nothing to
do with our fight.

334
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,125
We're talking about my
home, not a prison camp.

335
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,062
What did I just say? I think it was
something about this not being personal.

336
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,255
You can spend time with
Rachel, I can watch over you.

337
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,339
Win-win.

338
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,300
Maybe I've got a medical thing,

339
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,302
maybe I just think I'm talking

340
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,014
but no one can hear me,
not just my uncaring daughter.

341
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,558
What do you want?
20 grand.

342
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,811
I'll hire help and forget this
nightmare you put me through.

343
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,606
Make it 30.
I'll put in a stair-lift.

344
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:09,069
If my board even hears about
these threats, let alone a settlement,

345
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,338
they'll investigate
what happened

346
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,642
while you were
here as a patient.

347
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,658
House and I could
both lose our licenses.

348
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,537
I've been assuming
this is personal,

349
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,832
because I don't wanna assume
that that's what my mother wants.

350
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,924
House.

351
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,133
Ex-not-mom-in-law.

352
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,444
You said you weren't
coming. After you said,

353
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,303
"Pretty please,
with sugar on top?"

354
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,514
Problem is, we
only give store credit.

355
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,893
So I say we put your old,
cracked, poisonous hip back in,

356
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,144
here and now.

357
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,730
I saved your life,
happy to un-save it.

358
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,649
He's being an ass.

359
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,234
If I could join you
in suing him...

360
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,652
She's like this in bed, too.

361
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,987
Always scheming to get
the lawyers out of the room.

362
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,202
If House isn't going
to take this seriously,

363
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,663
I know a few judges who will.

364
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,253
Was I supposed to
be the good cop?

365
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,840
I had to rig the monitor.

366
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,761
I had a lot of
salt with breakfast.

367
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,473
You think I'm repressed, too?

368
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,518
I think you're in danger of being
dissolved by your own stomach acids.

369
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,061
But what about Chase?

370
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,306
Do you believe that nonsense
about him being celibate?

371
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,942
Don't know, but I'm rooting
for him. Read the studies.

372
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,354
The fewer partners you have,

373
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,612
the happier you are
with your ultimate partner.

374
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,322
Hmm.

375
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,533
Then you're gonna be miserable.

376
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:42,037
Those studies, it's important
that they have a control group.

377
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,707
There's the tumor
on his pancreas.

378
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,045
There's one in his kidney,
and one in his colon.

379
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,426
One looks avascular,
one looks vascular,

380
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,052
the third looks calcified.

381
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,055
He has three completely
different cancers at once.

382
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,392
On average,
not so lucky after all.

383
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,688
You had to go all
Wile E. Coyote on her.

384
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,190
You told me that Arlene
wanted me in the middle of it.

385
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,651
I had to show her that
no good would come of that.

386
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,571
Seriously, that's
your rationalization?

387
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,074
How about, you didn't
like that Cuddy tricked you

388
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,452
even though you wanted
the same thing as her?

389
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,246
You didn't like that
she got the best of you.

390
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,057
You've got more anger
toward her than you realize.

391
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,167
I'm happier without her.

392
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,131
So I'm not stupidly expecting
her to make me happy.

393
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,675
I'm happier with my unhappiness.

394
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,054
Do you listen to what you're
saying? Because I have to.

395
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,390
I'm holding a summit meeting to force
you and Cuddy on to the same page

396
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,768
before a lawsuit gets filed.

397
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,984
Three completely
unrelated cancers at once.

398
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,112
A multicancer syndrome,
Von Hippel-Lindau?

399
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,614
Wouldn't have touched his colon.

400
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,660
I hereby certify that
Dr. Foreman has not tampered

401
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,163
with this blood pressure
mechanism in any way.

402
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,291
And after I prove
I'm 100% stress-free,

403
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,835
do I get to strap you
into a chastity belt?

404
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,547
What if the patient's
missing a tumor suppressor gene?

405
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,926
How would we even find it? We
need to blast him with chemo now.

406
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,289
We can't give the patient chemo.

407
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,613
His platelet
count's through the floor.

408
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,806
Even worse,
it'll contain his cancers.

409
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,449
If we wanna know
what they've in common,

410
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,951
we've gotta see
where they spread next.

411
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,870
You wanna wait six months
while the cancer spreads

412
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,562
and his seizures and
paralysis get worse?

413
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,648
Now, that's crazy talk.

414
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:37,403
But if we pump the patient full of
vascular endothelial growth factor...

415
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,738
Foreman doesn't like that idea.

416
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,165
You want to grow
more and bigger cancers.

417
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,543
We can't figure out what three
small ones have in common,

418
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,838
maybe we can figure out what
eight big ones have in common.

419
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,134
Is this idea real,

420
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,178
or are you just threatening to
kill the patient to screw with me?

421
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,893
This whole thing is idiotic!

422
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,498
What does it matter what's inside
of me if I know how to control it?

423
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,358
Makes no difference to us, but
you may want to make out a will.

424
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,196
Go get lotto boy's consent,
and turn his cancers up to 11.

425
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,041
You, what, found my old yearbook

426
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,210
and got a picture
of my high school boyfriend?

427
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,974
Actually, that would've
been a lot simpler.

428
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,423
I took this 10 minutes ago.

429
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,137
Your high school boyfriend
who dumped you,

430
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,055
leaving you
unable to believe that

431
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,891
anyone can
rekindle an old flame.

432
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,436
He dumped me after I
hooked up with his sister.

433
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,694
Would you mind
letting him down gently?

434
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,905
I might have made promises
that you can't keep.

435
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,454
We're giving you more cancer.

436
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,664
The risks of that
are kind of obvious.

437
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,125
We'll scan you, run your
blood at frequent intervals.

438
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,002
We believe this
is our best chance

439
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,754
at finding the
underlying genetic flaw.

440
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,973
Will you marry me?

441
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,813
Don't be stupid.

442
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,607
If this cancer overwhelms me,

443
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,276
at least I'll die
happy here and now,

444
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,780
instead of hoping for a
future I may never have.

445
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,449
I love you.

446
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,285
No, you don't.

447
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,871
You don't know.
You can't know.

448
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,460
We both need more time.

449
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,630
And I believe
we're gonna have it.

450
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,949
Did you notice she's wearing
different clothes every day?

451
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,725
As opposed to the same
Starfleet-issued tunic?

452
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,103
She said she came for one
night. Why'd she pack for more?

453
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,981
So she stuffed an extra sweatshirt
in her bag or she bought some.

454
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,400
Used? She's here because
an old beau struck gold.

455
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,003
She turned down a proposal. How
long a game do you think she's playing?

456
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,030
I think if she said yes after 14
hours, even he'd be suspicious.

457
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,866
You're lucky you're
hot and smart because...

458
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:33,245
Well, you're just lucky
you're hot and smart.

459
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,015
I need a hooker.

460
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,433
Not if you can make that work.

461
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,686
How the hell is that
supposed to relax you?

462
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,999
It's not for me, it's for Chase.

463
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,567
I'm saving myself, too.
Maybe you should get a couple.

464
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,193
You're riding me,
why not ride him?

465
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,613
Because I can get
a rise out of your BP,

466
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,281
his pee-pee,
on the other hand...

467
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,075
Forget yoga.
Embrace Zen.

468
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,161
You're a repressed idiot,
he's a horny idiot.

469
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,872
Neither one of you can
do anything about it.

470
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,457
Pretty sure that's Zen.

471
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,081
Thought we were
meeting in Cuddy's office.

472
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,150
And I put one of the radio frequency
tagged sponges from the OR

473
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,235
in your portable television.

474
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,464
However much it hurt, I did
have a right to break up with you.

475
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,758
You just want everything to
have a hidden personal agenda.

476
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:55,077
You need to get over it instead
of torpedoing our jobs out of spite.

477
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,138
It couldn't just be that
you're a pain professionally...

478
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,330
Stop!

479
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,248
You're both at fault here.

480
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,085
You, for trying to manipulate
House when you used to know better,

481
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,171
and you, for being you,

482
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,465
which is an especially bad
idea under the circumstances.

483
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,758
I had good reasons.

484
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,302
You had lame rationalizations.

485
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,530
If I hadn't played him, he'd
have found out about the meeting

486
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,639
and crashed it anyway.

487
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,075
Yeah, it would've been
a lot more efficient.

488
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,892
Enough! Okay, here's
what's gonna happen.

489
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,228
Tomorrow, I drive
both of you to Arlene's.

490
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,351
You're gonna write her a
personal check for $30,000,

491
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,541
and tell her she can stay in
her own home with your blessing.

492
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,735
You're gonna do this because you
actually give a crap about your job

493
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:33,281
and this hospital, and your
mother, and possibly even House.

494
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,283
And you're gonna say,
"I'm sorry,"

495
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,077
and not utter one syllable more.

496
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,037
'Cause I'm an idiot?
No, because if you don't,

497
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,872
I'm gonna tell the
pharmacy to stop issuing

498
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,666
Vicodin prescriptions
in my name.

499
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,587
I'm not paying for gas.

500
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,470
Anything look different?

501
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,847
Not yet.

502
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,265
Where's Jennifer?

503
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,684
She's embezzling money
from my Swiss bank account.

504
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,132
That's what you think, isn't it?

505
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,147
I'm being taken for a ride?

506
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,819
I think she wouldn't be here if
you were still fixing refrigerators.

507
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,824
One random set of numbers
doesn't change human nature.

508
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,285
Those sets of numbers
are what kept me going.

509
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,996
Clutching those tickets,

510
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,206
thinking about
the life I could have,

511
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,583
finding Jennifer again.

512
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,835
So you figure if one
long-shot dream came true,

513
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,129
the other one will as well?

514
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,840
You think you're protecting me.

515
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,009
I think you're sad.

516
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,471
Can't stand to
see somebody happy.

517
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,148
Mom, here's a check.

518
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,484
It's a settlement for
all you've been through.

519
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,003
Of course,
you can stay in your home.

520
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,904
It was wrong of me
to suggest otherwise.

521
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,201
I'm sorry

522
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,870
that we saved your life

523
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,250
in the way that we did.

524
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,211
B plus.

525
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,213
I hope this resolves everything.

526
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,090
I can tell you that both your
daughter and Dr. House are deeply...

527
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,384
This is 30 grand.

528
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,636
Which is what you asked for.

529
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,095
This covers pain and suffering.

530
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,597
What about the probate lawyer?

531
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,018
Did you two... I have
to change my will.

533
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,605
Leave everything to Julia so this
one doesn't try more funny business

534
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,482
to get control of my home.

535
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,818
I'm sure we can
toss in another $2,500.

536
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,779
Well, I guess I'll have
to kill you tonight, then.

537
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,048
Mom, I'm not interested in...

538
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,116
You already think you own
my body, why not my home, too?

539
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,743
Everybody, stay calm and...

540
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,329
You have to lash out at
everyone who tries to help you?

541
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,212
Live in your own
kitchen sink, for all I care.

542
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,250
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Harsh.

543
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,210
I didn't think you
had a case before,

544
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,504
but that is no way
to talk to a patient.

545
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,047
You are right.

546
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,271
Chase has had his eyes
on this one for months.

547
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,857
Meaning, he has eyes?

548
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,276
I paid her $100.
Now, when he hits on her,

549
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,278
might be tonight,
might be next week,

550
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,864
she's gonna slap
him and storm off.

551
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:23,118
So, your plan is to prove you're
both full of crap all in one move?

552
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,828
First he'll compliment her hair.

553
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,122
That's how he breaks the ice.

554
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,709
Next comes some
kind of joke or story.

555
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,294
He's sharpening his harpoon...

556
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,421
Are my moves this predictable?

557
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,801
She's grabbing his arm,
he's going in for the kill...

558
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,456
Don't let it get to you.

559
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,171
We poured a
lot of gas on the fire.

560
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,673
Ultrasound will give us a
good look at the damage.

561
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,841
A little more gel.

562
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,427
I never made a will.

563
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,950
I wanna provide for you
if I don't...

564
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,347
Stop it, will you?

565
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,349
I'd like you to
hold your breath for a sec.

566
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,810
Your money, there's
charities, causes,

568
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,854
your family.

569
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,022
You gotta ask yourself,

570
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,108
"What's mattered to you most
year in and year out?"

571
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,988
That can't be right.

572
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,200
Is it bad news?

573
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,618
No.

574
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,663
We've been pumping you
with growth factor,

575
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,540
but you don't
have any new cancers.

576
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,876
The tumors you had

577
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,128
all shrank.

578
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,010
Three tumors disappearing means
we were probably wrong about

579
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,471
him missing
a tumor suppressor gene.

580
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,181
How many mulligans
are you gonna ask for?

581
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,351
This test is what
raised my blood pressure.

582
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,228
I'm used to it now.

583
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,230
Go.

584
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,691
If it's autoimmune,

585
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,986
and he created antibodies that
ended up fighting his own tumors...

586
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,072
Growth factor would've made the
underlying autoimmune condition better.

587
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,949
Maybe it was never cancer
in the first place.

588
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,951
Of course, it was
cancer. We biopsied.

589
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,579
It could've been
a false positive.

590
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,084
Amyloidosis? His EKG voltage
has been on the low end of normal.

591
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,629
What if the tumors were
actually protein deposits?

592
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,674
GI biopsy to confirm,
chemo to treat.

593
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,136
She's making that diagnosis
based off a low-normal EKG.

594
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,345
Low-normal's still normal.

595
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,516
That thing cannot be right.

596
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,309
Low-normal is still low.

597
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,663
And that thing does not have
money riding on you being wrong,

598
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,730
like the rest of us do.

599
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,897
Chase, fix this.

600
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,500
Oh, I think you're
confusing Chase and Foreman.

601
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,942
I used to do that all the time.

602
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,278
I know it's rigged!

603
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,446
Because you're Mr. Cool,

604
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,031
nothing could possibly phase...

605
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,574
'Cause I took a beta blocker.

606
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,128
Both times, right?

607
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,715
His platelet count's still low.

608
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,175
Chemo's still a death sentence,

609
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,885
treating for amyloid
with normal EKG

610
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,636
is like doing
heart surgery on a guy

611
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,406
because he's 10 pounds
overweight. It's insane.

612
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,224
We'll do it your way. Go shout
at the patient till he gets better.

613
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,144
GI biopsy to confirm,
chemo to treat.

614
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,905
Here's the dirty little secret.

615
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,615
I just think we are who we are.

616
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,867
And I think
lotteries are stupid.

617
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,205
Janet Hemorrhoid!

618
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,170
That's not my name.
It's why I'm here.

619
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,715
Oh, I see, it goes across.

620
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,926
We better make this fast
'cause I'm about to

621
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,803
lose my medical license
for malpractice.

622
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,223
It's nothing unusual. Head of the
hospital's about to lose hers, too.

623
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,901
I heard Cuddy quadrupled
your clinic hours.

624
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,362
Yeah, but you know what?
I'm flying through patients.

625
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,613
Arlene wants another meeting.

626
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,907
I know. I told my
seconds to tell her seconds

627
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,159
that she gets no second chance.

628
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,620
Technically, it's a third
chance, but I don't have thirds.

629
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,747
Cuddy told her the
same thing, more or less.

630
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,833
So you got us on
the same page, after all.

631
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,602
I've been thinking
about your irrationality,

632
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,666
and I've come up with a
rational explanation for it.

633
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,296
That's quite a challenge.

634
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,714
You don't wanna let go of Cuddy.

635
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,050
So you're clinging to
the negative interaction

636
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,052
because some
small part of you thinks

637
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,388
the bad stuff
beats nothing at all.

638
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,431
Almost making this work.

639
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,434
All you gotta do now
is change reality.

640
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,061
Perhaps if I was
the one suing me.

641
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,522
You didn't start it, but you
had the chance to end it.

642
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,816
And you didn't.
You love her, House.

643
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,486
And it's human to hang on, but
you're blowing up not just your job

644
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,448
but any chance of any kind
of relationship with her again.

645
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,459
Hi.

646
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,005
Hey.

647
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,634
What's that?

648
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,722
It's a check for $10 million.

649
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,441
Uh.

650
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,651
I don't know what to say.

651
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,696
You've already been so generous.

652
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,076
By hiring you? For a whopping
six figures? My own blood?

653
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,538
Best friend I ever had?

654
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,500
Year in, year out?

655
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,201
You're wearing contacts
under your glasses?

656
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,120
I must've forgotten to
take them off when I...

657
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,248
They're tinted. Do you
change your eye color?

658
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,408
Sometimes I like to mix it up.

659
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,339
I don't understand
what you... Wait.

661
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,842
You don't have brown eyes?

662
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,017
Where'd the name
"Baby Bear" come from?

663
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,480
It's so long ago, I don't...

664
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,066
It's a birthmark
on your left breast

665
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,777
in the shape of a bear.

666
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,529
You forgot that?

667
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,263
It's the one thing
I never told you.

668
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,039
That's why she doesn't know.

669
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,543
It's not like that.

670
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,044
I swear.

671
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,800
Get out.
Get out, both of you.

672
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,052
Come on, man.

673
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,596
Get out.
I'm sorry.

674
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,056
Get out!

675
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,143
Both of you!

676
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,236
You were right. I'm
just another lottery fool.

677
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,448
My life sucks.

678
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,992
It'll always suck.

679
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,246
He's crashing.
Everything's shutting down.

680
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,713
Patient had a cardiac arrest,

681
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,091
and his lungs and liver failed
before we even started the chemo.

682
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,511
Brain symptoms that aren't brain
symptoms, tumors that come and go.

683
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,138
It's not amyloidosis.

684
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,099
You're forgetting alopecia.

685
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,494
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were just listing

686
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,062
the things it's not,
alphabetically.

687
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,938
His long-lost love is a fraud.

688
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,065
Thirteen figured that out.

689
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,191
Good for her.

690
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,692
Decades of menial work.

691
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,404
If three cancers couldn't make
him die miserable, she just did.

692
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,947
The truth made him miserable.

693
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,992
It's like there's two of me.

694
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,789
Keep the clinic shut down,

695
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,458
but whatever it is, it's isolated
to the administrative floor.

696
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,211
I'm not gonna
evacuate the whole...

697
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,220
Only way to get the two of you

698
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,680
in the same place
at the same time.

699
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,229
Reopen everything,
readmit everyone, now.

700
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,816
I want you both to know
I'm filing the suit today,

701
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,568
delivering the paperwork
to your counsel's office.

702
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,933
You have to be destructive.
You have to tear things apart.

703
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,157
God forbid you should say what's
really on that twisted mind of yours.

704
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,118
And you're the great peacemaker?

705
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,454
Single mom, can't keep a man
long enough to cook a meal...

706
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:32,166
You'd be dead if it weren't
for our mistreatment.

707
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,410
And somehow, you'd still
find something to whine about.

708
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,046
We'll let the court decide who's
whining since you're so sure...

709
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,881
We're not getting back together.

710
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,136
What are you talking about?

711
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,054
It's the only explanation.

712
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,806
Why she keeps making threats

713
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,893
without ever filing her stupid,
yet completely valid lawsuit.

714
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,270
Why she ripped up her will,

715
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,106
why she kicked half of the
hospital out on the street.

716
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,733
She wants us united against her.

717
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,945
This is her drawing blood

718
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,699
over the latest of a long
line of imaginary slights.

719
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,536
She doesn't care if anyone
else is happy for a single...

720
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,208
Look at you idiots.

721
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,712
Who else is gonna put up
with either of you?

722
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,051
I asked you to move in.

723
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,432
That meant we
weren't gonna reconcile.

724
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,228
I'm sorry, Mom.

725
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:40,026
Some things take more
than a common enemy.

726
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,740
And you're an idiot with
impossible standards.

727
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,132
Common enemy.

728
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,177
One way to
trigger brain symptoms

729
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,387
when there's nothing
wrong with your brain.

730
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,891
Have something else turn
your brain into a common enemy.

731
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,309
You have a teratoma,

732
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,145
a usually harmless
congenital growth

733
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,981
which can be filled with
almost any kind of tissue.

734
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,068
And unusually,
not at all harmless.

735
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,446
If I'm right, yours is
filled with primitive cells,

736
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,907
some of which
developed into brain cells.

737
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,202
These foreign cells leaked
into your blood stream.

738
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:35,414
Now, the body is a little
xenophobic, and it creates antibodies.

739
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,017
The problem is, there's
not much difference

740
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,417
between brain cells
in your abdomen

741
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,794
and brain cells in your brain.

742
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:44,840
To make matters worse, primitive
cells can become almost anything.

743
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,509
Grow like weeds,

744
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,011
which means they can
turn into tumors,

745
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,514
and destroy whole organ systems.

746
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,476
But the cancer?

747
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,644
It was cancer.

748
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,939
It was just growing so fast, it
collapsed under its own weight.

749
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,526
Am I gonna live?

750
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,362
Cut out the teratoma and
what's left of your cancer,

751
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,155
you should be fine.

752
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,825
Think of it as your
second luckiest day.

753
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,536
It's hard to feel lucky.

754
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,330
The woman I loved was a fraud.

755
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,041
No, actually,
a fraud was a fraud.

756
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,169
You fell for her just the same.

757
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,963
You may stay miserable,

758
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,716
but your long-lost love is
not gonna be the reason why.

759
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,266
It's the real Jennifer.

760
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,711
Or at least
the only one to show up

761
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,604
who actually has the birthmark.

762
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,065
He's renting her an apartment.

763
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,110
It'll end horribly.

764
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,569
Not for him.

765
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,073
She may take all his money,

766
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,784
and he may be a naive idiot,

767
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,404
but he'll always be hopeful.

768
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,080
So he'll always be happy.

769
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,796
You lost your mother,
you euthanized your brother,

770
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,216
you got the life expectancy
of a pretty good sitcom.

771
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,247
If you can
convince yourself that

772
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,529
you'll be miserable
no matter what,

773
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,805
even without all that stuff,

774
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,641
then maybe you don't
have to hate the universe

775
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,768
for dumping a giant turd on you.

776
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,314
Fatalism is your
survival mechanism.

777
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,569
And you?

778
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,822
Dumped by everyone
you've ever loved,

779
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,574
rehab was a bust,

780
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,744
your leg feels like somebody
took a giant bite out of it.

781
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,498
We are who we are.

782
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,585
Lotteries are stupid.
