1
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,789
They have a cure
for that, you know?

2
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,625
It's called a computer.

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,395
We're done for the day, or do I
need to find something else to read?

4
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,587
I'm done.

5
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,007
It's done.

6
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,302
No way. It's finished?

7
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,347
How's it end? I mean,
you gotta let me read it.

8
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,932
Not this time.

9
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,768
Well, you at least gotta
tell me what happens.

10
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,747
Come on. How am I supposed to
help with the next book if you don't...

11
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,940
There isn't going
to be a next book.

12
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,611
You can't be serious. Why?

13
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,697
You wouldn't understand.

14
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,990
Try me.

15
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,957
I just can't do it anymore.

16
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,335
I'm not brave like you.

17
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,090
But writing's your whole life.

18
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,425
What are you
gonna do without it?

19
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,844
What I should
have done years ago.

20
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:40,392
What are you doing? Put it
down or I'll... I'll make you.

21
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,019
How, Jack?

22
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,065
You don't even exist.

23
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,194
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,707
Miss Tanner! Miss Tanner!

25
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,084
Dear God!

26
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,785
Which of these says I
want to sleep with you more?

27
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,871
Penguin or beaver?
Beaver, beaver, beaver.

28
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,791
You're right.
It's too high school.

29
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,417
What did you do
to piss Cuddy off?

30
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,919
I can't be romantic?

31
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,546
House, you're stealing
from a woman in a coma.

32
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,216
We're fine. I've never
seen her happier.

33
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,259
Yeah? What about you?

34
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,054
I'm worried.

35
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,597
Because she's happy?

36
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,224
No, because I am.

37
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,394
House, that's...
Ironic, weird, crazy?

38
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,729
I was going to say normal.

39
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,816
For now. We're in
the honeymoon period.

40
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,402
Our brains are flooded
with endorphins.

41
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,987
And when she snaps out of
it, where does that leave us?

42
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,156
In an adult relationship.

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,743
Name one thing that Cuddy and
I have in common besides work.

44
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,161
There's...

45
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,666
You're both... Wait... Exactly.

46
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,752
Long-term relationships
are based on compatibility.

47
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,255
And right now we only have sex.

48
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,508
House, you don't actually think
she'd dump you because you, what,

49
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,177
don't do yoga,
listen to the B-52s?

50
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,846
Not right away.

51
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:29,686
We'll fight, makeup sex, fight,
maybe sex, and then she'll dump me.

52
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,188
With possible goodbye sex.

53
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,524
So instead of enjoying
the honeymoon phase,

54
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,026
you've decided
to skip it entirely?

55
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,613
I need to find something that we
both like doing, besides each other.

56
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,283
Right. Or you could
just talk to her about it.

57
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,166
No, then she'll start pretending
to like things that she really doesn't

58
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,122
just to make me feel better,
which will make her feel even worse,

59
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,541
which won't be my fault,
so I'll resent her,

60
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,710
and that won't be her
fault, so she'll resent me.

61
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:59,716
At least with my plan, I get my
One A Day with iron till the bitter end.

62
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,985
Is there a reason why
you're following me?

63
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,051
Oh! Yeah.

64
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,388
You're not gonna believe
who just checked into the ER.

65
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,391
The doctor hasn't
examined you yet.

66
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,311
There's nothing wrong with
me. My maid just overreacted.

67
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,687
Great!

68
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,648
This won't take long, then.

69
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,736
EMTs found her unconscious.
Her maid said she had a seizure.

70
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,362
I fainted.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,241
Huge Jack Cannon fan, by
the way. I love your books.

72
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,826
Really?

73
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,371
My fans tend to be overly
annoying teenaged girls.

74
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,998
I know.

75
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,281
And all they care about is
who's hotter, Jack or Deacon.

76
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
Like Sarah can't
love both of them.

77
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,380
I may belong to one
or two online fan clubs.

78
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,869
So how's the new
book coming along?

79
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,762
I don't talk about my work.

80
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,347
Okay.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,100
How about nodding your head
to a few yes/no questions?

82
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,770
But I'll make you a deal.

83
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,900
You finish this exam quickly,
and I'll answer one question.

84
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,027
About anything?
Anything.

85
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,906
Who is Jack's real father?
Who kidnapped his uncle?

86
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,783
Deal.

87
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,536
I will have to go with...

88
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,954
Why did you try
to kill yourself?

89
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,290
The burn on the side of your
face is caused by gunpowder.

90
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,460
So, did you change your mind at
the last second or just a lousy shot?

91
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,504
I'm out of here.

92
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,630
You can't.
We had a deal.

93
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,299
Try and stop me.

94
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,467
Okay.

95
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,554
This woman is on a
72-hour psychiatric hold.

96
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,722
If she tries to run, shoot her.

97
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,891
With a sedative,
if that's more convenient.

98
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,156
He called us back to work because
a lady might have had a seizure.

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,784
A seizure while trying
to commit suicide.

100
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,227
So send her for a psych eval.
What's that got to do with us?

101
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,682
What is the matter
with you people?

102
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,791
We're talking about a
human being who's suffering.

103
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,170
You're right, that's not enough.

104
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,508
She is also the writer of
Jack Cannon, Boy Detective.

105
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,176
Beloved by millions
around the world.

106
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,679
By girls between 10 and 14.

107
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,018
Look, the point is,
if she kills herself,

108
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,771
millions of fans, of all ages and
genders, will be very disappointed.

109
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,655
So we're taking this case
'cause you're a fan?

110
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,609
No, that would be
crazy and unprofessional.

111
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,292
You're taking this case
'cause I said so.

112
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,946
You and Taub do a full
workup, observe her overnight.

113
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,740
See if she has another
seizure. You can go.

114
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,925
Why does he get the night off?

115
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,620
Because he brought
a smoking hot babe.

116
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,210
I have plans with my wife.

117
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,545
Yeah, nice try.

118
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,882
You hate your personal life.
And you obviously don't have one.

119
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,468
Hey.

120
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,432
I'd stay myself, but I just
bought the flowers, so...

121
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,646
Reservation for Dominica isn't
until 8:00. So we got plenty of time.

122
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,148
You need to pick something
up from a haunted house?

123
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,817
This is a Gothic
revival masterpiece.

124
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,445
I hope one day to live
in a house like this.

125
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,788
Your friend's a writer?

126
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,373
One of the best.

127
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,751
She wants me to read
her latest manuscript.

128
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:27,006
"Alice Tanner." Why does
that name sound familiar?

129
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,468
I gave you a couple of
her books a few years ago.

130
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,138
No.

131
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,226
She's the woman
you put on the psych hold.

132
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,853
This isn't a date.
We're on a case.

133
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,022
Ever hear of multitasking?

134
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,565
Did you steal her keys?

135
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,485
You think I'd take the Dean
of Medicine on a B and E?

136
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,779
How did you get in here?

137
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,075
Well, I guess you
have your answer.

138
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,078
When was your last physical?

139
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,248
A while ago.
I don't like doctors.

140
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,335
Any history of seizures
before today?

141
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,881
Not that I recall. Are we
almost done? I'm tired.

142
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,760
The exam would go faster if
you would cooperate with us.

143
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,429
I am.

144
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,723
You're evading
every question we ask.

145
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,806
Why do you say that?

146
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:18,891
That.

147
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,811
I didn't ask for help.

148
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,939
Committing a suicidal
gesture says otherwise.

149
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,441
It wasn't a gesture.

150
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,737
I had the damn seizure before I
could get the gun in my mouth.

151
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,196
You want to tell us why?

152
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,284
You want to know my life
story, my secret inner pain?

153
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:40,079
Maybe if I just open up a
little, you'll be able to save me?

154
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,291
We're just trying to help you.

155
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,585
Thank you.

156
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,921
I want a woman doctor.

157
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,381
And back to being evasive.

158
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,344
It's my right as a patient.
So, please, get out now.

159
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,763
We need to
observe you overnight.

160
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,556
You really think
I'm stupid enough

161
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,683
to try and kill myself
in a hospital?

162
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,351
To see if you have
another seizure.

163
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,812
We'll be up there
and we won't disturb you

164
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,565
unless there's a problem.
That work for you?

165
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,485
Whatever it takes to
get you out of here.

166
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,490
House, Christina has
agreed to not call the police.

167
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,408
She's probably illegal.

168
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,619
Same reason she didn't
report the suicide attempt.

169
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,705
I called 911, but when
Miss Tanner woke up,

170
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,625
she said she would fire me if
I say anything about the gun.

171
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,127
And if she whacks herself,
what happens to your job?

172
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,673
I think she's
a very depressed person.

173
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,927
Never goes out,
doesn't have friends.

174
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,889
She has all this money,
but all she does is write.

175
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,391
I need to see
her latest manuscript.

176
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,521
She always locks up
her writing in there.

177
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:51,609
Has she ever complained
about physical pain or stress?

178
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,571
Yes. Her back and
her hands hurt a lot.

179
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,700
A writer with back and hand
pain. That's very helpful. Let's go.

180
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,036
Sometimes I hear
her cry at night

181
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,330
when she thinks
nobody is listening.

182
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,041
I should have done something.

183
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,251
True.

184
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,711
What are you doing?

185
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,758
Before there were
hard drives, there were...

186
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,854
How many of these
does she eat a day?

187
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,939
Two for lunch.
Sometimes three.

188
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,200
Still no seizure activity.
It's your turn...

189
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,621
What the hell?

190
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,914
Close. House.

191
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,462
She's fine. Both the EEG
and all her vitals have been...

192
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,139
You. What do you want?

193
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,557
You wet the bed.

194
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,644
I'm just not sure how yet.

195
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,154
Good morning, gentlemen.

196
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,993
Well, if it's any consolation,
I didn't get any sleep either.

197
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,830
Unilateral hyperhidrosis.
Interesting.

198
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,042
She also admitted she tried to
kill herself, but won't tell us why.

199
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,168
House searched her home,

200
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,545
found she's been eating two
cans of tuna a day for years.

201
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,671
Mercury poisoning?

202
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,508
Explains the seizures, hand and
back pain, also the depression.

203
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,594
Explains everything
except the fact that it's not.

204
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,655
We got her urine and blood
samples back. They're normal.

205
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,879
If it's low level, it might
not show up in a spot check.

206
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,813
We'd need to run
continuous testing to find it.

207
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,977
We can't. She wants
a female doctor.

208
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,661
She only asked for
a woman to waste time.

209
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,649
She's cooperating just enough
to get through the psych hold.

210
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,694
Put some lipstick on Chase
and start chelation therapy.

211
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,821
Confirm with another urine test.

212
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,660
Okay, I'll go talk to Cuddy.

213
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,037
Maybe she'll let us
borrow a dress, too.

214
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,094
This would be me ignoring you.

215
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,222
What if we got
arrested last night?

216
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,934
And whatever happened to keeping our
professional and personal lives separate?

217
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,219
I'm not the one talking
about our relationship at work.

218
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,397
What's behind your back?

219
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,857
Peace penguin.

220
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,795
What room should I return it to?

221
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,987
243.

222
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,948
I need some help with Alice
Tanner. She wants a vagina.

223
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,283
I'm pretty attached to mine.

224
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,454
I told you to hire a temporary
replacement for Thirteen two weeks ago.

225
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,580
I've been busy.

226
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,082
Doing what?
You.

227
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,368
So you'll talk her out of it?

228
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,498
You'll hire a woman doctor?

229
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,838
Do you think we just sit around

230
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,007
talking sports
and belching and farting

231
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,466
when chicks aren't around?

232
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,468
By when?
Next week.

233
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,303
Next week it is.

234
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,616
What makes you think
it's mercury?

235
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,850
Your symptoms.

236
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,979
I can perform the procedure myself
if you still prefer a woman doctor.

237
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,106
But the team you
have is our best.

238
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,151
That's an interesting
perfume you're wearing.

239
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,527
It was a gift.

240
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,112
From Dr. House?

241
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,782
It was all over him last night.

242
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,883
If you'd prefer another female
doctor, I can arrange that as well.

243
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,997
I also smelled it somewhere
else more recently.

244
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,249
Faint, but unmistakable.

245
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,379
You should have worn a different
cardigan this morning, Christina.

246
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,174
Something you'd like
to tell me, dear?

247
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:49,472
When I found you yesterday,
I thought I was too late.

248
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,225
I talked to them so I
could help you get better.

249
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,103
I just don't want to
see you suffer anymore.

250
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,355
That won't be a problem.

251
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,482
You're fired.

252
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,902
This woman cares about you.
If it weren't for her...

253
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,279
I wouldn't be here now, would I?

254
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,906
I should have done it yesterday.

255
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,575
I understand
that you're in pain,

256
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,702
but lashing out
isn't the answer.

257
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,412
Treatment is.

258
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,580
I agree.

259
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,373
Send the men back.

260
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,878
At least they're not a bunch
of dewy-eyed cry babies.

261
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,381
What's that?

262
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,550
It's the new Jack Cannon novel.

263
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,596
Suggestions?

264
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,015
Yeah. Stop.
It can't be done.

265
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,768
People wonder why
you never cured cancer.

266
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,481
Did you get this before or
after your date with Cuddy?

267
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,943
Yeah, probably would have
been a wiser choice. Huh.

268
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,780
This is actually good, House.

269
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,449
She's committing crimes.
What does that tell you?

270
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,743
I'm a horrible influence.

271
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,788
True. A horrible influence
she's reaching out to.

272
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,540
She's looking
for ways to connect.

273
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,961
Sure, they're self-destructive,
juvenile and insane,

274
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,879
but so are you.

275
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,715
You do have something in common.

276
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,761
You're both trying to find
things you have in common.

277
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,473
And not finding them.

278
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,230
You don't look so hot.
You want to talk about it?

279
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,441
Those days are over.

280
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,579
Who are you talking to?

281
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,664
Myself.

282
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,833
If you're seeing things, it
could be another symptom.

283
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,585
It's not.

284
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,505
It's only in my imagination.
I make things up for a living.

285
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,260
And talking to them?

286
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,970
It's a writer thing.

287
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,598
We're also good
at reading people.

288
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,433
Like you, for instance.

289
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,727
Recently divorced.

290
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,397
You slept with a girl last
night, her place, not yours.

291
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,108
You probably won't
return her calls.

292
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,194
That...

293
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,324
How?

294
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,785
The tan line from your
former wedding ring.

295
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,832
You stink of smoke, but no
yellow on your fingers or teeth

296
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:27,129
means she's the smoker and
you either didn't shower or change.

297
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,964
Either way, her place.

298
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,801
Do him.

299
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,638
We're wasting time,
which is her main goal here.

300
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,681
I need your arm for this.

301
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,683
You remind me of my ex-husband.

302
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,354
A cute man, but problems
in the bedroom department.

303
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,067
Not even close.

304
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,110
The ones I caught him in.

305
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,363
He cheated on me
every chance he could.

306
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,492
The first time with my
best friend. The second...

307
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,744
Bastard.

308
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,998
BP and heart rate are spiking.

309
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,122
Must be an allergic reaction
to the chelation agent.

310
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,753
I didn't give it to her yet.

311
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,716
Pain, seizures, hyperhidrosis,

312
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,427
and sudden onset of
radically high blood pressure.

313
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,513
The continuous blood
and urine tests came back.

314
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,765
It's definitely not mercury
poisoning. They're clean.

315
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,558
Could be haemolytic
uremic syndrome.

316
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,454
It's not. There weren't any blood or
protein markers in her urine either.

317
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,748
We also caught her talking
to herself. She could be delusional.

318
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,940
She's a writer and a recluse.

319
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,609
I'd be more surprised if
she didn't talk to herself.

320
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,152
You done playing
with your ribbon?

321
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,405
What was she doing
when it happened?

322
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,031
Sitting in bed.

323
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,076
She claims it was only in
her imagination, but still.

324
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,411
When her BP spiked.

325
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,330
Comparing Taub to her
ex-husband. She really hated the guy.

326
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,043
And her first symptom was
when she had a gun to her head.

327
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,842
Excess adrenaline would explain
the seizures and skyrocketing BP.

328
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,385
A pheochromocytoma.

329
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,137
Get an MRI and find it.

330
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,940
Would you hold this?

331
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,073
I meant now.

332
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,040
Have I mentioned
I'm claustrophobic?

333
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,624
Have I mentioned we don't care?

334
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,671
What's wrong?
Nothing, just a leg cramp.

335
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,721
Get her out of here!
She's got metal in her leg!

336
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,018
She has three screws
in her right leg

337
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,395
from a skiing accident
she didn't tell us about.

338
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,439
The MRI's magnetic field superheated
the metal, causing third-degree burns.

339
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,444
Skin ruptured from
internal heat pressure here.

340
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,781
It's not our fault.

341
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,259
She signed the consent forms.
Denied there was any metal in...

342
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,704
Normally I'd say it, but maybe
this way it'll finally sink in.

343
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,794
She wants to die. We
cannot trust anything she says.

344
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,597
Treating the soft tissue injuries
in her leg cost us most of the day.

345
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,964
We also had to
replace the screws.

346
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,927
And finding a pheochromocytoma
without using the MRI could take us a week.

347
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,888
Longer if she doesn't
stop lying to us.

348
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,434
Or we could figure out a way to find it
in the 39 hours left on her psych hold.

349
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:32,106
We need to make her cooperate. We
need to offer her something she wants.

350
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,816
She wants to
kill herself, House.

351
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,237
I can work with that.

352
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,332
I want you to write more books.

353
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,086
I'm done writing
Jack Cannon's adventures.

354
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,506
And when I get out of here,
I'll just be done.

355
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,300
Now don't you say that,
you dirty birdie.

356
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,487
You know, there are
easier ways to go

357
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,097
than shooting yourself in the
head or tearing apart a limb.

358
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,683
And this is one of them.

359
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,644
The best part?
You'll feel so good,

360
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,813
you won't even
notice you're dead.

361
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,776
You expect me to believe
you're going to help me kill myself?

362
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,028
You are the perceptive
one. You tell me.

363
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,698
Why?

364
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,869
We can't find your tumor in
time without your cooperation.

365
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,704
So I'm giving you a choice.

366
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,081
Give us a chance
to make you better

367
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,500
or stick this anywhere and push.

368
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,337
Why do you care about me?

369
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,215
You think you know me
because you read my books?

370
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,553
No. I know pain.

371
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,850
You think you can handle it,
and then one day you can't.

372
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,563
And when that happens, you either
find reasons to go on or you don't.

373
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,482
I'm...

374
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,568
I'm all out of reasons.

375
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,652
Now.

376
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:05,532
When you're pain-free, you're gonna
wanna live and start writing again.

377
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,579
And if I'm wrong, you got a
backup plan to take home with you.

378
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,374
Okay.

379
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,170
Good choice.

380
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,257
If I were you, I'd hide
that if you want to keep it.

381
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,009
I know the perfect place.

382
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,405
Morning, sunshine.

383
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,658
You're a real bastard.

384
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,618
You were supposed
to choose life.

385
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,830
You're also an excellent liar.

386
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,792
Wasn't lying about the cure.

387
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,630
If we find and remove that
pesky adrenaline-secreting tumor,

388
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,465
you'll get better.

389
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,300
You'd better hurry.

390
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,345
My lawyer will have me out
of here this time tomorrow.

391
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,013
Yeah, about that.

392
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,600
It seems that last night, you
found and self-administered

393
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,144
what you thought was a
potentially lethal narcotic.

394
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,315
Your psych hold has been
extended an additional 24 hours.

395
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,693
I know.
Bummer, right?

396
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,447
You want to know
something about my book?

397
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,661
Sure.
Jack Cannon dies.

398
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,832
I know. Bummer, right?

399
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,379
We finished analyzing
the PET scans from last night.

400
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,755
There's no sign of a tumor.

401
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,009
We sampled blood from six different
areas looking for any spikes in adrenaline.

402
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,174
All of them were negative.

403
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,305
If she told us her symptoms, where
it hurts, when the pain first started,

404
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,390
we could at least
focus on a specific area.

405
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,392
Or use them to rule areas out.

406
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,687
She'll only lie. We're better
off not even talking to her.

407
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,064
You think you can get her
to try to kill herself again?

408
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,858
We're gonna need more time.

409
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,486
There might be a way to get
her symptoms without asking her.

410
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,488
If writers write what they know.

411
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,074
I thought you said it was
about a boy detective.

412
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,535
And his mentor, Aunt Helen,

413
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,539
who happens to be around
the same age as Alice.

414
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,125
The answers
could be in the book.

415
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,211
Great. You finish reading
your typewriter ribbon yet?

416
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,882
Look for the tumor
with ultrasound.

417
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,179
I drove across town
to treat a ribbon?

418
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,890
That's why I prefer lying.
It makes things easier.

419
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,976
Whatever he has you doing, stop.

420
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,311
You told him?

421
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,522
We do live together. I generally
tell him when I show up at his work.

422
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,692
He told me it was a
matter of life and death.

423
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,362
It is. My patient
wants to kill herself.

424
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,821
He's just trying to read a book.

425
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,032
The latest Jack Cannon,
Boy Detective.

426
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,909
Alice Tanner is your patient?

427
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,410
You're a Fannon, too?

428
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,745
I'm Team Deacon.

429
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,623
Oh, come on. Why
can't she love them both?

430
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,920
The typewriter keys should have
left impressions on these ribbon fibers.

431
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,130
They would also
remove a layer of ink.

432
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,884
It's just a question of
tweaking the software, really.

433
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,565
Does Cuddy know you're
using the MRI for this?

434
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,227
Let's say yes.

435
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,861
So do you think Jack finally
hooks up with Sarah in this one?

436
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,780
No. Debbie Wright
is his true love.

437
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,864
She's dead.

438
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,701
Presumed!
All we really know is...

439
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,370
There are actual patients
waiting to use this machine.

440
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,670
Congratulations.

441
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,131
It's a book.

442
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:58,640
Wilson just told me we're going on a
double date with him and Sam tonight.

443
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,885
You don't like double dates?

444
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,519
I'd just like if
you'd ask me first.

445
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,979
You don't like surprises?

446
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,022
Is this Alice's book?

447
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,445
Sam reprogrammed the MRI
to read Alice's typewriter ribbon.

448
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,864
You used a $3 million
piece of hospital equipment

449
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,198
so you could read a novel?

450
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,450
Cool, right?

451
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,204
Well, as your girlfriend,
I'm impressed. As your boss,

452
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,582
you're a jackass.
Don't do it again.

453
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,000
As your boyfriend, I thank you.

454
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,836
As your employee, I resent you
because I need this for my case.

455
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,548
As your boss, you just got
six more clinic hours next week.

456
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,092
So, what's the plan for tonight?

457
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,218
Whatever you want.

458
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,182
I don't care. Just pick
something we both enjoy.

459
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,847
Yeah? What would
that be exactly?

460
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,116
I don't know,
you know what I like.

461
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,516
I got to get back to work.

462
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,193
Found something.
It's not a tumor.

463
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,238
Whatever it is, it's
encased around her heart.

464
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,456
She has a pericardial effusion.

465
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,350
Which wasn't there last night
when we did the PET scan.

466
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,169
Means she's getting worse, and
there's no sign of a pheochromocytoma.

467
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,962
Seizures, sweating,
rapid blood pressure

468
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,672
and an effusion point
to something viral.

469
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,049
Or maybe a cancer.

470
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,261
We could use your opinion,
House. Or at least your attention.

471
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,892
Jack Cannon is not dead.

472
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,478
It's worse.

473
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,773
Ten books leading up
to a final confrontation.

474
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,776
She ends it on a cliffhanger.
I mean, who does that?

475
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,653
People who want to
sell you the 11th.

476
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,821
She was gonna kill herself.

477
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,573
This is the final Jack Cannon,
and nothing gets resolved.

478
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,202
Who's his father?
Who killed his brother?

479
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,120
How'd he get that
damn scar on his cheek?

480
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,997
And why is he obsessed
with yo-yos?

481
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,625
Is there anything in it
that pertains to our case?

482
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,587
Yeah. I know why
she wanted to kill herself.

483
00:27:54,589 --> 00:28:00,095
His mentor, Helen Rutherford,
has contracted a mysterious illness

484
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,890
which consists
of joint pain, fatigue,

485
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,102
sensitivity to light
and depression.

486
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,938
How do we know this mentor
character is really Alice?

487
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,942
Helen dies halfway
through the book.

488
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,613
Shoots herself in the head to save
Jack from having to care for her.

489
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,367
If we add those to the symptoms
we've seen and the pericardial effusion?

490
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,493
It's lupus.

491
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,454
It can't be lupus.

492
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,498
Why not?

493
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:29,958
It isn't curable.

494
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,336
That's not an answer.
It's treatable.

495
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,006
We'll start testing to see which
drugs she best responds to.

496
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,717
We're not gonna be able
to take her pain away.

497
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,637
She's still gonna Kill herself as
soon as she gets released tomorrow.

498
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,892
I can't let Jack Cannon
end this way.

499
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,020
We're treating a patient,
not a book.

500
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,776
Retest to confirm.

501
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,078
Go-karts? Really?

502
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,749
Your mom said
you loved go-karts.

503
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,208
You called my mother?

504
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,587
I loved them when I was 12.

505
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:19,674
This is so cool! I haven't
done this since I was 12!

506
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,552
Winner picks the restaurant.

507
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,429
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

508
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,391
Are we ready, racers?

509
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,943
On your marks,
get set, and go away.

510
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,201
Hey. Watch it.

511
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,038
You having fun?

512
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,248
You know who wins these races?

513
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,918
The person who weighs less.

514
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,298
My parents never let me
drive one of these.

515
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,384
Yeah, I can tell!

516
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,720
Oh, my God!

517
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,357
Whoa!

518
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,111
What is her problem?

519
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,737
She hates Jews.

520
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,199
Never again.

521
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,052
Atta girl!

522
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,461
See you at the finish line!

523
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,712
Oh, yeah?

524
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,161
Yes!

525
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,084
Hey! You're banned
for life, mister!

526
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,420
Your Fun Stop privileges
are officially revoked!

527
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,175
You, too, Blondie.
All of you! Get out!

528
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,927
I avenged my lady.

529
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,263
The seat belt nearly broke
my neck. I'm done for the night.

530
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,766
It's not my fault Wilson's
attracted to psychos.

531
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,851
You picked the place.

532
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,606
That's just the pain talking.

533
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,279
Oh, wow.

534
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,792
It was a car crash,
not a skiing accident.

535
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,128
What?
The screws in your leg.

536
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,465
You got me. I'll be
going back to sleep now.

537
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,968
You damaged your thyroid
gland in the crash

538
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,053
when the shoulder strap
cut into your neck.

539
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,390
You don't have lupus.
What you have is curable.

540
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:56,975
Go away.

541
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,814
I read your book.
Sucks, by the way.

542
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,066
Nice try, but impossible.

543
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,778
Helen Rutherford kills herself

544
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,866
because she feels useless and
doesn't want to be a burden...

545
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,034
Just like you do now.

546
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,078
You have hypothyroidism.

547
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,205
It's why you feel
so tired and worn-out.

548
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,791
With medication, you'll
feel 20 years younger.

549
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,603
Or whatever age you were the last
time you didn't want to kill yourself.

550
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,796
How did you... You can
finish the story the right way.

551
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,548
The way Jack Cannon deserves.

552
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,509
You think you know
what Jack deserves?

553
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,571
I know that he deserves
better than what you gave him.

554
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:37,223
You don't know anything about
him! Why can't you just leave me...

555
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,524
What did you do to me?

556
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,528
I can't move.
I can't move anything.

557
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,953
How can I be right and wrong?

558
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,458
I deduced car accident
because thyroid fit the symptoms.

559
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,377
But a damaged thyroid
wouldn't explain the paralysis.

560
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,464
How can I be wrong about the
thyroid, but right about the accident?

561
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,257
What if you're not?

562
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,051
I like the way you think, kid.

563
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,928
At least not completely.

564
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:19,098
A posttraumatic syringomyelia
from a 15-year-old car crash.

565
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,477
Slowly growing over the years and
pressing against her spinal column.

566
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,563
Causes pain, fluctuating
blood pressure, seizures.

567
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,483
And if untreated, eventually
leads to paralysis and death.

568
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,986
We find it and remove it. She
should be able to regain full function.

569
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,756
If we can get her medical
records from back then,

570
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,490
we can use them
to pinpoint the location.

571
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,118
Do it.

572
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,789
We're dead on our feet.
I've barely slept in four days.

573
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,833
Aw, that's sad. You
know what's even sadder?

574
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,794
Thirteen was the only
man on my team.

575
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,104
Yeah, it'd be nice
if you'd hurry up

576
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,505
and hire someone
to fill her spot.

577
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,301
Do it. Cuddy
wants it to be a girl.

578
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,321
There are a couple of people...

579
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,185
I was talking to Chase, but I was
just looking at you to screw with you.

580
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,235
I am meditating.

581
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,612
From where we're standing,
it looked like sleeping.

582
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,531
We can't find
her old medical records.

583
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,907
You woke me up for that?

584
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,410
We woke you up
because it doesn't matter.

585
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,953
Alice is refusing
any more treatment.

586
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,454
She doesn't want the surgery.

587
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,290
She kicked us out.

588
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,836
Why would she lie
about the accident?

589
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,504
Everybody lies.

590
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,716
Everybody has a reason.

591
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,225
I know. Alice
is refusing surgery.

592
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,185
She'll be dead in a
few days without it.

593
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,979
Which is why I've spent
the last four hours

594
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,331
trying to find
a legal way to do it

595
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,398
without her permission.

596
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,319
Unsuccessfully.
I'm sorry.

597
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,488
As your boyfriend,
I'm grateful for the effort.

598
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,491
As your employee, I'm
disappointed at your ineffectiveness.

599
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,706
Why would she not tell us
about the pins in her leg?

600
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,666
'Cause she wants to die.

601
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,002
By having her leg ripped off?

602
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,755
She wants to punish herself

603
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,049
for something that happened
before she was famous,

604
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,259
before she even
started to write.

605
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,303
I think the answer's
in her old medical records,

606
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,306
but Dopey, Sleazy and
Uptightey can't find them.

607
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,517
Maybe "Alice Tanner"
is just her pen name.

608
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,023
Your boyfriend is an idiot.

609
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,233
I'll contact
the national records archive

610
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,194
and run the type
of screws in her leg

611
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:40,031
against blood type, age
and anything else I think of.

612
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,616
Her first name could be Helen.

613
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,743
Even better.

614
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,539
Don't bother to get up.

615
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,753
Now the way you write Jack
always made him feel real to me.

616
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,922
Now I know why.

617
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,967
Because I'm a good writer.

618
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,890
He's cool, but he's awkward. He's
brilliant, but he makes mistakes.

619
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,227
He's funny, but sometimes
he takes it too far.

620
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,562
Sounds like a great kid.

621
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,358
Please, just leave me alone.

622
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,361
You weren't alone
in the car crash.

623
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,073
Your son was with you, Helen.

624
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,418
The books are your way
of keeping him alive.

625
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,049
Why can't you just
let me die in peace?

626
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,552
You haven't been at peace
since it happened.

627
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,852
I killed him.

628
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,271
No, you didn't.

629
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,940
I let him drive.

630
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,862
He only had a learner's
permit. It was raining.

631
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,865
I deserve this.

632
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,950
No, you don't.

633
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,790
He could always get me
to do what he wanted.

634
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,253
He's always been my muse.

635
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,213
Yeah, all that may be true,

636
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,508
but I've been reviewing
your muse's autopsy results.

637
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,845
It wasn't the crash
that killed him.

638
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,391
Your son had a brain
aneurysm. That's why he crashed.

639
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,727
He was dead before the impact.

640
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,104
There was nothing
you could do to save him.

641
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,898
They would have told me.

642
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,818
They had no reason to dig any
deeper, it was a car accident. I did.

643
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,279
It's easy to miss.

644
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,491
But you can see
the blood build up here.

645
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,035
Your son would
have died that day

646
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,497
on a bus, in school,
sitting on his bed.

647
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,375
The only thing the
crash is killing IS you.

648
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,171
We need to repair that
syrinx in your neck.

649
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:07,261
He was my world.
Writing...

650
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,557
I could feel him with me.

651
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,314
It wasn't my fault, Mom.

652
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,652
And it wasn't mine.

653
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,676
Her son didn't have
a brain aneurysm.

654
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,429
Nope. She shouldn't have
let him drive in the rain.

655
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,016
Jack was never very coordinated.

656
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,396
As your boss, I am opposed
to you lying to a patient.

657
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,565
As your girlfriend,
I'm glad you care.

658
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,774
I don't.

659
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,194
I just wanted to
save Jack Cannon.

660
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,823
I can see why you like him.

661
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,746
I started reading one of
the books you gave me.

662
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,995
I find that
very hard to believe.

663
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,581
Why? Because I can't
like something you like?

664
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,392
We couldn't possibly
have something in common?

665
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,418
Because I lied about
giving you the books.

666
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,378
Oh.
Oh...

667
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,881
Wilson told you.
Yeah.

668
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,800
He's such a gossip.

669
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:32,430
I'm not gonna dump you because
we like different food or books or music.

670
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,058
On the other hand, I might
dump you if you don't talk to me

671
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,744
when you have a problem
with our relationship.

672
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,730
I know you believe that
now. But the fact is...

673
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:45,234
Who cares about common?
Common is boring.

674
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,697
It's common.
I like being with you.

675
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,657
You make me better.

676
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,201
Hopefully, I make you better.

677
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,331
What we have is uncommon,

678
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,420
and I've never been happier.

679
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,771
Mind giving us a
moment alone, Christina?

680
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,572
I'd like to thank you.

681
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,242
Great. You can dedicate
the next Jack Cannon to me.

682
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,370
I can't.

683
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,496
You're still in pain?

684
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,579
No.

685
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,541
You did everything
you said and more.

686
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,461
I can finally move on.

687
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,671
Thank you.

688
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,255
Move on, where?

689
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,009
I want to write
books for adults.

690
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:57,306
What about Jack? Your last
book, you didn't answer anything.

691
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,893
The way I ended
Jack's story is perfect.

692
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:05,189
Each reader can decide what
fate they want for him themselves.

693
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,735
Yeah, but that's stupid.
That doesn't make any sense.

694
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,072
How many answers
do you get in real life?

695
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,159
This is a book. Books have
beginnings, middles and ends.

696
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,662
You can't just leave it on a
cliffhanger. Who does that?

697
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,790
I'm sorry.
His story's done.

698
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,212
There's really nothing you
can say to change my mind.

699
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,425
Your son

700
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,728
was very lucky to
have you as his mother.

701
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,283
That was...
Oh, shut up.
