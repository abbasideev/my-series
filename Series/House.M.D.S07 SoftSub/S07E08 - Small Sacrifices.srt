1
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,173
Bajalo. Get him down!

2
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,256
What have you got
against chickens?

3
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,342
One got choked last
night, thanks to you.

4
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,511
33-year-old male
with haemoptysis, fever.

5
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,846
We can't even talk about it?

6
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,099
If you can't apologize, we
can't talk. And puncture wounds.

7
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,769
I'm not apologizing for
doing the right thing.

8
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,021
Lying to me was
not the right thing.

9
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,940
Puncture wounds are
from a crucifixion.

10
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,280
I lied to save
my patient's life.

11
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,699
I didn't lie to you,
I lied to my boss.

12
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,244
Either of those
arguments working yet?

13
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,209
Guess that means I don't have
to go to the wedding on Saturday.

14
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,544
The hospital's
chairman of the board?

15
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,464
I'm not gonna stand him
up and neither are you.

16
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,425
I loathe weddings and their
seven levels of hypocrisy.

17
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,469
But you do seem awfully hissy,

18
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,847
and there's an outside chance
I can get you drunk and score.

19
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,171
So as long as you don't
take it as an admission of guilt,

20
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,394
sure, count me in.

21
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,145
Bit too much honesty?

22
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,940
You're also going to the
rehearsal dinner Friday night.

23
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,526
Dressy casual.

24
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,535
House-keeping.

25
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,789
Either you're crazy or you're
atoning for something naughty.

26
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,582
And you're crazy.

27
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,543
He's a doctor.

28
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,253
I'm not atoning for anything.

29
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,255
That answers that, thanks.

30
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,801
My Marisa was diagnosed with terminal
brain cancer, stage IV glioblastoma.

31
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,554
When the doctors said
she had two months to live,

32
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,807
that's when I made my bargain.

33
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,393
With your health
insurance carrier?

34
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,353
With God.

35
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,478
Oh!

36
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,316
I told him I would nail myself to a
cross every year he kept her alive.

37
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,026
So how did that negotiation go?

38
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,904
You lowballed with ear
piercing and God countered?

39
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,242
Three weeks later, she was
cancer-free. That was four years ago.

40
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,744
Pontius Pilate,
misunderstood oncologist.

41
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,122
Yeah. My ex-wife
thinks I'm crazy, too.

42
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,916
She moved out the
first time I did this.

43
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,253
At least your daughter
has one viable role model.

44
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,338
- You don't believe in
God? - I did.

45
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,048
Then I grew my curly hairs.

46
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,694
So how do you think I was cured?

47
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,803
Maybe you were
misdiagnosed in the first place.

48
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,223
You have your answer,
Doctors. We have ours.

49
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,852
Causal determinism, we are
hardwired to need answers.

50
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,022
The caveman who heard
a rustle in the bushes

51
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,207
and checked out
to see what it was

52
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,609
lived longer than the guy who
assumed it was just a breeze.

53
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,152
The problem is,

54
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,988
when we don't find a logical
answer, we settle for a stupid one.

55
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,742
Ritual is what happens
when we run out of rational.

56
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,036
If you're done mocking him,
we need to prep for an LP.

57
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,873
Good. Another hole in him
should really make God's day.

58
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,006
Why are you late?

59
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,050
Your next dental
appointment isn't until January

60
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,469
and you just saw
your GP eight days ago.

61
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,430
Think stage IV glioblastoma
in an eight-year-old

62
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,848
can disappear in three weeks?

63
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,975
Had a flat tire.
Your patient has cancer?

64
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,228
Your tires have got less
than 5,000 miles on them.

65
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,813
No, and neither does
my patient's daughter.

66
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,566
I hit a piece of rebar
near a construction site.

67
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,195
In three weeks?
It's highly unlikely.

68
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,489
There's no construction site
between here and your home.

69
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,075
I agree, I think it was
a misdiagnosed cyst.

70
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,786
But there is one between
here and my dry cleaner.

71
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,998
It could be a misdiagnosis or it
could be spontaneous remission, but...

72
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,751
Why would I lie about this?
I don't know yet.

73
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,354
But you would've dropped off
your tie, it's got a mustard stain.

74
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,720
I was buying an engagement ring.

75
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,390
I'm gonna propose
to Sam at the wedding.

76
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,059
That is the second stupidest
thing I've heard today.

77
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,228
And I'm surprised
how close you came.

78
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,706
You didn't need to
buy her a new ring.

79
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,691
Isn't the first one good
for all-you-can-marry?

80
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,986
I assume you haven't
apologized to Cuddy yet.

81
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,487
Your stupidity
demands equal time.

82
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,197
Nothing to apologize for.

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,409
Pretend to apologize.

84
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,493
You want me to lie?

85
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,857
There's a lovely symmetry to it.

86
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,791
A lie got you into it,
a lie gets you out of it.

87
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,583
Everybody lies.
I'm sure Cuddy...

88
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,546
Just need to give her a chance.

89
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,467
Yeah, that must've
been what I meant.

90
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,845
Have you seen the bride-to-be?

91
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,681
Gorgeous woman half
his age. He's a lucky guy.

92
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,349
Yeah.
For a while.

93
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,602
My father's 19 years
older than my mother

94
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,485
and they've been happily
married for 32 years.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,398
I'm guessing your dad
wasn't on the Forbes 400

96
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,483
and your mom didn't
look like a swimsuit model.

97
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,570
Sorry, that didn't
come out right.

98
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:30,533
My father was the classics chair at
Columbia and my mother was his student.

99
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,037
His gorgeous student.

100
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,165
What's it mean when somebody
takes their cell phone into the bathroom

101
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,408
when they're taking a shower?

102
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,795
Means they don't want you to
check their calls, e-mails or texts.

103
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,464
If we're talking
about your wife,

104
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,717
it means the chickens
are coming home to roost.

105
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,095
Taub has been known to dabble.

106
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,263
Used to be.

107
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,434
Maybe it's just a habit. I do that
with my cell phone and I live alone.

108
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,229
She has a meeting
today at 1:30, at a hotel.

109
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,649
I'm gonna go with
the chicken thing.

110
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,570
Negative for toxocara,
bacteroides, ascaris, everything.

111
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,531
So what looks like an infection
but doesn't test like one?

112
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,618
Animals.

113
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,261
I'm sure your wife's
just seeing a dude.

114
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,707
Patient works for Morgan
Timber Works, card's in the file.

115
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,377
"Specializing in stables,
barns and stalls."

116
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,462
He works around animals.
Rhodococcus equi.

117
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,422
Unless this guy's
sleeping in the manger.

118
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,925
Or has a history of open wounds.

119
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,727
We think you have rhodococcus
equi, a horse infection.

120
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,772
It's pretty rare in humans but
easily treatable with antibiotics.

121
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,440
Does it make your
teeth fall out?

122
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
No.

123
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,411
Then again, maybe we were wrong.

124
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,044
Fever, coughing up blood,
coughing up teeth.

125
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:10,675
Either God sweetened the deal
with a no-flossing clause, or...

126
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,135
Radiation sickness.

127
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,762
Yeah, maybe the carpenter
builds microwave ovens.

128
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,888
Kaposi sarcoma?

129
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,390
No skin lesions.

130
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,102
Heavy metal poisoning fits,
canned tuna, sushi, lead paint.

131
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,230
Heavy metal it is. Do a home
search and a peripheral smear.

132
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,941
I can't. I have a
personal errand to run.

133
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,610
Trying to catch
your wife cheating?

134
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,031
Why would you say that?

135
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,243
Missing mojo, posture
slumped, expression defeated,

136
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,329
you didn't try to back up your
theory. And Chase told me.

137
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,541
Go, find your mojo.

138
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,010
Shopkeeper,
I need a patient file.

139
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,469
Ask records.

140
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,679
Not one of our patients',

141
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,765
my patient's daughter.
Ask your patient.

142
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,892
He thinks I only want
it to debunk his faith.

143
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,643
And why would he think that?

144
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,730
Because he's strangely
perceptive for an idiot.

145
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,568
And I'm going to violate patient
privacy laws just to keep you happy?

146
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,739
You keep me happy, I return
the favor. Think of it as tat for tit.

147
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,659
When we're at work, we need
to focus on our work thoughts.

148
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,163
Why are you wearing that?

149
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,165
It's my dressy casual.
What do you think?

150
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,083
You look like Wilson.

151
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,960
It looks weird.

152
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,129
But you knew I'd think that,

153
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,173
which makes me wonder
why you look disappointed.

154
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,342
If you prick me, do I not bleed?

155
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,681
You knew I wouldn't like it but
you thought I would say I did.

156
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,018
That's what this is about. You're
trying to trap me into lying to you.

157
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,437
You sure?
That sounds so juvenile.

158
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,363
You're okay with burglary now?

159
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,697
I asked his permission.

160
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,243
The reason we
don't ask permission

161
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,745
is we're afraid the patient
is going to hide something.

162
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,580
But our patient
hasn't been home,

163
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,374
lives alone,
doesn't have any help,

164
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,376
and has no motive
to hide anything.

165
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,670
You ask for his key, too?

166
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,296
Oh! Doesn't have one.

167
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,264
And now we know why.

168
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,267
You think he's crazy?

169
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,687
Crucifixion's pretty convincing
evidence. Lead paint?

170
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,439
Place is too new.

171
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,150
He believes in a higher
power that can affect his life,

172
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,527
like most people on the planet.

173
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,655
True. On the other hand,
crucified himself.

174
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,617
No canned tuna and I don't
think we have to worry about sushi.

175
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,663
No computer, no television,
no music. What does he do?

176
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,166
He reads. Prayer has
been proven to aid recovery.

177
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,377
Only if the person knows
they're being prayed for.

178
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,547
Means there's no
objective effect.

179
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,843
So faith comes from within.
Not exactly a newsflash.

180
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,479
I guess worry is
good for the waistline.

181
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,405
It's not worry, it's starvation.

182
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,134
His tooth didn't fall out because
of heavy metal poisoning,

183
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,659
it fell out because
of malnutrition.

184
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,244
He does have rhodococcus equi.

185
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,121
Taub was right.

186
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,666
He just didn't know why.

187
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,257
- It's locked!
- I'm busy.

188
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,426
I'll wait.

189
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,474
I really am busy.

190
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,601
Cuddy got me
the daughter's file.

191
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,770
Well, not Cuddy, exactly.
Her signature.

192
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,190
Well, not exactly her signature.

193
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,318
Another lie?

194
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,081
Thought you could
take a look at it for me.

195
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,113
Maybe you hadn't heard,
I'm kind of busy.

196
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,406
With what?

197
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,075
Sudoku.
What do you think?

198
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,662
I'm the head of oncology
in a major hospital.

199
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,958
And yet these files are
not from this hospital.

200
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,462
These are from
Where-My-Fiancée-Works Memorial.

201
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,507
Sam's boss is doing a
clinical review of all of her files,

202
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,883
and she just wanted to make sure

203
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,928
everything's in order
before he starts on Monday.

204
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,721
Which explains why Sam
is too busy to look at my file.

205
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,141
If I don't help her, she can't
go to the wedding, and...

206
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,285
We fell in love at
her cousin's wedding,

207
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,688
which is why I want to
propose to her at a wedding.

208
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,982
And now, you have 60
seconds to berate me for that

209
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,734
and for helping my
girlfriend with her homework.

210
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,212
You don't want to
propose at a wedding.

211
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,655
Emotions running high,
people on edge.

212
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,076
You want to try somewhere like
a Buddhist temple or an aquarium,

213
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,662
or a Buddhist aquarium.

214
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,123
That only took 10 seconds.

215
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,709
You can spend the rest
of the time on my file.

216
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,424
Rachel?

217
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,856
Hey. How long
before you're home?

218
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,399
Not long.

219
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,570
Hey. Hey.

220
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,654
Uh...

221
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,741
Yeah, you left your laptop on.

222
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,704
I saw you today, at the hotel.

223
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,165
Were you checking up on me?

224
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,375
Yes.

225
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,793
Satisfied?

226
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,254
Yes.

227
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,964
Good.

228
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,468
That's it?

229
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,470
You said you're
satisfied, that's enough.

230
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,640
You're not wondering
why it started,

231
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,119
that makes me think you
don't want to talk about this,

232
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,394
which makes me think...

233
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,979
You're being paranoid.

234
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,231
You took your cell phone
with you into the bathroom

235
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,715
when you took
a shower this morning.

236
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,322
I made a new friend, online.

237
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,158
In a support group.

238
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,036
A guy?

239
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,162
Yes.

240
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,165
Support group for what?

241
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,502
For people with
unfaithful spouses.

242
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,384
Why didn't you tell us
you were starving yourself?

243
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,929
Well, I wasn't trying to.

244
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,015
I'm on a tight budget and
it seemed like an okay diet.

245
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,227
You seem to be feeling better.

246
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,979
Not really,
my legs are killing me.

247
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,569
How bad is the pain?

248
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,863
On a scale of one to 10,
10 being the worst.

249
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,950
Nine and a half.

250
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,286
Then why are you smiling?

251
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,038
I'm not smiling.

252
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,673
Leg pain
and pseudo bulbar affect.

253
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,301
He's feeling one emotion while
unknowingly expressing another one.

254
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,053
Classic neurohecatia.

255
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,557
Two days of anticholinergics
and you'll be walking out of here.

256
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,016
Really?

257
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:20,396
No. I just made that up to see
your reaction. Diagnostic test.

258
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,773
This is awesome.

259
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,069
33-year-old carpenter
presenting narcissism,

260
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,071
delusions of grandeur
and hallucinations.

261
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,447
He hasn't had hallucinations.

262
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,952
I'm not talking about him, I'm talking
about him, with a capital O-M-G.

263
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,746
You want us to do a
differential diagnosis on Jesus?

264
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,418
Hears voices, thinks he's the
son of God, probably schizophrenic.

265
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,420
I think you offended him.

266
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,673
You're saying the patient's religious
extremism could be a symptom?

267
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,092
A neuro disorder could
explain all his delusions.

268
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,596
Get an MRI of his brain.
Let's see if we can find God.

269
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,062
Heard you got the daughter's
file. Patient change his mind?

270
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,148
I forged your signature.

271
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,736
Thank you for your honesty.

272
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,237
Think of it as a present.

273
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,491
See, somebody is about to
turn the big 4-5 in several months,

274
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,828
and somebody else wants
to make a very big deal of it.

275
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,288
4-3.

276
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,665
4-3. Are you sure?

277
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,750
Very.

278
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,421
How could I make such a
mistake? In reading your HR file.

279
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,923
Oh, no, wait, I didn't.

280
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,761
And boom goes the dynamite!
Scores are tied. We are even-Steven.

281
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:38,474
You're right, I did lie.
To HR, not to you.

282
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,646
When I first applied for the VP
admin job, I was 29 years old.

283
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,899
I knew I'd be taken more
seriously if I were in my early 30s,

284
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,567
so I added two years to my age.

285
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,819
You lied to make yourself older?

286
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,173
Are you lying
about being a woman?

287
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,199
Even if you can trap me,

288
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,868
do you think I'll suddenly
embrace the value of lying?

289
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,788
My point is you already have.
I just need to prove it.

290
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,255
Chickens aren't roosting.
She's just got a friend.

291
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,841
A guy she met in an online
support group for cheating spouses.

292
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,053
I've heard of that group.
It's called Irony.

293
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,722
You think she's
cheating on her spouse

294
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,850
with someone from a
cheating spouse support group?

295
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,603
Sounds like the perfect place
to hit on vulnerable women.

296
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,898
Look. Multiple
dense lesions.

297
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,859
It looks like MS.

298
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,654
How did we miss MS?

299
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,740
It was hiding behind
the malnutrition.

300
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,660
MS. attacks the immune
system. No system, no symptoms.

301
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,913
And now we're feeding him
so they're both back.

302
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,334
How are you feeling?

303
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,671
Terrible.

304
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,589
Obviously.

305
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,885
Where are your friends? Still
casting lots for your clothes?

306
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,887
All I ask is that
they pray for me.

307
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,890
Always sacrificing,
very inspirational.

308
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,935
The lesions are in
your temporal lobes.

309
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,478
When those areas
get messed with,

310
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,355
people have strange experiences.

311
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,774
Like hauntings, alien
abductions, past lives...

312
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,568
Deals with God?

313
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,903
You didn't come to
see if I was better,

314
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,073
you came to see if your medicine
has turned me into an atheist.

315
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,783
I'd settle for agnostic.

316
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,160
Faith is not a disease.

317
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,244
No, of course not.

318
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,248
On the other hand, it is
communicable and it kills a lot of people.

319
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,092
I can't move my arm.

320
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,265
You feel that?

321
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,730
Your friends are not
praying hard enough.

322
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,693
It's not MS.

323
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,528
Paralysis is a symptom of MS,

324
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,864
so are leg pain and
pseudo bulbar affect.

325
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,759
He's getting worse on
the prednisone. It's not MS.

326
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,202
The MRI was clear,
he has lesions.

327
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,954
It could be an AVM,
cerebral infarction.

328
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,374
Let's put it to the vote.

329
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,750
Vest or cummerbund?

330
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,503
Cummerbund.

331
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,421
You know me,

332
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,591
I can't say no to any of
you guys. You're all correct.

333
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:21,095
He has MS. But not the
friendly Mr. Rogers MS.

334
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,347
This is the
weird-guy-in-the-panel-van kind.

335
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,391
Marburg MS?

336
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,558
What did I just say?

337
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,727
He'll be dead in two to
three days, at the most.

338
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,205
That's unless we can
get someone to nail

339
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,022
themselves to a cross
as soon as possible.

340
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,982
Or stem cell treatment.

341
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,484
That's an experimental
treatment.

342
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,985
That's had promising
results with

343
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,071
demyelinating diseases.
It's our best shot.

344
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,740
It would be if it wasn't
embryonic stem cell treatment.

345
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,051
Our patient's right of the pope,

346
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,535
he's never gonna
consent to that.

347
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,871
I know that, you know that,
but he doesn't know that.

348
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,207
But now she knows that,
he's gonna know that.

349
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,959
Way to go.

350
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,672
Confirm Marburg. Then see if
he's a fair-weather flagellator.

351
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,225
You looking smashing,
Miss Moneypenny.

352
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,186
Cummerbund?
Very foolish, Mr. Bond.

353
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,647
The daughter's case checks out.

354
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,901
Stereotactic biopsy confirmed
stage IV glioblastoma multiforme.

355
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,903
It doesn't respond to chemo

356
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,240
but they gave it to her anyway
as a Hail Mary and just got lucky.

357
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,619
So either God intervened,
which is a lazy explanation,

358
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,956
or we just don't know why,
which is no explanation.

359
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,085
Sometimes there is no explanation.
And I'm just fine with that.

360
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,503
Which annoys me to no end.

361
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,340
I need that file,
that chair and that desk.

362
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,556
Your woman is fudging the facts.

363
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,851
Five of those cases,
the stated doses

364
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,644
don't explain
the radiation damage.

365
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,146
Sensitivities vary.

366
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,355
Not that much.

367
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,195
Yeah. That's
what I thought.

368
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,118
I asked her
point-blank about this.

369
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,496
She said the dosages
were accurate,

370
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,979
and that she had
done nothing wrong.

371
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,083
Because morally she didn't.

372
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,169
All five patients were terminal,

373
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,671
she exceeded the dosing
protocols to try to save their life.

374
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,173
You'd have done the same.

375
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,966
She's a sap and
she's perfect for you.

376
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,100
I hate rehearsal dinners almost
as much as I hate weddings.

377
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,020
The only reason
anyone gets married

378
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,772
is because Homo erectus females

379
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,442
needed protection from
predators while breastfeeding.

380
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,029
And the only reason these
two are getting married

381
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,406
is to throw an obnoxious gala to
make the rest of us feel unworthy.

382
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,575
Even though we know in two years

383
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,699
the lawyers are gonna be
fighting over the Bentleys.

384
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,164
That'd make a lovely toast.

385
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,208
She's got looks, he's got money.

386
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,418
One of them is bound to run out.

387
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,838
I give it 19 months.

388
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,466
That's very specific.

389
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,302
No fault divorce in
New Jersey requires

390
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,806
couples to live at
least 18 months apart.

391
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,642
I'm actually only
giving it a few weeks.

392
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,995
I thought I was supposed
to be the dark one.

393
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,229
Not today.

394
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,689
Yeah.

395
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,237
You're gonna have to go stag.
My patient is refusing treatment.

396
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,572
And you care?

397
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,908
No, but it's an excuse
you can't argue with.

398
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,748
Accepting this treatment
is an insult to God.

399
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,209
I can't expect him
to keep our deal.

400
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,752
You already broke it.

401
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,547
Your blood test shows you
were loaded with ibuprofen.

402
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,382
Taking painkillers
breaks my deal?

403
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,510
The point is to suffer
like your savior did, right?

404
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,847
Well, he didn't take myrrh,
the Tylenol of ancient Rome.

405
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,600
And his nails went through
his wrists, not through his palms.

406
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,851
Palms are for sissies.

407
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,769
And what about the 39 lashes,

408
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,938
and the beatings and
the crown of thorns?

409
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,567
What you go through is closer to
a bad manicure than a crucifixion.

410
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,277
It's not about
showing God my pain,

411
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,529
it's about showing him my faith.

412
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,907
If he asks me to die for
my daughter, I'll do it gladly.

413
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,493
Don't make this
about your daughter.

414
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:17,039
You're just worried that we'll find
a cure that will cost you your faith,

415
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,391
and you'll be
like the rest of us.

416
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:23,003
Alone and afraid? You're
right. I don't want that.

417
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,087
You're smiling.

418
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,381
Does that mean that you're
comfortable with your choice

419
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,300
or that you're afraid?

420
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,843
Because this may
be your only hope.

421
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,512
You can prescribe a lot of
things but hope isn't one of them.

422
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,391
Sticking by your convictions
and damning the consequences.

423
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,268
You two have a lot in common.

424
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,647
You're both idiots.

425
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,822
All convictions
equally ridiculous?

426
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,993
Just when they're applied
indiscriminately to all circumstances.

427
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,237
He needs to see his daughter.

428
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,871
He needs to see
Inherit the Wind.

429
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:02,417
And tell her he's dying because God
doesn't want him to take his medicine.

430
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,798
Honesty's not all bad.

431
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,342
Get her in here.

432
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,771
You don't have to die. Not
if you take the medicine.

433
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,027
The treatment
violates God's laws.

434
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,737
He doesn't want me to take it.

435
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,490
But God doesn't want you to die.

436
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,618
He doesn't want anyone
to die. He's all about love.

437
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,262
I know this is
coming from your mother.

438
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,122
This is coming from me.

439
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,667
I'm the one who
almost died, I know what it's like.

440
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,128
You're my daddy, you can't die.

441
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,132
I wish I didn't have to.

442
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,009
You don't have to, Daddy.
Just take the medicine.

443
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,762
You always tell me to
take the medicine. Please.

444
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,854
One day, you're
going to understand.

445
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,938
No, I'm not.

446
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,941
I'm never going
to understand that.

447
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:13,113
If God could do this,
I hate God.

448
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,037
I just spotted a couple of hot
girls by the chocolate fountain.

449
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,520
Weren't you just
upstairs with...

450
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,689
It wouldn't have happened
if not for you, buddy.

451
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,444
Someone had to distract
the sober friend.

452
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,904
I'm not here to be your wingman.

453
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,530
I'll be your wingman this time.

454
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,741
I didn't come here
to get laid either.

455
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,825
Then don't.

456
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,952
Talking to beautiful women
isn't nearly as much fun

457
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,330
as watching Taub not
talking to his wife.

458
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,379
I went through your e-mails.

459
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,216
There's nothing in
there that's inappropriate.

460
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,759
We're friends, Chris.

461
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,428
But you tell him things
that you've never told me.

462
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,181
I tell him things I can't
tell you, that's the point.

463
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,058
Not things about me, about you.

464
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,311
About your new job,
about coloring your hair,

465
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,563
about how you felt
when your mother died.

466
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,899
I want to know those things.

467
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,985
He's easy to talk to.

468
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,950
He's open and honest.
He makes me feel safe.

469
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,743
Sounds like you love him.

470
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,204
I'm not having an affair.

471
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,749
He lives in Oregon. I've never
met him. I probably never will.

472
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,252
You are having an affair,
an emotional one.

473
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,547
Are you equating what
I'm doing with what you did?

474
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,298
I've done terrible
things to you.

475
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,676
And I deserve all
of this and more.

476
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,762
But you can't pretend that
what you're doing isn't hurtful.

477
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,230
Someone looks lovely tonight.

478
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,773
Thank you.

479
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,608
I meant me.

480
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,946
But someone else
looks simply stunning.

481
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,365
That was you.

482
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,868
And the blonde at the bar.

483
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,621
Just to be clear, this whole
little act isn't gonna work.

484
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,791
I need an apology, not flattery.

485
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,211
It's not an act.
It's the wedding.

486
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,296
You hate weddings.

487
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,382
I thought I did. Then I
realized I've never been to one.

488
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,675
Never?

489
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,802
Turns out they're kind of fun.

490
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,390
Well, I can't complain about
my boss. He's right here.

491
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,851
You're his boss?

492
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,036
Only Mondays through Fridays.

493
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,813
On the weekends, he's my bro.

494
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,486
This round's on the bro?

495
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:08,997
Um...

496
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,876
I'm sorry about your daughter.

497
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,170
I never meant to hurt her.

498
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,381
You just thought
she'd change my mind.

499
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,886
I was surprised she didn't.

500
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,514
So was I.

501
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,102
I didn't tell you the truth.

502
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,022
When I said I'm
not afraid to die.

503
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,359
But you're going
straight to heaven, so...

504
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,237
That's what I believe.
But I'm human.

505
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,531
So you know you may be wrong.

506
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,535
How could you do
what you just did?

507
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:55,001
That's why we have beliefs, so
we can still see the right thing to do

508
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,045
when we're blinded
with doubt and fear.

509
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:03,134
Our beliefs define us. If
we lose them, who are we?

510
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,563
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean for it to go that way.

511
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,655
You think I'm being
selfish but I'm not.

512
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,161
He makes me feel better
about me and about us.

513
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,581
Well, that is hard to believe

514
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,420
because all I feel
right now is betrayed.

515
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,255
I never wanted that.

516
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,339
Good.

517
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,844
Because just like you asked
me to stop my behavior,

518
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,304
I'm asking you to stop this.

519
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,685
No?

520
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,437
I'm not gonna lie to you.

521
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,272
Is this revenge?

522
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,191
I don't know.

523
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,986
But I do know that it's
something I need right now.

524
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,957
What would you wear?

525
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,045
I'm a sucker for the white gown.

526
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,884
Traditionally for young,
first-time brides.

527
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,637
Well, I may not be
young but I'd be first-time.

528
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,309
That is a lie.

529
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,318
You were married before.
In 1987, for six days.

530
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,847
Your knowledge of New Jersey
divorce law made me suspicious,

531
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,990
so I looked it up.

532
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,036
So this was all your trap?

533
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,248
Trap's primitive,
I prefer inveiglement.

534
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,836
Anyway, the point is, I lied to
you, you lied to me, I forgive you.

535
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,386
Well played.

536
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,686
You're tired, aren't
you? All those files.

537
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,524
No, no, I was thinking...

538
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,487
I mean, if those two even have
the slightest chance of making it,

539
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,532
then we have to be a sure thing.

540
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,701
And we've already
made all our mistakes.

541
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,537
And...

542
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,296
I've come to realize
that I love you

543
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,257
even more than I thought I did.

544
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,718
Sam, will you marry me again?

545
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,393
Wow. I don't even
know what to say.

546
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,145
I have a suggestion.

547
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,231
Where did this even
come from? When did you...

548
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,361
You just came to realize?

549
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,656
What made you love me even more?

550
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:19,455
Everything you've done, your
work, your sense of morality.

551
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,085
The five cases.

552
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,089
I not only agree with
what you did, I admire it.

553
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,049
I didn't do anything.
You already asked me

554
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,594
about the files and
I told you the truth.

555
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,013
I know, and I get it.

556
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,640
You don't believe me.

557
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:42,020
I believe that you
are a wonderful person.

558
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,354
Who lies and cheats.

559
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,439
No, Sam.

560
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,150
Listen, I'm on your side.

561
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,028
I can't believe this.

562
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,158
What? Sam. Sam,
don't do this.

563
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,810
So how many do you think?

564
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,355
At least three.

565
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,982
Hat-trick Chase.

566
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,862
See? Life of the bachelor.
All of the sex, none of the guilt.

567
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:37,325
It's not over, okay? I
just really miscalculated.

568
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,411
I thought she'd forgiven
me for everything

569
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,999
but all those hurt feelings,
they never really went away.

570
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,921
That makes a lot more sense.

571
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,550
Ignore him, he just got an idea.

572
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,513
I have one more test to run.

573
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,435
Uh, I hate weddings.

574
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,538
Won't be long now.

575
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,043
You'll be staring down the
yawning void before you know it.

576
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,587
You came from a
wedding to tell me that?

577
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:36,718
No, I came from a
wedding to run a PET scan.

578
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,553
Thought you'd given up on me.

579
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,889
I have. PET scan
was for your daughter.

580
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,309
I was wrong about her.

581
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,729
She did have glioblastoma.

582
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,443
And she still does.
Cancer never went away.

583
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,989
Yes, it did. They
tested her every year.

584
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,824
With a CT scan

585
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,329
which misses all the tiny little
tumors that a PET scan doesn't.

586
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,416
You made a mistake. She
does not have cancer anymore.

587
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,502
I ran it twice, no mistake.

588
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,091
Looks like God broke your deal.

589
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,263
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,516
But I'm also right.

591
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,522
You're a bastard.

592
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,655
Do whatever you want to me.

593
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,825
Good call.

594
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,251
Surprised you've got enough
strength to come to work today.

595
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,129
Thirty-six hours is long
enough for me to recover.

596
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,840
And not nearly long enough
for this guy to be getting better.

597
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,718
House wanted us checking
every 12 hours anyway.

598
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,678
Sorry I took off on you.

599
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,472
Twice.

600
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,558
First one was my bad.
Second one I had no choice.

601
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,061
It was a threesome.

602
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,814
They're overrated.

603
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,733
He's bluffing.
He's bluffing.

604
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,986
Get House.

605
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,741
Got something to show you.
Your daughter's PET scan.

606
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,577
It's clean.

607
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,871
She's fine.

608
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,666
My bad.

609
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,377
Got her mixed up
with Marion Silver.

610
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,589
Marisa Silva.
That's believable, right?

611
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,927
Anyhow, good news for
you, bad news for Mr. Silver.

612
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,848
You tricked me. God
didn't break our deal, I did.

613
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,060
You led me into
temptation and I followed.

614
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,937
And God will
punish you for that.

615
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,939
He has to.
'Cause if he didn't,

616
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,774
it'd make you wonder,
wouldn't it?

617
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,025
He will.

618
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,612
Well, that's why I'm
so confused by this.

619
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,284
This is your MRI. Shows
incremental improvement.

620
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,535
You're getting better.

621
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,683
I double-checked
the name on this one.

622
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:16,210
But it's not all good news.
This patient is screwed.

623
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,589
Technical term is
dead as a doornail.

624
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,132
Who is that?

625
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,467
God.

626
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,844
You broke your deal with him

627
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,864
but your daughter's fine
and you're getting better.

628
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,391
Nothing bad happened.
Which can only mean one thing,

629
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,809
there is no God.

630
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,855
'Course, if your daughter
gets hit by a meteorite today,

631
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,107
I would have some
serious egg on my face.

632
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,738
You're smiling. I assume
that means you're miserable.

633
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,324
It means I'm happy.

634
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,703
This doesn't mean
God doesn't exist,

635
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,331
it just means
he's truly merciful.

636
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,918
My beautiful Marisa was right,

637
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,128
God is all about love.

638
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,924
Punishment is proof of God and
no punishment is proof of God.

639
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,676
Ingenious argument.

640
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,263
Faith isn't an argument.

641
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,519
I'd like to see my daughter.

642
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,863
Everyone else knew?

643
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,492
Everyone I could trust.
So, yes.

644
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,788
If you had told me,
he'd be dead by now.

645
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,041
So why do I still
want to tell the truth?

646
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,504
Either you're naive, or you have
scruples. I'm not sure which is worse.

647
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,299
This is insane.
We can't work like this.

648
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,718
I can.

649
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:54,976
Sam?

650
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,688
Sorry, I was hoping to be
done before you got home.

651
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,649
We had a fight.
We had one fight.

652
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,777
And I admitted I was wrong.

653
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,460
We can talk about it,
we can get over it.

654
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,530
This is about trust.

655
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,949
I never lied to
you about anything.

656
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,660
I know,
and I always trusted you.

657
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,245
I...

658
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,914
Maybe we could
talk to a counselor.

659
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,708
You said that helped
after our divorce.

660
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,502
It did, and I think
I changed a lot.

661
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:25,006
And I haven't.
This is my fault?

662
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,759
I know where this is going.

663
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,386
And I don't want
to go there again.

664
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,435
You're quitting, Sam.
You're quitting again.

665
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,688
So I guess you haven't
changed that much.

666
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,052
Good work today.

667
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,971
Don't even think your
patient's gonna sue.

668
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,266
Looks like everybody's happy.

669
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,481
I've been an idiot.

670
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,860
I got this argument
stuck in my head.

671
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:32,239
If everybody lies, then trust is
not only unfounded and pointless,

672
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,241
it's fictional.

673
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,579
But trust is not an argument
that can be won or lost.

674
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:44,168
Maybe I just have to suspend
my cynicism and believe.

675
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,297
Maybe it's time
I took a leap of faith.

676
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,969
I'm sorry.

677
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,931
I won't lie to you again.

678
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,810
Thank you.

679
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,952
Sam left me.

680
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,954
What a moron.

681
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,791
Too soon. I'm still
in love with her.

682
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,293
I meant you.

683
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,297
Do you have a drink?
Or drinks?

684
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,174
Cuddy's coming over.

685
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,056
Does she know you're here?

686
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,393
I apologized to her.

687
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,317
