1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,095
One small step for man.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,140
One giant waste
of your monthly allowance.

3
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,686
Safety's disengaged.

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,775
We are go for launch in
five, four, three, two, one.

5
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,449
That was freaking awesome!

6
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,248
Whoa.

7
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,459
Aw, jeez, come on.

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,684
My father's gonna kill me.

9
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,145
Can I film that, too?

10
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,869
Whoa.

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,788
What?

12
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,710
Oh, man.
Is that guy dead?

13
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,046
I think so.

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,643
Get the rest of the flames out!

15
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,315
You gonna be okay, mister?

16
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,029
It smells like...

17
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,699
Like liquorice?

18
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,068
Think House is coming in today?

19
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,446
Maybe if we start
offering spa treatments.

20
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,906
He already jumped
off of a hotel balcony.

21
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,908
Who knows what he'll do next?

22
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,746
Ride some kind of
prostitute chariot to work?

23
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,007
First person to offer me an
interesting case gets to ride her,

24
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,134
single or double team.

25
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,097
My scooter.

26
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,267
Which now said out loud
sounds even more inappropriate.

27
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,603
Seriously? You're
bringing them to work now?

28
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,396
23-year-old homeless man brought

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,440
into the ER with
burn injuries and...

30
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,525
Let me guess.
The diagnosis was fire?

31
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,028
He said his burning flesh
smelt like liquorice

32
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,281
and the ER antiseptics
like blueberry muffins.

33
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,451
Cool.

34
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,412
Dysosmia could be anything
from an environmental factor

35
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,457
to an early sign of a
degenerative brain disease.

36
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,959
Smells like a winner.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,589
Okay, you and Chase go check
out the park where they found him.

38
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,386
You two, load him up with
prednisone, give him an odor ID test.

39
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,430
If he's still mistaking
his body odors for candy,

40
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,682
problem's definitely
in his brain.

41
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,395
Also find out what else
he's lying about,

42
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,606
since I'm assuming Ferris
Bueller is not his real name.

43
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,816
Why?

44
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,696
Seriously, who is that?

45
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,991
They say he's a righteous dude.

46
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,578
And before I forget, I
want you to meet Dominika.

47
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,374
She's about to become a
permanent member of Team House.

48
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,918
Nice to be meetings you all.

49
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,253
Doing what exactly?

50
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,379
Me.

51
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,744
We're getting married on Friday.

52
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,052
Mount up.

53
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,446
I don't think that
two people are supposed...

54
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,972
Living on the edge, baby doll.

55
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,228
How's the arm?
Hmm?

56
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,021
It hurts.

57
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,275
Do I have to check out now?

58
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,361
Not until we figure out why
your sense of smell is off.

59
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,239
When was the first
time you noticed it?

60
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,907
Maybe a couple months ago.

61
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,785
We also need you
to tell us your real name

62
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,538
SO we can review
your medical records.

63
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,208
I didn't ask to come here.

64
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,043
Okay, I'm not paying
for any of this.

65
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,422
Don't worry, I don't think the collection
agency has an office in the park.

66
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,217
I don't have a medical history.

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,552
I've always been healthy.

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,555
What about those scars
and burn marks?

69
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,062
Lean forward.

70
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,031
My Dad.

71
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,659
We didn't exactly get
along when I was a kid.

72
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,245
How many times
were you hospitalized?

73
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,416
Never.

74
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,919
He was good at it.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,242
Made sure he never did anything

76
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,255
that couldn't be covered
up by a sweatshirt.

77
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,678
No, don't be.

79
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,347
I'm not.

80
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,933
The past is the past, that's
why I don't like talking about it.

81
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,450
You can't ride
that thing in here.

82
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,453
Speaking of things,
I'm having one on Friday.

83
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,378
If you want to drop by,
we'd love to have you.

84
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,457
No pressure.

85
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,792
You're still standing on it.

86
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,795
So I am. Perhaps
you're not familiar

87
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,589
with the New Jersey
handicap ordinances.

88
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,926
Or perhaps I am.

89
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:30,139
They apply to wheelchairs and
powered scooters only. Not toys.

90
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,892
Have you any idea
how much this toy costs?

91
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,227
I don't care.

92
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,121
For some reason, my leg's
been hurting a lot this week.

93
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,815
For some reason,
I still don't care.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,527
Fine. I'll return it.

95
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,112
Do I have to
walk it out of here?

96
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,782
Stop.

97
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,160
I'll make an exception,
for your leg.

98
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,123
But next time,
check with me first.

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,511
Congratulations
on your engagement.

100
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,179
I hear a strange voice.

101
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,850
A very soft-looking man.

102
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,351
Must be the Wilson.

103
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,769
I know we said no secrets,

104
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,980
but I think I need to take
this alone, honey bunny.

105
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,857
Okay.

106
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,653
Nice to be meeting you.

107
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,873
You're trying to
screw with Cuddy.

108
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,375
Yeah, it's the classic
"you dumped me

109
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,502
"so I'm gonna get
married a week later" ruse.

110
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,047
'Cause not only
is she that stupid,

111
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,882
but apparently I'm that stupid.

112
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,217
Then what? You're
openly mocking marriage?

113
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,623
Trying to prove
it means nothing?

114
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,887
It doesn't,

115
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,723
but you proved that
yourself years ago.

116
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,893
I'd love to keep guessing, but
I've got people with tumors waiting.

117
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,729
Why do you want us to think
that you're getting married?

118
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,065
Only one theory left.
I am.

119
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,234
Dominika needs a green card.

120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,988
So you're just doing some
random stranger a favor? It's illegal.

121
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,075
People go to jail for
that, pay huge fines.

122
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,910
Have you seen me
practice medicine?

123
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,056
You know how much it
costs to have a live-in maid,

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,416
personal assistant, cook,
massage therapist, whore?

125
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,087
I do.

126
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,173
She's willing to work
four days a week for free.

127
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,884
It's gonna save me
about $33,000,

128
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,097
and all I have to do is say
two stupid words, "I do."

129
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,434
And if she doesn't
see it this way?

130
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,521
Ironclad pre-nup.
We go our separate ways.

131
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,108
Your stunned look,
I take it, is your way

132
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,443
of saying,
"Brilliant idea, House."

133
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,542
Wow.

134
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,377
You look different.

135
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,854
The prednisone has
had time to work,

136
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,297
so we need to give you
the odor ID test now.

137
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,216
Sure.

138
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,094
We need you to tell us
what you smell.

139
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,304
Oh.

140
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,392
Something spoiled,
maybe rotting meat?

141
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,602
It's baby powder.

142
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,069
I kind of like that one.
Peppermint?

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,156
It's extremely bad body odor.

144
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,663
You got to admit, that one's
kind of a good deal for me.

145
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,669
My backpack. Oh.
Where'd you find it?

146
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,173
In the park, right next
to a big pile of questions.

147
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,675
What kind of
drugs you shooting up?

148
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:59,015
Vitamin supplements. I've been
trying to boost my immune system.

149
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,851
All right, test me if
you don't believe me.

150
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,978
Ferris tell you
his real name yet?

151
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,521
Peter Johnson.

152
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,982
Danny Jennings.

153
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,943
I bought those books used.

154
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,445
All from the same guy?

155
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,283
I'm sorry, but I think I
should check out now and...

156
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,911
What's wrong?

157
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,788
Oh, my stomach...

158
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,039
Gastrointestinal bleeding.

159
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,381
Is anyone else
disturbed by this?

160
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,383
What?

161
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,469
She offered.

162
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,970
Danny may have lied
about his name,

163
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,056
but he was telling the
truth about the vials.

164
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,517
Tests confirm they were
vitamin A and B-12.

165
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,811
He also enjoys vitamin H.

166
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,021
Kid's a junkie.

167
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,649
Tox screens were
negative for drug use.

168
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,902
His hair wasn't.
I had it tested.

169
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,155
Because unlike Santa
and the Easter bunny,

170
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,616
homeless, non-mentally
ill 20-somethings

171
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,077
without drug problems
don't exist.

172
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,663
He was a heavy user
sometime in the last five months.

173
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,084
Wow, that
was incredible. Thank you.

174
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,712
No, thank you. I like men
with the big, strong, sexy feet.

175
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,673
He really puts
the Mani in the pedi.

176
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,675
If he has a
history of snorting heroin,

177
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,318
he could've caused
the dysosmia himself.

178
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,679
But we still need to explain
the bleeding in his GI tract.

179
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,597
Vitamin injections
could have caused that.

180
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,015
Hypervitaminosis A syndrome.

181
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,517
So his symptoms
aren't connected?

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,435
House, you buying this?

183
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,772
Not usually.

184
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,900
But this guy has been
sleeping on a bed of dog poop.

185
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,629
I wouldn't be surprised if
he's got six different symptoms

186
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,779
for six different reasons.

187
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,282
The bleed could be caused
by a GI obstruction.

188
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,784
Vitamin OD makes
sense and it's easier to treat.

189
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,954
Give him tocopherol and zinc
supplements for the excess vitamin A.

190
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,540
If we're right, he could
go homeless tomorrow.

191
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,710
And if we're wrong, his intestines
could get further distressed

192
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,628
while we ignore
the GI obstruction.

193
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,505
See what happens
when women don't have

194
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,465
to serve men to
stay in the country?

195
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,384
They get all uppity.

196
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,303
This is why we
invented green cards.

197
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,180
Go x-ray the guy's abdomen,

198
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,391
if it'll make
you feel all equal.

199
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,112
I need a favor.

200
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,741
I want to add my fiancee's name

201
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,993
to my health insurance
a few days early.

202
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,496
She wants to get a tooth
capped before the big day.

203
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,957
I'm not signing this.
I agree.

204
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,084
I think she looks
beautiful the way she is.

205
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,674
Oh, no. Wait. You're not
signing that for moral reasons?

206
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,429
You're declaring yourself
the sole arbiter of true love?

207
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,681
'Cause you covered
Taub's wife for years.

208
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,475
It's fraud.

209
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,985
She wanted me to bribe you
like they do back in the old country.

210
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,487
Tell her what I said.

211
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,738
This is America.

212
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,157
The land of the home,
and the free of the braves.

213
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,286
I just get teary-eyed every
time I hear her say that.

214
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,621
She brought you a gift.

215
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,830
Almond kulich.

216
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,916
I make with own hands.
It's delicious.

217
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,209
Almond kulich.

218
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,419
How do you say no to that?

219
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,090
You realize if I do sign this

220
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,716
and you don't get
legally married,

221
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,885
you'll lose your
insurance with our carrier.

222
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,096
Yes.

223
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,685
Fine.

224
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,854
It's your life.

225
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,359
I wish you both
the best with it.

226
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,527
Thank you.

227
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,409
North, Miss Teschmacher!

228
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,414
Your blood test was clean,

229
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,541
but your hair showed heroin use.

230
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,378
I've been clean
over three months now.

231
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,921
How'd you kick it?

232
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,798
I had to die first.

233
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,593
I OD'd back in November.

234
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,596
And they said I was clinically
dead for several minutes.

235
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,077
It was like God
gave me a second chance

236
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,894
to do things right this time.

237
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,064
You're saying God cured you?

238
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,315
No.

239
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,276
State rehab cured me.

240
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,280
But I should be dead,
but I'm not.

241
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,783
That has to mean something.

242
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,412
I mean, I must be here
for a reason, right?

243
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,791
Did you figure out the reason?

244
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,503
My goal is to become
a doctor one day.

245
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,299
I am smart.

246
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,952
I mean, I got a scholarship
for pre-med out of high school.

247
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,513
Chase?

248
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,600
Look.

249
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,440
We found 13 masses
spread across the wall of his colon,

250
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,317
ranging from 2 to 8 millimeters.

251
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,462
They can't be tumors.
Edges are too sharp and defined.

252
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,671
I thought they might
be parasites,

253
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,114
but we didn't see any movement
between X-ray exposures.

254
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,201
And no larvae or eggs were
observed in any of the stool samples.

255
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,494
Which is kind of surprising

256
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,746
for a homeless junkie
living in a park.

257
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,999
Ex-junkie. He claims he's
been clean for over three months.

258
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,460
And he's not planning
on staying homeless.

259
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,462
He's trying to
protect his health,

260
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,881
which is why he's been
taking vitamin supplements.

261
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,132
He wants to be a doctor.

262
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,486
He's just telling you
what you want to hear.

263
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,637
Once an addict,
always an addict.

264
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,600
Can you please not do
that in front of me?

265
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,684
Doubt it.

266
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,646
You're the main reason
I'm on the stuff.

267
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,107
We could be looking
at fungal masses

268
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,733
hanging off
the walls of his colon.

269
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,610
Start him on
amphotericin B tonight,

270
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,279
and in the morning, run a scope
up where the sun don't shine

271
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,803
and see if you can
find any truffles.

272
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,746
I think we should boycott
this wedding on principle.

273
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,873
I kind of have to go.

274
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,251
His fiancée did give me
a foot massage,

275
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,254
and he invited me to be
in his wedding party.

276
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,089
What about Chase?
He ask him?

277
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,340
Yeah, he's in it.

278
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,633
What the hell?

279
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,885
You just said you
weren't even going.

280
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,388
I still have feelings.

281
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,931
What's that?

282
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,643
That's definitely not a fungus.

283
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,882
You were
bleeding because you had

284
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,148
13 pieces of bone in
your digestive tract.

285
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,650
We think you have pica,

286
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,360
a craving for non-food items.

287
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,320
That's caused by
a chemical imbalance...

288
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,405
I didn't crave them.

289
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,909
I kind of volunteered
to eat them.

290
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,953
What, why?

291
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,497
There's this great Italian
restaurant I like to frequent.

292
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,460
And by restaurant I mean
their dumpster out back.

293
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,337
The cook is kind of
a friend of mine.

294
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,548
He challenges me to eat stuff.

295
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,051
Sometimes it's raw squid, or I
have to chew on a chicken bone.

296
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,387
But if I do it, then he
hooks me up with real food,

297
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,680
not just the garbage.

298
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,931
Great friend.

299
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,785
These fragments could have
perforated your colon and killed you.

300
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,436
You have to
promise us you'll stop.

301
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,148
I think there's something
wrong with my eyes.

302
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,649
What is it?

303
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,944
It's like I'm looking at you
from the bottom of a well.

304
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,333
If we add tunnel
vision to the dysosmia,

305
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,711
we can subtract the
bone-induced abdominal bleeding.

306
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,256
I thought the
dysosmia was from heroin.

307
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,550
He said he never snorted,
he just shot up,

308
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,570
so that wouldn't have
affected his sense of smell.

309
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,138
And we believe
the lying liar why?

310
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,474
House.

311
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,809
Are you even listening to us?

312
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,853
I'll start when you decide
what the symptoms are

313
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,480
and give me some theories.

314
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,317
If we combine the dysosmia
with the tunnel vision,

315
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,154
the symptoms fit for
western equine encephalitis.

316
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,074
But the patient doesn't.
No fever.

317
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,452
What the hell?

318
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,870
Negative reinforcement.

319
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,372
What about
Foster-Kennedy syndrome?

320
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,166
He could have a
meningioma, or plasmacytoma,

321
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,294
started by pressing on his olfactory
nerves, affects his sense of smell,

322
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,714
and now it's growing and
pressing on his optic nerve.

323
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,175
Good.
MRI his head and find it.

324
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,137
Your potential donation
could... Hey, hey.

325
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,559
Would have an immediate
impact on our community.

326
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,603
We could extend our...

327
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,775
Something wrong?

328
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,527
I just think maybe
it'll be a better idea

329
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,237
to have a tour of
the clinic first.

330
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,155
It's right this way.

331
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,005
We have several patients
that are children

332
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,465
and we find that it's important

333
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,901
to give them
the opportunity to play

334
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,095
to make the hospital
a less intimidating place.

335
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,350
My Dad used to
lock me in a closet

336
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,769
and it feels like
I can't breathe.

337
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,731
We need you to stay still.

338
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,983
Give him a break.

339
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,944
You want him squirming
around? We'll have to do it twice.

340
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,196
I want you to show
him a little respect.

341
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,326
You really think this kid
can turn his life around?

342
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,786
He believes God gave
him a second chance.

343
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,270
That kind of belief
can be powerful.

344
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,333
Masters doesn't surprise me,

345
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,084
he plays the fellow med student

346
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,086
who dreams of being a
doctor and reels her in.

347
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,465
But you? Falling for his
deep connection with God?

348
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,883
He has hope.

349
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,593
After all he's been through,

350
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,945
it kind of makes me
root for him.

351
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,346
We don't even know who he is,

352
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,681
except that he lies
about who he is.

353
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,976
The bit about his abusive
father is probably all made up.

354
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,145
And he faked the scars?

355
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,873
He's a punk, probably
got in a lot of fights.

356
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,024
And he sucked you in
using the dad story.

357
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,279
I don't think I'm feeling
very well. I think I'm...

358
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,699
He's vomiting.

359
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,743
Should I ask him to stay
still while he does that?

360
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,582
He has two dark spots
in the parietal cortex.

361
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:13,712
They're not tumors, maybe
some kind of injury or inborn defect.

362
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,506
Apparently,
he was clinically dead

363
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,299
for several seconds
when he OD'd.

364
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:21,303
The dark spots could be brain
damage from oxygen starvation.

365
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,222
Except it's not.

366
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,807
I've seen MRI imagery like that

367
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,475
in schizophrenics.
Three serving two.

368
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,227
But schizophrenia
doesn't explain

369
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,728
why his blood pressure
skyrocketed

370
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,063
and he threw up in the MRI.

371
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,815
Panic attack.
He's claustrophobic.

372
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,751
He was fine once we let him out.

373
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,152
The dysosmia and tunnel
vision could be hallucinations.

374
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,154
Except, as was already covered,

375
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,907
he was screened for
mental illness down in the ER.

376
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,201
In your head!

377
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,284
It's face.

378
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,578
On your face!

379
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,830
Close enough.

380
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,167
The ER docs missed it because he
didn't present with major symptoms yet.

381
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,491
We're seeing it in its infancy.

382
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,170
So we treat him, and then what?

383
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,341
He becomes just
another schizophrenic

384
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,777
homeless man
wandering the streets.

385
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,344
- We have to help him.
- I'd love to,

386
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,346
but I got four million
other crazy people

387
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,014
ahead of him on my to-do list.

388
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,766
Along with milk.

389
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,444
You two spent months trying
to figure out a way to date

390
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,779
and not have it affect
your working relationship.

391
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,115
Now you need to do the
same thing for not dating.

392
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,452
No, I don't.

393
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,204
This is serious.

394
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,874
Did you know that she's...

395
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,544
She's dying of guilt and
feels horrible for dumping me.

396
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,379
It's great.

397
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,381
Not the dumping part,

398
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,135
but the part where she'll
now let me do whatever I want.

399
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,721
So you're just trying
to punish her?

400
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,516
She feels bad and your only
goal is to take advantage?

401
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,562
That's not true.
I have plenty of goals.

402
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,399
One of them is a 60-inch
flat screen, right there.

403
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,738
You're a lot of things, House,
but you've never been a sadist.

404
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,367
You're pummeling an
opponent who isn't fighting back.

405
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,561
I already gave him
his second dose

406
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,687
of clozapine, you don't need...

407
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,422
I'll bet you 50 bucks his
favorite sport is hockey.

408
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,733
How could you
possibly know that?

409
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,800
Just a hunch.

410
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,136
How you feeling?

411
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,554
My arm kind of hurts.

412
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,099
I'll talk to the nurse
about upping your pain meds.

413
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,478
Hockey, eh?

414
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,188
Oh.

415
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,566
My nephew bought it for me.
Knows I'm a huge fan.

416
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,946
I hate hockey.

417
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,078
If this IS schizophrenia,

418
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,871
you're gonna need regular care.

419
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,206
I've found some shelters

420
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,958
that have
full-time medical staff

421
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,167
and also offer college...

422
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,710
My arm really hurts.

423
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,045
Let's have a look.

424
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,463
It feels like it's on fire.

425
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,941
We need to take a
look under the bandages.

426
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,800
No, no, no, not that one.
This one.

427
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,565
Ahoy there, me hearties,
permission to come aboard.

428
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,750
Danny said his left arm felt
like it was on fire last night.

429
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,670
We assumed it was a
schizophrenic delusion, but...

430
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,839
It's not.
He's on clozapine.

431
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,299
He'd be getting better,
not worse.

432
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,884
Sounds like
regional pain syndrome.

433
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,469
Has to be a genetic disorder.

434
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,140
Would you slow down?
You're gonna get us arrested.

435
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,393
I wouldn't worry about it.
We'll probably die first.

436
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,395
Don't make me take my shoe off!

437
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,190
We need to run his DNA. He could
have early onset of Parkinson's.

438
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,901
Or cortical-based
ganglionic degeneration,

439
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,238
or Huntington's or any one of
a dozen other genetic diseases.

440
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,116
If you let us out,
we can start testing.

441
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,760
If you're gonna test for
them all, it'll take weeks.

442
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,871
I'm not canceling my
honeymoon to treat this kid.

443
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,415
It's a fake marriage,
but a real honeymoon?

444
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,541
Most are.

445
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,126
Danny could also
have died before

446
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,295
we get through testing
for all the possibilities.

447
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,505
So we cheat.
Since it's genetic,

448
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,174
daddy or mommy's got it, too.

449
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,634
They're either sick or dead.

450
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,944
He doesn't know
where his mother is,

451
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,179
and he won't tell us
where his father is.

452
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,268
He's a homeless ex-junkie.

453
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,980
You telling me that you four
geniuses can't outwit him?

454
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,524
Green light!

455
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,409
Cuddy got it for me.

456
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,829
I'm now drafting a request for
studying the effects of caffeine

457
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,623
involving an Italian
espresso machine

458
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,708
and a massage chair.
Make it quick.

459
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,293
I found Danny's father.

460
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,213
Well done.

461
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,549
Kid said he was in a
state-sponsored rehab last November.

462
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,551
There's only one Danny Jennings

463
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,904
that was in treatment
at that time,

464
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,139
and he listed his father's
address as his primary next of kin.

465
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,685
The "Well done" was
for making it quick.

466
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,162
Now I'm gonna have
to take that back.

467
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,605
He lives about 30
minutes from the hospital.

468
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,775
And the reason you're continuing
to talk instead of driving there?

469
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,861
Chase and Masters are
already on their way.

470
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,496
Why didn't you ask me to
be part of your wedding?

471
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:44,292
You're genuinely upset at being
mockingly snubbed by a mock wedding?

472
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,171
Is it because I haven't
been here as long as them?

473
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,259
Or is it that you
really don't like me?

474
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,803
Or are you just screwing...

475
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,479
III...

476
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,192
I'll come back
when she's finished.

477
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,486
She is.

478
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,118
Oh, my God, what did
you think she was doing?

479
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,496
She's just installing the cable.

480
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,374
That's not a euphemism.

481
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,836
Oh, I feel sorry
for the little one.

482
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,337
Isn't there something we can do?

483
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,726
Can I help you?

484
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,770
We need to talk to you
about your son Danny.

485
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,898
Danny? Who are you?
We're his doctors.

486
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,150
We need to know if you
or perhaps his mother

487
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,068
have any family history
of genetic disease.

488
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,780
Why, what difference
would it make?

489
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,658
You may not care
about your son, but...

490
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,702
Is that what Danny told
you when he was in rehab?

491
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,287
We didn't love him?

492
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,581
Not why we came here.

493
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,291
We just want to know
if there's any

494
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,974
diagnosed genetic disease
in your family.

495
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,463
We're trying to
make your son better.

496
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,715
Better?

497
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,301
He died of a drug overdose.

498
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,094
We buried him three months ago.

499
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,782
Who are you?

500
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,617
What are you doing?

501
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,701
Test.

502
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,121
Who are you?

503
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,251
The important question is
who are you?

504
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,128
Danny Jennings is dead,

505
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,965
which means that Danny
Jennings has no pulse,

506
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,384
which you, on the other hand,

507
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,885
do.

508
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,138
Ergo, you are
not Danny Jennings.

509
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,600
Or I did the test wrong.

510
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,603
So why don't you cut the crap
and tell me your real name?

511
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,648
No.

512
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:18,196
Hiding your identity. Either
you're a criminal or a superhero.

513
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,116
I'm not a criminal.

514
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,452
Awesome. What
color is my underwear?

515
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,790
I'm not telling you my name.

516
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,463
No problem. I just
need your father's name.

517
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,885
Forget it.

518
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,219
Care to tell me why?

519
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,143
He's looking for me.

520
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,855
He supposedly

521
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,483
cleaned up and got sober.

522
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,153
And now he...

523
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,364
He wants to be part
of my life again,

524
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,866
and I can't let that happen.

525
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:09,164
You're a big boy now. You
still think he can hurt you?

526
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,753
You don't get it.

527
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,174
If I ever see my Dad again,

528
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,054
I'll Kill him.

529
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,362
What's happening to me?

530
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,535
Well, luckily for you, we don't
need daddy to figure that one out.

531
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,961
Did you find out his real name?

532
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,380
Cerebellar Ataxia.

533
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,216
That's a weird name.

534
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,302
Guy whiffed twice trying to
pick up a cup right in front of him.

535
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,930
That plus everything else...

536
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,396
means that we have whittled
our list of genetic diseases

537
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,319
all the way down to one,
early-onset Parkinson's.

538
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,117
After everything he's been
through, now we have to tell him,

539
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,661
"Hey, you have
an incurable disease

540
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,579
"that gets
progressively worse."

541
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,458
You could lie,
I'm fine with that.

542
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,894
But you'll probably
both feel better

543
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,380
if you give him Levodopa
and confirm with DNA tests.

544
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,932
He's gone too far.

545
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,269
He's taking up six handicapped
spaces with a monster truck.

546
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,539
It's only four, and he's gonna
get rid of it after the wedding.

547
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,064
And the chapel?
He's turned the chapel

548
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,816
into his own
personal catering hall.

549
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,986
Who cares? Other than a
janitor sleeping off a bender,

550
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,113
he's the first person
to use it in two weeks.

551
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,033
Appeasement is never the answer

552
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,396
in the face of naked aggression.

553
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,703
It won't be long
before his tanks

554
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,497
are rolling down
your Champs-Élysées.

555
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,752
I know what House is doing.

556
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,297
You, on the other hand, why do
you care? He isn't hurting anyone.

557
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,311
You're the first boss he's
ever had who could handle him.

558
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,146
Before you, he was either fired

559
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,440
or buried under a mountain
of malpractice suits.

560
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,777
He needs someone to say no.

561
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:48,156
He needs someone he'll
listen to when they say no.

562
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,159
If you really care about House,

563
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,786
you'll stop
feeling sorry for him,

564
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,998
and get out there and start
kicking him where he needs kicking.

565
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,549
I changed my mind.

566
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,135
You want the fish
instead of the chicken?

567
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,720
This room is for
patients' families,

568
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,181
not for doctors trying to
defraud the government.

569
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:18,311
Oh. So you've decided
to take a moral stand?

570
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,562
Yes.

571
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,564
The chapel still has
sanctity for some people.

572
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,400
You're right. I think
I saw Blue the janitor

573
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,044
passed out in one of
the pews last week.

574
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,322
It's Lou, and I would
have thrown him out, too.

575
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,243
Where are we gonna go?

576
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,496
We got caterers staging
everything downstairs as we speak.

577
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,834
We got floral arrangements,
place settings, other weddingy stuff.

578
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,586
It's not my problem.

579
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,716
I sent out the invitations.
People are coming here.

580
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,178
That's also not my problem.

581
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,894
And I want the TV back.

582
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,407
You should just let me die.

583
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,453
The world's
better off without me.

584
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,081
It's normal.

585
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,754
People feel depressed
when they get bad news

586
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,756
because it's bad news,

587
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,303
obviously.

588
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,098
I didn't OD by accident.

589
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,810
I was trying to kill myself.

590
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,565
Why?

591
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,822
Because I've done things.

592
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,451
Horrible things.

593
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,662
I've hurt people.

594
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,584
But when I didn't die,
I thought...

595
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,298
I thought God forgave me.

596
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,429
But he just wanted me to suffer,

597
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,307
and I deserve it.
No.

598
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,147
You don't deserve it.

599
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,364
I had a girlfriend in college

600
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,868
and I almost killed her.

601
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,164
I just snapped

602
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,628
and I started hitting her.

603
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,508
And if her roommate
hadn't come home...

604
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,223
I'm evil.

605
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,186
I'm just like my dad.

606
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,524
We're both monsters
that deserve to die.

607
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,077
I can't... I can't...

608
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,914
I feel dizzy.

609
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,876
I need a crash cart in here!

610
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,015
His heart is
dilated and failing.

611
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,201
And at the rate it's happening,
he'll need a new one soon,

612
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:48,062
and there's no way we'll
get him on the transplant list.

613
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,564
What are we missing?

614
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,317
Everything. We know
nothing about this kid.

615
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,903
Except that he's gotten
worse since we admitted him.

616
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,780
Why?

617
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,075
Most of our patients tend to
do that, unless we cure them.

618
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,077
Yeah, but why so fast?

619
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,389
He had dysosmia for
a couple of months,

620
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,332
never even came here
to get it treated.

621
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,084
He was just
a random burn victim.

622
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,919
We get him,

623
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,214
boom, he's got tunnel vision,
peripheral polyneuropathy,

624
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,259
Cerebellar Ataxia
and now cardiomyopathy.

625
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,387
What's different here than say,

626
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,806
living in a filthy state park?

627
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,267
You think cleanliness
is making him sick?

628
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,102
An allergic reaction?

629
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,647
We treated him with Vicodin,
clozapine and one IV bag of Levodopa.

630
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,775
His condition started
deteriorating before that.

631
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,739
Stop that man!

632
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,619
I need the meal card
for the patient in 243.

633
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,961
He's eating healthy

634
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,588
because he can.

635
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,301
Most of the meals
in here are vegetarian.

636
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,598
Adult Refsum disease.

637
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,518
It fits all the symptoms.

638
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,980
His body can't process the
phytanic acid in chlorophyll.

639
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,651
It's his healthy diet of green
vegetables that's killing him.

640
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,111
So if we change his diet...

641
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,278
We can save his life.

642
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,364
Run him through
a plasmapheresis treatment

643
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,741
to remove the excess
phytanic acid from his blood.

644
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,827
Confirm with gene testing.

645
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,831
Okay, I got to go get married.

646
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,696
They say true love
doesn't exist anymore.

647
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,698
Maybe it never did.

648
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,369
So without further ado...

649
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,667
Do you, Dominika
Patrova, take this man

650
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,544
to be your
lawfully-wedded husband?

651
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,380
I do.

652
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,471
And do you, Gregory
House, take this woman

653
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,223
to be your lawfully-wedded wife?

654
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,061
Yep.

655
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,148
Then by the power vested in me

656
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,484
by the state of New
Jersey just for today,

657
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,321
I now pronounce you man
and wife. You may kiss the bride.

658
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,577
Those of you with
cameras, please feel free

659
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,621
to provide legal documentation.

660
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,473
It's okay, I'm just
angry at myself.

661
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:18,272
Promised I wouldn't let this
get to me, and it got to me.

662
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:23,402
Just say the word, and we will
climb out that window right now.

663
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,450
I wouldn't give
House the satisfaction.

664
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,787
You see? Things are
getting back to normal.

665
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,624
Yeah.

666
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,460
Normal.

667
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,755
You feeling better?

668
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:50,388
So, all I have to do is eat the
right kinds of food and I'll be okay?

669
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,722
Basically, yeah.

670
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,141
It's pretty limiting and it
is for the rest of your life,

671
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,562
but if you follow the diet
and get checked up regularly,

672
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,480
you should be fine.

673
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,316
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

674
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,236
For not giving up on me.

675
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,574
You're not a bad person.

676
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,744
You made mistakes,
but we all do.

677
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,348
Maybe when you get out of here,

678
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:21,168
you can go talk to
someone, a professional.

679
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:26,340
Yeah. Yeah, some of those places
you suggested have people on staff.

680
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:32,680
You know, I think God really
does have a plan for me.

681
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,516
And all this?

682
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,437
It was just his way
of testing my resolve.

683
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,525
I wouldn't have
passed it without you.

684
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,199
See you tomorrow, Danny.

685
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,871
That's not my real name.

686
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,793
Doesn't matter.

687
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,823
I know this is
not real marriage,

688
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,534
but I really like you.

689
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,331
I like you, too.

690
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,520
I can't.
Why not?

691
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,233
I never sleep
with married women.

692
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,779
I'm going to bed.
You can take the couch.

693
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,964
What's going on?

694
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,883
Danny disappeared
without checking out.

695
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,387
So you called the FBI?

696
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,056
We didn't call
them, they just showed up.

697
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,561
Danny's DNA, when
we sent it to the lab for testing,

698
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,731
it set off alarm bells
