1
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,588
Hey.

2
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,008
Hey.

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,636
So, uh...
What did you want?

4
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,932
It's too late now.

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,350
Too late for what?

6
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,810
I'll tell you later. Come
on, the bell just rang.

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,103
We've still got time.

8
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,358
I'm ready.

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,735
Oh.

10
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,861
You sure?

11
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,114
Yeah.

12
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,825
Why now all of a sudden?

13
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,202
What, you don't want to anymore?

14
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,495
Yeah, I do.

15
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,122
I'm just wondering
what changed your mind.

16
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,208
You did.

17
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,714
Now?

18
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,175
If you want.

19
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,723
Excuse me.

20
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,768
You two need to come with me.

21
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,819
Take a seat.
But we didn't...

22
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,546
You know you're not
supposed to be back there.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,655
We weren't doing anything.

24
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,116
That's not what it
looked like to me.

25
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,868
Principal Fields will be back
as soon as the assembly's over.

26
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,163
Ms. Washburn, please. If I
get one more referral, my mom...

27
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,748
Bench.

28
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,011
Who put sand in her vagina?

29
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,353
Hey, kids.
How you boys doing?

30
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,398
Uh, can we help you?

31
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,649
I certainly hope so.

32
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,236
You know what this is?

33
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,946
A laptop?

34
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,744
A password-protected laptop
that I need you nerds to hack into.

35
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,829
No insecticides
or toxic cleaners.

36
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,664
Check the bathroom.

37
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,791
Who are you?

38
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,542
Your roommate's doctor.

39
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,020
You remember your
roommate, don't you?

40
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,546
I thought he just
had bronchitis.

41
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,384
That's what the morons at the
Rutgers student medical center thought,

42
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,011
which may be part of the
reason he just coughed up a lung.

43
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,056
What do you mean,
"He coughed up a lung"?

44
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,225
He coughed,

45
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,062
after which the respiratory
organ which resided in his chest

46
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,356
resided in his mouth.

47
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,026
Actually, his hand. Well,
his mouth, then his hand.

48
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,820
Bathroom's clean.

49
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,988
What's in this?

50
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,116
Just soda.
Mind if I have some?

51
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,992
You want my drink?

52
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,828
You got a problem with that?

53
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,622
Uh, yeah. Actually, I do.

54
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,082
You barge into our room,

55
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,085
start looking through our
personal private stuff,

56
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,752
demand I hack into a computer,

57
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,596
I think I can safely
assume doesn't belong...

58
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,844
I'm sorry. Did I break your
concentration? Please, continue.

59
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,389
You were talking
about personal privacy.

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,977
What, you're finished?

61
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,229
Well, allow me to retort.

62
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,774
Wait a second. You're
saying this actually happened?

63
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,568
Absolutely.

64
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,153
You're lying.

65
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,615
Interesting theory.
Can you prove it?

66
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,244
Doctors don't carry guns,
they don't shoot people,

67
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,205
and they definitely don't
search patients' homes.

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,291
Plus I've seen Pulp Fiction,

69
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,876
the movie you're
totally ripping off.

70
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,504
Huh.

71
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,715
Wait, uh, was it Timmy Morgan?

72
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,800
I have no idea.

73
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,137
It had to be him. He's, like,
totally obsessed with old movies.

74
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,683
Pulp Fiction is not
an old movie. What...

75
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,728
So you're here to talk to the
principal about something Timmy did?

76
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,146
I got no problem with Timmy,

77
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,982
and even if I did,
I ain't no snitch.

78
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,401
Then why are you here?

79
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,529
To dig myself out of a hole.
Instead I dug a bigger one.

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,241
What did you do?

81
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,618
What did you do?

82
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,911
What did you do?

83
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,248
What happened to your eye?

84
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,584
It's none of your business.

85
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,628
Actually, it's none
of yours. I'm a doctor.

86
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,965
It's a few days old, so
it's not why you're here.

87
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,219
Unless you two got busted
for some sort of revenge plot,

88
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,847
but then you'd look angry
instead of ashamed.

89
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,682
I'm not ashamed.
Interesting.

90
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,602
You defensively insist
that you're not ashamed,

91
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,855
which, of course, means you are
ashamed, and yet you're the victim.

92
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,774
You want to know how
she got the black eye?

93
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,443
Tell us why you're here first.

94
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,254
Anyone ever tell you
you're annoying?

95
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,490
Yes. All
the time.

96
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,077
But he's right. You
wanna know, you first.

97
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,374
I didn't kill anybody.

98
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,126
I have to be here, so I figured

99
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,295
I'd punch up the stakes
in the first act.

100
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,299
But we did and almost always
do search the patient's home.

101
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,801
And if we tell them first,

102
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,428
then they could hide
something that we need to know

103
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,312
in order to figure out
what's wrong with them.

104
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,534
Why would they hide something
that could be killing them?

105
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,768
Because they are morons.

106
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,312
They're
all morons and everybody lies.

107
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,857
Wait. If everybody lies, then
that means you're lying right now.

108
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,778
I didn't say everybody
always lies, Aristotle.

109
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,950
And on that note, unless
there are any questions...

110
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,159
Good.

111
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,911
Oh, Dr. Hourani.

112
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,166
Before you finish, maybe you
could describe what you actually do.

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,045
You know, like if someone
comes in for a routine physical.

114
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,678
You want routine?

115
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,804
Please.

116
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,808
It just feels kind of numb.

117
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,562
You do a lot of bicycle riding?

118
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,730
No.

119
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,524
How long have you been married?

120
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,651
Twelve years next month.

121
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,696
And you have six kids.

122
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,551
You don't think it could have
anything to do with that, do you?

123
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,909
Probably.

124
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,496
How often do you
use your vibrator?

125
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,041
Excuse me?

126
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,460
Your battery-operated Brad Pitt.

127
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,462
After giving
the gift of life to six

128
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,255
8-pound 4-ounce wrecking balls,

129
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,506
I think I can safely assume

130
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,859
it's an industrial
strength model.

131
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,468
Dr. Hourani!

132
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,802
Please.

133
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,600
You wanted routine.
Am I done?

134
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,644
Maybe we should just move on.

135
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,811
No problem.

136
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,813
I meant with your typical day.

137
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,417
I assume you see
more than one patient.

138
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,983
Nope.

139
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,653
Okay.

140
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,240
Then I guess we move on
to our next guest...

141
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,992
Wait, if you only
see one patient,

142
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,436
what do you do
the rest of the day?

143
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,837
Dr. Hourani?

144
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,932
Just in time for lunch.

145
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,118
If by "lunch" you mean a
"conference call with the board,"

146
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,937
and by "just in time"
you mean "20 minutes late."

147
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,522
I meant sex.

148
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,900
Fine, lunch.

149
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,654
How about we start
with a small tossed salad?

150
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,949
As of this morning,
I'm on a diet.

151
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,127
Meaning?

152
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,546
I told you, I'm busy.

153
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,215
No, you told me you were
supposed to be busy 20 minutes ago.

154
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,943
But you were obviously able
to put them off then,

155
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,653
there's no reason you
can't put them off now.

156
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,972
How about I wanted
to then and now I don't?

157
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,600
Get your finger off my phone.

158
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,019
We obviously have
something we need to discuss.

159
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,730
Now is not a good time.
If you're mad

160
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,082
because you don't
feel you're getting

161
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,066
the necessary amount
of affection,

162
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,276
all you have to do is ask.

163
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,694
Seriously, not now.

164
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,028
If memory serves,

165
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,490
I enjoyed a healthy Sunday
brunch, SO your insinuation...

166
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,243
Ow! What is
your problem?

167
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,996
You! You are my problem.

168
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,374
You are the most selfish,
self-centered son of a bitch

169
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,751
on the face of the planet.

170
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,128
And I'm sick of it.

171
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,338
I'm just done.

172
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,551
I can't deal with you anymore.

173
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,773
So that's what a typical
doctor does on a typical day.

174
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,608
Any questions?

175
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,365
What's a vibrator?

176
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,877
Why was your girlfriend so mad?

177
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,837
It doesn't matter.

178
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,422
Well, obviously it matters.

179
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,066
I mean, if she's
your girlfriend,

180
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,051
you should care how she feels.

181
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,637
I mean it doesn't matter
to the story.

182
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,097
It's the most important
part of the story.

183
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,266
It's the only thing
that does matter.

184
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,728
You don't kiss her enough.
Is that the problem?

185
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,063
Absolutely not.

186
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,440
Which, by your definition,
means it is.

187
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,486
We kiss plenty.

188
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,822
Your turn.

189
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,990
Then what's the problem?
Your turn.

190
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,076
What's the problem?

191
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,248
Excuse me, when exactly
will the Commandant be back?

192
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,750
Shouldn't be much longer, sir.

193
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,965
Well...

194
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,472
So now you're not gonna
talk. That's real mature.

195
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,937
All right, fine. We got busted
for kissing behind the school.

196
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,565
Now you know why we're here,

197
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,191
so tell us why you're here.

198
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,151
The deal was
about the black eye.

199
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,028
And we didn't kiss.

200
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,615
So you're just
making him beg, huh?

201
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,284
I didn't have you
pegged as a tease.

202
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,493
I'm not a tease.

203
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,579
The available evidence
suggests otherwise.

204
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,955
I'm not a tease.

205
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,290
Prove it.

206
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,129
By telling me your story.

207
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,095
You're a pathetic loser jerk,

208
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:05,141
and I wouldn't kiss you if I had brain
cancer and your lips were the cure.

209
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,561
Whoa.

210
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,564
She actually said that?

211
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,875
Well, yeah, that was,
like, two days ago...

212
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,442
It doesn't matter.

213
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,194
I clearly didn't lead him
along or anything like that,

214
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,739
which proves
I'm not a tease, so...

215
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,866
Why is your girlfriend
mad at you?

216
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,203
I'm getting a kind of bossy
vibe. I take it you're into that.

217
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,872
Don't answer.

218
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,498
Your turn.

219
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,504
What seems to
be the problem, sir?

220
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,216
I'm having more difficulty
breathing, and some pain in my chest.

221
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,052
You're new, aren't you?

222
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,180
Yeah. I just moved
from Chicago.

223
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,903
Chicago's awesome.
What part are you from?

224
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,393
We need to get a chest CT.

225
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,996
Excuse me,
I'm the senior team member,

226
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,340
which means we don't need
anything unless I say we need it.

227
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,167
Do you want to have an affair?

228
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,692
You want to have a threesome?

229
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,696
You can't talk to her like
that. I'm telling Cuddy.

230
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,032
We need a chest CT.

231
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,867
Get it yourself.
Get it yourself.

232
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,203
Isn't that like
sexual harassment?

233
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,871
Not if you're good-looking.

234
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,206
Excuse me?

235
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,709
You said the one guy
was short with a big nose.

236
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,473
I guess it's not the
only thing that's big.

237
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,712
What does that mean?

238
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
It means he's lying.
Again.

239
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,510
'Cause you can't
handle the truth!

240
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,389
That's so easy.

241
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,432
A Few Good Men.

242
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,231
Okay, I give up. I think we
should move on to our next guest.

243
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,234
Mr. Dryden

244
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,362
works for one of the largest

245
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,239
advertising agencies
in New York City.

246
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,407
Boring.

247
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,201
Can we at least hear what
happened to the patient?

248
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,954
Yeah, please.

249
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,418
If Dr. Hourani
promises to...

250
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,794
Patient's dead.

251
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,634
The floor's yours, Don.

252
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,760
Dave.

253
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,388
He's not dead. You said
earlier he was still in the hospital.

254
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,031
What's wrong with him?
He's got a cough.

255
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,516
You said he coughed up a lung.

256
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,600
What about the laptop?

257
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,019
Who cares about the laptop?

258
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,502
Yeah, and he already said he
was lying about that, you moron.

259
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,315
Gabe, we do not use
that word here. He did.

260
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,210
Yeah, and I was talking
about people like you.

261
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,485
Ooh.

262
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,489
Dr. Hourani, please.

263
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,118
Could you just finish,
quickly, SO we can move on?

264
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,711
I don't know what's wrong.

265
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,380
He was stable for a while
and then all of a sudden...

266
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,550
Bronchial infection
must be from a drug resistant strain.

267
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,385
02 sats are plummeting.

268
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,780
We need to get him
on a bronchodilator

269
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,948
before he goes into
respiratory arrest.

270
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,973
Need suction.
Sit him up.

271
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,683
Start blow-by oxygen.

272
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,068
What is that?

273
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,157
I think this is...
It's his lung.

274
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,084
That actually happened?

275
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,252
Yes, it really happened.

276
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:24,381
I take cases that other
doctors fail to diagnose,

277
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,675
which is why I only
take one at a time.

278
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,761
My current patient
is a college student.

279
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,404
He's actually in
the hospital right now.

280
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,140
And, yes, he really did cough up

281
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,935
a large portion of
dead lung tissue.

282
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,938
How's that even possible?

283
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,898
That's what she said.

284
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,069
No, she did literally say that.

285
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,779
How's that even possible?

286
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,781
Primary squamous carcinoma could

287
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,616
cause lung tissue to
basically disintegrate.

288
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,284
It's not cancer.
FOB was normal.

289
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,494
It's not infection either.

290
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,537
Broad spectrum antibiotics
haven't had any effect.

291
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,748
Who password-protects
a computer they keep

292
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,708
in a locked desk
in a locked office?

293
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,728
Someone who works with
someone who thinks it's okay

294
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,112
to break into
other people's homes.

295
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,714
An amoebic
liver abscess could rupture

296
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,967
through the diaphragm
into the thorax.

297
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,636
Not when his liver
function tests are all normal.

298
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,013
His dorm mates are
computer science majors.

299
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,474
If they're fabricating chips
they could be working with

300
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,309
all kinds of
different toxic solvents.

301
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,980
We need to search the dorm.

302
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,148
We?

303
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,113
While we're out, do a thorascopic
lung biopsy and c-ANCA

304
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,157
because it's sarcoidosis.

305
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,326
But if you think it's
sarcoidosis, why are you...

306
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,581
So you really did force his
roommate to hack into the laptop?

307
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,457
Why would I lie?

308
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,459
But whose laptop is it?

309
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,420
It's your girlfriend's,
isn't it?

310
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,713
She's not my girlfriend.

311
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm just interested in
her because she's a client

312
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,884
and she sleeps
above her covers...

313
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,760
Four feet above her covers.

314
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,347
What?
Ghostbusters.

315
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,433
So that's why she's so mad?

316
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,934
You looked through her computer?

317
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,479
No, that part happened
after she got mad.

318
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,442
First she got mad. Then I
stole her computer to fix things.

319
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,736
And then we got the case.

320
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,948
Wait, so you tried to fix your
relationship by stealing her computer?

321
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,160
Well, when you say it
like that...

322
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,953
Yes.

323
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,290
Looks like you're the moron.

324
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,626
Ooh.

325
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,364
Can also get three sets
of golf clubs in here.

326
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,506
No way.

327
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,592
You didn't get her laptop by
blowing down the door of her office.

328
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,511
That's from
Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.

329
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,772
Just seeing if you're
still paying attention.

330
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,017
It was actually more subtle.

331
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,440
The Thomas Crown Affair.

332
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,694
The Steve McQueen version.

333
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,570
Just tell us the truth already.

334
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,447
Excuse me,
but there are others here

335
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,032
who would like
a chance to speak.

336
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,742
Go right ahead.

337
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,868
No!

338
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,582
The audience is always right.

339
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,797
It wasn't me.

340
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,928
Ma'am, are you okay?
Can you hear me?

341
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,389
Ooh.

342
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,890
What's that smell?

343
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,647
Smells like a gas leak.

344
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,316
Call Dr. Cuddy!

345
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,783
You poisoned
a room full of patients

346
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,453
So you could steal
your girlfriend's laptop?

347
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,580
I didn't poison anybody.

348
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,916
I spilled some hydrogen
sulphide and ammonia on the floor,

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,420
thinking the stench would
clear the place out.

350
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,380
But instead of breathing
through his nose,

351
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,133
some idiot decided
to hold his breath.

352
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,760
He passes out

353
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,678
and before I know it,
the place is

354
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,930
a perfect storm
of mass hysteria.

355
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,268
Although it worked out
just as well.

356
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,686
They're morons.

357
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,063
Agreed.

358
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,482
No, not the patients, the kids.

359
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,943
It doesn't matter how you
stole it, what matters is why.

360
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,530
You know, you're starting
to remind me of someone.

361
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,492
I didn't ask how you
stole it, I asked why.

362
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,327
Isn't it obvious?

363
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,372
You think you can tell
why she's mad by reading

364
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,499
budget spreadsheets
and per Diem schedules?

365
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,501
I know why she's mad,

366
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,312
what I need to know is
how to make her un-mad.

367
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,089
Step one is gaining access
to the journal on her laptop

368
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,342
where she records her
inner most thoughts,

369
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,469
instead of just
watching porn with me.

370
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,806
Oh, grow up.

371
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,393
If porn was bad, why would
there be SO many nuns in it?

372
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,729
Why is she mad?
I was myself,

373
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,148
which, by the way, she's
supposed to love unconditionally.

374
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,902
I didn't do anything.

375
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,404
We had a great weekend.

376
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,408
Went to a blues club, we
watched Cinderfella on DVD.

377
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,243
And?

378
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,205
It doesn't matter. She's being
unreasonable and I have to fix it.

379
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,208
I need to know what's really
important to her. I need something big.

380
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,335
Because?
We're past that.

381
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,259
Have you tried
childhood pet names?

382
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,052
I don't know her pets.

383
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,513
She's never mentioned a pet?

384
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,181
Yeah, but I wasn't listening.

385
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,602
She's not mad because I don't
remember a dead dog's name.

386
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,982
Her first dog was Ronaldo.

387
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,358
R-O or R-E-Y?

388
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,152
I didn't ask, try both.

389
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,280
Just got a case from the ER.

390
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,949
Rutgers student came in with
what looked like acute bronchitis.

391
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,760
But there's nothing in his
blood or sputum cultures.

392
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,845
Don't you think
it's time you people

393
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,162
stop looking to the white man

394
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,325
to solve all your problems?

395
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,873
His O2 sats are in the toilet.

396
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,267
If we don't figure out
what's attacking his...

397
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,917
So figure it out!

398
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,127
I'm busy.

399
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,050
That can't be true.

400
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,218
Why not?

401
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,389
'Cause if he was dying...
I mean, you're a doctor.

402
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,564
Patients die every day. Not
all of them are interesting.

403
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,456
You still haven't
answered either question.

404
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,210
She was mad because
she's genetically programmed

405
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,629
to make a big deal out
of every little thing.

406
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,632
So she's mad
'cause she's a girl?

407
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,177
And now she's mad
because she's programmed

408
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,429
to make a big deal out
of every little thing.

409
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,973
Actually, she's not like that.

410
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,326
Why are you sticking up for her?

411
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,685
She said you were a pathetic
jerk and she hates you.

412
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,354
That was a long time ago.

413
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,897
It was two days ago.

414
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,774
And it wasn't even true then.

415
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,025
How do you know?

416
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,401
Because I know how you think.

417
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,445
Really?

418
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,863
Really.

419
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,282
Really?

420
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,637
And no peck on the cheek.
It has to be on the lips.

421
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,016
Winning a bet to
force her to kiss you

422
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,726
actually cuts
against your theory

423
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,970
that you know how she thinks.

424
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,499
I wasn't forcing her to do
anything that she didn't want to do.

425
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,234
You hoping for a career
in the NBA or the NFL?

426
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,027
The bet let her do
what she wanted to do,

427
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,911
while still being able
to act like she didn't,

428
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,507
so her friends
wouldn't get all, like,

429
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,241
calling her a slut or something.

430
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,161
Not that it's slutty or
anything, it's just a kiss.

431
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,498
Not even close to true.

432
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,421
I just couldn't
believe I'd lose.

433
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,007
Ah, now we're getting somewhere.

434
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,594
No, we're not.

435
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,512
Oh, I thought we were.

436
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,307
No, you thought we weren't
and that's exactly what you want

437
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,935
because you don't want to
tell us why was she mad at you!

438
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,249
You tell us you don't
want to do your job

439
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,835
because you're too busy trying
to break into your girlfriend's laptop

440
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,986
to figure out a way to
make her not mad at you

441
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,281
but you don't tell us
why she was mad at you.

442
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,369
It's stupid.

443
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,705
Talk.

444
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,048
I'm out of here.

445
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,135
Unless...

446
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,724
Rachel's gonna be up soon.

447
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,142
You never know.

448
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,311
Yes, I do.

449
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,358
Could you take the
garbage out before you go?

450
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,485
I would, but...

451
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,073
Oh, come on.
It's not a lot.

452
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,992
The pain's always worst
first thing in the morning.

453
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,675
Mommy!

454
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,199
You used her toothbrush.

455
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,826
That's so gross.

456
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,786
What's the big deal?

457
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,931
It's not like she had a problem

458
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,373
with swapping spit
the night before.

459
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,292
Maybe it's not the swapping
spit that bothers her,

460
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,503
but the fact that
you don't listen to her.

461
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,908
Had she warned you not to do it?

462
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,089
Oh, I listen to her.

463
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,799
But you just said before
that you didn't.

464
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,276
No, I said I didn't
remember what she said...

465
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,969
No, you said
you don't listen to her.

466
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,679
I listen to her.

467
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,975
Okay? Believe me,
I listen.

468
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:06,857
It's my toothbrush
and it's not just once,

469
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,859
and it's not like I'd even care,

470
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,487
but you totally destroy it.

471
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,740
You're supposed
to brush with it,

472
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,825
not gnaw on it
like a rawhide bone.

473
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,996
I think Ms. Four-Cavities'
time would be better spent

474
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,791
copying Mr. No-Cavities
instead of complaining about him.

475
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,377
And given what
I'd just been doing,

476
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,105
I thought you wouldn't
want me going out to dinner

477
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,673
without a good brush
and a floss.

478
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,843
Would you please just use
the toothbrush I bought you?

479
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:38,054
Would you please just shut
up and watch the movie?

480
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,143
I said, please.

481
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,858
Why would you have to brush
your teeth before you go to dinner?

482
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,985
You don't wanna know. Yet.

483
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,654
You're gross and dumb.

484
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,156
You listen to what she says

485
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,283
just so you can tell her
how wrong she is.

486
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,202
You are clueless and naive.

487
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,498
I have to tell her that she's
wrong because no one else will.

488
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,750
She's the boss,

489
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,585
which means she's
surrounded by morons

490
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,462
who are either afraid of her,

491
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,714
or they want to kiss up
to her, or they want to

492
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,718
kiss her.

493
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,886
But not you.

494
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,970
I already kissed her,

495
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,698
and I respect her enough
not to treat her like

496
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,809
some tender blossom
who needs to be coddled.

497
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,020
Makes sense to me.

498
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,566
That's what you think you did?

499
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,819
Yeah, totally.

500
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,078
You?

501
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,372
No, I didn't punch her.

502
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,937
Oh, my God.

503
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,022
You're a moron.
I didn't mean to.

504
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,774
The stick had
a wicked heel curve.

505
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,276
Did I mention, you're a moron?

506
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,777
Hey, you just said
that it's wrong

507
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,196
to treat your girlfriend
like she's weaker than you.

508
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,590
I'm not talking
about trying to score,

509
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,949
I'm talking about shooting high.

510
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,368
Tennis shoes on a wooden floor?

511
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,871
She obviously can't butterfly
and cover the low corners.

512
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,707
Your turn. The laptop.

513
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,637
I must be in the midst of
a complex partial seizure

514
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,806
'cause I know you are
not sitting at my desk.

515
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,309
Sorry, I ran out
of lotion in mine.

516
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,619
Get the hell out of here. Can't.

517
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,313
This is the only place left that
Cuddy will never look for me,

518
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,790
and I still haven't
found what I'm looking for.

519
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,067
I can tell you what you're about
to find. It's my foot in your ass.

520
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,486
I don't think you got
enough lotion for that.

521
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,450
How'd you even get in here?
The door was locked.

522
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,492
Well, either I can
walk through walls, or...

523
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,621
We have lift off.

524
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,830
Is that Cuddy's journal?

525
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,125
No, it's a freelance piece
I'm writing for Teen Vogue.

526
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,501
Let me see that.

527
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,961
Sorry, gotta go.

528
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,089
Key.

529
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,676
Oh.

530
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,931
I gotta give you
one thing, Hourani.

531
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,810
Your wife, she's
beautiful. I mean, wow.

532
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,771
Thank you.

533
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,406
House!

534
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,744
Walt.

535
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,082
I thought you
were Dr. Hourani.

536
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,959
Yeah.

537
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,764
So that's why you're here?
Well, that was stupid.

538
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,683
I know.

539
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,519
Mr. Stupid Head
at your service.

540
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,812
Where are you now?

541
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,146
In the principal's office.

542
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,856
House, we don't
have time for games.

543
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,542
The PET scan was negative
for sarcoidosis.

544
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,568
Great. Means the
treatment's already working.

545
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,363
It would if we'd actually started
the treatment, but we didn't.

546
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,614
Why the hell not?

547
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,491
Because it's not sarcoidosis.

548
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,243
If you were here,
you would know that.

549
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,953
He's dying.
What's left of his lung

550
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,639
has collapsed and FNA
of the mediastinal...

551
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,039
I don't care about the FNA.

552
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,250
What I care about is how
he responds to the treatment.

553
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,835
House...
Just do it.

554
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:44,384
Sarcoidosis is
a diagnosis of exclusion,

555
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,179
which means that the cowards who
spend their time excluding what it isn't

556
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,391
usually cause their
patients to die from what it is.

557
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,644
I don't get it. Why would
you lie about your name?

558
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,062
Who cares?

559
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,466
What did she write
in her journal?

560
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,274
Thank you!

561
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,527
That is exactly my point. Why
does no one ever believe me?

562
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,071
What?

563
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,033
Just because he's dying
doesn't make it interesting.

564
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,119
You cheated on her, didn't you?

565
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,871
No, I didn't cheat on her.

566
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,034
It's obviously more than
just you used her toothbrush

567
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,958
and wouldn't take
the garbage out.

568
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,169
No, actually,
it was exactly that.

569
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,088
I just need some time alone.

570
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,716
Because I used your toothbrush?

571
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,427
And you wouldn't
take out the garbage.

572
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,722
That's insane.
You know that, right?

573
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,059
You do whatever you want.
Always.

574
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,311
I said I was sorry.

575
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,289
I was still half asleep.
I wasn't paying attention.

576
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,397
And you're always right.

577
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,000
And I don't mean you
always think you're right.

578
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,610
But you are
actually always right.

579
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,862
Because that's all that matters.

580
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,238
That doesn't even make sense.

581
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,365
What? You want me
to be wrong?

582
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,492
I want you to care about

583
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,787
more than just what
you want, what you think.

584
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,334
You need me, House.
And you may even love me,

585
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,754
but you don't care about me.

586
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,258
And I deserve someone who does.

587
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,898
That's what I said!
You don't listen to her.

588
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,359
You didn't say that.

589
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,277
Yes, I did.

590
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,696
Well, I wasn't listening then.

591
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,408
But you found a way
to fix things, right?

592
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,534
That's why you were happy
when you read her laptop.

593
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,037
I did.

594
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,123
At least I thought I did.

595
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,793
She recently got
the thin envelope

596
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,129
from her first choice preschool.

597
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,799
But it turns out, it was
her fake first choice

598
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,068
because she was
convinced she couldn't

599
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,760
get her kid into
her actual first choice

600
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:55,723
without a substantial donation
or an inside connection.

601
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,226
If it's Brye Park,
I'm afraid she's right.

602
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,645
Wait, that's our school.

603
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,314
What other school
would he be talking about?

604
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,316
Just finish the story.

605
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,486
You know, I gotta tell you,

606
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,488
there's bossy,
which can be sexy,

607
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,865
and then there's bitchy...

608
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,741
Finish the story.

609
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,832
You obviously know this
because you're on the school board,

610
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,167
which puts you on the inside

611
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,628
and being the CEO here
obviously connects you to Cuddy.

612
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,965
Well, if we're so connected,
why isn't she the one asking?

613
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,384
Because she thinks it's wrong

614
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,470
to use connections to
cut in line. I don't.

615
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,766
I might be able to help.

616
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,059
Fantastic.

617
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,604
But I could use a favor as well.

618
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,355
Where are you?

619
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,499
I needed to take care
of something.

620
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,566
It's not a foreign body.

621
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,692
You must've missed it.

622
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,985
If we do any more imaging,

623
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,172
we're gonna have to add
radiation poisoning to the DDX.

624
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,947
I meant the sarcoidosis.

625
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,533
The biopsy and c-ANCA
were both negative.

626
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,802
We're gonna have to
do a pneumonectomy.

627
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,453
No sign of drug
or alcohol abuse.

628
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:02,415
He's not a smoker, coal miner
or a potter. It's sarcoidosis.

629
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,459
Start him on corticosteroids
and methotrexate.

630
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,961
If it's a drug resistant bug
and we give him steroids...

631
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,048
He'll die, which from the sound of
it, wouldn't be much worse than...

632
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,885
You moron.

633
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,154
But you have to show him
your ID and your insurance stuff.

634
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,822
You can't just
give him a fake name.

635
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,075
You don't have to do anything.

636
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,661
Last time I checked,
this was still America.

637
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,913
'Course that was 10 years ago.

638
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,706
But you're gonna pay him, right?

639
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,999
I mean, it was your fault.

640
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,920
A yellow light
does not mean stop.

641
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,005
At the most, 20% my fault.

642
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,466
Since the insurance
companies automatically

643
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,095
put 100% of the fault
on the rear-ender,

644
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,806
my little lie was
actually an effort

645
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,183
to achieve an outcome
closer to the truth.

646
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,312
And it would've worked, too,

647
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,190
if it weren't for
those meddling kids.

648
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,526
I am Dr. Hourani.

649
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,195
Then why did you say the
other doctor was Hourani?

650
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,365
It's a common name.

651
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:21,035
It's like Smith in Lebanon.

652
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,537
Let me see your ID.

653
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,014
I told you. I left it
in my other pants.

654
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,557
Really? "Cause it looks
like it's still in this pair.

655
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,666
Get your hands off me.

656
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,917
Give me your ID.
Hey!

657
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,270
Will you stop...
Give me your ID.

658
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,712
Gentlemen, please.

659
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,922
- Kids, stay calm.
- Give me your ID!

660
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,925
Stop! Stop this right
now! Stay in your seats.

661
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,052
Stay calm, you guys.
Stay in your seats.

662
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,264
Gentlemen, please, this
is not the time or place.

663
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,186
Is there a problem
in here, Ms. Corwin?

664
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,159
Why don't you just take off?

665
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,828
It's not like the principal
can call your parents.

666
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,956
No, but the principal
can call the police.

667
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,250
Or the guy he's
doing the favor for.

668
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,003
His girlfriend's
obviously gonna find out.

669
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,338
He's screwed.

670
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,006
I'd bolt.
No, you wouldn't.

671
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,632
Yeah, I would.

672
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,093
No, you wouldn't.

673
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,972
How do you know?

674
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,777
What's wrong?

675
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,989
I guess... I don't
wanna do it like this.

676
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,576
Sorry for shooting
the puck so hard

677
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,037
and tricking you in the bet.

678
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,538
You didn't trick me.

679
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,664
Yeah, I did.

680
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,335
I gave Madison a Red
Dead Revolver cheat code

681
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,045
so she'd hit your foot
with the rope.

682
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,425
I knew you couldn't beat me.

683
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,802
You're right.
It's just...

684
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:06,307
I really like you and I'm
pretty sure you like me, too,

685
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,060
but I don't want to
play any more games.

686
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,482
When you want... I
mean, if you ever want to,

687
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,237
just tell me you're
ready, and, you know...

688
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,155
Sorry.

689
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,419
Well done.

690
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,423
He's not always a jerk.

691
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,843
And neither are you.

692
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,262
She obviously likes you.

693
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,723
Just stop using her toothbrush
and stop playing games.

694
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,018
She'll still like you.

695
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,191
She's bossy,
but she's usually right.

696
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,417
Thank you. FIELDS: Dr. House,
can I ask you a question?

697
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,086
Are you insane or just stupid?

698
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,215
Is there a third option?

699
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,469
Actually,
I don't think there is.

700
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,058
I'm sorry,
I just wasn't thinking.

701
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,770
I mean, I was,
but only about myself.

702
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,398
That's apparently the way I am.

703
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,610
Usually. Not always.

704
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,572
I need to
convince someone of that.

705
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,034
And you think you can do
that by getting someone to

706
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,412
pull strings to get her
daughter into our preschool?

707
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,290
I spoke to Sanford Wells.

708
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,131
You can call the police, you can
turn me in for lying at the accident.

709
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,051
I'm sure Mr. Dryden has
already taken care of that.

710
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,262
Let her daughter in.

711
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,057
She's a great kid and
Dr. Cuddy's a great mom.

712
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,476
They'll fit in perfectly here.

713
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,565
And how exactly does admitting her
daughter prove how unselfish you are?

714
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,443
Seems like you're still
doing it to help yourself,

715
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,778
not anyone else.

716
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,573
I don't know.

717
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,285
I just know that
I need to do something.

718
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,122
I need her in my life.

719
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,294
You know what it's like
to actually need someone?

720
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,092
Yes.

721
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,721
I do.

722
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,475
But I also know what it's
like to have responsibilities.

723
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,104
Maybe it's time you grew up.

724
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,200
Dr. House? Is there
anything you'd like to say?

725
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,786
Can I be excused?

726
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,004
It's just food.

727
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,591
Something small enough
to go down the wrong pipe,

728
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,968
but too big to be washed out
by the bronchial lavage.

729
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,846
Wouldn't show up on a CT.

730
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:36,225
But would cause the COPD and wouldn't
respond to steroids or antibiotics.

731
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,104
Prep him for exploratory
surgery and start the betting.

732
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,397
Betting?

733
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,733
I got 100 bucks
that says it's a pea.

734
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,368
I'm busy.

735
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,495
I know.

736
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,004
I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

737
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,551
Shouldn't you be saying
that to Sanford Wells?

738
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,723
A fifth grade career day? You
really thought you could pull that off?

739
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,227
I figured, how hard could it be?

740
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,274
And I wanted to prove to you

741
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,694
that I do care about your needs.

742
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,280
And Rachel's.

743
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,949
I do.

744
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,413
Is that why you
also stole my computer?

745
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,248
Yes, it is.

746
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,708
And then threw it in the trash?

747
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,753
I did not throw it, I placed it,

748
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,397
knowing that
the janitor would find it,

749
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,675
and know it was yours, and
return it to you unharmed.

750
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,301
I'm a moron.

751
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,055
But that doesn't mean I don't care
about you, I don't think about you,

752
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,058
I don't want you to be happy.

753
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,688
I was wrong, you were
right. I can do better.

754
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,065
Just give me a chance.

755
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:15,116
What were you? An
astronaut or a bull fighter?

756
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,620
I was myself.

757
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,288
For the most part.

758
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,798
I know you're still upset,

759
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,722
so I'll leave you to deal
with it however you want.

760
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,558
House.

761
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,316
You want to come over
for dinner tonight?

762
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,485
I'd love to.
