1
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,457
Move it. Faster.
Parks, quit slacking.

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,583
I'm not slacking.
I can't.

3
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,019
How dare you talk to
your drill instructor?

4
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,044
Sir, I'm not slacking.

5
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,754
You stand up and you
look me in the eye.

6
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,088
I feel lousy.
I can't...

7
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,716
"Can't" doesn't exist here.

8
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,361
Now you finish this course or
you're in isolation the rest of the day.

9
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,720
You hear me?

10
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,723
MacDonald, you ready to
make Parks eat your dust?

11
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,764
Sir, yes, sir.

12
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,266
Ready? Go!

13
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,229
Are your ears malfunctioning?
I said go.

14
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,481
Go! Go!

15
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,691
Get down! Get down!

16
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,486
Belly down. Belly down.

17
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,612
Move it!

18
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,323
Get up over there.
Grab those bars.

19
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:18,495
Move ahead. You grab
them bars. Faster. Move it!

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,165
Move it. Knees up.
Knees up! Move it!

21
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,418
Grab the wall! Hit
that wall! Hit that wall!

22
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,963
Move it.
Get up over there.

23
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,217
Keep it going. Don't you
fall on me. Faster! Move it.

24
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,225
What's the matter, Parks?
You got a boo-boo?

25
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,436
Sir, I'm bleeding, sir.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,522
Is your life in
immediate danger? No.

27
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,607
Then you get your
ass up over that wall.

28
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,904
I said get your ass over that...

29
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,283
What's going on?

30
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,077
My back hurts.
I can't move.

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,832
Help. Help!
I can't get up.

32
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,003
"Can't" doesn't exist here.

33
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,317
We should not be
looking at this.

34
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,760
He sent out an alert.
It'd be rude not to look.

35
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,803
Though I am straining my eyes.

36
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,180
What are we checking out?

37
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,098
Your profile page.

38
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,975
Why? I haven't...

39
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,313
That is not me.

40
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,273
That is you.

41
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,109
That's me, but that is not.

42
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,654
Whoever did this made it
smaller. Much, much smaller.

43
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,074
Whoever did this has
a bone to pick with you.

44
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,241
Ironic, since your bone...

45
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,160
Is not in that picture.

46
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,971
My proof is right here.
You really want to see?

47
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,872
Whoa, convinced.

48
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,833
You have any idea who did this?

49
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,021
I don't even know where
the original picture is from.

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,381
Bathroom at the Carleton Hotel.

51
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,466
Towel, hotel logo's reversed.

52
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,635
Shot must've been
taken in the mirror.

53
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,637
We were there for
Sanford Wells' wedding.

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,097
That must narrow it down.

55
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,391
He slept with three women there.

56
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,226
Ah, you're a whore.

57
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,778
38-year-old former Marine.
Came to the ER with back pain,

58
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,823
now his bladder aches as much
as his back 'cause he can't empty it.

59
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,926
What are we
looking at this morning?

60
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,869
Upskirt celebrity,
endearingly funny cat?

61
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,164
Another study about gays
being better parents.

62
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,768
We were lured in by
the word "lesbian."

63
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,544
Has he taken any
antihistamines or anticholinergics?

64
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,255
Nope, and the ER ruled
out enlarged prostate,

65
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,340
stuffed colon and spinal injury.

66
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,844
Military history. In suspiciously
good shape for his age,

67
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,388
makes a living bullying kids.

68
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,057
I'm thinking steroids.

69
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,434
Fascinating.

70
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,853
Thanks. We can
wean him off...

71
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,063
Steroids isn't fascinating,
it's moronic.

72
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,023
There's no other sign
of hormonal imbalance.

73
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,152
What's fascinating is that you
equate discipline with bullying.

74
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,712
Which means that
your parents either

75
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,256
disciplined you too
much or too little.

76
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,406
I'm guessing too little.

77
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,368
It's hardly surprising you agree
with our patient's philosophy.

78
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,120
You run your department
like a boot camp,

79
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,373
as if cruelty
ensures performance.

80
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,341
Is this where I'm supposed
to disagree with you?

81
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,798
Diagnosis of urinary
retention depends on

82
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,151
the particular mechanical cause.

83
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,153
We need to know if there's
a blockage in the urethra

84
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,304
versus a nerve or a muscle
problem with the bladder.

85
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,931
Fascinating without misdirect.

86
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,185
Cath him, and see what's
stopping him from emptying his bilge.

87
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,895
Oh, not you, Chase.

88
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,897
Sending Captain
Micropenis to deal

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,773
with what's probably
normal-sized equipment?

90
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,567
That's too cruel even for me.

91
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,039
Good morning.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,961
And what brings the
lesser Cuddy to these parts?

93
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,173
Pediatrician appointment
for an S-H-O-T.

94
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,177
Waldenwood insists vaccination
reports go in with the application.

95
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,720
Honey, finish your oatmeal.

96
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,556
Waldenwood. Is that
by any chance a boarding school?

97
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,225
Or a work camp?

98
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,019
It's our first choice preschool.

99
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,897
Blocks made of gold? Kids
don't have to pick their own noses?

100
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,358
Great facilities and teachers,

101
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,610
and they're known
for their gifted program.

102
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,822
You sure that's the
right place for her?

103
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,659
Sounds a little snobby.

104
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,454
I've done my research,
we've visited. It's a perfect fit.

105
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,712
You feel pressure,

106
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,924
we need you to tell us when the
urge to void becomes unbearable.

107
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,843
Sorry, can't make you feel
better till we make you feel worse.

108
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,055
I get it.
Goes for what I do, too.

109
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,933
We cause pain when
it's the only option.

110
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,436
The kids I work with at the camp
are there because a judge sent them.

111
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,480
I can't teach them
good behaviors

112
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,250
without first getting
rid of all their bad ones.

113
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,693
That's not gonna happen
unless I push them.

114
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,572
I don't see why metaphorical
pushing has to involve actual pushing.

115
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,367
I may work these kids hard,
but I never hit them.

116
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,970
You march them into the ground
instead of knocking them there.

117
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,787
Yeah, well, it beats
the alternatives

118
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,623
which is ending up in
jail or a gang, or a coffin.

119
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,417
How often do you pull that off?

120
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,960
Two-thirds never re-offend.

121
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,628
It's better numbers than juvie.

122
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,301
She's brilliant,
but new to the real world.

123
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,969
Yeah.

124
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,013
Doc, I gotta go.

125
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,264
Let's empty you out.

126
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,350
Take the urine to Taub.
Have him screen it for bacteria.

127
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,560
I'll analyze this data.

128
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,275
A half-hour on the phone, no go.

129
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,753
Website won't take
down the picture.

130
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,405
I thought their policy
doesn't allow nude photos.

131
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,075
Now tap the tube gently against
the table to re-suspend the cells.

132
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:36,289
They don't, but technically,
I'm no longer nude.

133
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,501
Maybe you should
shut down your account.

134
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,503
I tried but whoever did
this changed my password

135
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,939
so I can't even
prove it's my page.

136
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,008
There's a clue, she's
got serious tech skills.

137
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,385
My password
was "password."

138
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,639
You're a dumb whore.

139
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,099
Do any of the three seem
like a more likely suspect?

140
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,934
Maybe one was clingier.

141
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,603
I can't even
remember their names.

142
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,064
Listen, this is
a tough time for me,

143
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,650
breaking up with Rachel,
moving into a hotel.

144
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,278
I want you to know how much your
humiliation has eased my burden.

145
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,120
Urine is clean for bacteria.

146
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,122
Not surprising, since
his bladder test showed

147
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,391
that his peeing
problem is really

148
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,875
a nerve problem,
neurogenic bladder.

149
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,127
Could mean spinal cord
tumor, cerebral palsy.

150
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,438
House is gonna go
right for syphilis.

151
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,588
How can you be so sure?

152
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,674
Rare complication of
an embarrassing illness,

153
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,175
practically a House special.

154
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,748
I want to get ahead. Let's
go test his blood for syphilis.

155
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,406
Okay, I'm gonna take some blood.

156
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,474
This will only hurt
for a second. Ready?

157
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,145
Stop it. Stop trying
to kill me.

158
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,647
Hey, let her go.

159
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,816
You're trying to
kill me. Let her go.

160
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,651
Security.
Need some help in here.

161
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,986
Let me go!
Let me go!

162
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,331
She's fine. How about we
get back to someone who isn't?

163
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,375
The patient's in
restraints and on Haldol,

164
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,519
which seems to
have made him lucid.

165
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,255
Differential diagnosis, back pain,
neurogenic bladder, psychosis.

166
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,340
A symptom which we learned
about when he choked me.

167
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,509
Hate to slow us down
by acknowledging it.

168
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,802
And yet you have.

169
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,388
Tertiary syphilis fits.

170
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,556
Test came back negative.

171
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,683
Several meds could
cause those symptoms.

172
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,060
Tricyclic antidepressants,
Ritalin.

173
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,980
Also other native plants,
wormwood, jimsonweed...

174
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,291
With the amount of jimsonweed
or Ritalin you'd have to ingest,

175
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,459
seems like he would've
mentioned it.

176
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,026
Unless he didn't know about it.

177
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,071
Maybe one of those
kids at the camp

178
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,240
got tired of Driscoll's
lessons and poisoned him.

179
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,788
Go to the camp,
check for potential poisons.

180
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,709
I all but ignored your assault,

181
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,878
showed you no
compassion whatsoever,

182
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,629
and you came up
with a good idea.

183
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,007
Score one for tough love.

184
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,098
Glad to hear you met someone
you liked. Weddings are good for that.

185
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,600
I was hoping to get in touch.

186
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,894
Thing is, I'm a bit
fuzzy on names.

187
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
Sorry, open bar.

188
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,356
She was sitting at
Dr. Simpson's table,

189
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,942
brunette, purple dress, low-cut.

190
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,903
That's my niece, Winn Phillips.

191
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,155
Your niece?

192
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,783
Fantastic.

193
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,368
Her info is in your e-mail.

194
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:26,584
Also, there was a blonde,
green dress.

195
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,087
You want me to hook
you up with two women?

196
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,423
Actually, three.

197
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,222
How do you cheat on a test
when there's no test?

198
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,974
Sorry, not playing.

199
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,685
Go away, House.

200
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,981
I'm not giving you
advice just so you can

201
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,151
distort it to suit your
own warped world view.

202
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,445
But it's been working so well.

203
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,864
Cuddy wants to get Rachel
into Waldenwood Preschool.

204
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,617
Problem is Rachel's dumber
than a paste sandwich.

205
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,912
And her not getting in bothers
you. You care about Rachel.

206
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,539
That was not advice.

207
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,165
Cuddy cares about her,

208
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,293
which means when Rachel
gets rejected, Cuddy will be upset.

209
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,896
Then, as the boyfriend,
I will be expected

210
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,214
to be supportive and consoling.

211
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,550
Not your strengths, I grant you.

212
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,594
Leave it alone. It's just
a play date. It'll be fine.

213
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,388
"Play date" being their code for

214
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,431
"way to weed out
the paste sandwiches."

215
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,392
They'll hand her puzzles
and counting games

216
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,687
and Rachel will just sit
there and eat the pieces.

217
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,818
Crap! Crap.
I'm such a sucker.

218
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,945
Thanks for the advice.

219
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,572
That's the isolation area.

220
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,701
Kids that behave badly go
there, sometimes 23 hours a day.

221
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,703
Sounds like a pretty
good incentive to behave.

222
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,540
They're treating the symptom
instead of the disease.

223
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,001
Basic systems theory,

224
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,753
troubled kids are produced
by troubled families.

225
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,940
This place doesn't even attempt
to change the environment

226
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,300
that damaged them
in the first place.

227
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,094
So there are no bad
kids, only bad parents?

228
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,804
Then why is my
brother an ex-con?

229
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,934
Treating kids decently
doesn't mean identically.

230
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,979
Some kids need more
structure or discipline.

231
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,275
Nobody needs this place.

232
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,279
Maybe we're
coming at this wrong.

233
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,198
We find the poisoner, let
them point us toward the poison.

234
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,868
Driscoll's got 24
kids in his troop.

235
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,369
You want to interview
all of them?

236
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,496
Maybe we don't need to.

237
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,500
Driscoll sent me to isolation all the
time. Doesn't mean I poisoned him.

238
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,628
He's the psycho, not me.

239
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,963
Tell him.

240
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,341
DI Driscoll's way harder
on him than the rest of us.

241
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,760
Maybe because he's
a bigger pain in the ass.

242
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,262
What are you in here for?
Shoplifting.

243
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,264
You ready to upgrade
to second-degree murder?

244
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,974
Spend 10 years in jail?

245
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,810
If he dies because of whatever
you gave him, that's what'll happen.

246
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,063
That supposed to scare me?

247
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,190
My mom's dead, my
dad's never been around,

248
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,209
and after this I'll get
bounced to another foster hole.

249
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,194
My future's not exactly bright.

250
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,714
Prison, now or later, doesn't make
that much of a difference to me.

251
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,699
Dude, I'm not mopping
the whole floor by myself.

252
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,995
Your eyes are red.

253
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,581
Might be an allergic reaction
to the cleaning solution.

254
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,041
It's just my allergies.

255
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,324
Do you take anything for them?

256
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,294
Not right now.

257
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,838
Why not?

258
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,724
These IV fluids will
help flush the drugs out of your system.

259
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,434
You know which of
the kids dosed me?

260
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,146
It's not medically relevant.

261
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,943
Look, I'm not gonna hurt him,
but I get why you're scared of me.

262
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,047
I'm real sorry
about this morning.

263
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,156
No apology necessary.

264
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,076
You're ill, you didn't
know what you were doing.

265
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,497
I used to be a real screw-up.

266
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,584
The military taught me that
actions always have consequences,

267
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,713
part of being a man
is accepting them.

268
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,802
After all the times I've said that
to the kids, apology is necessary.

269
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,975
Are you okay?

270
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,727
No, my heart's kind of racing.

271
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,228
I got it.

272
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,401
Heart rate is 170, PAT
until proven otherwise.

273
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,924
We got to slow it down. Six
milligrams of adenosine, IV bolus.

274
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,989
Tell the nurse to get in
here with the crash cart.

275
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,079
Pushing fluid sent his
heart into overdrive.

276
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,498
It took three doses of
adenosine to get it under control.

277
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,062
Treating him for antihistamine
toxicity revealed a new symptom.

278
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,104
Which revealed
that he didn't have

279
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,130
antihistamine toxicity
in the first place.

280
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,132
House, where are you?
Playground.

281
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,552
Great place to meet chicks.
Their moms, too.

282
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,638
Tachycardia could be a
humoral effect, mastocytosis.

283
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,391
We'd see either GI
or cutaneous symptoms.

284
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,601
Pancreatic insulinoma...

285
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,144
Wouldn't cause bladder problems.

286
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,104
Unlike pheochromocytoma.

287
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,649
Well done, Chase.
Now turn off your phone.

288
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,026
You heard that?
It's on vibrate.

289
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,278
I'm assuming it's been
ringing almost non-stop

290
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,155
since you changed
your status update to,

291
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,908
"Nothing lights my
fire like a lady-of-size.

292
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,118
"Less than three bills,
don't bother calling."

293
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,661
Followed by your cell number.

294
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,711
No, no, no, you're right. This is
in no way clever and hysterical.

295
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,755
Before you start
rolling anyone in flour,

296
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,173
work the patient up for a pheo.

297
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,635
Adrenal and pituitary scans,
24-hour urine collection.

298
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,934
How soon after the admissions
session did the child get sick?

299
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,186
Kid barely got home
before she collapsed.

300
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,897
Her parents are a wreck,
desperate for answers.

301
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,857
Have you experienced
any symptoms?

302
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,984
Or does someone else
oversee these sessions?

303
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,779
The teachers supervise. No
one's mentioned feeling sick.

304
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,697
I'd love to call the
family, offer my support.

305
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,367
Sorry, I can't reveal names.

306
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,786
Doctor/patient confidentiality.

307
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,997
So this is where all the
admissions play dates happen?

308
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,517
She wouldn't have
been in another room?

309
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,917
This is where we have them all.

310
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,686
Maybe to be safe we
get rid of these toys and...

311
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,795
No, no, no.
Don't do that.

312
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,964
I'll tell you if
anything's toxic.

313
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,216
For now, you should
minimize your exposure.

314
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,734
I'm supposed to be supervised.

315
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,280
The scan is pre-programmed.
There's no risk to the patient.

316
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,907
You're literally gonna sit
here, watch the monitor

317
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,410
and chat with him
if he gets lonely.

318
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,495
Still...
Report me.

319
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,346
How are you doing in there?

320
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,142
You shouldn't bother
trying to protect Landon.

321
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,710
I know he's the one
who drugged me.

322
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,272
The antihistamines
aren't what got you sick.

323
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,691
Doesn't change
the fact that he did it.

324
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,865
I tried everything with that
kid, I just can't break through.

325
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,576
It's clear you care about him.

326
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,578
Have you tried telling him that?

327
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,722
You gotta understand something.

328
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,040
These kids,
they're all manipulators.

329
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,293
As much as I care about
all of them, I can't...

330
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,213
I can't show them that unless there's
some mutual respect, otherwise...

331
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,466
Forget those other kids.
Think about this kid.

332
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,303
He watched his mother
get sick and die,

333
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,972
he's never known his dad.

334
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,516
Who knows how long it's been
since anyone's taken care of him,

335
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,060
or if there's ever
been a man around

336
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,395
with any degree of consistency.

337
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,361
I believe that
you're on his side.

338
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm betting it
would help if he did.

339
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,832
You are a beautiful man.
Can I leave now?

340
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,876
I know where all
three women are,

341
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,920
but I'd like to avoid
the additional humiliation

342
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,797
of falsely accusing any of them.

343
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,510
You ID'd the hotel off this. Hoping
there's another clue in it somewhere.

344
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,721
We could enhance the image,

345
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:23,352
maybe her face is reflected in
that gleam off your butt cheek.

346
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,397
Or maybe it's time
to chalk this up

347
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,232
to the hazards
of being a player.

348
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,402
Your zipper problem
just blew up your marriage.

349
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,780
Don't move.

350
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,243
Unlike me, you've had the
decency not to cheat on anyone,

351
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,954
but you haven't been giving much
thought to who these women are,

352
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,372
how they might feel.

353
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,334
Obviously you hurt one of
them. Emotionally hurt her,

354
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,212
because physically,
how would you even know.

355
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,052
Looks like your
shorty is a shorty.

356
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,893
You're early,
dinner's not ready.

357
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,770
Oh.

358
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:11,483
Okay. Rachel and I
will go play in her room.

359
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,943
Really?

360
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,403
I'm hungry, go cook.

361
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,422
All right,
you little lump of clay.

362
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,763
Rachel? Rachel!

363
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,852
It's a new toy. What kid
doesn't like new toys?

364
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,938
A moron, that's who.

365
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:56,278
Okay, look at the pretty
colors. Now, what color is this?

366
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,951
Orange.

367
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,164
Yes, that is orange.
What color is this?

368
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,837
Okay, blocks going away.
Bye-bye, blocks.

369
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,215
Next time, reinforce the levees.

370
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,634
Bad corps of
army engineers, bad.

371
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,220
But what's this?

372
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,473
Rings.
Look at the rings.

373
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:29,228
Now the goal of this game is...

374
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,233
To not kill you.

375
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:42,157
Why are you here? Wait,
did you give me an STD?

376
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,910
No, I did not.
Don't deflect.

377
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,371
That picture was taken
by someone your height.

378
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,496
Just take it down.

379
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,998
What picture?

380
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,500
Fine.

381
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,378
Play it that way.

382
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,013
So...

383
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,059
You really like kittens, huh?

384
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,644
Yeah, you said you did, too.

385
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,481
No wonder you're pissed,
because that is not you.

386
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,066
And I didn't take it.

387
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,026
Did you mean my height
with heels or without?

388
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,447
You weren't wearing heels
when we were in that room, so...

389
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,574
Oh, yes, you were.

390
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:28,412
I started to take them off, and
then you asked me very nicely not to.

391
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,123
Why would I do this?

392
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,250
I'm not mad about
what happened with us,

393
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,378
or apparently with you and any
other women at that wedding.

394
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,256
Sorry, I guess
my forensic analysis

395
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,175
wasn't as advanced as I thought.

396
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:46,054
Wait. You know, you don't have
to rush off. I still have those heels.

397
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,728
Everywhere you looked,
gingham and stuffed animals.

398
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,396
How did you get out of there?

399
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,608
I didn't, right away.

400
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,694
Wasn't anything wrong
with her physically.

401
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,988
One down, two members
of a threesome to go.

402
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,490
You should flip
a condom to choose.

403
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,075
We checked his adrenal,
pituitary and thyroid glands,

404
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,329
monitored his
catecholamines. It's not a pheo.

405
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,998
We had to put him on a
diltiazem drip to regulate his heart.

406
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,459
Means he's running out of time.

407
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,419
Means you are, too.

408
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,798
Your campaign to soften him
up so he'll go easier on the kids,

409
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,468
all in a pointless attempt to
validate your own upbringing.

410
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,679
Another cardiac arrhythmia?

411
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,599
It's not our patient.
It's the ER.

412
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,812
That patient House admitted with
back pain and urinary retention?

413
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,565
How do you feel
about a matched set?

414
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,953
We need to track your common
exposures. What shampoo do you use?

415
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,663
Whatever crap the camp gives us.

416
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,289
Same here.

417
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,518
We need things exclusive to
you but not the rest of the camp.

418
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,045
Otherwise, a lot more people
would be sick. Toothpaste, deodorant?

419
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,130
Can't be deodorant
making him sick.

420
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,966
He doesn't wear any.
Smells like a...

421
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,091
Parks, shut your mouth.

422
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,277
You're not my
drill instructor here, okay?

423
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,901
Doesn't mean you get
to be disrespectful.

424
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,139
I can do whatever the hell I
want. You're not in charge.

425
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,808
There's gotta be a link.

426
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,352
Diet, sexual history,
drug abuse.

427
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,853
No, and believe me, I asked.

428
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,730
Those were some
fun conversations.

429
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,982
Did you believe the answers?

430
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,227
I know the answer to that
is always supposed to be no,

431
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,318
but I did.

432
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,363
Not like the kid has had much
unsupervised time lately.

433
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,283
Delivery for
a Dr. Robert Chase.

434
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,367
That's me.

435
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,535
Camp is in the woods.

436
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,304
There are tons of
opportunities for infection

437
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,746
that not every
person will pick up.

438
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,125
Legionellosis from water,
toxoplasmosis from dirt,

439
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,418
brucellosis from animals.

440
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,670
Too bad none of those
explain his symptoms.

441
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,339
Casey and Sanford Wells thank me

442
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,176
for my extraordinarily generous
donation to their wedding charity.

443
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,261
Aw!

444
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,598
Oh, God. She must have
gotten access to my credit card.

445
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,682
Nocardia fits.

446
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,059
The bacteria lives in the
dirt. They both spent plenty...

447
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,395
Nocardia starts in the
lungs, not the bladder.

448
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,564
How generous is
extraordinarily generous?

449
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,400
Call the charity, explain
the donation's a fraud.

450
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,152
And take back
Wells' wedding gift?

451
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,613
You are extraordinarily screwed.

452
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,657
Bushes can make a happy hunting
ground for ticks. Lyme disease.

453
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,535
Neither of our patients
have a rash or a tick bite.

454
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,705
40% of Lyme patients don't
develop a rash. Bite is easy to miss.

455
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,416
Start them on
doxycycline for Lyme.

456
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,376
$2,500!

457
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,840
Cancel your credit card,
find that girl and marry her.

458
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,483
Go back, that was Jersey Shore.

459
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,901
I'm not watching that crap.

460
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,572
No, let him be your guinea pig.

461
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,537
You can dose me after
you're sure you're right.

462
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,118
The side effects
are fairly limited,

463
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,828
and it would be
better to treat you

464
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,872
before you develop
any more symptoms.

465
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,040
I want to wait.

466
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,961
I'm not your drill instructor,

467
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,464
I'm not trying to break you.

468
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,217
My only job is to
make you better.

469
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:15,013
I truly believe this
medicine is our best shot.

470
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,308
But whether or not you
take it is up to you.

471
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,111
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

472
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,447
Another pillow would
be cool, if you don't mind.

473
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,501
Hey.

474
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,423
Your turn to pick.

475
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,307
Ready, set, feed the monkey.

476
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,269
This isn't weird at all.

477
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,273
She's got the fine motor
skills of the Hulk in oven mitts.

478
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,610
Do you want a doodle?
Do you? Feed the monkey.

479
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,825
Cuddy puts her to bed at 7:30,
which cuts way into our training time.

480
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,161
Her play date's on Friday.

481
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,082
What is that?

482
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,500
Dog training clicker.

483
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,627
Gives immediate
positive reinforcement,

484
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,151
bridging the precious
seconds between

485
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,590
the desired behavior
and treat delivery.

486
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,384
House, she's not a dog.

487
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,512
That really seems to be working.

488
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,055
Does Cuddy know
that Rachel's here,

489
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,783
and that you're turning
her into a schnauzer?

490
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,768
I told Maria that Rachel
and I are working on

491
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,270
a secret art project for Mommy.

492
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,938
Which means that
some paede's patient

493
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,774
is about to be
short one art project.

494
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
The sacrifices we make
for our children's education.

495
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,697
Who's a good girl?
Who's a good girl?

496
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,411
It had to be you. I gave you
my credit card to pay for drinks.

497
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,706
And I gave it back. I didn't
take the picture, now go away.

498
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,083
Forgive me if I'm not convinced.

499
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,352
You're obviously pissed at me.

500
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,670
Because I thought we
totally had a connection.

501
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,565
And then when you didn't
ask me for my number...

502
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,257
A connection?

503
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,759
It was a threesome.

504
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,484
Yeah, but you were obviously
more into me than you were into Nika.

505
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,639
Kenzie, honey.
You have a phone call.

506
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,890
Just a minute, Dad.

507
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,685
I didn't want to say anything in
front of her, but you could have.

508
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,979
You live with your parents?

509
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,606
Just until graduation.

510
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,399
College?

511
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,777
How old are you?

512
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,861
Eighteen.

513
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,905
Next month.

514
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,950
Relax, it's not
illegal or anything.

515
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,618
Look, I just need this to stop.

516
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,871
Would you give it up,
already? I told you it's not me.

517
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,749
My parents won't even let
me on social networking sites.

518
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,417
Too many sexual predators.

519
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,803
Stop him!

520
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,223
Hey. Hey.
Where are you going?

521
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,809
Hey. You're sick, you
need to be in a hospital.

522
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,412
There's a million hospitals. Ones
that won't send me back to that camp.

523
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,563
Landon, what's going on?

524
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,773
Please help me,
don't send me back.

525
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,818
Those are my car keys. You
stole them out of my pocket?

526
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,528
"No bad kids," huh?

527
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,323
Did you stop Landon?

528
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,408
Yeah. Yeah. What's wrong?

529
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,995
My legs, they hurt.
Muscles are in a vise.

530
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
What does it mean?

531
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,205
Not sure yet.

532
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,832
10 Diazepam, 40 potassium.

533
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,509
The leg pain was caused by a
muscle cramp from low sodium,

534
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,261
which was caused by
kidney dysfunction.

535
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,473
Landon didn't respond to doxycycline
either. I think we can rule out Lyme.

536
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,159
I thought I was
getting through to him,

537
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,743
but he just wanted
to steal my car keys.

538
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,022
If only his previous behavior had
given you a reason to expect that.

539
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,941
Why are you putting
hot sauce on a toy?

540
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,194
Maybe you don't care if
children chew on your caterpillar.

541
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,446
I think it's wrong.

542
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,824
What causes kidney dysfunction
on top of everything else?

543
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,492
Arsenic poisoning.

544
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,037
And people do change.

545
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,289
Driscoll took it to
heart when I asked him

546
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,250
to think about Landon's history.

547
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,710
He was much nicer and then...

548
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,713
Wow, two ideas that
don't make any sense.

549
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,840
If it was arsenic, they'd
be puking and pooping.

550
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,885
And conversations
with moralizing strangers

551
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,137
do not make people
change their behavior.

552
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,646
Rachel is not gonna
do that more than once.

553
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,817
Whipple's could affect
the brain, kidneys, heart.

554
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,486
Not without GI involvement.

555
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,820
Why is it impossible to believe

556
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,281
I made a compelling
argument and he...

557
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,575
If he changed,
it's because something

558
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,911
besides you made that
argument compelling.

559
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,207
Compromised kidneys secondary to
bladder issues points to botulism toxin,

560
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,375
which lives in soil.

561
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,126
Got into the kid's bloodstream

562
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,544
through the cut on his forehead,

563
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,813
got into the drill instructor's

564
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,381
through some
abrasions on his feet.

565
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,053
Good idea. Give
them both the antitoxin.

566
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,063
I saw my chance to get
out of here. I had to take it.

567
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,899
Don't make excuses.
You tried to steal from me.

568
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,210
All these kids are manipulators.

569
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,819
You can't let your guard down.

570
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,570
What do you mean
"all these kids"?

571
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,382
Don't lump me in with
the losers at that camp.

572
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,242
Seems like you belong there.
It may be your only chance.

573
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,412
Look, I've screwed up but I've
never been in trouble with the law.

574
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,415
You said you were
in for shoplifting.

575
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,893
The store owner caught me
trying to boost some chips and stuff,

576
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,711
called my DCS caseworker.

577
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,044
I thought all the kids were
there under court order.

578
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,674
That's usually how it works.

579
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,426
So why is he different?

580
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,351
Why would I take
a naked picture of you?

581
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,271
You're cute, but you're not
that cute. Now please, go.

582
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,523
You're the only one left.
You're pissed off.

583
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,084
I'm pissed off because
you're in my apartment,

584
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,776
and my boyfriend might
be here any minute.

585
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,279
Boyfriend.

586
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,924
The last thing I want to do is
publicize that I cheated on him,

587
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,033
so why would I prank you?

588
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,785
And where was this
boyfriend at the wedding?

589
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,495
Out of town.

590
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,621
Conveniently.

591
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,710
It's from my sister's
birthday last month.

592
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,380
And before you suggest he's my
brother, note how I'm kissing him.

593
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,050
You used me, I used you.
It was a mistake.

594
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,885
Now I just want
to forget about it.

595
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,478
I just got off the phone
with Landon's DCS caseworker.

596
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,440
You were right. I'm not what
made my argument compelling.

597
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,826
Where are we going?

598
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,330
To give your bladder an antibiotic
wash to protect against infection.

599
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,758
Who are you?

600
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,426
I'm Dr. House.

601
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,680
And that boy is the
spitting image of his mother.

602
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,725
Of course I've never seen her.

603
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,520
But his care worker
told my lackey

604
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,939
that you paid his
enrollment fee at the camp.

605
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,859
Now that could mean
that you're a family friend,

606
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,028
but then why hide it?

607
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,698
The only person
who'd want to hide it

608
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:36,204
is his deadbeat dad who's decided
not to be a deadbeat anymore.

609
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,545
Please don't tell him.

610
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,471
We spend days looking
for a link between them.

611
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,890
He doesn't tell us
the kid is his son.

612
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,017
We were looking for exposures.

613
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,741
He didn't think it was
medically relevant.

614
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,872
Soon he won't have to
worry about his kid finding out.

615
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,732
Being dead makes
keeping secrets much easier.

616
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,901
Neither one is responding
to botulism treatment.

617
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,426
And the boy started
having seizures.

618
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,113
And Driscoll
might have been right that

619
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,882
their biological
relationship doesn't matter.

620
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,968
Genetic illness emerges
when people are the same age,

621
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,243
not during the same week.

622
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,494
Unless there's a trigger.

623
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,181
Genetic conditions can be set
off by things in the surroundings,

624
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,416
and these two obviously
have shared surroundings.

625
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,501
That's a relatively
rare phenomenon,

626
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,836
which is our specialty, I know.

627
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,256
Our patients are related.
That can't be a coincidence.

628
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,178
I just had an idea.

629
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,514
Relevant to our case?

630
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,601
Sit.

631
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,938
Wegener's can be brought on
by exposure to heavy metals.

632
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,082
You see anything at the camp?

633
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,526
Near the isolation hut, there
were some old generator batteries.

634
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,028
Could've leaked into the soil.

635
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,114
Seems like someone else at the
camp would've had lead poisoning.

636
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,365
You got anything better?

637
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,370
Treat with cyclophospamide.

638
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,289
Go find your bliss.

639
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,128
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a play date.

640
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,890
Why didn't you
step forward when his mom died?

641
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,061
I found out she'd
passed months later.

642
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,650
By then, Landon was
already in the foster system.

643
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,489
I was figuring out a way to
approach him when he got into trouble,

644
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,242
so I brought him to the camp.

645
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,994
You need to tell him.

646
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,164
I can't. Not now.

647
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,584
If I die, the only thing
I'll ever be to him

648
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,087
is the hard-ass who made
him run obstacle courses.

649
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,425
You apologized to me for
something done in a psychotic state,

650
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,469
but you won't own up
to being his father.

651
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,932
What happened to actions have
consequences, a man accepts them?

652
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,393
I'm in his life,
and I am working

653
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,436
to get him on the right path.

654
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,440
He doesn't need
a drill instructor.

655
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,987
He needs a dad.

656
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,537
It's so sweet of you,
coming to this.

657
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,622
Just trying to be supportive.

658
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,125
I heard that's
what boyfriends do.

659
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,380
Hi, honey.
Hi. Did you have fun?

660
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,132
Yeah?

661
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,305
Rachel had a great time,
played with everything.

662
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,307
She's a very clever girl.

663
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,520
I'm sorry to ask this,

664
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,898
but we've had some problems
with parents coaching kids.

665
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,568
Rachel caught on to our
toys unusually quickly,

666
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,904
and she even knew the game
was called Feed the Monkey.

667
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,492
Well, as eager as I am
to have her go here,

668
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,494
I promise you,
I would never do that.

669
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,334
Hey, Rachel, have you ever
played Feed the Monkey before?

670
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,881
No, Mama.

671
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,596
She seems so dumb.

672
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:27,685
But when the pressure was on, she
knew what had to be done and she did it.

673
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,271
You're pumped
because your kid lied?

674
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,524
She's not my kid.
She's a pain in the ass.

675
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,904
And she's a better
liar than you are.

676
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,366
You didn't cut your leg
getting into your truck.

677
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,284
The abrasion has
dirt and gravel in it,

678
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,079
a bit of fertilizer, too.

679
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,581
I tripped in my greenhouse.

680
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,375
Growing my own organic veggies.

681
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,627
Didn't ask, not gonna tell.

682
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,422
She didn't hesitate.
She didn't oversell.

683
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:01,636
Took me years to learn how to lie
like that. Rachel has it on instinct.

684
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,763
Sounds like you're
real fond of that kid.

685
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,225
You're really not good
with nuance, are you?

686
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,143
I admire her talent.

687
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,896
I'm just gonna numb you up.

688
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,570
I gotta go.

689
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,954
Latest kidney function test
shows no improvement.

690
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,082
Nice stitches.
Did they hurt?

691
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,167
No, they gave me
a shot of something.

692
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,169
That was Lidocaine.

693
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:39,132
It triggered an underlying genetic
condition called variegate porphyria.

694
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,968
That would explain
their symptoms.

695
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,761
But I didn't have any Lidocaine.

696
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,555
But you had a handful
of antihistamines,

697
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,640
courtesy of the deviant
in the next bed.

698
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,809
It's also a porphyria trigger.

699
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:54,355
Wait. So we have
the same genetic thing?

700
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,608
Yeah. Small world.

701
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,530
This is good news. We
can manage the condition with haematin.

702
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,782
Liver transplant could cure it.

703
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,123
Sometimes two patients
share one donated liver.

704
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,877
Would that work for us?

705
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,587
Possibly.

706
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,423
We'd have to test your blood,
tissue type, if they match.

707
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,716
Why would they?

708
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,610
Just because we have the
same thing making us sick...

709
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,927
Also...

710
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,601
I'm your father.

711
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,239
I don't believe you.

712
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,243
What, you don't think a
white guy can be a bad father?

713
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,953
Happy to check your DNA,

714
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,456
but do you really think he'd
say he's your dad if he isn't?

715
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,583
It's not like you're a catch.

716
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,178
You're evil.

717
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,434
Barely recognize you
with your clothes on.

718
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,188
You were at the
wedding with your sister.

719
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,690
Shared a room with her, too.

720
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,946
I came by to change my shoes
and found you in my bathroom.

721
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,406
Took you long enough to find me.

722
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,992
Because when someone starts
pranking you, the logical suspect

723
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,619
is the overly protective sister

724
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,037
of a woman you slept with once.

725
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,790
This has nothing
to do with my sister.

726
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,416
Then what does it
have to do with?

727
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,090
If you really have no clue,
then you so deserved this.

728
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,927
All that creativity and energy
you put into pranking me,

729
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,155
seems like you were
trying to make a point.

730
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,974
You really don't want
to tell me what it was?

731
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,228
You're a really big fan
of John Hughes movies.

732
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,565
You inexplicably prefer Some
Kind of Wonderful to Sixteen Candles

733
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,316
though that's
probably because...

734
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,444
Mary Stuart Masterson looked
hot in those leather gloves.

735
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,448
We talked at the reception.
That's why you hate me?

736
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,702
It was fun.
It was great.

737
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,371
Until I mentioned that I don't
sleep with guys on the first date,

738
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:19,625
and then you said you had to go to
the bathroom and you never came back.

739
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,920
Actions have consequences.

740
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,716
Do you take vengeance on
every guy who acts like an ass?

741
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,175
Could be a full-time job.

742
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,722
When we were talking,
you seemed like a nice guy.

743
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,184
So either you're a great actor or
you're a nice guy who lost his way.

744
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,394
Whatever the reasons,

745
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:42,106
a little negative reinforcement
seemed to be warranted.

746
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,194
Oh, currently your
password is "great big ho."

747
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,156
Change it back to
anything but "password."

748
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,576
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,332
Let me prove it to you by
taking you out for dinner,

750
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,375
followed by not
sleeping with you.

751
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,089
I'm serious.

752
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,217
Not on your life.

753
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,035
We need to talk.

754
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,913
Nothing to say.

755
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,377
Okay.

756
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,005
I'll wait till you're ready.

757
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,180
You're my son.

758
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,268
I'm not going anywhere.

759
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,456
Wait a minute.
What is that?

760
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,874
A doggie.
What does it say?

761
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,585
That's right.

762
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,756
Waldenwood called.

763
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,925
They love Rachel
but they have no room.

764
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:39,473
Something about more siblings
than usual. We should apply next year.

765
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,856
She's a smart kid.
She'll be fine.

766
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,317
You mean that?

767
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,696
Yeah, I do.
