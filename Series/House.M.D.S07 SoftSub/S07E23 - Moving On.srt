1
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,986
Are we almost done here?

2
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,990
I have to call my mother, get
my daughter, call the hospital.

3
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,742
So he didn't threaten you?

4
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,410
No.

5
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,579
No fight?
Not really.

6
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,164
Sounds like a yes.

7
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,295
Was there any indication
that something would happen?

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,588
Yeah.

9
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,133
Every moment
I've spent with him.

10
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,095
I was always waiting
for something to happen.

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,348
But this?

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,516
And no idea where he is?

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,684
No.

14
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,318
These domestic situations, it's
not uncommon to get cold feet.

15
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,862
You're asking me
to file charges?

16
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,114
Just give me the paperwork.

17
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,160
If Greg House steps foot
in my hospital again,

18
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,412
comes anywhere near me,

19
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,164
I want him thrown in jail.

20
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,951
So, we can use any of these?

21
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,202
Yeah.

22
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,789
And just do
whatever we want to her?

23
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,072
That's what they're there for.

24
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,714
Hey! We're just getting
to the good part.

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,716
Is there a good part?
It's performance art.

26
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,884
That's Afsoun Hamidi.
She's a genius.

27
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,304
She just won the MacArthur,
legally proving it.

28
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,641
Just had a retrospective
at the Tate Modern.

29
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,892
Nobody reads The New Yorker?

30
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,228
No, but I subscribed
to her patient file.

31
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,331
House, you should relax.
You had surgery this morning.

32
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,149
Minor surgery, removing a drain.

33
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,067
Put there during major surgery.

34
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,820
My doctor says it's okay as long
as I don't leave my hospital bed.

35
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,072
Which doctor was that,
Seuss or J?

36
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Nurse!

37
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,102
Dr. Hourani wrote
it in his chart.

38
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,875
I'm surprised he approved it.

39
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,918
I'm more surprised
you actually asked.

40
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,420
I do things like that now.

41
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,173
I'm making some changes.

42
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,675
Like skipping ahead
to minute 37.

43
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,054
What is that, paint thinner?

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,658
I'm not gonna watch a
woman get set on fire.

45
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,160
Philistine.

46
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,144
Who's the guy with the notebook
who can't decide what to do?

47
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,129
Her assistant. He's been
instructed not to intervene.

48
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,091
Spoiler alert, he does.

49
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,098
For her, it is, literally,
heartbreaking.

50
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,310
Let the games begin.

51
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,728
Arrhythmia, high hematocrit

52
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,814
and inconsistent RR variability.

53
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,358
You forgot about the fourth
symptom, "being completely crazy."

54
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,318
One man's crazy is
another woman's art.

55
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,488
Her work explores things like
gender politics and self-image.

56
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,366
And the pressing issue
of shaving your entire body in public

57
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,909
while wearing a monkey mask.

58
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,619
She saw her mom commit suicide

59
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,830
and was abused by
her stepdad for years.

60
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,307
Didn't say the crazy
wasn't motivated.

61
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,542
Well, she took that pain
and transformed it into art.

62
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,385
That's better than a
lot of the alternatives.

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,461
I still vote for nuts.

64
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,672
We should run a resting
state functional MRI

65
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,841
to look for increased
activity in the dorsal nexus.

66
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,967
She's not nuts.

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,028
The monkey mask shaving
medium really speaks to you?

68
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,013
What speaks to me is she's
elevated being full of crap

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,850
to a genuine art form.

70
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,768
And made a fortune doing it.

71
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,312
People who pay 20 grand
for one of her video stills,

72
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,564
on the other hand,

73
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,649
really do need their
dorsal nexi checked.

74
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,235
Maybe the paint thinner
set off an allergic reaction.

75
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,445
Not without bronchospasm.

76
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,990
There was a space heater
next to her in the gallery.

77
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,786
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

78
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,913
It fits.

79
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,416
Put her in a hyperbaric chamber.

80
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,393
Lisa?

81
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,437
You're Lisa Cuddy.

82
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,022
What's this about?

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,292
I'm sorry.
I'm Jerry Barrett.

84
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,526
I recognized you
from the photos.

85
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,528
They barely do you justice.

86
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,946
The usual.

87
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,132
I'm friends with your sister.

88
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,324
She showed me your photos.

89
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,993
I work at the bank
across the street.

90
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,788
Julia's my client.
She wanted to set us up.

91
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,919
I'm afraid you have me
mixed up with somebody else.

92
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,589
No, I don't think so. I've seen
many pictures of you, several times.

93
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,300
That didn't sound the way I...

94
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,903
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

95
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,678
Nice to meet you.

96
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:51,392
Yeah. Say hi to Lisa Cuddy when
you meet her in the office you share.

97
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,813
Oh, thank God!

98
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,108
The ICU isn't being attacked
by giant radioactive spiders.

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,861
Did I text you that? That was
meant for my dream journal.

100
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,697
I wanted to return your stuff.

101
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,115
Don't worry, I didn't go AWOL.

102
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,701
I had my wife-maid
bring it over.

103
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,413
My sweater, a coffee mug,

104
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:17,544
half used bottle of lotion
and a DVD of Marley & Me.

105
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,045
Given your thing
for Owen Wilson,

106
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,065
I thought you might want
those last two back ASAP.

107
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,889
I don't get it. You
masturbate to Owen Wilson.

108
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,175
I meant the box.

109
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,510
Oh.

110
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,721
It's a symbolic gesture.

111
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,726
I want things to go back to the way
they were before we started dating.

112
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,230
No more bad feelings, No
more issues. Just work.

113
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,317
Thanks for coming.

114
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,296
I haven't even spoken to
you since you hurt yourself.

115
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,572
I was self-destructive.

116
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,574
It won't happen again.

117
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,494
I'm making changes. I'm
gonna stop doing stupid things.

118
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,997
Great.

119
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,502
The smart thing to do would
be to talk about why you did it.

120
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,795
If you don't understand...

121
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,839
I think I can avoid putting
another hole in my leg

122
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,202
without talking about my mother.

123
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,285
I don't wanna
find out you're wrong

124
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,013
by getting another phone call
from you in a bloody bathtub.

125
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,766
I'm a big believer that the
best way to get past the past

126
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,101
is to shoot it in the head,

127
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,812
bury it in a deep pit
and pour lye on it.

128
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,897
I'm just asking you
to talk about it.

129
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,065
You owe me.

130
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,234
Forget about saving your life,

131
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,404
you exposed my daughter to
that obnoxious pirate cartoon.

132
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,704
Bring me lunch tomorrow
and we can plumb my depths.

133
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,146
I should have known the
gallery wasn't ventilated enough.

134
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,314
Hey, if it wasn't for you,

135
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,317
we'd be treating her for
third-degree burns, too.

136
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,567
That was a mistake.

137
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,319
He shouldn't have interfered.

138
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,570
I told you I'm sorry.

139
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,881
I want to share your commitment,

140
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,145
but it's hard for me sometimes.

141
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,367
Like when she read
your love letters

142
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,743
in the middle of the New Museum?

143
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,121
Yes, I read The New Yorker.

144
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,793
That was a year ago, and
we're not together any more.

145
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,963
Seriously, you weren't really
gonna let that guy set you on fire?

146
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,049
He was just a plant to
get the crowd going, right?

147
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,594
If that's your
interpretation, I welcome it.

148
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,056
Afsoun believes explaining
her work limits its potential.

149
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,101
But between us, he
was real. And a total dick.

150
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,186
No sane person
would let themselves

151
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,854
be burned alive
for the sake of art.

152
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,692
My work is meant to force the
audience to break with the rational

153
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,735
and see things in a new way.

154
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,364
Fine. No sane person would
let themselves be burned alive

155
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,824
to break with the rational.

156
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,283
I feel...

157
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,793
Luca, hand me the
oxygen mask behind you.

158
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,298
Luca!

159
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,010
Congratulations,
it's a gestational sac.

160
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,888
You can't see anything
this early. I know.

161
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,059
I just figured this would help
me process what's happening.

162
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,463
There's a lot
we gotta figure out.

163
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,770
We have almost eight months.

164
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,174
You're not having doubts,
are you?

165
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,190
No. Are you?

166
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,276
Definitely not.

167
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,780
A nice, cozy home
for little Ruben.

168
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,326
It's a family name.
It's a sandwich.

169
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,287
Named for my family.

170
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,046
It's just House.

171
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,511
I swear to God, stay
out of my personal life.

172
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,180
Where's the downside here?

173
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,556
Huh? Jerry is cute,

174
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,391
he's a Senior VP,

175
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,728
he kite-surfs in Costa Rica every
winter, and he loves his mother.

176
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,979
Seasonally?

177
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,856
Or is that just
the kite-surfing?

178
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,981
Is this about House?

179
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,192
What?

180
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,613
Like, I secretly wish I could
alter the laws of the universe,

181
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,115
change who we are and
magically make it work out?

182
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,617
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm asking.

183
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,118
And my sarcasm
indicated "no."

184
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,120
No. Your sarcasm
indicated you wanted

185
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,705
to avoid actually
saying anything.

186
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,042
Look, Lisa...

187
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,379
All I know is you seem stuck.

188
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,673
And I don't like
seeing you like that.

189
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,137
She got worse in the hyperbaric
chamber, it's not CO poisoning.

190
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,890
I think we should consider
infection and test the assistant.

191
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,892
I couldn't get his
attention, he was in a daze.

192
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,977
You think that's a
symptom? He's in love with her.

193
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,206
He's probably just overwhelmed
and couldn't decide what to do.

194
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,981
What's he been doing
since she was admitted?

195
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,378
Did he bring anything from the
patient room into the treatment room?

196
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,739
Few things. A handbag,
flowers, a stuffed elephant.

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,537
Does she seem like the kind of
woman who needs a stuffed animal?

198
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,165
Who are you calling?

199
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,752
Oh. Of course.

200
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,215
What are you wearing?

201
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,261
Oh. I can see what you're
wearing. Go to her room.

202
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,275
Now go
address the elephant in the room.

203
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,247
This is a nanny cam.

204
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,541
The reason Luca couldn't decide

205
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,293
what to do in the treatment room

206
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,627
is the same as in the gallery.

207
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,629
He's been told not to intervene.

208
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,050
Congratulations. We've
become her latest work of art.

209
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,004
It shouldn't have surprised us.

210
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,059
All her work is based
on personal traumas.

211
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,896
She's had Luca taking notes,
videotape her treatments,

212
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,731
collect things, like
sharps and bandages.

213
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,482
It'll all go into
a gallery installation.

214
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,369
Well, then, I guess as long as the
exploitation is properly motivated,

215
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,987
it's all okay.

216
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,327
Ultrasound showed a cyst on
her pancreas. We drained it...

217
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,804
Why are we even
discussing this case?

218
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,497
She lied to us, it's opening
us up to malpractice...

219
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,000
Our practice opens
us up to malpractice.

220
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,752
How do we know
she's actually sick?

221
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,920
Her being sick is a clue.

222
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,440
She would have let that guy set
her on fire for the sake of her work.

223
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,264
You think she's scared
of a little arrhythmia?

224
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,484
She probably
huffed paint thinner.

225
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,861
She would have let
him set her on fire

226
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,345
because of the honesty
of her work.

227
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,513
Faking an illness
doesn't fit. Thirteen's right.

228
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,265
At least her conclusion was.

229
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,850
Everything else
was laughably wrong.

230
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,769
If the patient
induced pancreatitis

231
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,163
and a heart attack,
she'd be suicidal.

232
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,606
Exactly. She's risking
her life all the time.

233
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,608
Exactly.
If she wanted to be dead,

234
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,193
she'd be dead a long time ago.

235
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,528
Pretending to cheat death
pays better than watercolors.

236
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,406
Coxsackie B fits.
But do a spiral CT

237
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,784
of her biliary tree
to rule out gallstones.

238
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,369
Fine. I'll get the CT.

239
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,120
Sure, I'd be
happy to come with you.

240
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,039
Thanks for asking.

241
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,042
You're supposed to stay
in bed. Doctor's orders.

242
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,378
If you really cared about me,

243
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,547
you wouldn't be so obvious when
you scheme to prove me wrong.

244
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,300
You volunteered because
you want to CT her lungs,

245
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,551
not her biliary tree.

246
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,304
You want to find fibrosis and
prove your paint thinner theory.

247
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,014
If I don't come with,
when you fail,

248
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,225
you'll pretend you never tried.

249
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,477
I don't really have
a choice now, do I?

250
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,006
Since I've seen your pay
check, I probably shouldn't...

251
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,926
But canned beans aren't so bad.

252
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,846
Once they're cooked
over an oil drum fire

253
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,099
under a bridge with
the king of the hobos...

254
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,684
I feel dizzy.

255
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,777
Pale, diaphoretic, tachycardic.

256
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,447
BP 80 over 40.

257
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,282
Internal bleeding?

258
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,118
Get her out of here
and scope her.

259
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,212
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,776
The colonoscopy
didn't find the bleed,

261
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,079
SO we gotta look by your liver.

262
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,136
Luca, please. We need
to document everything.

263
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,140
Hold this.

264
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,609
I'm just below
the celiac artery.

265
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,154
No blood.

266
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,637
Could it be leaking
into her thighs?

267
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,825
No swelling, no asymmetry...

268
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,118
So where's the blood going?

269
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,501
Why are you looking down there?

270
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,170
Because I don't like beans.

271
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,259
You stood me up.
Sorry.

272
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,179
I should have scheduled my
patient's internal bleeding for Thursday.

273
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,015
You're still playing the same
petty passive-aggressive games.

274
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,518
Got you to go all the
way to the second floor

275
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,520
of the building you work in.

276
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,771
Boy, did I screw with you.

277
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,689
You said you were
going to change.

278
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:41,816
Check the sign.

279
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,168
It says you got to treat
me with intensive care.

280
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,319
I'm expressing my anger.
You should try it.

281
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,197
Right now. Let's
finally have our fight.

282
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,949
All we do is fight.

283
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,118
No, all you've done
is pull pranks,

284
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,787
or have temper tantrums
with Wilson, never me,

285
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,247
marry mail-order prostitutes,

286
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,432
make me go to your wedding...

287
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,792
Dominika is
a licensed esthetician.

288
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,794
You cut open your own leg!

289
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,920
So all this was about you?

290
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,403
You don't think it
was even related?

291
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,216
House, we've never even had a
conversation about our breakup.

292
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,968
You are obviously
still angry at me,

293
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,171
and it's hurting both of us.

294
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,472
Wow. I didn't realize the
incredible healing power of lunch.

295
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,058
I know one conversation
isn't gonna solve everything,

296
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,309
but it is a start.

297
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,313
It's a privacy curtain.

298
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,648
It wasn't working.

299
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,696
Lunch at 1:00, tomorrow
in the cafeteria. You happy?

300
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,223
How many of those
have you had today?

301
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,583
I don't know.
Is "your mother" a number?

302
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,918
The patient is a fraud.

303
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,063
I found a puncture in the
dorsal vein of her left foot.

304
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,231
Shooting up heroin
wouldn't explain...

305
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,339
Not heroin,

306
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,484
she was injecting herself
with her own red blood cells.

307
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,588
It caused her heart issues,

308
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,862
and when her
hematocrit evened out,

309
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,238
we mistook it for
internal bleeding.

310
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,062
That must've been
a very distinctively shaped,

311
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,515
and awfully talkative puncture

312
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,683
for you to get all of that.

313
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,728
The browser history
on her laptop helped.

314
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,023
She was researching blood
doping, among other things.

315
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,154
She was researching me?

316
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,280
For months.

317
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,157
This isn't about creating
art in the moment.

318
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,783
It's about you.

319
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,452
She set you up.

320
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,136
We sent a uni over to his
apartment and the hospital.

321
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,138
Yeah, he won't be there.

322
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,640
Any ideas?

323
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,577
When you find him,
you're gonna arrest him?

324
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,281
Is there some reason
you think I shouldn't?

325
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,900
Knowing him, he'll be in a bar.

326
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,819
He'll find one that matches
how he feels inside.

327
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,990
It'll be the most dark,
depressing hole

328
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,742
you can find in New Jersey.

329
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,414
Now you're just pissing me off.

330
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,042
I'm really sorry. I
didn't know she researched you,

331
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,207
I had no idea she... HOUSE:
You don't know anything?

332
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,379
Then why are you talking?

333
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,648
Please,
don't take it out on Luca.

334
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,108
I'll take it out on whoever I
think will irritate you the most.

335
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,612
I thought you would
understand someone

336
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,928
who uses their work
to deal with pain.

337
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,448
I didn't realize that search
engines could look within the soul.

338
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,766
You're standing in front
of me in a hospital gown.

339
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,202
What the hell is
the point of this?

340
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,353
What personal trauma
are you exploiting...

341
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,356
Sorry. Mining for
its artistic potential?

342
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,857
My illness.

343
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:36,198
I did the blood doping to
intrigue you, but I was already ill.

344
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,117
Wait. You're really sick?

345
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,595
Why me? LUCA: Do
you know what you have?

346
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,788
Yes.
So tell him.

347
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,541
If I do, there won't
be any game for him.

348
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,960
And then, there
won't be any art for us.

349
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,671
Why me?

350
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,048
I don't answer those questions.

351
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,196
You know, there's a
lot of games I could play

352
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,390
that don't involve dealing with
narcissistic, manipulative posers.

353
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,852
But this is a puzzle
tailor-made for you.

354
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,980
You don't know which
of my symptoms are real,

355
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,859
which are fake, which ones
I'm not even telling you about.

356
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,571
I know that intrigues you.

357
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,576
Do you really want
to end it now?

358
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,583
No.

359
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,585
You want us to
waste a bed on her?

360
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,003
You took an oath,

361
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,172
an oath to be cool.

362
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,214
At least that was the one
I mumbled under my breath

363
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,861
while everyone else
was doing the boring one.

364
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,304
Even if she is sick,
which I don't believe,

365
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,014
she also says
she has a diagnosis.

366
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,558
So, it's either just a
lie or it's just a game.

367
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,728
So what? I like
the game, it's fun.

368
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,773
Go get a blood culture. Check
for parasites and bacteria.

369
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,024
This is the new House?

370
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,109
Half the leg power,
twice the irresponsibility?

371
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,612
The new House is about
making my life healthier.

372
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,113
I never said
anything about yours.

373
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,199
Go get her blood.

374
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,914
I'll do it.

375
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,601
He's going through
a tough patch right now.

376
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,935
If this is
the distraction he needs

377
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,239
to keep him in his hospital bed,

378
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,214
I'm sure it's better than
any of the alternatives.

379
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,468
That was incredibly
condescending. Did it work?

380
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,232
Why do you keep
ducking your wife's calls?

381
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,400
Ex-wife.

382
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,276
I'm sure she just wants
to congratulate you

383
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,405
about knocking up
a 22-year-old nurse.

384
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,657
I haven't told her yet.

385
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,034
But you have told her
you're not gonna

386
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,161
sleep with her any more, right?

387
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,430
How are you planning
on letting her know?

388
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,834
Just invite her to the bris?

389
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,919
I'm trying to let her down easy.

390
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,282
Rachel never
wanted to have kids,

391
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,439
I don't want to
hurt her feelings.

392
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,341
Yeah, you are
all about feelings.

393
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,010
I've loved Rachel for 20 years.

394
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,763
What if she never
speaks to me again?

395
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,142
She's gonna find out.
It better be from you.

396
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,979
You can't cheat your way
out of this one.

397
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,153
What is it?

398
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,113
Just the nausea.

399
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,031
She said her back
was hurting earlier.

400
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,801
What's the pain level
on a scale of one to 107

401
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,868
Five.

402
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,012
- We know we can't take her
word for it. - We can't.

403
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,037
Fun, huh?

404
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,622
Roll on your side.

405
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,545
Grey-Turner's sign.

406
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,005
We're done playing.

407
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,215
Your pancreas is releasing
corrosive enzymes.

408
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,050
It'll eat away at
the surrounding organs.

409
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,678
But you must know that.

410
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,322
The doctor who diagnosed
you would have said

411
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,682
what will happen if
you don't get treatment.

412
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,894
Just tell them.

413
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,079
If you know
what's wrong with you,

414
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,313
tell them so they can fix it.

415
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,316
How many projects
have we done together?

416
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,151
You're always SO worried.

417
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,904
Have you ever gone
wrong trusting me?

418
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,750
That pancreatic cyst
we drained, it's back.

419
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,585
And she doesn't care at all.

420
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,689
You think she actually
Is suicidal?

421
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,756
I would.

422
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,674
But how does she
give herself the cysts?

423
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,386
Tox screen was negative,
and there's no sign of trauma.

424
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,601
There is another explanation.

425
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:37,523
The reason that she didn't
react isn't 'cause she wants to die.

426
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,527
It's 'cause she knows she
can't do anything about it.

427
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,111
Whatever she has, it's fatal.

428
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,576
That should narrow it down.

429
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,540
What are we doing here?

430
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,792
Testing a theory.

431
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,461
It's based on some stuff
you can't understand,

432
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,046
like RR variability.

433
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,464
And some stuff you can,

434
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,091
like the fact
she shaved her head

435
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,801
in an art piece four months ago.

436
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,637
That was a commentary
on society's...

437
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,305
It was a commentary on the fact

438
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,723
that it was gonna
fall out anyway,

439
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,976
and she wanted to hide why.

440
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,897
Cancer?

441
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,816
Are you sure about that?

442
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:25,988
See that tumor-Ish thingamajig
near her brainamabob?

443
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,326
Are you getting this?

444
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,661
Game's over. I won.

445
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,498
Primary CNS lymphoma with
associated paraneoplastic syndrome.

446
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,668
Is that really what it is?

447
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,171
Yes.

448
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,343
Four months ago, I had some
vision and balance problems

449
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,179
and New York Mercy diagnosed me.

450
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,349
The tumor was too close
to the brain stem to cut out,

451
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,477
so they did a few
rounds of radiation.

452
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,439
But it didn't work,
and they sent me home.

453
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,441
That was around the time
you broke up with me.

454
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,819
We were having a fling. It wouldn't
have been fair to involve you.

455
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,698
I'm involved now. You
just didn't want to open up.

456
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,492
Luca, my mind was
not clear then.

457
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,163
And then you cleared it.

458
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:20,000
You realized you could use your
death to make your magnum opus.

459
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,378
Maybe you wanted to show
that no one can cheat death,

460
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,840
even with an entire team of
doctors with unlimited resources.

461
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,426
Or maybe your first doctors

462
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,136
didn't treat you like a person,

463
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,387
just a series of symptoms.

464
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,057
You wanted to recreate
that depersonalization,

465
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,725
and I was the man to see.

466
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,732
If that was what I thought,
I don't any longer.

467
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,402
You spent time with me,

468
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,197
you took this personally.

469
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,576
No, I didn't.

470
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,080
And I don't actually think
your piece is about anything.

471
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,750
I think you just figured
out that you were mortal.

472
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,919
Just a bag of cells and waste

473
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,921
with an expiration date.

474
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,424
You wanted to act out,
you wanted people to notice.

475
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,263
Maybe you even prayed for
a different answer this time.

476
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,563
I got a title for your piece.

477
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,109
"It doesn't mean anything."

478
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,457
You're forging my
name on prescriptions again.

479
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,792
No.

480
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,713
What you just said implies
that I stopped at some point.

481
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,382
Twenty minutes ago, I put a
notice out to all local pharmacies

482
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,134
to require verbal authorization

483
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,444
before filling in
my prescriptions.

484
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,138
You have any idea how much
extra work you've just given yourself?

485
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,365
You're not gonna last a week.

486
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,974
I've been dealing
with this for years,

487
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,475
but it's over.

488
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,227
Your liver, your hearing,

489
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,814
never mind the fact that each
scrip you write is a separate felony.

490
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,482
You will serve time.
So could I.

491
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,569
You've chosen this moment to
give me crap about my Vicodin use?

492
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,070
You filled this three days ago,

493
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,488
now it's almost half gone.

494
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,614
So is my leg.

495
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,283
It's a month's supply.

496
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,411
The amount you're taking has
nothing to do with physical pain.

497
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,620
Okay.

498
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,082
So, maybe I am trying
to numb myself a little.

499
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,333
Because I'm trying to change.

500
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,895
I'm trying to stop
being self-destructive.

501
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,007
So, you can only handle not
self-destructing by being self-destructive?

502
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,175
What do you want from me?

503
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,844
I don't know, House.
But I'm worried about you.

504
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,196
I don't know how many
times I can watch you

505
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,680
cut off pieces of yourself.

506
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,016
Now it's the ICU, next
time it'll be the morgue.

507
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,020
You're miserable
and you're angry.

508
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,106
And I want you to
actually deal with that

509
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,318
and not just try to
medicate the issue away.

510
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,864
No.

511
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,700
You know what I feel right now?

512
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,871
I don't feel miserable or
angry. I don't feel good or bad.

513
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,500
I feel nothing.

514
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,544
Which feels great.

515
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,214
What are you doing?

516
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,342
Moving on. In the
direction of my house,

517
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,718
where I've got some more pills.

518
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,308
You're discharging yourself
against doctor's orders,

519
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,643
you've got to check that box.

520
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,562
I'm a doctor, so technically...

521
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,065
Wouldn't it be easier if
you just checked the box?

522
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,586
Why are you still here?

523
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,841
I'm going as soon as the nurse
brings me something for my eczema.

524
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,683
I figured it was irritated
by the paint thinner

525
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,017
poured on me in the gallery.

526
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,727
Does this mean something?

527
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,105
It's not eczema.

528
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,942
And it's not cancer.

529
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,697
It's Wegener's granulomatosis.

530
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,866
The biopsy confirmed that
what you thought was eczema

531
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,869
was actually a swelling of
the blood vessels in your skin.

532
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,956
It also explains the pancreatitis
and the mass in your brain.

533
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,458
And it's treatable.

534
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,547
What's the treatment?

535
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,215
We could do steroids alone,

536
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,967
to shrink the growth
in your brain.

537
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,469
But it's much better to add
another course of radiation.

538
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,389
Radiation? On my brain?

539
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,809
But it made me fuzzy last time.

540
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,477
It was harder to work.

541
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,813
I'm still slowed down from it.

542
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,066
And it'll get worse.

543
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,279
But, you know, dying can also do
a number on your ability to think.

544
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,492
I'm sorry.
I can't do the radiation.

545
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,500
They just said it was
the better treatment.

546
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,921
It could save your life.

547
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,174
My life's not worth
anything if I can't do my art.

548
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,136
You have friends, people
who care about you.

549
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,851
This is my brain, my
work and my life, Luca.

550
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,811
You have more!

551
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:37,692
This is not some great
performance piece any more.

552
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,613
This is just crazy.

553
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,659
I'm sorry.

554
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,541
I can't watch you die.

555
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,296
Not when you can save yourself.

556
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,509
Goodbye, Afsoun.

557
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,234
Good for you.

558
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,249
So...
So...

559
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,214
Why did I ever ban
alcohol from the cafeteria?

560
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,512
Before I forget,
there's a brush,

561
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,432
tortoise shell handle,
natural bristles.

562
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,685
It wasn't in the box.
If you could look for it?

563
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,770
Like the Lindbergh baby.

564
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,399
You dating anyone?

565
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,693
We don't have to...

566
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,362
Look, it's just standard
lunch conversation.

567
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,864
Not for us.

568
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,700
Okay, well, if you've gone over

569
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,535
to the "we don't
talk about things" side,

570
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,704
then I got a pot roast
in the oven.

571
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,955
No.

572
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,292
I haven't dated
anyone since you.

573
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,714
You know what they say,
once you go gimp...

574
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,635
We should talk about your leg.

575
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,556
You think I have
unresolved issues,

576
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,349
and you are
the unresolved issues.

577
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,476
Yes.

578
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,772
But I think it's more than that.

579
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,565
Your life, your choices...

580
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,317
I did it to fix my life.

581
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,486
No, wait.

582
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,947
No, I did it because I am
a deeply unhappy person.

583
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,493
No, I did it to
get sympathy from you.

584
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,913
I did it to piss you off. I did
it because I'm not over you.

585
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,082
Or I was over you
and I was moving on.

586
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,000
I did it because I wanna know

587
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,668
what it's like
not to be in pain.

588
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:04,130
I did it because
I wanna feel more pain.

589
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,264
Whatever the reason, it was
a bad reason and a bad idea.

590
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,766
That's all that matters.

591
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,934
Good lunch.

592
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,860
House! Talk to me.

593
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,028
I already did.

594
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,613
No, you just parroted back

595
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,674
what Wilson and I have been
saying to you the last few days.

596
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,158
Get out of my way.
No.

597
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,785
You pulled a stitch.

598
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,703
House, please.
Just talk to me.

599
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,039
You want to know how I feel?

600
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,464
I feel hurt.

601
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,976
I know.

602
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,066
I'm sorry.

603
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,698
It's not your fault.

604
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,256
Did I make the wrong choice?

605
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:37,807
Five years, through every
opening, every installation,

606
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,642
every day and every night,

607
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,312
he was there the whole time.

608
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,523
Except the first time
you were diagnosed.

609
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,820
You broke up with him and you
had to go through all of that alone.

610
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,116
Maybe that's the real reason
you're doing this piece,

611
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,036
so that this time, you
can have him with you.

612
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,289
You still could.

613
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,636
Hi.

614
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,264
Lisa Cuddy.
Nice to meet you.

615
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,451
I'm sorry about the other day.

616
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,269
I... There was some personal
things going on in my life

617
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,480
and I wasn't at my best.

618
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,024
Well, in retrospect,

619
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,152
my approach could've
come off as a little creepy.

620
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,362
No.

621
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,864
On a scale from one to creepy,

622
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,283
you were, maybe,
mildly unnerving.

623
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,839
Rach.

624
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,970
Sorry I ducked your calls. I
keep making the same mistakes,

625
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,179
but at some point...
Chris.

626
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,473
I'm pregnant.

627
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,023
I didn't expect that.

628
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,659
Sorry, I was checking
the stitches on my penis.

629
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,078
Your leg okay?

630
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,955
It's healing.
Good.

631
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,165
Just came to grab
the radiation therapy forms.

632
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,126
What?

633
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,460
Afsoun changed her mind.

634
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,635
Get out.

635
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,228
You made a decision.

636
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,148
I changed my mind.
Why?

637
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,567
Because there are more
important things than...

638
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,653
Than what? Than your
brain? Your abilities?

639
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,923
That's where
everything comes from,

640
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,824
any meaning in your life,
any happiness.

641
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,992
Not all happiness.

642
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,452
He's already left once.

643
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,911
He's gonna leave you again.

644
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,124
You don't need to depend on
people who are gonna let you down.

645
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,961
If you do this,
you're a pathetic hypocrite.

646
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,463
You're saying
that your whole life,

647
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,149
all your work up until
him was a pointless...

648
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,175
Why are you doing this?

649
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,941
House, I can hear
your phone ringing.

650
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,672
You all right?

651
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,579
Did you go to lunch with Cuddy?

652
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,842
Yeah.

653
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,677
How was it?

654
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,764
The pasta arrabiata was cold.

655
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,561
Why don't we get a drink?

656
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,021
We could go to the Sawmill.

657
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,540
Cuddy's is on the way.

658
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,959
I need to return this.

659
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,880
You think she's going to
have an emergency tangle?

660
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,090
It was on my mind.

661
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,050
I want to get it off.

662
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,436
Want me to come?

663
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,771
You think I'm
gonna get in trouble?

664
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,148
I'm delivering a hairbrush.

665
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,799
What just happened?

666
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,052
Get out.

667
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,971
What just happened?

668
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,348
Get out.

669
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,606
House, what are you mad about?

670
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,316
Just let it out,
you'll feel better.

671
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,419
You're right.
I feel much better.

672
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,562
You want another one?

673
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,775
No, I think I've had enough.

674
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,653
What do you think
I should do today?

675
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,906
I don't know, go home?

676
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,577
Not tonight.

677
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,122
Cheers.
