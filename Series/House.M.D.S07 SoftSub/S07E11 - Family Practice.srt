1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,139
If you're going to dress
like an Italian hooker,

2
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,267
at least let it be this
year's Italian hooker.

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,019
She's not telling
us we look fat.

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,142
It's a major breakthrough.

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,563
If you didn't want
to be insulted,

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,064
you wouldn't have invited me.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,774
Would anyone like
some champagne?

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,526
No.
Yes. Three glasses, please.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,195
Mom.
It's not even lunch.

10
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,531
If you'd prefer,
I'll make it a mimosa.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,866
What do you think?

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,492
Perfect for a night on the town.

13
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,537
Perfect for breastfeeding.

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,672
My heart's doing
that weird thing again.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,883
Beating? That's
normal for humans.

16
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,676
Come on, Lisa. Take
her seriously for once.

17
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,563
What? What is it?

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,359
I think we need to
get you to the hospital.

19
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,587
Is no one gonna tell me

20
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,425
why we're in the morgue?

21
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,885
House is on the I am
from someone.

22
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,196
Taub's got his money on Wilson,

23
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,405
but I'm pretty sure it's Cuddy.

24
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,266
Fool's bet. There's a whole
world of angry patients, creditors...

25
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,981
She needs a doctor.

26
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,817
Yes, just not me.

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,362
Your mom is a 65-year-old
woman with high blood pressure.

28
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,725
What about
the macrocytic anemia?

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,408
Borderline, which is the
lab equivalent of imaginary,

30
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,202
which, by the way, matches
the rest of her medical history.

31
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,497
You really think she's psyching
herself into atrial fibrillation?

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,249
So get her a cardiologist.

33
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,960
You don't want me involved.
You don't want you involved.

34
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,605
You know all that ethics stuff
that I don't give a crap about?

35
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,714
It suddenly makes sense.

36
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,191
If you're emotionally invested,

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,009
you cannot make
rational decisions.

38
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,345
You know this
would be a disaster.

39
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,348
This is my mother.

40
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,061
Treadmill test went well.

41
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,938
No chest discomfort or ischemia.

42
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,524
The abnormal rhythm will
probably resolve itself,

43
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,943
and if not, a daily pill
will keep it under control.

44
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,445
I will follow up later today.

45
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,530
Is it connected to
my other symptoms?

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,450
Which other symptoms, Mom?

47
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,077
Not her fault.

48
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,956
This Dean of Medicine stuff,
very impressive at parties,

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,625
but she's forgotten
how to be a real doctor.

50
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,586
It's all in my file.

51
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,882
There are 15 years of
clinic visits in this file.

52
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,051
I don't want to be a bother,

53
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,011
but isn't this what
you do for a living?

54
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,143
So, we're looking for a disease

55
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,936
that can last
a decade and a half,

56
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,148
causes constipation,
diarrhea, flu, colds,

57
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,650
dizziness, rashes,
back and joint pain,

58
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,194
heart feeling "weird",

59
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,738
kishkes feeling "wobbly".

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,406
One actual hip replacement.

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,492
And which has eluded
detection by years

62
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,078
of blood work, X-rays and MRIs.

63
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,163
Well, one thing
does pop to mind.

64
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,999
We'll monitor you. And
we'll give you a thyroid test.

65
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,835
And House's team will do a home
search for environmental toxins.

66
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,341
He seems to know his stuff. How
come he can't afford a coat that fits?

67
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,136
No radon, no mold,
no lead in the pipes.

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,221
Yeah, yeah, great.

69
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,948
Have you seen Cuddy's
high school yearbook?

70
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,909
Okay, that is clearly not
related to the case, so...

71
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,059
There is no case.

72
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,228
Cuddy won't let House
see the yearbook,

73
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,979
so he figures there's
something to hide.

74
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,272
Any guesses?

75
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,818
It's clearly related to
being a giant teenage dork.

76
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,778
So you thought I'd
have some insights?

77
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,239
Oh, no, no, I didn't
mean that. Relax.

78
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,241
I was crowned Homecoming Geek.

79
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,327
I'm sure you can relate.

80
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,248
Because you knew some dorks?

81
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,876
I was the class president
and head boy at...

82
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,211
Ah!

83
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,092
Is that Cuddy's mom?

84
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,635
Certain parts of her.

85
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,765
And certain parts of some
muscular Hispanic gentleman.

86
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,225
Should we consider STDs?

87
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,269
I think I just caught one
looking at these photos.

88
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,813
What does "azarcon" mean?

89
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,567
It means we might
have an actual case.

90
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,071
Mexican herbal medication
for stomach problems,

91
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,948
but only in the sense
that lead chromate

92
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,741
is an herb and
poison is a medication.

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,619
I'll start a chelation IV.
Thank you so much.

94
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,080
Wasn't too much of
a disaster, was it?

95
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:54,252
You know, it's not the only
thing they found in her home.

96
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,629
Not my yearbook.

97
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,214
Nope.

98
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,383
Just some stuff that
could cause severe

99
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,635
nausea and permanent
erectile dysfunction.

100
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,014
And which proves that
your mom is doing the help.

101
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:10,268
According to her diary, it's
some contractor named Jesus.

102
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,897
Which, granted, was
originally a Jewish name, but...

103
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,815
Go, Mom.

104
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,162
So, why were you taking
a Mexican folk remedy?

105
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,291
A friend uses it.
A friend.

106
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,962
Mom, just for medical reasons,
you should have told me.

107
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,756
If you're sexually
active... At my age,

108
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
he's more the active one.

109
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,719
Mom's having a fling.

110
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,430
I know.
You do?

111
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,309
She's been giving me lousy
advice about it for five years.

112
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,392
I have physical needs.

113
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,520
He's a married man, Mom.

114
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,606
She doesn't want sex with him,
I do want to have sex with him.

115
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,774
Tell me who's being hurt.

116
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,943
Hold on.
Five years?

117
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,306
Why didn't you tell me about it?

118
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,820
I don't know.

119
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,406
We don't have that
kind of relationship.

120
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,163
Does that really surprise you?

121
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,168
You're not ready?

122
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,505
You said you had two
guys helping you move.

123
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,881
They couldn't get out of work.

124
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,509
I'm trying to economize.

125
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,678
And this hotel is cheaper.

126
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,054
Hi.

127
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,639
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,224
I just wanted to
drop off some mail

129
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,642
and talk to you about something.

130
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,811
Of course.

131
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,239
Rache.

132
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,825
Chris, that's not why...

133
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,787
We got to move on.

134
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,749
And what does that mean?
Have you moved on?

135
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,712
With who? Is it Phil?

136
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,075
I don't want to talk about this.

137
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,341
I know that you're
worried about money, SO...

138
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,719
You're trying to change
the subject. Yeah.

139
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,178
Which you could
have gleaned from,

140
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,055
"I don't want to
talk about this."

141
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,517
I got you a tryout
to be a part-time

142
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,603
medical consultant on law suits.

143
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,188
Wait. With your brother?

144
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,442
Have you completely
forgotten the last time I saw him?

145
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,652
Yeah, that was five years ago.

146
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,213
Jamie had just found
out that you'd been

147
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,114
cheating on me with
your partner's daughter.

148
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,657
It's a little over-reaction...

149
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,784
He broke my nose
and then called me

150
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,370
the most horrible
person that he's ever met.

151
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,125
He shouldn't have
broken your nose.

152
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,107
You know, texts,
calls and e-mails

153
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,694
all go to the same magic device
these days, only got to send one.

154
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,406
Then it's even weirder it took
you so long to get down here.

155
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,453
Yeah, it's a crazy mystery. It's
not like I got a department to run.

156
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,957
This other magic
device tells me that

157
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,835
lead poisoning wouldn't
cause all my symptoms.

158
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,298
True. But it could cause
the 5% that are real.

159
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,927
You think I'm a hypochondriac?

160
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,154
Well, let me answer this way.

161
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,640
Maybe you're imagining that I
think you're a hypochondriac.

162
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,185
Look, my hand just
started to shake.

163
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,481
It's a side effect of these
arthritis pills. Read the label.

164
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,942
I did.
When I was typing it up.

165
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,195
Right before I slapped it
on a bottle of sugar pills.

166
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:55,243
You printed a fake label just
to prove I'm a hypochondriac?

167
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,828
Did it work?

168
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,331
It got you fired, you schmuck.

169
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,254
An hour to convince her
to go with Dr. Kaufman,

170
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,841
and only then because
he runs internal medicine.

171
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,606
She wanted to leave
the hospital entirely.

172
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,887
My God, a woman getting
better wants to leave the hospital.

173
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,811
If she's getting better, it's not
because you made her feel like a fool.

174
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,016
It couldn't be more because.

175
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,787
If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed
herself with six new forms of cancers.

176
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,854
She'd never leave.

177
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:27,066
It's hard enough dealing with
my mom being sick. This juvenile...

178
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,278
- Yeah.
- Lisa.

179
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,572
It's gonna be okay,
but she's in A-fib at 170.

180
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,698
Oh, God.

181
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,781
I think we should
cardiovert while she's unsedated.

182
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,827
I'll be right there.

183
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,454
A-fib's at 170.

184
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,417
Wait. I'm sorry
she's sick.

185
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,740
I'm not sorry I'm off the case.

186
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,044
You're not off the case.

187
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,773
You don't think you
can convince her...

188
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,466
No, no.
You are staying on.

189
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,634
She just can't know about it.

190
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,853
Top of the morning,
Dr. Kaufman.

191
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,522
Here's the deal. You
copy me on all the imaging.

192
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,708
I'll have my guys
run the lab tests.

193
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,233
No.

194
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,711
I thought you spoke to Cuddy?

195
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,737
Yeah. Then I spoke
to the elder Cuddy.

196
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,073
Who specifically requested
you not be involved.

197
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:21,120
Listen, Kaufie. You are perfectly
competent, bordering on good, even.

198
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,914
But you know I'm better.

199
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,837
If you want, we can pretend it's
'cause I got a team and more resources.

200
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,044
Either way, it'd be crazy
to ignore my advice.

201
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,046
It's not gonna stop at advice.

202
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,273
You're gonna start
cutting me out,

203
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,632
go behind me to your girlfriend.

204
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,133
And if something goes wrong?

205
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,011
It's still me standing up
there alone at the M&M.

206
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,597
Please, stay away
from my patient.

207
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,319
You bugged the room?

208
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,656
I absolutely without
apology will admit

209
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,783
that someone may
have allegedly done so.

210
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,453
Guess we can pass unethical
and skip straight to illegal.

211
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:06,207
Not according to the recent
Supreme Court case of Bite vs Me.

212
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,750
Dr. Kaufman's single.

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,669
Did you know he went
to Harvard Medical...

214
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,296
Mom, stop yenta-ing
for one minute.

215
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,482
Of course, if you want gloomy

216
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,551
and unable to commit, then
stick with the goyishe one.

217
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,695
This is completely unethical.
Why are we listening to this?

218
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,805
I know I'm a pain,
but it's impossible

219
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,074
for me to work
with you if you...

220
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,140
Fine. Fine.

221
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,602
Instead of a live stream, I'll get a
recap from Cuddy 20 minutes later.

222
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,854
Thank you for saving America.

223
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,774
Could be leukemia. Anemia
from taking over the marrow.

224
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,694
A-fib from infiltrating
cardiac muscle.

225
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,237
Sounds good.

226
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,990
Yeah.

227
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,119
I was really hoping for
a different diagnosis.

228
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,162
One that Kaufman hadn't
already come up with.

229
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,707
He just started
a bone marrow biopsy.

230
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,279
So we don't need to do anything?

231
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,253
I don't. You do. Go to
admitting and find us a new case.

232
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,732
DDX.

233
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,025
We just did it.

234
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,193
No, we just did the fake one.

235
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,558
Why do you think I let the
truth fairy know about the bug?

236
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,908
I was testing her. She
failed. She's still a narc.

237
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,161
Thiamine deficiency
fits better than leukemia.

238
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,330
You think she's an alcoholic.

239
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,374
When I had dinner with Arlene,
I mixed her a gin and tonic

240
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,585
and I'd run out of the tonic

241
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,629
so I substituted sleeping pills.

242
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,215
Next morning, she assumed
the blackout was from the drinking.

243
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,844
How many old ladies are used
to passing out from boozing?

244
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,221
The answer is the boozers.

245
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,351
We're gonna have to
slip her the thiamine pills.

246
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,564
We've got to run this by Cuddy.

247
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,735
Why do you think I'm
in such a bad mood?

248
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,285
Alcoholic?

249
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,916
Treatment's very easy, safe,

250
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,627
just literally
a few vitamin pills.

251
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,018
It'll fix her heart
and it won't interfere

252
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,923
with the biopsy
Kaufman's running.

253
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,593
I've put them in
an antacid bottle.

254
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,762
Just tell her it's
for stomach problems.

255
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,436
I have to ask her about this.

256
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,981
Of course. Absolutely.

257
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,276
You'll ask, she'll deny, you'll
push it, she'll get offended,

258
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,712
you'll be exactly
where you are now,

259
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,016
except it'll be harder to treat.

260
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,447
You've absolutely
got to do that.

261
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,771
I don't think she'll lie to me.

262
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,618
She just spent
the last five years

263
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,371
going south of the
border down Mexico way.

264
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,790
We have our issues,
but since Dad died,

265
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,127
we tell each other the
truth when asked directly.

266
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,963
It's important to us.

267
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,176
Addicts lie.

268
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,693
Can I speak to Mom alone?

269
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,279
Why?

270
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,578
You're scaring me, Lisa.

271
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,998
Mom, I think your drinking

272
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,321
IS causing your heart problems.

273
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,752
Is this about the
champagne? She ordered...

274
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,049
Patsy and Anne told me last week

275
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,885
you lost control at
the museum luncheon.

276
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,345
You're talking to my
friends behind my back.

277
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,764
We are all concerned.

278
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,849
Just tell me honestly.

279
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,851
How much have you been drinking?

280
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:00,399
I may be your patient,
but I am still your mother

281
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,611
and I'm telling you
I am not a drunk.

282
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,621
Okay.

283
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,592
For your stomach pains.

284
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,411
If something like
that comes up again,

285
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,615
just do what you need to do.

286
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,414
And keep you out of it?

287
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,917
Yeah. I am
being a coward.

288
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,547
Which is exactly why doctors
shouldn't treat their own families.

289
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,298
Congratulations.

290
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,801
You were right, as usual.

291
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,808
The hitting you was not optimal.

292
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,644
I was going through
my own divorce at the time.

293
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,896
I've had years of therapy.

294
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,733
Now when I get mad, I do some
deep breathing, squeeze my stress ball.

295
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,903
Hey, I kind of deserved it.

296
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,113
That's for sure.

297
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,324
Here's the deal.

298
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,660
I do a lot of med-mal insurance.

299
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,245
I need a new
non-testifying expert.

300
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,788
I'll give you one
case as a tryout.

301
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,584
You kick ass, I put you on
retainer, average 15 hours a week.

302
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,751
It's 50 a year.

303
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,087
Fifty what?

304
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,590
You kidding?
Fifty thousand.

305
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,925
I'll take it.

306
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,719
You drive a soft bargain.

307
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,262
You got to sigh an NDA.

308
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,346
Sure.

309
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,473
Is this...

310
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,059
That's a case I'm
about to settle.

311
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,770
I rep a giant pizza
delivery company.

312
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,148
Driver hit that kid,
messed up his legs.

313
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,276
And gave him a
micro-bleed in his brain, right?

314
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,278
What? No.

315
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,113
This little white mark.

316
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,075
Your predecessor checked,
so did the kid's doctors.

317
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,953
I don't know what
that is, but he's fine.

318
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,998
Probably. But if
there's any doubt...

319
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,501
It's a multimillion-dollar case
we're settling in two days.

320
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,794
Lay off it, okay?

321
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,881
Okay, you're right.
I'm off.

322
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,979
She spiked a fever.
It's 102.

323
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,317
Means I was wrong about
the thiamine deficiency.

324
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,486
You were wrong
about the alcoholism.

325
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,071
True dat.

326
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,615
It's actually looking more
and more like leukemia.

327
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,743
Kaufman rushed the
biopsies. It's not cancer.

328
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,704
So there's a bright side.

329
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,748
Kaufman was wrong, too.

330
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,593
DDX.

331
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,180
Okay. What disease
can turn Cuddy's mother

332
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,891
into a coma patient
named Stewart?

333
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,601
Lupus?

334
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,106
We got fired from that
case. We're moving on.

335
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,440
We were already fired.

336
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,525
By the patient.

337
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,402
This time by Cuddy,
so it's real.

338
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,446
She somehow realized that her
completely unworkable system

339
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,407
was completely unworkable.

340
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,492
Okay, pop quiz, hotshots.

341
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,995
I chose Vegetable
Stew for a reason.

342
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,247
You got 60 seconds, no hintsies.

343
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,709
You're not gonna talk to us?

344
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,852
Exactly, you're gonna have to...

345
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,045
Hey, you're good.

346
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,214
So this is just a test?

347
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,092
Pupils fixed and dilated.

348
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,846
An addict found with an empty
bottle of phenobarb next to him.

349
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,099
How's this a mystery?
It's an overdose.

350
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,643
Glutethimide!
Script filled last year.

351
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,563
Could mimic fixed and
dilated without the brain death.

352
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,357
Except he'll just
get better on his own,

353
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,734
so why would you take this case?

354
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,129
Because House doesn't
care about the treatment

355
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,696
as long as the case
is interesting.

356
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,451
I'll do a blood draw and put
glutethimide on the tox screen.

357
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,460
Really? You thought
that case was interesting?

358
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,795
Guess we're still on Arlene.

359
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,898
Aren't there other ways of
keeping Masters occupied?

360
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,800
Not according to my
sexual harassment seminar.

361
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,764
Maybe it's not hypochondria.

362
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,182
She says she gets
a lot of rashes.

363
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,061
Add the fever, sounds
like autoimmune, SLE.

364
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,981
Congratulations. You can think
exactly like a semi-competent internist.

365
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,942
Kaufman's starting
her on prednisone.

366
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,944
But the heart
problems were first.

367
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,447
Endocarditis?

368
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,823
With no murmurs?

369
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,283
It's usually a late sign.

370
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,701
The echo showed pristine valves.

371
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,453
Below the resolving threshold.

372
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,790
Kaufman's prednisone will
suppress her immune system.

373
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,916
It could kill her.

374
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,713
You've got to tell
him it's endocarditis.

375
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,881
Check the wiretap.

376
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,258
His ID guy's has been putting
the same argument to him.

377
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,969
He can't convince him.
You think I got a better shot?

378
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,304
So what do we do?

379
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,185
We switch her meds.

380
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,522
We get a solution of
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

381
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,857
Stick it in an IV bag
marked for prednisone.

382
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,485
Kaufman can only be
there a few times a day.

383
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,730
Tell Arlene you're from the
pharmacy. Switch them out.

384
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,988
This is nuts.

385
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,175
This is way too complicated...
It's hanging an IV bag.

386
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,344
If the attending doesn't know
what she's on, the risk of...

387
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,995
What risk? We know how he's
treating her, we bugged the room.

388
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,622
This is not about information.

389
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,083
We're talking ethical and
legal violations on a scale

390
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,918
that should make even
you puke. She's dying!

391
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,712
Doesn't mean we should
all go to jail to save her!

392
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,474
You're losing control because
this is your girlfriend's mom.

393
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,520
You gonna run this by Cuddy?

394
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,442
No. She said to keep her out
of it, do what we need to do.

395
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,695
Look, I know what I'm suggesting
is completely screwed up.

396
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,031
That's because this situation
is completely screwed up.

397
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,201
Do it or you're fired.

398
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,208
We stick together, he
can't fire all three of us.

399
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,911
Give me your prescription pad.

400
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,130
Why are you doing this?

401
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,315
Because I think
it's endocarditis

402
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,467
and I think the
prednisone will kill her.

403
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,721
And I forgot my
prescription pad.

404
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,066
Am I a horrible person?

405
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,445
I used to win awards
for volunteer work.

406
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,864
I went to Guatemala
and fixed cleft palates.

407
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,409
Now we're sitting back
letting Chase do our dirty work.

408
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,078
We're doing the right
thing. Stay out of it.

409
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,665
I don't know. I don't know
about anything anymore.

410
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,253
Then this thing with the
kid Rachel's brother is...

411
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,671
Stay out of that, too.

412
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,841
A, radiologists, experts,
unlike you said no bleed.

413
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,510
B, you yourself
said it's probably not.

414
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,929
C, you've got no
doctor-patient relationship.

415
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,680
D, you'll lose
your consulting job.

416
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,015
E, your ex will kill you.

417
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,725
F, I'm running out
of alphabet here.

418
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,355
You do it?

419
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,232
Had the bag. Walking
towards the room

420
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,692
and Cuddy's sister
says, "Hey, Dr. Chase."

421
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,736
I met her at that
charity event last year.

422
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,238
One of you two's got to do this.

423
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,532
I met Arlene at
the same benefit.

424
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,866
Conveniently.

425
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,036
Come on, don't ask me. I
don't even know if I believe it's...

426
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,123
Damn it.
It's Rachel's brother.

427
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,167
He wants me to check
out some new case.

428
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,752
Conveniently.

429
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,798
It's a tryout.
I need this job.

430
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,259
I got to do this.

431
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,470
So you're just gonna ditch us, run
off and work on some other case?

432
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,817
Are you Timothy's mom?

433
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,068
Yeah.

434
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,403
My name is Christopher Taub.

435
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,322
I'm a doctor at
Princeton-Plainsboro.

436
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,699
I saw your son's file.

437
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,660
I think he might have a
very small bleed in his brain.

438
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,956
Wait, you saw his file? How
do you even know who we are?

439
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,709
Your son could die
of a brain hemorrhage.

440
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,502
He needs a cerebral
angiogram today.

441
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,338
Get in your car and
meet me at the hospital.

442
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,635
Timothy? We're gonna
go see the doctor.

443
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,185
Another pop quiz.

444
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,355
How many idiot doctors
does it take to switch an IV?

445
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,483
The longer we wait,
the more the prednisone

446
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,777
is gonna Kill her immune system.

447
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,864
Forget playing the pharmacist.
Mom naps every afternoon.

448
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,627
Wait by the room, when she falls
asleep, get the sister out somehow.

449
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,791
Hi, Dr. Cuddy. Is now
a good time to talk?

450
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,126
Not really.

451
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,795
So, um, you know how
you had us consulting,

452
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,881
and then stopped
having us consult?

453
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,342
Why are you still here?

454
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,387
Well, I think the stopping
might have stopped.

455
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,183
House put me on this weird
case where there's no treatment.

456
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,810
I think maybe to distract me.

457
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,014
And they've been acting odd.

458
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,897
I'll look into it.

459
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,732
Thank you for coming to me.

460
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:48,236
Because I'm worried that he's
switching your mother's medications.

461
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,531
I checked with the pharmacy.

462
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,118
Dr. Chase got prednisone and
antibiotics for my coma patient.

463
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,329
Which wouldn't treat him,

464
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,750
but could treat conditions
that cause heart failure.

465
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,216
You told me to keep you out
of it, do what I needed to do.

466
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,818
What the hell did
you think that meant?

467
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,986
I meant like if
you had to slip her

468
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,762
a few more vitamin
pills or something.

469
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,807
This is life-threatening.
It's illegal.

470
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,142
I wasn't expecting
something like this.

471
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,162
Only because you intentionally
weren't thinking about it

472
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,814
'cause you don't wanna
make any tough decisions.

473
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,944
Are you completely
sure it's endocarditis?

474
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,073
That's not a real question.

475
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,119
Endocarditis fits better
than the alternatives.

476
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,586
We're having a little
trouble hanging the right IV.

477
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,673
Fastest way is with your help.

478
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,062
Where did Julia go?

479
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,230
She's got a family.

480
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,232
I've got a family.

481
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,444
Three kids and a
husband, that's a family.

482
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,780
You are always tougher on
me than Julia. Why is that?

483
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,157
I'm not.

484
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,120
I was thinking about when you
made me run for yearbook editor.

485
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,956
I didn't want to, I didn't have a
social life my whole senior year.

486
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,308
You let Julia do
whatever she wanted.

487
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,877
We're debating 12th grade now?

488
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,003
Like anything's changed.

489
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,087
What do you want, Lisa?

490
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:32,466
Do you want to hear
I love you both the same?

491
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,176
Of course I do.

492
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,096
Okay.

493
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,599
But times like this,

494
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,519
when we argue, it reminds me

495
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,396
I have more in common with her.

496
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,524
She's nicer to me.

497
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,110
I love you both,

498
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,490
but I like her more than you.

499
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,300
I called you three times.

500
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,260
My phone wasn't exactly on.

501
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,262
I figure I'll be getting
some angry calls

502
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,056
once radiology sends
back the angiogram.

503
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,225
They already did.

504
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,769
Here.

505
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,063
This is what you saw.

506
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,315
It's an anatomical
variant of the skull,

507
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,360
bone in proximity
to a blood vessel.

508
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,986
There was nothing
wrong with him.

509
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,448
That was reason G.

510
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,494
That's good news for him.

511
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,670
Lungs clear?

512
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,505
Diffuse wheezing,
tightness, pruritus.

513
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,800
It's an allergic reaction.

514
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,357
Looks like. But it
doesn't make any sense.

515
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,848
She's on prednisone. How
could she get an allergic reaction?

516
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,648
I switched out the
antibiotics, put her back on prednisone.

517
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,693
Her breathing's normal. But the
A-fib's back and her fever's up.

518
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,945
Allergy's got to be
due to our antibiotics.

519
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,613
Does Kaufman know what we did?

520
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,824
That's good.
No, that is terrible.

521
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,368
He doesn't know that she
got worse on antibiotics,

522
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,995
SO now he's
thinking endocarditis.

523
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,706
He'll put her back on the
antibiotics that almost suffocated her.

524
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,957
What do we do?

525
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,044
We push through this.

526
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:37,090
Started in the heart, endocarditis
still fits, it's just got to be fungal.

527
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,926
We have to switch Kaufman's
antibiotics for Amphotericin B.

528
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,654
I don't know if you're
right, I don't care.

529
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,388
But we are gonna end
up killing this woman

530
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,932
if we keep confusing her
attending with these secret meds.

531
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,685
I don't care about confusing
the attending. I want this woman...

532
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,104
We're not talking about
simple antibiotics anymore.

533
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,024
Amphotericin B is dangerous
in itself. It's a poison.

534
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,902
That's why it kills fungi.
It'll give her fever, chills...

535
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,154
Which she already has,
which will help us hide it.

536
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,506
I don't think I can
take a risk like that.

537
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,370
Well, then, you shouldn't
have let her fire me!

538
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,082
Look, all you have to do
is switch the IVs again.

539
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,352
This has blown up
on you once already.

540
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,377
He's right.

541
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,503
Yep.

542
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,301
I'm so sorry I got you guys
into this. You should go.

543
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,395
I'm right.

544
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,689
I know.
And I'll do it, but...

545
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,374
I agree. Fungal
endocarditis fits.

546
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,796
But we still have
to tell your mother.

547
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,759
I don't want to
tell her, not at all,

548
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,095
but the patient is
the highest priority.

549
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,974
I'm kicking you
out of your office.

550
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,687
Yes, you. This is
not her office yet.

551
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,251
If you tell anyone,

552
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,629
I will get you thrown
out of med school

553
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,257
and I will destroy your career.

554
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,596
I've thought about that.

555
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:55,311
Lying about me won't work.

556
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,732
Everybody knows your reputation.

557
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,152
True. But I won't
have to lie.

558
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,616
Buried in your coma
patient's big, big file is a form

559
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,368
that doesn't allow
treatment without

560
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,163
the express consent
of the relatives.

561
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,460
Wait...
You drew blood.

562
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,130
That's not just a screw-up.
It's a criminal assault.

563
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,179
But you told me... No.
As you may recall...

564
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,729
You set me up?

565
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,736
Why?

566
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,824
Because this patient
is the highest priority.

567
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,870
You made her think I was
hiding her son being sick!

568
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,915
She scuttled the settlement.
She reported me to the bar.

569
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,543
I got to deal
with that crap now!

570
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,047
I will sue you for slander,
for tortuous interference

571
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,134
and anything else
I can use to destroy you.

572
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:56,641
And my sister says, stay
out of her life, you failure.

573
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,728
Five years of therapy.

574
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:11,781
Dr. Kaufman, I need to speak
with you and the patient alone.

575
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,121
I'm skipping
the credentials committee.

576
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,583
I'm going straight to the state
board and reporting you for...

577
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,711
What you've done is
so off the spectrum,

578
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,338
I don't know there's
a specific name for it.

579
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,008
- I think he's talking to you.
- Marty, calm down.

580
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,801
And you.
What you did is worse.

581
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,596
He's an insane lunatic.
You're the Dean of Medicine.

582
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,055
I want you off my case.

583
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,182
That's exactly right.

584
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,058
Don't get excited.
You're fired, too.

585
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,226
What?

586
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,853
I'll never get away from House

587
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,563
or my daughter if I stay here.

588
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,523
Transfer me to
Princeton General.

589
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,774
Mom.

590
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,820
You're very ill and
you're very angry.

591
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,823
You really think now is the right
time to make a decision like this?

592
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,701
You lied to me and betrayed me.

593
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,164
Do you think I really care what
you consider a good idea anymore?

594
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,514
I'll get the ambulance.

595
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,728
Happy?

596
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,199
I can't believe it.

597
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,538
What just happened?

598
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,041
You just killed her.

599
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,214
Are you blaming me?

600
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,093
This is all because
you're so arrogant,

601
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,553
you goaded her into firing you.

602
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,889
Actually, my mistakes
started a little after that,

603
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,724
when I agreed to
your brilliant scheme

604
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,661
to keep me on the case
after she'd fired me off it.

605
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,954
She would have
left the hospital.

606
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,397
Only 'cause you would have
let her. Like you did just now.

607
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,773
You think I can control her?

608
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,167
I don't know.
I've never seen you try.

609
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,152
I have been rebelling against
this woman my entire life.

610
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,154
Here's what I've seen.

611
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,157
She insults you,
you complain to me.

612
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,368
I drug her at dinner,
you never let her know.

613
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,495
We slip her medicine,
happens behind her back.

614
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,580
You never confront her.

615
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,709
And it pisses me off.

616
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,714
Are you taking this personally?

617
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,300
If she leaves, she dies.

618
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:40,596
One day, maybe a week from
now, maybe a year from now,

619
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:46,019
you're gonna decide that the man
sleeping next to you killed your mother.

620
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,525
Get me my patient back.

621
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,031
This is really bad, Lise.

622
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,867
I swear to God, Jules,
I will call security.

623
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,882
I asked you before
why you were tough on me.

624
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,966
I wasn't.

625
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,843
You were.
And I know why.

626
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,139
You see something in
me that you didn't see

627
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,974
in Julia and you
didn't see in you.

628
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,769
A type of ambition,
a type of brains.

629
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,896
That's why you rode me.

630
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:34,942
You made me yearbook editor,
summa undergrad, AOA in med school.

631
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,279
The only time I ever
see light in your eyes

632
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,199
is when you hear me
talking about my job.

633
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,580
The reason you keep
coming to see me

634
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,041
in the clinic is
because you trust me.

635
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,211
You trust my medical judgment.

636
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,671
So here it is.

637
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,425
If you transfer to
Princeton General,

638
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,636
you'll be treated
well and you'll die.

639
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,641
If you stay here with House,
you'll be treated badly, but you'll live.

640
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,605
I don't care if I have
to slash the tires

641
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,316
of every ambulance
in this bay, Mom.

642
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,320
I am not letting you
leave my hospital.

643
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,659
One, two, three.

644
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,079
I got it.
How are you feeling, Mom?

645
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,289
I feel a little dizzy.

646
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,751
Heart's still weak from the
infection. We'll hang an antifungal IV.

647
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,545
If you're so great,
how come you're not

648
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,755
running your department anymore?

649
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,340
What are you talking about, Mom?

650
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,675
That's what he told me.

651
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,759
Two days ago?

652
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,446
I said that I didn't have a department
to run? I was being sarcastic.

653
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,513
No, you weren't.

654
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,432
Right, because
people who are talking

655
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,995
can't tell if they're
being sarcastic.

656
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,411
That doesn't make any sense.

657
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,354
Of course they can.
But you weren't.

658
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,904
I love A-Rod.

659
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,365
He's so modest

660
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,994
and I highly respect the paintings
he has of himself as a centaur.

661
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,621
Question.
Do I like A-Rod?

662
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,251
Yes. Whoever he is.

663
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,962
She can't recognize sarcasm?

664
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,173
Deficit in the right
parahippocampal gyrus,

665
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,259
which means CNS
involvement before the fever.

666
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,512
I was wrong about
the endocarditis.

667
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,723
I don't feel...

668
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,267
Mom. Mom.

669
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,978
Heart rate 170. Nurse!

670
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,148
Do something.

671
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,232
I am.

672
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,360
House!
The fever was hypothalamic.

673
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,779
That means brain,
heart, anemia, allergy.

674
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,257
You hear that, what do
you think? I don't know.

675
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,532
You think heavy metal toxicity.

676
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,051
It can't be. You treated
chelation for lead.

677
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,994
And she got better,
then she got worse

678
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,787
because she never
stopped being poisoned.

679
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:54,916
What are you doing?

680
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,519
You really want me
to stop and explain?

681
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,765
There it is.
Look at that.

682
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,435
The muscle's black.

683
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,729
Necrosis?

684
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:21,984
Metallosis. Her artificial hip
weared and teared way too much.

685
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,277
It's cobalt poisoning.

686
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,821
We're gonna need
Chase to get an OR.

687
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,615
We should start chelation again.

688
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,649
I thought you didn't
want to see me.

689
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,442
I didn't.

690
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,569
But Foreman called me.

691
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,909
I didn't know that you thought

692
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,079
that little boy had
a bleed in his head.

693
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,253
I will kill my brother if he
messes with you anymore.

694
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,007
What do you care?

695
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,221
Chris. You were
a crappy husband.

696
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,809
But you are a good person.

697
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,173
Once again.
You are unfired.

698
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,426
Why?

699
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,597
You sold me out
even though you knew

700
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,850
that you're gonna get
thrown out of med school.

701
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,854
That's just kind of impressive.

702
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,320
I keep my job if I stand
up to you, I keep it if I don't.

703
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,697
I don't buy it.

704
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,079
When Cuddy was protecting me
before, she was protecting a doctor.

705
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,831
She's now protecting
a boyfriend.

706
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,584
The hospital's not gonna
put up with that for long.

707
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,837
So I need you to protect me

708
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,173
from doing something
Cuddy will regret.

709
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,306
See you bright
and late tomorrow.

710
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:18,244
Mom, why would you
want to keep this?

711
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,665
So I can mount it on the
wall like a moose head.

712
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,928
It says here,
"Cobalt can cause rashes,

713
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,390
"dizziness and
stomach problems."

714
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,186
You still think I've been
imagining the whole thing?

715
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,814
Okay, you might have a point.

716
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,858
How do you feel?

717
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:52,862
You know, a little
dizziness, some pain.
