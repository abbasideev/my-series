1
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,590
I have been fantasizing
about this for months.

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,385
Forget it. We're not here to fool
around. I'm not fooling around.

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,928
I need this.

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,056
You're an idiot, you know that?

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,434
Just shut up and
give me a boost.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,818
Hurry your ass up!

7
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,472
Hey, sometimes a guy's
gotta do what a guy's gotta do.

8
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,682
Jaguar One to Control.

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:02,270
Sorry for the delay. Glenn had
to take a leak. It was unavoidable.

10
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,024
Target area is clear. Repeat,
target area confirmed clear.

11
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,407
Dr. Lee, target area's cleared,
launch vehicle's in range.

12
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,118
All systems go. Thank you,
Cesar. Whenever you're ready.

13
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,955
The CT-10's light enough
to launch from a UAV,

14
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,917
but can penetrate 8 feet of 6,000
psi concrete before detonation.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,085
Bombs away.

16
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,171
The precision guidance system's
not affected by darkness or weather

17
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,632
and can hit a 2-foot wide
target from 69,000 feet.

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,218
- What about sound?
- None in-bound at all.

19
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,553
We've developed a new fin
and a baffling design that...

20
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,267
Ordnance on target
in three, two, one.

21
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,236
I feel better already.

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,572
You need to see a shrink.

23
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,284
Seriously.

24
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,122
Well done. That's
really... Wendy!

25
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,666
Call 911!

26
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,393
Karma's a bitch.

27
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,979
You think her seizures
are the result of bad karma?

28
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,439
I think if you spend your days

29
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,067
designing ever more effective
ways to blow people up,

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,069
stuff's bound to
come back to you.

31
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,415
Thirsty. Side effect of
the new antihistamine I'm on.

32
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,584
You don't seem congested.

33
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,836
Intriguing. You have any
thoughts about our patient?

34
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,964
Got some questions about whether
Thirteen really believes in karma

35
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,216
or just wants to.

36
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,135
As to the patient, it's not gonna
be easy to break into her office.

37
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,529
You might want to start
with her home.

38
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,472
We could ask to look
through her office.

39
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,890
And we could do an MRI first.

40
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,767
Sure. Go ahead.

41
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,188
If you're not interested in
the case, why'd you take it?

42
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,481
I'm definitely interested.

43
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,608
Could be a tumor,
could be a CNS bleed.

44
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,861
But what do you do when
you got two interesting puzzles?

45
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,987
Two?

46
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,032
50 bucks! Pay up.

47
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,171
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Bet's off.

48
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,423
The fight was fixed.

49
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,466
The punch
barely even touched him.

50
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,927
You bet on Foley
to beat Zachary?

51
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,345
Speed beats power.

52
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,306
Unless speed has been paid
to speedily take a dive.

53
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,267
He touched him enough
to put him on the canvas

54
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,494
and the official
counted him out,

55
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,062
which means you
officially owe me

56
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,605
50 bucks.

57
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,941
We bet on a sporting event.

58
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,401
That was not sporting.

59
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,487
At less than 30 seconds,
that was barely even eventy.

60
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,867
Okay, here's what I saw,
you lost and I won.

61
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,429
Well, you can take that to your
grave. You're not taking my 50 bucks.

62
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,914
Prove it. Prove it or
pay up. You got one day.

63
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,626
And don't make me send
my boys out looking for you.

64
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,752
What?

65
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,091
All right.

66
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,094
So, two puzzles.

67
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,054
Tie goes to the one
that cost me money.

68
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,639
We'll keep each other posted.

69
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,353
I've always been healthy.

70
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,147
I never even get colds.

71
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,149
I guess your luck
finally ran out.

72
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,778
I take it she doesn't
like people who make bombs.

73
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,907
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to... It's all right.

74
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,743
Half of my family
feels the same way.

75
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,745
Of course, they all work
on Wall Street, so...

76
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,083
Ever since the first
Fourth of July I can remember,

77
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,920
I've always loved explosions.

78
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,963
When I got to college
and I had to pick a major,

79
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,091
I figured I might as well pick
something I'm passionate about.

80
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,428
Destroying things. You weren't
passionate about anything else?

81
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,724
Bombs are tools
just like anything else.

82
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,476
You can use it to
make things better,

83
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,478
or you can use it to
make things worse.

84
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,690
I also like romantic
poetry and picnics.

85
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,793
Is there anything else you wanna
know before we do this MRI?

86
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,403
No. Try to stay as
still as possible.

87
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,113
This shouldn't take long.

88
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,871
Hey, how's it going?

89
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,668
You mind? There are
plenty of other seats.

90
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,002
I'm not here to judge.

91
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,673
You did what was best for you,
and I got no problem with that.

92
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,259
I'm not gonna ask you
nice again. Just go away.

93
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,719
Or what? You're
suddenly gonna fall down?

94
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,389
Listen, I got a problem.

95
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,891
A guy who knows absolutely
nothing about boxing,

96
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,435
because of you
now thinks he does.

97
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,105
You can imagine the
potential ramifications.

98
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,108
I need you to get on the phone
with him, and tell him you took a dive.

99
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,317
I didn't take a dive.

100
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,821
Take a picture of you to prove that
it was really you, and we're done.

101
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,199
Just enough to convince him, not
enough to get you in any trouble.

102
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,660
I didn't take a dive.

103
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,664
Yeah, that story's
getting boring.

104
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,376
Look, I'm not from the
commission, I'm not some bookie.

105
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,336
I'm a doctor.
Here's my ID.

106
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,383
If you were a bookie,

107
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,720
you'd know no one pays a guy to
throw a fight he has no chance to win.

108
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,599
I was a 12-to-1 underdog,
lost my last five fights.

109
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,975
But you were the better fighter

110
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,519
and that last punch
barely touched you.

111
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,481
You ever been barely touched
by a guy who weighs 230 pounds?

112
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:25,069
Look at me. Look where
I am, what I'm wearing.

113
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,405
Do I look like a guy
who just got a payday?

114
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,409
I didn't throw the fight,

115
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,703
I just suck.

116
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,546
Hal

117
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,590
Proof.

118
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,597
Just because he wasn't
hit in the face...

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,890
Look at his pupils.

120
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,187
He has anisocoria, which, given his
age, the adrenaline surge in the fight,

121
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,315
and the fact that he's still
alive, means he was tachycardic.

122
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,025
He has Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome.

123
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,508
The bet was on who would win,
not who would live the longest.

124
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:11,074
If he's physically unable to continue
because of a pre-existing illness,

125
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,577
then it's technically a no contest,
which means all bets are off.

126
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,914
You know that just because I
was right about this one fighter,

127
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,582
doesn't make you
any less of a man.

128
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,584
Actually, it would
if you were right.

129
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,378
Then, as I said
earlier, prove it.

130
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,965
And one possibly photoshopped cell
phone pic does not a diagnosis make.

131
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,597
Excuse me, Dr. House.

132
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,812
I'm a co-worker of Wendy
Lee's. I'm also her boyfriend.

133
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,064
Great. I'm a guy
who doesn't care.

134
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,982
She's your patient.

135
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,585
You thought I didn't know
who Wendy Lee was?

136
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,695
That makes sense.
I'm not good at names.

137
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,987
Did Dr. Fortune tell you that?

138
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,740
Her last boyfriend was a real
nut. He's basically stalking her.

139
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,264
See, this is what
I don't care about.

140
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,578
I don't care who cares about
her, who used to care about her.

141
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,456
If either one of you falls down
dead, you can drop me a note, but...

142
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,500
I think I know
what's wrong with her.

143
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,422
What, you screwed up in the lab and
accidentally spilled some bomb on her?

144
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,840
No.

145
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,009
He really is crazy.

146
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,388
Poisoned?

147
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:19,267
Apparently our mad scientist
is also a slutty scientist,

148
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,812
whose milkshake's got all the
nerds in the yard fighting over her.

149
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,815
She's a slut because she's
dated two different guys at work?

150
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,067
I'm sorry, I thought we
were still judging her.

151
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,610
She's not a slut
and it's not poison.

152
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,455
When we tested her blood and
cerebral spinal fluid for toxic exposure,

153
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,174
it was negative for every
poison we could think of.

154
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,951
Well, that just leaves every
poison we didn't think of.

155
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,286
She works in a bomb factory.

156
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,805
So do a lot of
other not-sick people.

157
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,682
If the guy had any actual
evidence she was poisoned,

158
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,541
he would've gone to
the police, not to us.

159
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,310
And if we had any evidence
of what was wrong with her,

160
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:49,088
you'd be showing us MRI results.
I assume they were negative.

161
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,674
Couldn't hurt to start activated
charcoal, see what happens.

162
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,634
You know what else
wouldn't hurt?

163
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,511
This case is
getting interesting.

164
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,013
Let's add a little danger.

165
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,454
Just because he has guns
doesn't make him a murderer.

166
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,747
Tell that to the bear.

167
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,208
Look in the desk. See
if he's got a diary or a journal.

168
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,627
Something tells me he's not
exactly a diary kind of guy.

169
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,378
Maybe a manifesto.

170
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,523
Just look. I'm gonna check
out the rest of the place.

171
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,633
See if he's got a computer.

172
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,176
It's Foreman. Yep.

173
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,304
You break in yet? Yeah,
we're in the abattoir now. Why?

174
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,182
You can leave. I think Taub
and I found what we're looking for.

175
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:47,396
Looks like she actually was being poisoned,
but she's been doing it to herself.

176
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,152
- I'm not an alcoholic.
- I know, I know,

177
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,404
the whole label
thing is so limiting.

178
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,741
You're a person who happens
to suffer from alcoholism.

179
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,661
You broke into my house and
now you're being a smart ass?

180
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,580
During your history, you
said you didn't drink. At all.

181
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,166
I don't.
You just collect bottles.

182
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,584
Yes.

183
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,671
I collect them for my friend.
She uses them in her art projects.

184
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,091
And you're ashamed of these art
projects. The bottles were hidden...

185
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,010
That's because my housekeeper
keeps throwing them out.

186
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,595
I've told her a
dozen times not to,

187
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,265
but either she doesn't
understand or she doesn't care.

188
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,853
Why would she lie?
That's the easy question.

189
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,188
She needs a government
security clearance for her job.

190
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,439
And what's the hard question?

191
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,607
If she's an alcoholic,

192
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,419
why doesn't she have at least
some partially full bottles in the house?

193
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,363
And why keep the empties?
Why not just throw them away?

194
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,117
So she's probably telling
the truth. So what do we do?

195
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:46,122
We start her on Valium
for alcohol withdrawal.

196
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,083
It's the best we've
got right now.

197
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:59,135
One normal EKG does
not a healthy person make.

198
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,680
Look, I told you, I just suck.
Oh, you make me so sad.

199
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,807
Don't talk like that. Why
do you care so much?

200
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,311
Kill me for loving my
patients. It's just what I do.

201
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,898
Hey, stop.

202
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,316
Stop!

203
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,822
My leg hurts. Just talk
to me for a moment.

204
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,500
You don't have to
be a loser. Thanks.

205
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,170
Whatever's wrong
with you, it's real.

206
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,838
Sick is good.

207
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,507
Sick means it can get better.
You could get better.

208
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,636
I don't mean
healthier. I mean,

209
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,348
maybe you don't have to suck.

210
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,106
Figure out what's wrong with
yourself and leave me alone.

211
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,698
Abdominal pain.

212
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,534
She said it felt like
she was being stabbed.

213
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,205
Give her morphine,
5 milligrams IV.

214
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,834
Is it a symptom of the underlying
condition or a symptom of our treatment?

215
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,712
We'll know soon. I stopped our
treatment. We should restart it.

216
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,356
Acute pancreatitis from alcoholism
would cause this kind of pain.

217
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,675
It's stress related.

218
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,444
She's in a lot of pain.
She's under a lot of stress.

219
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,053
She's got two guys
fighting over her

220
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,031
and she just got done with
the final test of a new bomb.

221
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,473
Her guilt is Killing her.

222
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,452
As far as you know, she likes being
the center of attention and loves her job.

223
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,536
As far as you know,
she doesn't drink.

224
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,663
What if it's a kidney infection?

225
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,315
Acute pyelonephritis could kill her
if we don't start her on IV antibiotics.

226
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,067
Would kill her if
it was pyelonephritis.

227
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,379
But since her urine and CSF
don't show signs of infection...

228
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,904
I paged House.

229
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,825
What? We
got nothing.

230
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,327
Less than nothing since he's
actually ignoring my pages,

231
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,414
which means we have a sick
patient and apparently a sick boss.

232
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,100
Tell him you admit he's right.
Let's get him back to work.

233
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,519
If he's ignoring you,
it's because he trusts you.

234
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,104
No, it's not.
No, it's not.

235
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,273
But he does. Thanks,
I feel warm inside.

236
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,277
But right now I'm debating which
bad idea I should pretend is a good idea

237
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,546
and force everybody
to implement.

238
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,030
I think this is good for him.

239
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,532
Obsessing over a bet is good?

240
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,201
And doing his actual job,
treating actual patients, that's bad?

241
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,621
House only doing what House
wants, is the only way he can function.

242
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,959
Since the breakup, he's been seeking
out crazier and crazier things to do

243
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,711
because they're crazy.

244
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,630
This... Well, it's not crazy.

245
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,216
No, just irresponsible
and possibly dangerous.

246
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,634
By House standards, it's dull.

247
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,637
This he's doing just
because he's interested.

248
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:52,224
I think House getting back
to doing stupid House stuff

249
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,811
for stupid House reasons is the
best thing that could happen to him.

250
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,981
I'll go explain that
to the patient.

251
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,827
It's definitely
not pancreatitis.

252
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,746
Restarting the treatment
obviously didn't help anything.

253
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,374
Assume you tested
for infections.

254
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,001
And I assume that look
means yes and I was wrong.

255
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,245
You call for a psych consult?

256
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,297
Wow, that's the same look
I just got from Chase.

257
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,300
So an hour ago, we had three
theories we couldn't agree on.

258
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,928
Now we've got no theories,
but we're in agreement.

259
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,936
CT and ultrasound show
inflammation in the renal capsule.

260
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,272
Could be an obstructing
calculus or perinephric abscess.

261
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,875
Blood cultures came back negative.
It's probably just a benign cyst.

262
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,211
Yeah, so let's just dismiss an
idea because it's probably nothing.

263
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,712
It could be gas in
the perinephric space,

264
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,991
in which case we should be
prepping her for emergency surgery.

265
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,452
What looks like
Wolff-Parkinson-White, but isn't?

266
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,292
Her EKG was normal.
So was his.

267
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,420
That's why I said looks like, as
in similar to, but not the same.

268
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,383
You want us to help you
get out of paying your bet,

269
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,594
while your actual
patient lies in agony.

270
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,972
Who's the real bad guy here?

271
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,765
The guy who doesn't
care enough to help,

272
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,310
or the four guys who aren't
competent enough to help?

273
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,854
Works out too much,
gets pounded too much,

274
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,314
and not in the romantic way,

275
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,399
his pupils...
I got it.

276
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,777
Your patient? No.

277
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,947
Plenty of time to save her
life after we save my money.

278
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,993
Underlying neurological condition
exacerbated by an acute UTI

279
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,995
brought on by
her sexual escapades.

280
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,789
Slut, escapades. How
do we treat? A scarlet A?

281
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,501
Sorry. Acute UTI brought on by her
healthy enjoyment of her womanhood.

282
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,171
We start her on IV ampicillin
and an aminoglycoside.

283
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,059
You ignore us all the time, you
go on crazy joyrides all the time,

284
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,686
but you answer pages, you sleep.

285
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,900
I know I'm gonna regret
doing this, but I'll ask anyway.

286
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,527
Is there anything
I can do to help?

287
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,281
Although...

288
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,674
Great news.

289
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,928
You have an underlying
neurological condition,

290
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,223
which together with your heart...
You said my heart was fine.

291
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,725
Yeah, I also said that I would
get you your career back.

292
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,852
But that doesn't seem to matter

293
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,816
since you've so clearly been
handed the golden spit bucket here.

294
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,861
Sympathetic overdrive.

295
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,491
It's a medical term,
so is "great news."

296
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,996
'Course if you
prefer wallowing...

297
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,666
All you need is a chin,

298
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,459
and a heart, apparently.

299
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,005
You can go back to being the
guy who won 20 of his first 20

300
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,382
instead of the guy who
lost five of his last five.

301
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,719
Technically I counted
the last one as a no contest.

302
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,721
And you save 50 bucks.
I'm a doctor.

303
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,598
I don't tell a fat guy to lay
off bacon for less than 300.

304
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,893
This is about dignity.
For both of us.

305
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,732
Give me your arm.

306
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,110
Give me your arm.

307
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,406
What the hell?

308
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,161
Don't worry, it's just
epinephrine. Is it dangerous?

309
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,914
In the wrong hands,
very. So yeah, sort of.

310
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,084
This will only take
a few seconds.

311
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,464
And you are tachycardic.

312
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,384
You're... Are you psycho?

313
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,636
We combine the increased
heart rate with chest trauma

314
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,806
by applying a little sweet
science to the science.

315
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,267
Don't worry. I'll explain
more when you wake up.

316
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,192
Now, the punch that
supposedly knocked you out

317
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,105
looked like it was thrown by
an old cripple. Kind of like this.

318
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,652
Stop it.
Three, two, one...

319
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,240
Huh.

320
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,785
Guess I must be older and
more crippled than I thought.

321
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,912
You're embarrassing me.

322
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,998
It doesn't make sense.

323
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,666
Maybe if I...

324
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,632
Get the hell out of
my life, you lunatic.

325
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,519
She's in V-tach.
BP's dropping.

326
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,746
Whatever you're
doing isn't working.

327
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,939
Again. There's gotta be
some way to stop the seizures.

328
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,625
It's not a seizure.
She's having a heart attack.

329
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,809
No pulse. CESAR: That's
impossible. She runs marathons.

330
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,323
Charging 200. Clear.

331
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,742
Still no pulse.

332
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,244
Charging 300.
Why is this happening?

333
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,620
Clear.

334
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,874
My theory is that he's only avoiding
us because he really wants to avoid you.

335
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,251
Mah nishtana?

336
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,505
You made it through med school
without ever attending a Seder?

337
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,299
It means, "Why is this night
different from all other nights?"

338
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,219
I'm not sure it is, but usually when
push comes to shove he shows up.

339
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,447
If the patient's still alive, then
push hasn't met shove yet.

340
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,991
The patient is hanging by a
thread and we don't have a clue why.

341
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,726
Then we have to assume
he does, and she isn't.

342
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,689
We could. Or we could assume that
something is seriously wrong with House,

343
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,190
and try to do
something about that.

344
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,193
This way, even if we're
wrong, nobody dies.

345
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,237
House is fine.

346
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,197
House is always fine.

347
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,700
I'm expanding my theory.

348
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,704
He's avoiding you and you're avoiding
him, and this patient is gonna die.

349
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,707
Not if you do your job.

350
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,266
You're an idiot.

351
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,394
How'd you get in here?

352
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,939
My boss has me break
into places all the time.

353
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,528
Pain's been getting worse.

354
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:05,949
Figured if I upped the Vicodin any
more, I'd end up back in a rubber room.

355
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,745
So this seemed like
the smarter choice.

356
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,873
You're an idiot.

357
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,211
You drove all the way over here
to break in and call me an idiot?

358
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,054
No, I drove all the way
over here to tell you

359
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,087
we're implanting an automated
cardio-defibrillator,

360
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,859
which won't actually do
anything to help the patient

361
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,903
except maybe give us enough
time to come up with a guess

362
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,721
as to what's actually
wrong with her.

363
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,098
Oh, that makes more sense.

364
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:35,103
And I broke in here because Cuddy
and Wilson, both, separately, asked me to.

365
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,689
Even more logical.

366
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,025
And that's not heroin.

367
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,277
Which means you knew
I was coming over here

368
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,780
and Cuddy and Wilson are
right. You're just playing a game.

369
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,116
Throwing out a bone and
watching us fight over it.

370
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,745
There is another theory.

371
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,879
Compound CS-804.

372
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,967
It's an experimental drug that's
supposed to re-grow muscle.

373
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,598
This experiment
was done on rats.

374
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,310
It's groundbreaking.
A huge success.

375
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,938
In rats.

376
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:24,069
They got four legs. Think
how fast it should work on one.

377
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,617
You're an idiot.

378
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,391
We've got a problem.

379
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,601
AICD not working?

380
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,662
If it was the defibrillator,
I'd be looking elsewhere.

381
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,521
Smells like bleeding.
Rectal?

382
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,608
And vaginal.

383
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,068
Is it possible something
got perforated during surgery?

384
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,194
Is that an accusation?

385
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,487
Sounded like a question.

386
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,114
Just a straightforward inquiry

387
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,992
that only someone with serious
insecurities would take issue with.

388
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:17,289
Okay. So in answering I have to
decide between the only two possibilities,

389
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,297
"No," and "Yes," we
might have screwed

390
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:21,543
something up but are
intentionally hiding it

391
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,087
"because we're incompetent
and we're asses."

392
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,299
The answer's no. Glad we
didn't short-change that avenue.

393
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,593
It's a blood disorder,
a coagulopathy.

394
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,030
That's not a diagnosis. It's like
saying she has a runny nose.

395
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,307
True. But not saying she has a
runny nose risks getting snot all over us.

396
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,601
We can treat it.
Cause could still be a toxin.

397
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,911
She must have been
exposed to who knows...

398
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,813
Past tense. Which means she
would've been better now that she's not.

399
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,732
Same goes for House.

400
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,503
If this was about Cuddy, he
would have checked out weeks ago.

401
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,529
Something else is
going on. Something new.

402
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,050
That's an awfully simplistic
approach to matters of the heart.

403
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,676
House is rational.
He prides himself on...

404
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,536
No one is rational about emotions.
That's why they're emotions.

405
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,622
What do you think?

406
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,290
Me? I didn't say anything.

407
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,352
Exactly. You always have
some opinion on these things,

408
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,603
especially when
it comes to House,

409
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,563
doubly especially when
it comes to men and romance,

410
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,798
but suddenly you're
keeping your mouth shut.

411
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,388
House can't help us.

412
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,140
I respect his privacy,
no matter how stupid,

413
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,601
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd respect mine.

414
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,525
We need to treat
the underlying condition.

415
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,945
Could be cancer, sepsis, trauma,
liver disease, haemorrhagic fever...

416
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,782
I'm gonna start treating the symptoms while
you finish listing the possible causes.

417
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,281
The rats are doing great.

418
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,408
"Great" is a little vague.

419
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,452
Even better than
the previous study.

420
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,705
12% increase in strength,
22% in flexibility,

421
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,833
and some improvement in
at least 60% of the subjects.

422
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,210
Have you done maximum
tolerated dose studies?

423
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,713
Not yet. But that's
part of the beauty.

424
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,132
Since the compound is
easily excreted in the urine,

425
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,884
as long as they keep hydrated,

426
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,596
there's really no reason to expect
any danger at virtually any dose.

427
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,474
I mean, obviously, can't
know for sure, but...

428
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,197
If it's worthy of the
preface "obviously,"

429
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,395
then obviously, it only needs
to be explained to idiots.

430
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,189
Do I look like an idiot?

431
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,862
Sorry. Cranky.

432
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,574
What I meant to say was, why
don't scientists have groupies?

433
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,992
Because I'd do you right now

434
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,703
if society wasn't telling me that
you're just an underpaid dork.

435
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,664
Thank you.

436
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,544
Are you all right?

437
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,088
Leg hurts.

438
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,383
Would you mind
getting me a coffee?

439
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,428
How does coffee help your leg?

440
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,722
It will prevent me from
walking to get the coffee.

441
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,558
Right.

442
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,419
The page said she's now
bleeding from her mouth.

443
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,839
You started treatment?
I said I would.

444
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,173
A "yes" would have been fine.

445
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,343
Not asking the question
would have been even better.

446
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,512
Any breathing issues?
No.

447
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,348
But I'm not sure it's internal.

448
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,867
If it's coming from
both ends, it's internal.

449
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,935
Her gums look like
they were burned.

450
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,944
Experimental drugs?

451
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,242
That's unfair. 'Cause at one point,
even Vicodin was an experimental drug.

452
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,204
I have to go. Well, unless
you're going to do your job,

453
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,956
it can wait.
I'm going to do my job.

454
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,374
I'll give you a lift.

455
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,628
I'll give you two minutes.

456
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,381
But first I'm going to tell
you that I'm off the drugs

457
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,318
and then you'll feel silly because
you got nothing to say for two minutes.

458
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,343
Hmm.

459
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,429
Why are you off them?
'Cause they don't work.

460
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:10,058
Why were you on them? Because
they come in banana flavor.

461
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,394
You know the answer.

462
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,897
You think fixing your
leg will fix your life.

463
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,067
I think that my life will be
somewhat better if part of my life,

464
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,319
specifically my leg,
is somewhat better.

465
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,905
You think all your
problems are your leg.

466
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,176
So you're here to tell me that no matter
how depressed I may be, it's not enough.

467
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,744
I think you want
everything to be physical,

468
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,329
tangible, simple.

469
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,749
You want unhappiness to have
a cure. House, you obviously...

470
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:35,917
I hate that word.

471
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,586
I have to go now.

472
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,424
Actually, I don't. It would be rude
to walk out without saying anything.

473
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:43,758
What about this?

474
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,511
28-year-old woman presenting
with burn-like wounds in her mouth

475
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,596
and esophagus from
a candidiasis infection.

476
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,683
Interesting. And it would also be
relevant if the woman had had seizures.

477
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,486
If the fungus had
entered her bloodstream...

478
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,270
We would have seen it
in the blood work.

479
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,164
Acute myeloid leukemia can
cause swelling of the gums...

480
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,583
Again, interesting, but not
relevant. Again, you're being an ass.

481
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,877
She doesn't have a history
of blood diseases in her family,

482
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,946
her blood count's normal, and she
hasn't been exposed to a chemical toxin.

483
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,114
Not that we know of.

484
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,551
The guy she works the most
closely with is also her boyfriend.

485
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,885
You don't think he
would've told us

486
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,537
if there'd been some sort
of chemical spill or accident?

487
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,998
There is one other cause of AML.

488
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,295
Wait, where are you taking her?

489
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,939
We need to get her
into an isolation room

490
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,007
and prep for a hematopoietic
stem cell transplant.

491
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,175
Isolation? Why?

492
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,153
We think her blood and immune
system have been destroyed

493
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,928
by an exposure to
ionizing radiation.

494
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,532
We don't work with radiation.
Well, apparently your girlfriend does.

495
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,601
No. She doesn't. You're
wrong, it must be something else.

496
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,580
We found reports that your company
was developing tactical nuclear warheads

497
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,772
for bunker busting bombs.

498
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,735
Where? On Wikipedia?
Some paranoid idiot's blog?

499
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,501
I don't care where
you read it. It's not true.

500
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,129
You're saying there's absolutely no
chance that anyone in your company

501
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,822
is doing any experimental
research that you don't know about.

502
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,575
No. But I know Wendy,
and she wouldn't.

503
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,344
Maybe you don't know her
as well as you thought you did.

504
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,245
Excuse me.
We have to go.

505
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,967
You need a drink.

506
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,220
I'm fine.

507
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,387
That wasn't a question.

508
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,348
You really do need a drink.

509
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,646
We found a match.

510
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,732
We'll start treatment as soon as
we get the HSC from the donor.

511
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,192
Shouldn't be long.

512
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,985
Where's Cesar?

513
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,904
Uh, he's, uh,
in the waiting room.

514
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,364
I want to see him.

515
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,826
We can't. It's too dangerous with
your immune system this compromised.

516
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,705
Why can't he just put on a
gown and a mask like you?

517
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,832
I'm sorry.

518
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,918
The more people you're exposed
to, the greater the chance of infection.

519
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,463
I'm scared.

520
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,383
I know.

521
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,554
We're doing everything that we
can. Cesar will be with you soon.

522
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,973
Dr. Foreman, you
should look at this.

523
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,269
What is it? You feeling any
pain in your pelvic region?

524
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,148
No, why? Your genitals,
they're engorged.

525
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,908
I drink anymore,
I'm gonna explode.

526
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,312
You're not gonna explode.
You're just gonna have a seizure.

527
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,370
Which will prove that your
kidneys are not working,

528
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,083
which will also prove they
weren't working Saturday night.

529
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:27,422
That's why a glancing body blow
sent your blood pressure into the toilet

530
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,549
and you onto the canvas.

531
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,595
How many bottles is
this supposed to take?

532
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,804
Six.

533
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,016
And I've drank how many?
Eight.

534
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,978
It's not an exact science.
In other words,

535
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,813
nothing's gonna prove you wrong.

536
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,667
You're just gonna keep making me
miserable because you're too miserable...

537
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,151
You're an idiot.

538
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,988
And no, you're not gonna hit me.

539
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,908
Because somewhere deep in
that way too thin skull of yours,

540
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,410
you know that
you're full of crap.

541
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,289
That's why you stopped jogging for
me, it's why you drank eight bottles.

542
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,292
Because even though you want to
think that I'm wrong because it's simpler,

543
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,170
you also desperately
want me to be right.

544
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,219
I'm only an ass for building
your hopes up if I'm wrong.

545
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,889
Last one.

546
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,910
You're an ass.

547
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,220
You were wrong, it's
not the end of the world...

548
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,976
Anything else you want to say?

549
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,187
You have a problem.

550
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,232
I think if you seriously
look at everything that...

551
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,945
Anything else?

552
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,241
Okay, look, this isn't...
Okay! Okay, okay.

553
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,244
No, I don't.

554
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,498
Just get out of here.
Go home, we'll talk later.

555
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,376
Some place without
any of my stuff.

556
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,962
Nothing to talk about.
That was my point.

557
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,973
Inflammation of the genitals
means we were wrong.

558
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,616
Thanks for the
statement of the obvious.

559
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,743
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

560
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,704
Foreman wants to keep treating
for radiation poisoning.

561
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,439
Because the seizures have stopped,
because her fever's gone away,

562
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,815
because she's improved.
By luck.

563
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,567
I don't think the patient cares.

564
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,087
Yes. She's gonna die in considerably
less discomfort thanks to you

565
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,322
treating a few of the symptoms
instead of the disease.

566
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,157
I paged...
Shut up.

567
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,366
You're drunk.

568
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,662
Well, whose fault is that?

569
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,832
Give me another scotch.
I can't serve you.

570
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,419
Is it because I'm black?

571
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,922
Because I'm not, so...
Come on, buddy.

572
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,884
What? You can't get me drunk and
then give me crap for being drunk.

573
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,304
That's like dumping someone, and
then giving them crap for being upset.

574
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,805
It's just not decent.

575
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,395
Let me explain
why people come here.

576
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,106
They come here to drink.

577
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,860
Which causes us to ask,
"Why do people drink?" Mmm?

578
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,320
Is it sustenance?

579
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,366
No. Is it taste?

580
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,620
Nope.
Don't be a jerk.

581
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,414
Is it the company of
stout-hearted men?

582
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,624
I don't think so.

583
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,543
Is it killing pain?

584
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:58,674
Yes. 7.5% life duller.

585
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,902
That's the business you're in.

586
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,178
You're in the
screw-the-world business.

587
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,875
You're in the reality-sucks-
and-fantasy-temporarily-

588
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:07,600
appears-to-not-suck business.

589
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,728
Just get the moron a drink
so he'll shut the hell up.

590
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,857
No.

591
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,320
I'm giving you your drink.
Have you no pride?

592
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,324
Either serving me is a
good idea or it's a bad idea.

593
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,495
Shutting me up is a crappy reason
for compromising what you believe.

594
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,872
And not even an
effective one, apparently.

595
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,967
Am I gonna have to hit him?
Not a good idea.

596
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,845
But what if it's
the right thing to do?

597
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,515
Compromise is never the answer.

598
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,102
Stand up.

599
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,650
I will allow you to
throw the first punch.

600
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,194
Sit down. I'm
not gonna hit you.

601
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,613
Just as well,
'cause I was lying.

602
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,631
You can relax.

603
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,800
She's getting better?
The bad news is,

604
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,803
because of your extended
exposure to her and her workplace,

605
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,723
we're gonna need to
treat you as well. I feel fine.

606
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,617
Unfortunately, that's the way
it can be with radiation.

607
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,685
No symptoms until it's
too late to do anything.

608
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,448
You're gonna need
a bone marrow transplant.

609
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,521
No.

610
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,876
A marrow transplant does leave
you exposed to all sorts of illnesses,

611
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,220
but there's really
no choice here.

612
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,987
- She doesn't have radiation
poisoning. - She's getting better.

613
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,965
We need to start our
treatment before it's too late.

614
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,282
No.

615
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,372
You're either suicidal,
or you know we're wrong.

616
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,919
And the only way you can know
for sure what wasn't killing her

617
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,048
is if you knew what was.
And you do, don't you?

618
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,758
Because you've
been poisoning her.

619
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,761
And the reason she's getting better,
is because you haven't been near her.

620
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,472
Our co-workers are on their
way to your home right now

621
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,806
to search it for poisons.

622
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,075
You mind saving
them the trouble?

623
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,435
Attempted murder
is better than murder.

624
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,984
What are you doing here?

625
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,861
Training for my big fight.
Just need you to...

626
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,824
Drink five more bottles,
get punched a few more times?

627
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,492
Look, just get out and give up.

628
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,656
Nah, that's your specialty.

629
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,960
Ooh, looks like you
already lost your big fight.

630
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,879
Look, I may not be able to take
a punch, but I can still throw one.

631
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,923
Three, two...

632
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,722
What a lovely day.

633
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,024
Where's Cesar?

634
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,651
Uh...

635
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,695
In jail.

636
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,199
He was trying to kill you.

637
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,494
He found out about
you and Glenn.

638
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,580
Which, he admitted,
shouldn't have surprised him,

639
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,208
since he started seeing you
while you were dating Tony.

640
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,546
He poisoned me?
Repeatedly.

641
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,173
With Spanish fly.

642
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,134
The active ingredient
cantharidin is a potent toxin

643
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,137
and can cause a lot of the
same damage as radiation.

644
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,225
He poisoned me?

645
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,980
I'm sorry.

646
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,943
He had a security clearance.

647
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,743
What's this?

648
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,412
A palm.

649
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,207
Hmm. Useful
for many things.

650
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,670
Slapping, greasing, probably
some other applications, too.

651
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,964
Right now it's ready
for $50 and humiliation.

652
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,677
He was actually sick? He
wasn't knocked out by the punch,

653
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,012
he was knocked out by
the clinch before the punch.

654
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,639
He took a shot to
the back of the neck.

655
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:01,894
More specifically, to an abnormal growth
of nerves caused by a glomus tumor.

656
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,980
Kind of like a built-in taser sent a
massive shock to his entire body,

657
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,107
shut everything down.

658
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:12,613
Wow. Fascinating. Completely
explains exactly how he lost.

659
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,325
Oh, you are not gonna be like that,
because you've got a lot more posters here.

660
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,787
No. I'm not.
Well done, House.

661
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,498
You might have saved that guy.
Given him his life back.

662
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,835
No, no. He needs surgery.
He's never gonna fight again.

663
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,298
What happened to
your eye? You okay?

664
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,634
Better than okay.
