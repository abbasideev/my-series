1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,926
This election day,

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,429
the fate of our borders
is in your hands.

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:19,853
John Moreno wants to invite
illegal immigrants into our country.

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,939
He wants to give them our jobs.

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,609
He wants to give
them our healthcare.

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,779
John Moreno wants to give
them the American dream

7
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,449
and he wants you to pay for it.

8
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,792
"Whose side is he really
on?"

9
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,127
It's a valid question.

10
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,271
He favors easing restrictions.

11
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,296
So do I.

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,884
Come on, Hal, your position
on work visas is irrelevant.

13
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,886
He's talking about
a path to citizenship.

14
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,223
I'm telling you. This ad
wins you the election.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,225
By insulting one of
my core constituencies?

16
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,978
Come on, in '04, I had
45% of the Latino vote.

17
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,731
And this year, you're running
against a guy named Moreno.

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,817
This isn't one of your races in
South Carolina or Oklahoma, Joe.

19
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,654
This is New Jersey. People vote
for me because I'm a moderate.

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,738
Well, that's great.

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,324
You can be the most moderate
ex-senator in the country.

22
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,744
Hal, the election
IS seven days away

23
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,331
and even our own internals
show you down six points.

24
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,874
We've always been the underdog

25
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,358
and we've always
found a way to win.

26
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,587
I know, because you have always
let me do what's needed to be done.

27
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,174
Now, I can have this
on the air tomorrow.

28
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,512
No, no.

29
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,797
Come on, Hal, let me do this.

30
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,516
No, absolutely not. This
could totally galvanize the left.

31
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,519
You all right, Joe?

32
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,521
Yeah, I think I got
some kind of a rash.

33
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,855
What the hell?

34
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,107
That's not a rash.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,817
Maybe I should call a doctor.

36
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,111
Better call an ambulance.

37
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,980
Look at it like this,

38
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,565
of all the ways to rupture it,

39
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,984
nothing honors
the real Achilles more

40
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,320
than blowing the
dismount on a keg stand.

41
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,739
What's that smell?

42
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,700
Onions? Peppers?

43
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,412
Oh, I know.
It's a sausage-fest.

44
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,165
Sausage-fest implies multiples.

45
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,417
Now if you're talking
yardage, I'd have to agree.

46
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,085
I'm talking about
your department.

47
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,754
You still haven't
replaced Thirteen.

48
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,505
It's coming along.

49
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,507
You've had plenty of
time to find someone.

50
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,711
I've found plenty of someones,
just haven't kept them.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,261
It's time to end the cycle.

52
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,679
Meet your new team member.

53
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,514
Her name is
Martha M. Masters.

54
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,352
This doctor is not a doctor.

55
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,936
She's a third-year med student.

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,855
She graduated high school
when she was 15.

57
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,416
She filled out the
time before med school

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,109
getting PhDs in both
applied math and art history.

59
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,780
Should be incredibly useful if my
next patient is an Escher drawing.

60
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,385
Those things are
seriously screwed up.

61
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,075
This isn't a suggestion.

62
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,370
Just because my sausage
has been filling your bun

63
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,704
doesn't mean you get to decide

64
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,791
what flavor chips
I nosh on during the day.

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,877
No. I get to do that
because I'm your boss.

66
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,135
Patient is Joe Dugan, 42,
political consultant.

67
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,929
Presents with palpable purpura

68
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,223
and ALT and AST
are through the roof.

69
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,142
Otherwise known as rash
and liver damage. Fascinating.

70
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,186
Senator Anderson
sent this case to us

71
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,938
and personally requested
we take a look.

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,648
That's reason enough for me.

73
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,900
Black guy campaigning
for the opposition?

74
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,235
Does Obama know about this?

75
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,113
I tried calling him on the
Brother Hotline. He didn't pick up.

76
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,997
Martha M. Masters?

77
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,501
I'm Dr. House. This
is the rest of the team,

78
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,170
Boring, Bimbo and Bite-Size.

79
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,173
Martha enjoys quadratic
equations, Italian frescos,

80
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,426
and her turn-ons include
"learning to be a doctor."

81
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,345
Take a seat.

82
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,013
She's a med student?

83
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,141
Cuddy thinks she's
some kind of genius.

84
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,685
Say something brilliant.

85
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,438
Oh, I don't...

86
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,440
Capital of Azerbaijan.
Baku.

87
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,567
Year Beethoven died.
1827.

88
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,694
Twentieth decimal
of Euler's number.

89
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,362
Six.

90
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,699
It's my favorite constant.

91
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,534
She's like the Internet
with breasts.

92
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,120
No, wait,
the Internet has breasts.

93
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,164
Our patient's liver
damage explains the rash

94
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,874
and cryoglobulins
we found in his blood,

95
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,584
but we can't explain
the liver damage.

96
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,395
He shows no other signs
of drug or alcohol abuse...

97
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,896
Now all you've got
to do is figure out

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,173
which one is Bimbo
and which one is Bite-Size.

99
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,594
Also which monster truck won
the 2004 Thunder Nationals?

100
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,346
Hep C makes sense.

101
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,515
Test came back negative,
same for Hep A and B.

102
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,268
The answer we were
looking for is Virginia Giant.

103
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,562
Feel free to chime in
on either conversation.

104
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,734
Hate to steal the spotlight
from Small Wonder over here,

105
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,402
but what about toxic exposure?

106
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,737
Tetrachloroethylene.

107
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,114
Could even be pennyroyal
or sassafrass oil.

108
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,617
Go to his house,
get me some chemicals.

109
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,078
If you wanna stay on this team,

110
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,247
have an opinion.

111
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,840
Oh, cool.

112
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,717
Tudor revival architecture.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,470
Steeply pitched asymmetrical
roof over the entrance.

114
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,224
But it doesn't have the
half-timbering over the facade.

115
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,725
Doesn't say anything
about medicine.

116
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,685
Can't shut up about
architecture. Great.

117
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,562
I know. I don't know
what happened.

118
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,608
Being around House... He's
such a legend, he's so intimidating.

119
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,361
I'm not like that
around ordinary people.

120
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,115
Oh, not that you guys
are ordinary.

121
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,760
It's just that he's so brilliant

122
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,824
and you work under him,
so you're not as imposing...

123
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,289
I'm gonna be quiet.
Good idea.

124
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,418
Dugan didn't give you a key?

125
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,003
If patients know we're coming,

126
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,940
they can hide something
relevant to their illness,

127
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,715
intentionally or
unintentionally.

128
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,467
Their knowledge changes things.

129
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,274
Are you a vampire?

130
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,985
It's okay.
We're inviting you in.

131
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,444
But our patient didn't.

132
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,030
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,163
Well, she's gonna be a big help.

134
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,708
Yeah, what a rube,
being uncomfortable

135
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,084
breaking into
a stranger's house.

136
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,395
It's part of
our job description.

137
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,170
Not the most
morally ambiguous part.

138
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,424
Give her a chance.
She's fresh, enthusiastic,

139
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,175
has no bad habits
we need to re-teach.

140
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,761
She's a med student with
no practical experience.

141
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,222
That means every
procedure, every blood draw,

142
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,141
she needs one of
us there to supervise.

143
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,977
Is this attitude about her not
having an M.D. after her name?

144
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,497
Because I wonder if it has more
to do with her being a brainiac.

145
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,606
That's not it at all.

146
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,958
I'm not thrilled
someone else might be

147
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,442
the smartest person
on the team now.

148
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,068
I can only imagine how you feel.

149
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,362
You're not smarter
than me. Oh, yeah?

150
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,032
You find this?

151
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,826
A jug of unpasteurized cider.

152
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,286
Could be tainted with E coll.

153
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,288
That's what's causing
the liver to shut down.

154
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,956
E coli is found in animals.

155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,916
So unless he's
drinking pork cider...

156
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,169
Pork cider.

157
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,563
I need the number
of the patent office.

158
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,714
There are indirect ways
of contracting E coli.

159
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,050
Masters refused to go
on the search with us.

160
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,217
Interesting.

161
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,552
Which raises the question,

162
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,304
what is your problem with her?

163
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,640
He is intimidated
by her intelligence.

164
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,141
Why would that bother Taub?

165
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,727
He's been working with people
smarter than him for a long time.

166
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,813
I think perky new girl
makes him feel old.

167
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,982
She's basically
the same age as Thirteen.

168
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,194
She's a student, makes you
contemplate your med school days,

169
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,154
back when you had hair,
muscle tone

170
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,073
and no need for
a regular prostate exam.

171
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,491
Makes sense.

172
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,117
Just like E coli.

173
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,554
Orchards make cider out of
apples they can't sell otherwise.

174
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,538
Like if they've fallen
onto the ground...

175
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,415
Like into some cow feces.

176
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:25,338
Which would mean our esteemed
patient is literally full of BS.

177
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,506
Cool.

178
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,424
Go get the ingenue
and start the patient

179
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,760
on Aztreonam and plasmapheresis.

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,056
He said to start
the patient on...

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,852
The cell-sorter
separates the plasma

182
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,455
from the remaining
cellular components,

183
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,563
thereby removing...

184
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,274
The toxins, antibodies,
cryoglobulins.

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,111
I think we should tell our patient
about breaking into his house.

186
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,278
Why would we do that?

187
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,724
Because the reason
not to tell him

188
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,657
was that he might
hide something,

189
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,158
now that rationale is moot.

190
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,954
The rationale now IS
no upside, big downside.

191
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,206
How can we ask
our patients to trust us

192
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,489
if we're not honest with them?

193
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,062
How can we ask
the patient to trust us

194
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,961
after we tell him
he can't trust us?

195
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,756
Fine. Tell him.

196
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,676
Clear your conscience
because that's what's important.

197
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,389
Well, if you had
let me run that ad,

198
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,350
everybody would be talking
about immigration instead.

199
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,120
All right, look, here's
what we're gonna say.

200
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,980
"Yeah, he was in Iraq and
we're all grateful for his sacrifice.

201
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,624
"You chose to honor
your country through

202
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,317
"public service and
have voted 46 times

203
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,361
"to expand the Pentagon's
budget for programs

204
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,905
"which, by the way,
Moreno wants to cut."

205
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,366
All right. I'll draft it
up and send it over.

206
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,161
You should probably slow down

207
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,871
until you're out
of the hospital.

208
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,165
It's a busy week.

209
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,798
Aren't you curious how we
came up with this diagnosis?

210
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,467
You're doctors.
Isn't that your job?

211
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,594
But how we knew you
were drinking apple cider.

212
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,471
You had to have
found that at my house,

213
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,306
so I guess you guys
broke in there.

214
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,478
It doesn't bother you?

215
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,812
Medicine is like politics.

216
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,896
At the end of the day,
all that matters is results.

217
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,065
That's not true.

218
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,317
Respect matters.

219
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,528
Honesty and integrity matter...

220
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,773
Have you ever thought about
running for public office?

221
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,534
Because I would love to have
someone like you as an opponent.

222
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,330
Watch the replacement
fluid line.

223
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,748
Oh, right, sorry.

224
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,501
You ever wonder why
American voter turnout rates

225
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,587
are among the lowest
in the developed world?

226
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,217
Mr. Dugan?

227
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,677
Mr. Dugan?

228
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,430
What's wrong?
Can you hear me?

229
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,393
He's paralyzed. Call Foreman
and Chase. Get them down here.

230
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,021
Mr. Dugan?

231
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,028
We think it's a transient
ischemic attack.

232
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,048
The clot must have broken up
before we could find it.

233
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,116
He's temporarily paralyzed, but
he's regaining mobility and speech.

234
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,411
So what causes rash,
liver failure, clots

235
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,123
and the uncontrollable urge
to rat out your co-workers?

236
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,627
Oh, no, wait, that last one
was you, not the patient.

237
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,504
I wasn't trying to rat.

238
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,423
I was clearly trying to
honor my ethical obligation.

239
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,262
Portal vein thrombosis could
be caused by Wilson's disease.

240
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,680
Hooray!

241
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,642
You popped your cherry,

242
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,435
diagnostically speaking.

243
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,813
Unfortunately,
first time always sucks.

244
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,231
Pitch doesn't make any sense,

245
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,816
Dugan's cornea was normal.

246
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,526
You're obviously brilliant.

247
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,319
Why would you hide your mind?

248
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,779
I was brainstorming.

249
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,966
I'm not talking about your
stupid ideas about the patient.

250
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,700
I mean your stupid ideas
about morality.

251
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,535
My stupid ideas
are what most doctors

252
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,121
consider the rules for
professional conduct.

253
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,332
What about
a neuro-endocrine tumor?

254
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,168
Not without diminished mental
capacity, loss of judgment.

255
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,298
Disseminated intravascular
coagulation, however, fits.

256
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,341
Rules are just
helpful guidelines

257
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,594
for stupid people who can't
make up their own mind.

258
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,471
You obviously don't fit into that
category, so why put yourself there?

259
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,515
Masters is right

260
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,559
about a neuro-endocrine tumor.

261
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,687
Because, yes, Dugan
has had a loss of judgment.

262
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,355
He made this
totally inflammatory

263
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,774
anti-immigration campaign
commercial for Anderson.

264
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,942
It just got leaked online.

265
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,569
You're arguing Dugan's politics

266
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,130
are a sign that
he's mentally compromised?

267
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,698
No, his tactics. He's most
likely the one who leaked it

268
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,677
and all the commentators are saying
Anderson will catch a major backlash.

269
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,286
And honesty is a great idea

270
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,456
until your patient asks if her
distended abdomen makes her look fat.

271
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,708
House, I hate to interrupt
your ethics debate,

272
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,391
but we have two solid
ideas on the table.

273
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,716
CT from his neck to his abdomen
for neuro-endocrine tumors.

274
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,719
And run a D-dimer
and fibrinogen for DIC.

275
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,017
Masters,

276
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,688
if lying to a patient would
save their life, would you do it?

277
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,523
No.

278
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,025
That's a lie.

279
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,403
If your grandma gave you a
really crappy tea cozy for Christmas,

280
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,863
would you tell her you liked it?

281
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,698
Yes, but that's different.

282
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,222
So you lie when it doesn't
matter, but you won't when it does.

283
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,036
How'd you get so screwed up?

284
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,836
How mad would you be
if I fired Masters?

285
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,380
Very.

286
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,549
Unless you had cause.
Real cause.

287
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,552
Cause that a human being
would consider cause.

288
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,179
Never mind, then.

289
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,889
She's got principles.

290
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,976
She's like the love child of
Einstein and Mary Poppins.

291
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,269
Didn't even get Einstein's hair.

292
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,647
It's worth having
someone on the team

293
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,149
who doesn't see the world
entirely as shades of gray.

294
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,901
It is gray.
To you.

295
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,987
She has a fresh perspective.

296
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,406
Unless that threatens you.

297
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,783
It does not...

298
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,079
You thought I'd get defensive,
keep her out of pride?

299
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,914
Girl can hope.

300
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,166
House,

301
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,794
I gave this a lot of thought.

302
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,087
She deserves a chance.

303
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,464
A real chance.

304
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,306
House is gonna fire me.

305
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,100
No, he isn't.

306
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,852
Because you told him not to?

307
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,771
Butting heads with House
is par for the course.

308
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,189
House has strong beliefs,

309
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,067
and he respects other
people with strong beliefs.

310
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,820
It's not my beliefs
that are the problem.

311
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,155
It's my personality.

312
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,657
I'm not good at working
with other people.

313
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,534
You've been in there
for less than a day.

314
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,871
I wasn't looking for
encouragement, it's a fact.

315
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,082
Growing up,
my whole life, really,

316
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,501
I spent a lot of time by myself.

317
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,479
No one in high school
wants to hang out with a kid

318
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,547
that's three years
younger than them.

319
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,216
And studying
Anosov diffeomorphisms,

320
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,846
determining whether an unattributed
landscape is a Blakelock or a Ryder...

321
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,349
I'm actually
boring you right now.

322
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,479
And yet, you chose medicine,
which is a team activity.

323
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,816
Pretty gutsy, stepping so
far outside your comfort zone.

324
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,819
I'm not trying
to prove anything.

325
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,406
I just wanted to be a doctor.

326
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,033
It was stupid.

327
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,494
Nobody can do everything.

328
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,873
I was vain to think I
could be the exception.

329
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,129
House doesn't care if you're a
team player, or how ethical you are,

330
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,090
or how high your IQ is.

331
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,009
It's all about the cases.

332
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,011
You help him crack this one,

333
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,763
you two are gonna
get along just fine.

334
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,351
We gotta give Masters
some pointers.

335
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,812
Help her figure out
how to deal with House.

336
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,647
Why would I do that?

337
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,358
The entertainment factor
is off the charts.

338
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,320
It's like watching a bunny
hopping into a buzzsaw, repeatedly.

339
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,155
And if we don't help her,
she's out of here.

340
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,283
No, something else is
stopping House from firing her.

341
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,411
I'm guessing it's his desire to
keep having sex with Cuddy.

342
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,456
You
guys ready to admit you were wrong yet?

343
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,292
Excuse me?

344
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,130
This tumor you're looking for,
you're not gonna find it.

345
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,632
My judgment is completely sound.

346
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,969
So when you leaked that ad,

347
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,721
you were trying to torpedo
the Senator's campaign?

348
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,308
All right. One, I told you
before, I didn't leak that spot.

349
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,018
Uh-huh.

350
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,270
And two,

351
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,124
whoever did leak that ad had
nothing wrong with their mind either.

352
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,607
It's gonna save Anderson.

353
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,694
That commercial,
everyone sees through it.

354
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,047
You're just trying to
play to people's fears.

355
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,533
You say fears, I say
rational, protective instincts.

356
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,452
And judging by your accent,

357
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,329
immigration probably
isn't an issue

358
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,456
you can be real impartial about.

359
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,917
I waited five years
to get my green card.

360
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,641
If there's anyone who
would resent someone

361
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,462
trying to skip the queue,
it'd be me.

362
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,065
But just because
Moreno favors amnesty...

363
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,132
He doesn't.

364
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,944
You know that picture of
him with the Mexican flag,

365
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,137
seems to be from
a pro-amnesty rally?

366
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,265
That's from an Amnesty
International speech

367
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,268
protesting the imprisonment
of priests in Oaxaca.

368
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,230
Yes, you did just
prove that that ad

369
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,833
is even more disgusting
than you thought.

370
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,067
You also proved
that ad is effective.

371
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,322
You still think
my judgment is off?

372
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,782
Not anymore.

373
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,409
There's no sign of a tumor.

374
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,119
That leaves DIC.

375
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,243
I'll go check how Taub is
doing with the blood work.

376
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,938
I guess when you
get on in years,

377
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,149
it takes a little longer to
run a few simple blood tests.

378
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,801
This whole "Taub's an old
man" thing, kind of rings hollow

379
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,346
considering I'm in better shape
than you are. Pass the dye.

380
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,972
You're in rounder shape than me.

381
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,976
Tonight after work, meet at
the basketball courts in the gym.

382
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,771
You do realize you're two
and a half feet tall, right?

383
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,731
And white. And Jewish.

384
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,066
It'd be very embarrassing.

385
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,567
I get why you'd want to say no.

386
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,527
Tonight, after work.

387
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,905
Crap.

388
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,285
You hear Moreno's
latest stump speech?

389
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,788
He's gonna clean up Washington.

390
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,748
Yeah, right.
Like any politician

391
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,416
from New Jersey
has ever cleaned up.

392
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,044
Who else knows that
you leaked that ad?

393
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,296
You and I had
the only two copies, Hal.

394
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,358
I don't care that you did it,

395
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,841
I just want to
make sure it worked.

396
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,136
This morning's tracking
has me within two points.

397
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,515
I told you.

398
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,878
We're gonna pull this thing off.

399
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,937
Your blood test for DIC
came back completely normal.

400
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,105
That's good news, right?

401
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,482
It means the two things we
thought it could be, it's not.

402
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,818
We checked your home
for toxins and didn't find any,

403
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,255
but it's possible you might have
been exposed on the campaign.

404
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,156
Have you visited any
industrial or agricultural facilities?

405
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,367
There was a tomato farm
in Lumberton.

406
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,678
Did they take you
into the fields?

407
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,121
No one wants a photo op
with me. I never leave the bus.

408
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,765
Were the windows open?
Certain pesticides...

409
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,040
Foreman?

410
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,212
What? What is it?

411
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,673
It's not just your liver
we have to worry about.

412
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,384
It looks like your kidneys
are having problems, too.

413
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,184
So this guy
spends his entire life

414
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,562
campaigning
against bleeding hearts.

415
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,522
Turns out, he has one.

416
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,650
Bloody urine actually is a
renal problem, not a cardiac one.

417
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,402
Yeah. If I say
something inaccurate,

418
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,737
assume it's for comic effect.

419
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,031
Then laugh, because it's funny.

420
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,034
TTP makes sense.
Where are his platelets?

421
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,660
Two hundred thousand.
It's not TTP.

422
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,370
What about
Henoch-Schönlein purpura?

423
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,580
HSP doesn't cause clots.

424
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,458
HSP doesn't usually
cause clots, but it can.

425
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,710
And the vasculitis would
explain the kidney problem.

426
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,170
She can't diagnose a joke,

427
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,921
but she's making progress
on the patient.

428
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,217
We treat with
chemotherapy or steroids.

429
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,719
We treat with chemotherapy.

430
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,804
I said chemo.

431
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,972
And then you said "or."

432
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,766
Once again,
the bunny meets the blade.

433
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,894
The road to dead
patients is paved with "or's."

434
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,146
Chemo is the more
effective treatment,

435
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,374
which means it will confirm
our diagnosis more quickly...

436
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,067
I agree,
but there is another option.

437
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,568
There are lots of other options.

438
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,445
There's bloodletting,
crystals, prayer...

439
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,155
Another medically
accepted option.

440
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,366
Which is both less
effective and less scary.

441
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,368
So the patient
might just choose it.

442
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,251
Unless, of course,
we don't mention it to him.

443
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,581
We can't withhold information.

444
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,542
If we explain both the benefits
and the risks of each treatment,

445
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,378
I'm sure Dugan
will choose chemo.

446
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,046
Well, as long as you're sure.

447
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,717
The better option
is chemotherapy.

448
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,470
It's faster and more likely
to completely cure you.

449
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,596
I'll take the steroids.

450
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,015
Oh, my goodness.

451
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,725
If only someone
could have predicted

452
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,228
that you'd make that
incredibly stupid decision.

453
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,107
The nausea and
fatigue from chemo

454
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,441
will only last a few weeks.

455
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,734
Our poll numbers have stalled,

456
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,486
that's five days
till the election.

457
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,169
Doctor, can you talk
some sense into him?

458
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,950
Would that I could, but ethics
dictate that it's his decision.

459
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,119
So all I can do now
is return to my office,

460
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,038
knowing that even as my
patient endangers himself,

461
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,999
my integrity
remains unblemished.

462
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,003
Please, take some time
to think about this.

463
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,548
I don't need any time. I
want to start on the steroids.

464
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,433
Game to eleven by ones.

465
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,851
Hold on.

466
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,066
Wanna shoot for outs?

467
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,359
You can have it.

468
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,865
One, nothing.

469
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,701
You're gonna guard me?

470
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,619
You can't hit two in a row.

471
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,749
Two, nothing. You're
gonna guard me now?

472
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,418
You can have that shot all day.

473
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,757
Three, nothing.

474
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,517
1-3.

475
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,636
10-7.

476
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,277
Seriously?

477
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,904
You're gonna beat me with that?

478
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,077
I was wrong.

479
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,411
You're not so old.

480
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,538
Thank you.

481
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,873
Now all we have
to do is figure out

482
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,042
why Masters is
making you feel insecure.

483
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,884
I was just down by Dugan's room.

484
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,946
They were gonna give him
the wrong medicine.

485
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,180
I tried to change the order,
but I'm not a doctor.

486
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,598
Good.

487
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,892
The wrong medicine
is the right medicine.

488
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,436
But he wanted steroids,
not chemo.

489
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,188
He wants to live.

490
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,774
I'm gonna tell him
what's going on.

491
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,192
No, you're not.

492
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,279
I don't mind your
morality, in theory.

493
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,573
But, in practice, you're
risking my patient's life.

494
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,157
So you're fired.

495
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,136
You think that's gonna
stop me from telling him?

496
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,705
If you do, I'll get you
thrown out of medical school.

497
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,624
I haven't done anything
that would merit that.

498
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,210
I know, but unlike you,
I'm willing to lie.

499
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,383
Firing her was a mistake.

500
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,344
We need someone like her on
the team, keeping us all in check.

501
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,657
You're incapable of noticing
when I do something inappropriate?

502
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,492
We're like the frogs who've
been in the pot for a while,

503
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,601
we're used to the heat.

504
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,228
Things have been just fine
without Pippi Long-Division.

505
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,592
Your opponent's out of the race.

506
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,315
You can drop the smear campaign.

507
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,026
Dugan's developed
pulmonary edema, it's not HSP.

508
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,902
Masters was right.

509
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,196
He didn't want the chemo,
he didn't need the chemo.

510
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,699
Masters was wrong,
he doesn't have HSP.

511
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,076
And Masters is gone.

512
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,244
Could be an infection.

513
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,609
We had him on Aztreonam
for the E coli, he didn't respond.

514
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,957
Schistosomiasis wouldn't
respond to Aztreonam.

515
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,167
That's a great idea,

516
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,377
if he was running a
political campaign in Africa.

517
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,254
Guy hasn't been out of
the country in years.

518
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,757
Who needs to travel when
you've got a giant fish tank,

519
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,134
loaded with tropical fish,
tropical snails

520
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,844
carrying tropical bacteria,

521
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,387
like schistomiasis.

522
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,182
Go break into his home,
get me some escargot.

523
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,185
Unless you want to ask
the patient's permission,

524
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,145
as a tribute to the departed.

525
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,985
Need a minute.

526
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,990
You said you were
gonna give her a chance.

527
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,076
I did. She used
that opportunity

528
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,577
to endanger our patient's life.

529
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,288
By insisting he receive the
treatment that he asked for.

530
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,498
That's what I just said.

531
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,625
Your team is there
to challenge you.

532
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,311
I didn't fire her
because she's a challenge,

533
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,587
I fired her because she
is an immutable obstacle.

534
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,690
You gonna make me hire her?
How do you think that'll work out?

535
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,132
How do you think
that'll work out?

536
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,300
He's right.
I'll just...

537
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,219
You will not quit this job.

538
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,846
What is going on?

539
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,766
I want her gone, she wants
to be gone. Why do you care?

540
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,270
You don't actually think she's
a younger version of you?

541
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,148
Because let me tell you,
you're not that smart, or moral.

542
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,483
Socially awkward, maybe.

543
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,777
She's a potential star and
I want her in my hospital.

544
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,655
No problem. Just find
her a different department.

545
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,326
I think I figured it out,

546
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,620
why Taub didn't like Masters.

547
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,388
Now you're getting
involved in this, too?

548
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,417
My previous source of
entertainment just got fired.

549
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,544
Exactly.
She's gone. It's over.

550
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,421
She's totally moral and uptight,

551
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,881
which made Taub feel badly
about his cheating.

552
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,800
Can we get a move on?

553
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,168
He didn't like her even before
he knew about her morals.

554
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,680
From the minute he saw her.

555
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,642
So it's something
about how she looked.

556
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,894
All right.

557
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,230
No snails.
Let's get out of here.

558
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,693
Hello?

559
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,908
Yeah. It's Foreman.

560
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,201
What did you find?

561
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,411
Nothing helpful but...

562
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,806
There's gotta be something.
Dugan's gone completely downhill.

563
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,665
Now fluid's collecting
in his chest.

564
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,834
Where the hell are you guys?

565
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,169
In jail.

566
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,630
You gonna come bail us out?

567
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,091
Uh, kind of busy.

568
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,557
Thank you all
for coming down here at this late hour.

569
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,559
I assure you
I will be brief.

570
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,479
There has been a lot of
discussion about an attack ad

571
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,647
that leaked online
earlier this week.

572
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,488
There you are.

573
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,492
I was starting to think that my
holier-than-thou-dar was malfunctioning.

574
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:03,205
Our patient's liver, kidneys
and lungs are failing,

575
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,956
I need you to
help me figure out why.

576
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,085
As I recall, you have three actual
doctors you haven't fired today.

577
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,378
They're in jail.

578
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,630
What? Why?

579
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,881
Prostitution.

580
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,674
So, you're re-hired.

581
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,558
It all started in the liver,
but where in the liver.

582
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,685
If in the ducts, then
primary biliary cirrhosis...

583
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,814
Yeah, I don't need to hear
your ideas. Just return the volley.

584
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,191
Primary sclerosing cholangitis.

585
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,110
Nope. His vitamin A level
is normal.

586
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,198
Gall bladder problems can
affect the liver. Cholecystitis...

587
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,469
He's talking about our
patient. I've known Joe...

588
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,619
Did you just shush me?

589
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:46,039
For many years and
thought he was a friend.

590
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:51,044
That is until he leaked
this hurtful, hateful ad.

591
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,839
I think he's lying.
Dugan said...

592
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,966
I think the technical term
is speaking...

593
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,218
Dugan violated my trust.

594
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,596
And therefore I have
no other recourse

595
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,723
than to fire him
from my campaign.

596
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,477
Thank you and there will
be no further questions.

597
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,234
Thanks for your help.

598
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,905
Oh. And you're
fired again.

599
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,373
He screwed you.

600
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,916
That was a hell of a move.

601
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,751
He used the ad to
shore up the base,

602
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,753
fire the extremist
to hold the center.

603
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,964
No, I mean he
actually screwed you.

604
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,217
Taking weekend trips
down to Bunbury.

605
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,221
He's got a red blotch on his
hand, that's palmar erythema.

606
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,975
That and the fact that he's got a
permanent sheen of Nixonian flop sweat.

607
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,144
He's got Hepatitis C.

608
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,770
Which explains
all your symptoms.

609
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,940
That's great, but the Senator
and I have not had sex.

610
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,744
Well, then, the two of
you shot up together.

611
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,737
How many high-functioning
heroin users do you know?

612
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,572
Actually, quite a few.

613
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,658
Look, I know you've got Hep C.

614
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,912
So either you shared
a bed together,

615
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,080
you shared a needle,

616
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,666
or you shared a straw.

617
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,380
I'm talking
about coke, not Coke.

618
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,674
You can get Hep C
from doing cocaine?

619
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
Look, I will deny it...
Don't care.

620
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,055
They tested me for Hep C when
I came in here, I don't have it.

621
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,892
Well, apparently your liver picked
up a few of your campaign tactics.

622
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,770
It's hiding all your secrets
by producing cryoglobulins

623
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,522
so the Hep C tests
come back negative.

624
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,650
Now, I could look for
all the associated toxins,

625
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,318
but the plasmapheresis
got rid of those.

626
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,111
So, basically,
you've got a disease,

627
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,571
but there's no way to prove it.

628
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,031
It's pretty cool, huh?

629
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,241
What is that?

630
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,871
This is interferon. It delays
the onset of rigor mortis.

631
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,924
When did your lawyer say
he was coming to get us?

632
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,426
He said, and I'm quoting here,

633
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,387
"Soon."

634
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,763
I know...

635
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,391
The reason you hated Masters
from the moment you saw her...

636
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,600
Come on.

637
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,978
That was not the
first time you saw her.

638
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,312
That is brilliant.

639
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,235
It's really not.

640
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,363
Is that guy seriously
using the toilet?

641
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,948
Oh, my God, he's sitting down.

642
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,575
Don't try to change the
subject. Did you sleep with her?

643
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,537
No wonder he's in jail. Anyone
who would do that has no shame.

644
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,581
Or maybe he tried to sleep
with her, and she shot him down.

645
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,125
I don't know her.

646
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,628
Is he grunting?
I think I hear grunting.

647
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,422
You realize we're
not gonna drop this.

648
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,801
I didn't sleep with her.

649
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,679
I interviewed her
for Hopkins Med School.

650
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,017
So you're holding a grudge
because she chose a different school?

651
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,520
We talked for an hour.
She didn't remember me.

652
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,066
She remembers the 20th
digit of some math constant,

653
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,611
but she doesn't remember a guy
she had a one-on-one meeting with.

654
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,489
I barely remember you.

655
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,116
Mystery solved.

656
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,618
Now we can all go
back to our lives.

657
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,007
Great news.

658
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,259
I've decided to re-hire you.

659
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,802
Find another sounding board.

660
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,888
Dugan's got Hep C...
I'm not doing this.

661
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,057
But he's not
responding to interferon.

662
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,143
You must think I have
absolutely no self-esteem.

663
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,564
Ethics and self-esteem?
You really are a pain in the ass.

664
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,692
What treats Hep C
besides interferon?

665
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,985
Now you want me to talk?

666
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,236
Yeah.

667
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,741
Come on. Stop pretending
you're not gonna do this.

668
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,994
As much you hate me,
you hate failing more.

669
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,497
I didn't fail. You
fired me, repeatedly.

670
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,666
But if you walk away now, after
I just re-hired you, that's quitting.

671
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,380
A German research study showed

672
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,174
that 15% of patients with Hep C

673
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,009
were cured after
contracting Hep A.

674
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,345
Of course other studies
have shown that up to 85%

675
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,555
of doubly-infected patients
die very quickly.

676
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,433
So, in theory, if we can find
something that mimics Hep A...

677
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,811
There is one thing
that mimics Hep A,

678
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,437
Hep A.

679
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,730
Good work.

680
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,690
You're fired.

681
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,942
No.

682
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,321
Hep A could cure him.

683
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,697
Better chance it will kill him.

684
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,534
Tell the lab to release a Hep A
culture to me. We'll see who's right.

685
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,203
It's not an approved treatment
and exposes us to liability.

686
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,830
There's no way
I can let you do this.

687
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,873
That's an extremely
cowardly position.

688
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,377
Listen to the genius.

689
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,546
You're the one that
insisted he run this by me.

690
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,965
It's proper protocol for an
unconventional treatment.

691
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,468
But we shouldn't compromise
patient care just to avoid lawsuits.

692
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:54,389
What about the fact that we don't
have any proof he actually has Hep C?

693
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,016
That is a perfectly
valid objection.

694
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,144
Don't listen to her. She
doesn't even work for me.

695
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,604
If you really think that this
is the only way to cure him,

696
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,274
I will risk the lawsuit,
but I need to know

697
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,401
that he actually
has the disease.

698
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,610
Get me proof.

699
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,696
I've given you...
Proof.

700
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,867
Get me proof he has Hep C
and then you can give him Hep A.

701
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,993
I can't.

702
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,286
You'll figure something out.

703
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,080
The two of you have a
combined IQ north of 300.

704
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,834
That's also true of five morons.

705
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,671
Go. Work.

706
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,133
So what do we do now?

707
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,736
Considering the fact that I'm
about to do something unethical...

708
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,762
Oh, right, yeah.
I'm fired.

709
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,102
Missed you. We need a
false positive Hep C test.

710
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,937
And why would we
want to do that?

711
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,565
The world changes when
you're on the inside.

712
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,525
You just got to roll
with it once you get out.

713
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,445
You think he contracted
Hep C from the Senator, right?

714
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,197
Test Anderson.
If he's positive,

715
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,591
that's evidence
that Dugan has it, too.

716
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,782
Evidence. Not proof.

717
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,826
Are we presenting this
to a jury of our peers?

718
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,095
That should be enough for Cuddy.

719
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,287
Should be, but it won't be.

720
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,582
The test for Hep C
is 99.9% accurate.

721
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,210
That means one in every
thousand tests is a false positive.

722
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,545
We do enough,
maybe we get lucky.

723
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,132
I smell like jail.

724
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,636
A false false positive.
That's the best we can do?

725
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,681
Okay, go do it.

726
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,044
I have a problem.

727
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,756
A medical problem.

728
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,508
Which could become...

729
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,013
I have lied to Cuddy
10,000 times.

730
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,267
How do you think
she'd feel about 10,0017

731
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,186
I think you probably
already know the answer.

732
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,522
But it doesn't make any sense.

733
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,649
You don't understand why a woman

734
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,652
might be upset because
her boyfriend lied to her?

735
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,569
I wouldn't be lying
as her boyfriend,

736
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,196
I'd be lying as her employee.

737
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,699
That's not how
relationships work.

738
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,701
My patient is gonna die.

739
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,540
Does a lie guarantee he'll live?

740
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,458
No.

741
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,460
You've got two choices,
either be honest

742
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,864
and face
the medical consequences,

743
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,881
or lie and face
the personal consequences.

744
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,752
Now that you're my doctor,
you can't tell anybody, right?

745
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,629
Who would leak a story
about a sitting senator

746
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,090
who got Hep C
from doing cocaine?

747
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,972
You didn't fill out
any paperwork.

748
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm going to run this test
under an assumed name.

749
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,313
Trust me, no one will
ever know you were here.

750
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,991
Blood test confirming Hep C.

751
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,660
He got sicker,
his viral load came up,

752
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,079
finally showed up on the test.

753
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,208
Thank you.

754
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,002
There was a time
when you would have

755
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,254
completely ignored my request.

756
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,257
It means a lot that you
respect me enough to do this.

757
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,134
I've come a long way, baby.

758
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,180
Now if you would only hire
a new team member...

759
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,349
I'm on it.

760
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,318
How would you like
to come work for me?

761
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,113
It's like I'm on a Möbius strip.

762
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,824
We've had this conversation.
You want this job.

763
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,995
Prove yourself to me,
no more games.

764
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,957
At least the current game
ends, others may start.

765
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,251
You have my deeply-flawed word.

766
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,838
What do I have to do?

767
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,842
Get Dugan to let us
give him Hep A.

768
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,695
And while you're figuring out
the best way to coax a patient

769
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,222
into a treatment that
has an 85% mortality rate,

770
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,599
here's some advice, don't.

771
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,143
I'm not gonna lie to him.

772
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,312
You have a math degree, so let's
see if you can follow along here.

773
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,772
You lie to him.

774
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,233
He definitely consents,
he might live.

775
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,445
You tell him the truth, like
last time, he might not consent.

776
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,447
He definitely dies.

777
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,284
Remind me what's
so wrong about lying.

778
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,330
We're going to inject
you with Hepatitis A.

779
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,586
That doesn't
sound like medicine.

780
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,547
I know it seems counterintuitive,
but in some people,

781
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,632
the virus can
enhance immune function

782
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,551
and clear out the Hepatitis C.

783
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,802
Some?

784
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,888
How many are we talking about?

785
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,894
A fair amount.

786
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,397
Give me a percentage. What
are the odds of this thing working?

787
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,028
There's an 85% chance
that this will kill you.

788
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:51,329
So you want to give me something
that works 15% better than arsenic?

789
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,541
Technically, it works infinitely
better because arsenic has a 0%

790
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,044
chance.

791
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,423
This is your only shot.

792
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,509
Both Dr. House
and I believe that.

793
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,968
He faked a blood test

794
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,346
in order to get you
approved for this treatment,

795
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,182
and then, he tried to bribe me
into lying to you about the risks.

796
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,392
If either of those
incidents came to light,

797
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,479
he'd be suspended and
probably lose his license.

798
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,648
I'm sure some other
people would suffer.

799
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,945
He's risking his career
to give you this chance.

800
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,281
He wouldn't do that if
there was any other choice.

801
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,540
I did it and
I didn't have to lie.

802
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,041
And you feel good about that.

803
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,292
Yes.

804
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,544
So I'm hiring an idiot.

805
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,338
You can pretend you wanted
me to lie, but you didn't.

806
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,066
You want the people on
your team to challenge you.

807
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,360
Otherwise, you'd just be a
bully instead of a great doctor.

808
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,136
You hired me because I don't
compromise my principles.

809
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,556
Or I want a front row seat

810
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,850
when you wake up and realize
how useless your principles are.

811
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,574
I don't want you to
just lie to a patient,

812
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,437
I want you to want
to lie to a patient.

813
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,648
It's not gonna happen.

814
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,818
See you tomorrow.

815
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,554
I heard that Dugan is already
responding to treatment.

816
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,515
Yeah, his ALT level is
already beginning to normalize.

817
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,411
I want to apologize
for the way I've...

818
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,477
Wait.

819
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,272
You interviewed me, right?

820
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,358
For Hopkins?

821
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,445
Oh, my God.
You're right.

822
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,614
Wow.

823
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,449
That memory of yours...

824
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,659
I wanted to say
something the first day.

825
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,746
I've felt really awkward
about the whole thing.

826
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,456
Don't worry about it.

827
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,126
Is this Grandma's tea cozy?

828
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,629
What?

829
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,798
Nothing.
I'll see you upstairs.

830
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,972
If I knew hiring her meant dealing
with medical school paperwork,

831
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,807
I might have reconsidered.

832
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,977
You really got nothing better
to do than watch me sign this?

833
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,520
And miss the ultimate admission

834
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,272
that I was right about
Masters all along?

835
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,441
She had me when
she called you a coward.

836
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,652
You heading out?

837
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,153
I have to work late.

838
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,156
Gloating requires
a lot of paperwork.

839
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,334
Thank you, New Jersey,

840
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,462
for re-electing me
to the United States Senate.

841
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,092
We ran a positive campaign,

842
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:55,304
a campaign about the dire
issues facing this great nation.

843
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,893
There are many people who
gave their all for this campaign,

844
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,271
but there is one person
that stands out among them.

845
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,276
My beautiful wife
Loretta. Loretta?

846
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,198
Thank you.

847
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,330
Do you know where the
Senator's records are?

848
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,374
House was treating
Anderson's campaign manager,

849
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,583
not the Senator himself.

850
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,668
Oh.

851
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,336
Why did you think
he was a patient?

852
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,755
House saw him in the clinic.
I guess it wasn't medical.

853
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,006
When?

854
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,884
Friday, around 3:00.

855
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,139
House's team ran a Hep C
test on Joe Dugan on Friday.

856
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,932
Can you look up the time?

857
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,187
Chase, Taub and Foreman
were running tests all night.

858
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,981
All negative.

859
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:53,154
Positive test
at 3:17 p.m.

860
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,655
House ran it himself.

861
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:57,992
Is everything okay?

862
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,578
I don't think so.
