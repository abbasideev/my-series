1
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,218
Shouldn't they be up by now?

2
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,761
I'm sure they're fine.

3
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,014
They're gonna run out of air.

4
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,307
I'm happy to kill my daughter,

5
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,517
but I'd feel a little awkward
about killing your son.

6
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,645
They're spending time
together, it's good.

7
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,398
We're a family now.
They need to bond.

8
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,694
Yeah. Well, they can
bond with full air intake.

9
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,158
Julie, surface now!

10
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,160
Help! Shark!

11
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,083
Please don't scare me like that.

12
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,336
What? You said
we should bond.

13
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,920
Look what I found!

14
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,883
You're not supposed
to take anything off the wreck.

15
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,686
How cool is this?

16
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,858
They kind of look like feathers.

17
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,026
Can I see?

18
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,445
Ow!

19
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,780
Julie!

20
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283
Get her a towel.

21
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,410
What was in that jar?

22
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,991
Why aren't you guys
in my office?

23
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,576
Why are you in the building?

24
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,994
It's 8:00
in the morning.

25
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,162
Where's Chase?

26
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,581
He's not here because
it's 8:00 in the morning.

27
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,670
Sixteen-year-old girl, high
fever, vomiting, bloodshot eyes.

28
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,589
Wow, the case of
the really bad flu.

29
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,842
Hmm. Let me see.
Did I leave anything out?

30
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,177
Oh, yeah.
The smallpox.

31
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,433
Smallpox was eradicated
over 30 years ago.

32
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,143
So were Hush Puppies.
Did you check out

33
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,853
your local hipster
coffee shop lately?

34
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,273
Smallpox doesn't exist outside
of P4 labs and bio weapon plants.

35
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,524
She was in Bermuda...

36
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,151
Where she was scuba-diving

37
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,944
on the wreck of
a Dutch slave ship

38
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,863
that had been intentionally sunk

39
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,198
because an epidemic of
smallpox had broken out on board.

40
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,117
Was the ship sunk in water?

41
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,120
Because viruses can't
survive contact with water.

42
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,788
And if the virus had been kept
on the outside of an airtight jar,

43
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,998
that might be an issue.

44
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,500
The jar held
old-school inoculations.

45
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,627
They kept the scabs of the infected
people.

46
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,796
The virus can't
survive over 200 years...

47
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,047
You have.

48
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,469
Thanks for calling back.
Listen, I'm a screenwriter.

49
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,389
And is it theoretically
possible for smallpox

50
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,849
to survive for
more than 200 years

51
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,977
underwater in
a sealed glass jar?

52
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,731
Well, theoretically,
yes, but... Thank you.

53
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,234
So who do we believe,
the CDC or Dr. 902107

54
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:22,322
Isolate, get the baseline blood
draws for smallpox antibodies,

55
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,324
then vaccinate
the entire family.

56
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,826
We should test for the
21st century suspects.

57
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,495
Varicella, measles...

58
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,722
You're free to perform whatever

59
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,331
unnecessary tests
you want, Foreman.

60
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,249
Slavery was abolished years ago.

61
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,349
Why the hell do you guys
have us quarantined in here?

62
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,267
We're just taking
every precaution.

63
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,602
Against what?

64
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,355
What do you think I have?

65
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,357
One possibility is tetanus

66
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,026
from the glass jar
that sliced your hand.

67
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,279
I remember tetanus shots. That
does not look like tetanus shots.

68
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,906
It's really not
worth going into,

69
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,616
because the odds
are astronomical.

70
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,453
Tell me.

71
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,457
Again, it's...
Smallpox.

72
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,460
Smallpox?

73
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,179
Vaccine will protect you
if you don't have it,

74
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,383
and lessen the severity
if you already do.

75
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,763
But it's a billion-to-one, so we
don't want you to panic or anything.

76
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,975
How do I not panic
with that information?

77
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,736
Idiot in exam room one needs
anti-diarrheals and a dictionary.

78
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,738
You're not scheduled
for clinic duty now.

79
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,825
I had some free time.
Lowed four hours...

80
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,827
Don't you have a case?
Yeah.

81
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,245
Then don't worry about it.

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,081
Are you a Stepford doctor?

83
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,333
If you're busy, you don't
need to be down here.

84
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,252
You're serious.

85
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,504
Yep. Get out of here.

86
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,801
I can't.

87
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,095
I forgot her
stuffed animal at home.

88
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,098
It's been with her through
all the chemo sessions so far.

89
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,933
I need Lamby.

90
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,435
She doesn't want
me to do it alone.

91
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,062
Honey, there's no other way.

92
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,856
You're just gonna have
to be brave, okay?

93
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,025
What if I get someone
to sit with her

94
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,110
while you run home
and get Lamby?

95
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:31,159
I'll get a nurse. Then I have
to deal with a very sick man.

96
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,045
I think she knows.

97
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,714
Who is she,
and what does she know?

98
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,051
Cuddy and that
I faked a lab test

99
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,694
and lied to her to
save my last patient.

100
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,803
What did she do?

101
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,265
She let me out of clinic
duty because I had a case.

102
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,017
She's never done that.

103
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,894
She's also
probably never ordered

104
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,896
the pasta special
in the cafeteria.

105
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,690
Would that also have some special
paranoid message to send you?

106
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,567
I am not imagining this.

107
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,779
It's an aberration in the
way that she treats me.

108
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,048
How do I find out what it means?

109
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,615
You don't.
If she doesn't know,

110
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,718
all you're gonna do by sniffing
around is make her suspicious.

111
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,994
If she does know, you'll
find out soon enough.

112
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,954
What if I die of curiosity
in the meantime?

113
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,207
You were an idiot for
lying to her in the first place.

114
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,084
Don't be more of an idiot now.

115
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,462
Say nothing. To no
one. About anything.

116
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,880
That includes me.

117
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,972
It's not smallpox.

118
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,393
Blood work suggests some other
infection. White count is way down.

119
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,605
Masters, you got a boyfriend?

120
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,399
That's none of your business.

121
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,109
Probably just a dry spell.

122
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,113
House, you do realize
we just ruled out smallpox?

123
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,783
Would you ever be extra
nice to a theoretical boyfriend

124
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,410
if you were really mad at him?

125
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,789
I guess the only reason I would
be extra nice is because I'm angry,

126
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,124
and I just want him to go away

127
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,807
so I don't have to
deal with him anymore.

128
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,837
You passive-aggressive bitch.

129
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,130
You just asked me...

130
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,006
What about Foreman's
unnecessary tests?

131
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,633
Negative for
varicella and measles.

132
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,427
So all of our ideas
are off the table.

133
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,470
I'm putting mine back on.

134
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,139
Patient's a diver.

135
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,225
Under increased pressure,
everything in the blood

136
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,184
gets scared, panics,
runs and hides.

137
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,894
Antibodies could
be in the joints.

138
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,771
Tap her knee, ankle, shoulder,

139
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,108
and any other joint
in her smallpox-ridden body.

140
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,359
Good talk.

141
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,001
You know.

142
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,836
Of course I know.

143
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,880
Oh, thank God.

144
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,841
I thought I was
just being paranoid.

145
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,718
Why didn't you say something?

146
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,471
'Cause I wanted you to
come to me and apologize.

147
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,681
I can't apologize if I
haven't done anything wrong.

148
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,142
You lied to my face.

149
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,353
To do my job.
To save the patient's life.

150
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,691
Look, I don't wanna go all Godfather
on you, but this was business.

151
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,656
I wouldn't lie to you
about something personal.

152
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,905
You don't get to lie
to me about anything.

153
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,157
I can't compartmentalize
my life like that.

154
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,035
Well, maybe you should
practice, 'cause it comes in handy.

155
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,835
I think you should go.

156
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,848
Ow.

157
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,433
Sorry.

158
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,353
I have to get the
needle behind the bone.

159
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,605
I'm running out of bones.

160
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,250
If this is a waste
of time... Last one.

161
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,902
We just have to be...

162
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,238
What?

163
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,407
What is it?

164
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,579
I'm sorry.
I have to call the CDC.

165
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,915
I think you do have smallpox.

166
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,552
Am I gonna die?

167
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,387
I mean, this is what terrorists

168
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,180
want to use to
kill everyone, right?

169
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,306
Like, there's no cure.

170
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,142
There are treatments.
We can give you cidofovir...

171
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,068
I don't think you care
about the drugs' names.

172
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,397
Bottom line, it's 30% fatal.

173
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,542
Which means your chances of
being okay are about the same

174
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,902
as a basketball player's
chance of hitting a free throw.

175
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,823
Unless she finds dark,
purplish skin blotches.

176
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,409
What would purple blotches mean?

177
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,286
Hemorrhagic-type smallpox.

178
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,747
In which case, her chances are
more like Shaq hitting a free throw.

179
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,792
Well, no purple skin,
but take a look at this.

180
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,961
What is it?

181
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,505
There's a rash under
your daughter's arm.

182
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,425
What, like,
more of those gross bumps?

183
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,638
No. It's just
a regular rash.

184
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,599
What does that mean?

185
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,977
It means it's not smallpox.

186
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,112
Are you saying
you see House's side?

187
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,866
It's not even a side, it's
a fictional construction.

188
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,743
She's expecting
House not to lie?

189
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,244
If she's using the relationship

190
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,038
as a rationale to try
to change things...

191
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,957
Wait, wait. Are you saying it's
okay for us to lie to each other?

192
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,501
No. We have a different
relationship. I think a better one.

193
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,212
Lying was never part of it. Theirs
is built on it.

194
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,632
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

195
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,009
Oh, come on. I have to
leave in, like, five minutes.

196
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,677
Can't it wait?
There's a little girl.

197
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,155
The nurse watching her
got called away.

198
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,515
It's a long story,
but I've gotta babysit.

199
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,017
I'll see you tonight.

200
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,937
Attention.
Effective immediately,

201
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,356
all hospital entrances
and exits will be restricted

202
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,732
until further notice.

203
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,335
Center for Disease
Control has ordered

204
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,027
Princeton-Plainsboro
Hospital locked down.

205
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,363
Well, I guess I can stay.

206
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,413
Please, step out of the room.

207
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,754
I'm Dr. Broda, Head of
Infection Control, CDC.

208
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,131
And your protective suits
are not adequate.

209
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,008
Turns out they don't have to be.

210
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,843
Rash under the arm
means it's not smallpox.

211
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,512
False alarm.

212
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,348
Sorry, hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.

213
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,016
Rash is consistent
with smallpox.

214
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,810
Not if it presents
after pustules.

215
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,144
She's probably just allergic

216
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,748
to the bed sheets
or the hospital gown.

217
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,082
Or you simply didn't notice it.

218
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,109
We're gonna airlift blood
and tissue samples to Atlanta.

219
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,111
We'll have the DNA
results in 18 hours.

220
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,906
In the meantime, please,
step out of the room.

221
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,450
You brought
the plane? Cool.

222
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,374
When we left, Julie's
fever had climbed over 103.

223
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,738
It's not smallpox, she's
not dying, and it's not our case.

224
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,545
Need any other reasons
to forget it?

225
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,964
You know how you can tell
there's nothing to be done?

226
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,090
Chase showed up.

227
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,258
I was here at 9:00.

228
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,611
So you guys just want to do
nothing for the next 18 hours

229
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,429
until they tell us
it's not smallpox?

230
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,347
Can't we spend
the time discussing

231
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,726
what looks like smallpox
but isn't smallpox?

232
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,019
Molluscum contagiosum.

233
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,862
You have to compare
lesions to differentiate.

234
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,773
But we don't have access to
the patient or any new information.

235
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,735
We do have access to
the other patients.

236
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,446
The ones who died of
the same thing in 1793.

237
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,657
The captain's log
from the Sotos Ooslerzoon.

238
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,244
Maritime Museum in Bermuda
graciously sent over a PDF.

239
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,579
Problem solved.

240
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,457
I assume at least one of
you speaks fluent Dutch.

241
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,294
It's the middle
of the night in the Netherlands.

242
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,462
Nobody's working.

243
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,964
Oh, you can always find someone.

244
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,759
Oh, yes.
My name is Geerte.

245
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,970
Are you handsome
sexiest American man?

246
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,347
Well, you know, some people...

247
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,976
I would say that I am, yeah.

248
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,728
I want you to
translate something for me.

249
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,313
Why you want I translate?

250
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,442
I do topless, toys, and...

251
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,777
Just do the translation.

252
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,945
She can translate however
she feels most comfortable.

253
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,697
Whatever.

254
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,115
You put in credit card.

255
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,409
House, the hospital has
translators on call...

256
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,619
Shut up.

257
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,001
Honey, could you e-mail our
new friend the captain's log?

258
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,755
Sure thing, sexiest
American man.

259
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,718
"On morning of 14 July,

260
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:32,848
"I boarded Sotos Ooslerzoon
with two trunks and my cat."

261
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,892
Aw. The Captain had a cat.

262
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,685
Isn't she adorable?

263
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,230
Go ahead and skip to the
part where people get sick.

264
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,397
Mmm.

265
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,565
Ah, here.

266
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,569
"The passenger has a fever,
shaking and red eyes."

267
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,240
Ew, also, African man
make go in his pants.

268
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,076
What about the captain,
the crew?

269
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,037
No. It say only
African men sick.

270
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,665
It can't be smallpox.

271
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,670
Airborne transmission means
it's an equal opportunity killer.

272
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,593
We're looking for a
disease that discriminates.

273
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,132
Sickle cell.

274
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,676
The disease doesn't have to
be racist, it could be classist.

275
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,054
Vitamin D deficiency from lack of
sunlight weakens the immune system,

276
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,765
makes the slaves more vulnerable
to malaria or dengue fever...

277
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,827
I don't know how you get
pustules from any of those.

278
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,228
The captain and crew
got clean drinking water.

279
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,355
The slaves drank
whatever they could.

280
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,357
Scrofula.

281
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,862
That's what they called cervical
TB lymphadenitis in the 1700s.

282
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,616
Scrofulicious. That's what they
called annoying in the 1700s.

283
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,909
Is she wrong?

284
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,497
They died for nothing.

285
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,499
Those slaves
could have lived long

286
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,252
fulfilling lives
mowing my ancestors' lawns.

287
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,089
Foreman, can I speak to
you outside for a second?

288
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,638
We need to test for TB.

289
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,101
TB might fit, but it's too
slow-moving to kill her anytime soon.

290
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,228
There's no way that CDC's
gonna give us access.

291
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,189
That's why we
don't think it's TB.

292
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,191
We think it's
meningococcal disease,

293
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,651
which could kill her before
the results come back.

294
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,113
And once I gain access,
I run the TB test.

295
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,591
You could've said
all that in there.

296
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,325
In front of the narc?
As if.

297
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,761
Are you so afraid
of this new girl,

298
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,929
we have to take
elaborate measures

299
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,056
every time you want to skirt
around ethical boundaries?

300
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,416
Elaborate measures?
We took a walk.

301
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,501
A walk you would
have taken anyway.

302
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,129
Actually, I saved you
from the horrible

303
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,173
post-differential traffic jam.

304
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,637
Meningococcus?

305
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,265
We believe the rash under Julie's
armpit is actually petechial spots.

306
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,476
When added to the high
fever, the vomiting and...

307
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,245
There haven't been any
seizures, no stiff neck...

308
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,104
If I could just gain
access to the patient,

309
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,648
I could investigate
the rash further.

310
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,941
All right, I'll take a look.

311
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,362
I can wear your gear. I'll take
every necessary precaution.

312
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,822
You come to me
with a weak diagnosis.

313
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,324
I even offer to investigate.

314
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,326
But that's not
good enough for you.

315
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,870
What's really going on here?

316
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,004
Sir, are you feeling
all right in there?

317
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,298
It's just a headache.

318
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,636
Baby.

319
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,680
Baby.

320
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,059
Dad, you're bleeding.

321
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,520
Somebody, please,
get in here now!

322
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,904
This is not meningococcus.
You're not getting in here.

323
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,454
Cool.

324
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,974
Not really. Not for
them and not for you.

325
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,393
The dad's new symptoms are
consistent with them having smallpox.

326
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,502
Would be, if he had a headache.

327
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,878
He does have a headache.

328
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,588
No, he just said,
"Ow" and held his head.

329
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,091
Actually, he said, "Ow" then
he said, "It's a headache."

330
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,968
Which could be
indicative of head pain.

331
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,430
Headache is caused by muscle
tension or vascular stretching.

332
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,557
Head pain is caused by trauma.

333
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,201
Which would include such events

334
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,727
as a bleed in the brain from TB.

335
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,812
- We're back to TB?
- We never left.

336
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,355
We'll need to do a CT.

337
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,648
And I sort of have a hunch

338
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,359
that the CDC is not gonna
approve of us moving the patient.

339
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,281
Chase, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

340
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,621
We just tried this. I'm not
a better liar than Foreman.

341
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,666
Sure you are. You're
descended from convicts.

342
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,419
Plus, there's no lie this
time, just a bait and switch.

343
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,338
You propose that we
don't have to move him

344
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,964
if we do
a pneumo-encephalograph.

345
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,842
That's 60-year-old technology
that killed patients.

346
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,719
Exactly. He'll
compromise on the CT...

347
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,765
This isn't Cuddy. Your Jedi
mind tricks won't work here.

348
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,268
These aren't the droids you're looking for.

349
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,937
You don't trust me.

350
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,149
Going behind your back works
better when you're not facing us.

351
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,777
Instead of whatever lie
you're gonna tell Broda,

352
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,612
why don't you just
tell him the truth?

353
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,922
If we're honest
and reasonable...

354
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,531
Then people of
all races and creeds

355
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,925
will live together
in peace and harmony...

356
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,826
How did your
first plan work out?

357
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,914
Permission granted.

358
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,165
Thank you.

359
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,003
After she gets denied,
do the bait and switch.

360
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,633
They won't let your
mommy back in the hospital

361
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,094
because of
an emergency downstairs.

362
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,347
But we have to get started.

363
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,307
I can't do it without my Lamby.

364
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,143
Who is she?

365
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,354
I'm nobody, I'm leaving soon.

366
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,148
Her name is Sam,
and she's a friend of mine.

367
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,403
What does Lamby usually do
while you get your treatment?

368
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,654
She holds my hand.

369
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,240
Well, you could hold my hand.

370
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,576
That won't work.

371
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,497
Well, sometimes we have to do
things that we don't want to do.

372
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,082
You have to go to school,

373
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,445
you have to eat your vegetables,

374
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,860
and you have to
take your medicine.

375
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,336
You have to.

376
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,715
I want my mommy.

377
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,175
Yeah.

378
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,261
I'll be right back.

379
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,062
You know, I'm pretty sure Lamby
has a cousin down in the gift shop.

380
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,200
Hold off a minute.
I'm in overtime.

381
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,707
Broda agreed to
CT the dad's brain.

382
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,042
Well, that sucks.

383
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,170
But I thought
that's what you wanted.

384
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,923
I shouldn't have gotten it
with the truth. He's a hypocrite.

385
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,776
His position ever since
he's been here has been...

386
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,844
I pointed out that
either we're right,

387
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,721
and he's the hero
for ending the crisis,

388
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,847
or he's right,

389
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,199
and he gets to be
the first person

390
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,559
to look at a brain
infected with smallpox.

391
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,812
CT scans weren't
around 30 years ago.

392
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,774
Good work.

393
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,957
So I guess honesty
is the best policy.

394
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,627
Why'd you say that?

395
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,004
Seriously, to establish
your viewpoint,

396
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,315
as if I didn't already know it,

397
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,299
or to demonstrate some weird

398
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,010
cross-generational female
solidarity with Cuddy?

399
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,930
Actually, I was just trying
to fill the awkward silence.

400
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,310
Why have they stopped?

401
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,231
You can't go out there!

402
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,398
Why did you stop?

403
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,525
Get out of the hallway.

404
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,527
He does not have smallpox.

405
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,778
Yes, he does.

406
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,280
It itches.

407
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,033
He's just developed pustules.

408
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,285
He's now too dangerous
to transport.

409
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,954
Get out of the hallway.

410
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,881
Dad's vitals are in the toilet.

411
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,675
He's got full-blown smallpox.

412
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,801
What about the daughter?

413
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,136
Pustule count is
way up, her vitals are way down.

414
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,388
Means I was wrong.

415
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,724
Well, to be precise, I was
right before I was wrong, so...

416
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,185
So we just give up and go home?

417
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,815
Actually, somebody locked the
front door. But yeah, we give up.

418
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,941
We might as well keep...

419
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,025
We have our diagnosis.

420
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,027
If you're eager, you can
go find us a new case.

421
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,954
I guess she's eager or
has a blind spot for sarcasm.

422
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,458
I just wanna look at
the rash under her arm

423
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,936
to see if it's
matured to match the...

424
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,187
You can look through the glass.

425
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,379
I need to be closer.

426
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,856
If the pustules are
at a different stage...

427
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,173
She's comfortable.

428
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,426
We're gonna have our
results back in eight hours.

429
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,178
If it's not smallpox, you
can be the first one in there.

430
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,530
Why are you just
standing out there?

431
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,867
I'm just trying to help.

432
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,118
If you're feeling up to it

433
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,201
can you sit up and show
me the rash under your arm?

434
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,583
Wait.

435
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:24,296
The soles of your feet...
There aren't any lesions.

436
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,466
Who cares? They're
everywhere else. This is torture.

437
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,596
Eve.

438
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:37,726
Guess who came by
the hospital for a visit.

439
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,896
Hello, Eve.

440
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,316
Oh, no.

441
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,446
All right, I'm gonna get a couple
of nice nurses to come in here

442
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,990
and get you two ready
for the treatment, all right?

443
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,742
Okay.

444
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,417
How come Lamby can
be here, but Mommy can't?

445
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,426
Lamby was dirty.
We gave her a bath.

446
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,261
This isn't Lamby!

447
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,437
Julie doesn't have smallpox.

448
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,276
Did I just dream the part where
I finally agreed it was smallpox?

449
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,404
Well, if what I
thought was reality

450
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,657
was actually a dream,
then the reverse...

451
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,868
Oh, my God. I had a
threesome with Beyoncé and Lady Gaga.

452
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:42,958
She doesn't have pustules on
her palms or the soles of her feet.

453
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,795
But Dad does
have pustules there.

454
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,132
So how does he get
smallpox, but it skips her?

455
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,061
If I leave like that,
you should follow.

456
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,482
We gave it to him.

457
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,277
Where's Chase?

458
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,654
You do realize
we don't all live together, right?

459
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,699
Well, then just...
We gave it to him.

460
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,285
No pustules on
the daughter's palms, so...

461
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,078
So, therefore, your theory is

462
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,602
you asked me to
take the dad's blood,

463
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,583
but I accidentally
injected him with smallpox.

464
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,960
Exactly. Although, technically,
it was the vaccinia virus.

465
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,713
Which is what the smallpox
vaccine is made from.

466
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,548
Same symptoms as smallpox,

467
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,259
but only half the calories and
almost none of the lethality.

468
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,112
You sound like one of
those anti-vaccine cranks.

469
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,656
You can't develop full-blown
symptoms from the vaccine this quickly.

470
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,348
You can if you're
immuno-compromised.

471
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,870
Am I the only one who reads
these things? Dad had kidney cancer.

472
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,855
Six years ago.
He's been in remission.

473
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,023
Well, it's obviously back.

474
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,441
It shot his immune system,

475
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,067
made him vulnerable
to the vaccinia.

476
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,069
Which will get
better on interferon.

477
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,906
So if he responds
to the treatment,

478
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,699
that proves he doesn't
have smallpox.

479
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,146
Then what does
the daughter have?

480
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,745
Damn. I was hoping you
weren't gonna ask me that.

481
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,914
Can we please just
focus on the disease

482
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,209
we've just diagnosed
and we can treat?

483
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,128
What's more likely?
He got smallpox

484
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,755
the day after we
immunized him for it,

485
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,465
or he's sick from
the vaccine itself?

486
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,717
You got any proof
the kidney cancer's back?

487
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,927
Well, let me give him this.

488
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,596
When he gets better, that
will be the proof you need.

489
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,389
I'll put on one of
your fancy space suits,

490
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,517
and I promise I won't
kiss him on an open sore.

491
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,936
You know who Janet Parker is?

492
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:30,857
In 1978, she was working
at a university in England.

493
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,735
Someone in a research lab
on the floor below screwed up.

494
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,613
Some smallpox virus
managed to float up

495
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,367
through the vents into the
room where she was working.

496
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,455
She died four days later, the last
known person to die from smallpox.

497
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,584
And the person in charge
of the lab was so destroyed,

498
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,628
he killed himself.

499
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:57,300
Now that he's shedding, I
can't open that door for anyone.

500
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,013
Hey! Look.

501
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,265
There's the proof you need.

502
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,588
There's blood in the urine bag.

503
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,351
His kidneys are shutting down.

504
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,520
He's in the final stages
of the disease.

505
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,647
If smallpox was
causing the kidney failure,

506
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,732
the blood would be brown.
It's red.

507
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,820
Because the kidney cancer is
back and this is not smallpox.

508
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,282
I'm not opening that door.

509
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,454
Well, that makes one of us.

510
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,998
Hey!

511
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,043
Hey! You're insane!

512
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,295
But I'm right.

513
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,806
I hope you are. Because
I can't let you out now.

514
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,653
This is what happens when
you have no respect for authority,

515
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,281
no respect for anything.

516
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,992
You don't think it's a little
much to use the threat of death

517
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,703
to win a totally separate
argument with your boyfriend?

518
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,539
You think this is
about the other thing?

519
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,875
It does seem to track
suspiciously closely.

520
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,213
I don't care right now that you
lied to me. I want you to stay alive.

521
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,342
And if I do, does that
mean I win both arguments?

522
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,886
Put the suit on.

523
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,013
It's unnecessary, Mom.

524
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,932
This is why I didn't
want them telling you.

525
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,683
It's why I'm glad
they didn't tell Wilson.

526
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,060
Dr. House.

527
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,030
I'm getting worse, aren't I?

528
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,374
Interferon takes
a little time to work.

529
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,920
Don't worry.

530
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,973
Tell Broda that I'm increasing his
oxygen. And get my team down here.

531
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,907
Hi.

532
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,744
You're mad at us, aren't you?

533
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,079
Yeah.

534
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,873
Well, you have a right
to be. We weren't honest.

535
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,542
You might not know this yet,

536
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,628
but sometimes adults mess up.

537
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,427
Can I tell you something and
you'll keep it just between us?

538
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,930
I'm not great with kids.

539
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,182
I love them, but I get scared

540
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,019
that I'm gonna do the
wrong thing, and then,

541
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,687
I usually do.

542
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,441
That's what I did
with the lying.

543
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,153
And I'm very sorry about that.

544
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,574
But the reason why
I did the wrong thing

545
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:11,953
was because I was trying to
get you to do the right thing.

546
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:17,459
Your mommy and your Lamby
both really need you to get better.

547
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,966
So, do you think that
you could be really brave

548
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,803
and do the right thing?

549
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,891
I'll try.

550
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,561
Great.

551
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,981
Great.

552
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,197
Fever's way up, sats are
way down, pustules still spreading.

553
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,823
Interferon's not working.

554
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,825
Means this is smallpox.

555
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,205
Right, because there are only two
diseases in the whole wide world.

556
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,539
What else could it be?

557
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,208
There's got to be something.

558
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,001
No, there doesn't.

559
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,670
There are still
no pustules on her feet.

560
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,173
All the reasons you thought
it wasn't smallpox still exist.

561
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,509
Forget her feet.
Forget all those other reasons.

562
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,843
Look at him now.

563
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,054
The pox are dome-shaped,
they're on 80% of his body,

564
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,556
and they're not scabbing over.

565
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,518
This is textbook smallpox.

566
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,145
DDx-ing at this point isn't
gonna make a difference.

567
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,355
Don't say that.

568
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,523
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,778
House, you screwed up
going in there.

570
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,129
You have any fever?

571
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,047
Not yet.

572
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,342
But when it does come,

573
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,261
I assume you'll
see the pettiness

574
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,721
of being mad at me for lying.

575
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,598
Shut up, House.

576
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,648
I'll be right back.

577
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,283
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

578
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,672
You should say goodbye
to your family.

579
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,207
I love you.

580
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,710
Just hold on.
Fight this.

581
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,631
You gotta take care of my boy.

582
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,970
Promise me.

583
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,642
I promise.

584
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,233
I love you.

585
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,318
I love you, too.

586
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,529
Get Roger closer.

587
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,325
Come closer.

588
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,743
Come on.

589
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,538
Dad?

590
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,168
You're my baby boy.

591
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,963
Dad, please.

592
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,174
It's gonna be okay.

593
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,551
Lulu's gonna take care of you.

594
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,428
I don't want to, Dad.

595
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,347
She's not you.

596
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,604
I will always love you, Rog.

597
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,569
Dad?

598
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,241
Dad!

599
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,519
You're killing me.

600
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:32,607
The suit will protect you if you
haven't already been exposed.

601
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,692
My air supply's almost out.

602
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,194
We'll give you another canister.

603
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,446
Yeah, and when I
change it I will be exposed.

604
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,781
Just move him.

605
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,199
I wish I could.

606
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,534
Well, that's great, because
you know what you can do?

607
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,620
You can move me.

608
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,373
You don't know that
I have smallpox yet.

609
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,832
We have to assume.

610
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,418
There's another isolation
room on the fifth floor.

611
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,462
The problem is getting him
from here to there.

612
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,797
So it's inconvenient?

613
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,175
My having a fighting chance
at life IS inconvenient?

614
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm sorry.

615
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,977
We don't know
that he'll catch it.

616
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,063
We don't know that
it's definitely smallpox,

617
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,565
not until we get the DNA
results back from the CDC.

618
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,484
What do you think
the dad just died of?

619
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,236
Would it kill us
to talk it through?

620
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,822
Kill us, no.
Save House, also no.

621
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,741
Even if by some miracle
it's not smallpox,

622
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,368
there's nothing more
for us to go on.

623
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,662
There's no new data and
there isn't going to be any...

624
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,746
Where are you going?

625
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,665
To get more data.

626
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:36,838
"Gerritt seems distant,
preoccupied."

627
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,714
Who's Gerritt?
Is he a slave?

628
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,591
Gerritt is the captain's kitty.

629
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,955
The captain's cat
is preoccupied?

630
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,219
Skip the cat.

631
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,389
"One goat
slaughtered for dinner.

632
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,558
"Broke out the next
barrel of wine..."

633
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,976
Skip the food.

634
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:54,105
Can we go back to the cat?
Did the cat get sick?

635
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,357
Smallpox is exclusive to humans.

636
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,484
Ship captains didn't have pets.

637
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,921
Nothing and nobody went on
those ships if it didn't have a purpose.

638
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,447
Hunting mice and rats?

639
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,698
For the crew.

640
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,617
The hold was probably
infested with mice.

641
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,901
What if that's the difference?

642
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,371
What happened to Gerritt?

643
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,832
Ah.

644
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,585
Is that a sad "ah"
or a cute "ah"?

645
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,296
Gerritt, he died.
It's a sad "ah."

646
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,800
Before he died,
did he lose his fur?

647
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,930
How did you know?

648
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,142
Mice don't carry smallpox,

649
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,935
but they do
carry rickettsialpox.

650
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,812
Which is treatable.

651
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,400
Just start them on doxycycline.

652
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,986
Based on a bald cat? You
never heard of shedding?

653
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,154
What's the downside?

654
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,698
If we shove her full of
antibiotics plus the antivirals,

655
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,450
it'll suppress her bone marrow.

656
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,743
That girl's about to die.

657
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,952
She probably is.

658
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,455
And I don't want to risk
pushing her over the edge.

659
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,123
At least look at the dad's body.

660
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:58,252
Small patches of black
dead tissue will prove I'm right.

661
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,089
Eschars appear with
rickettsialpox but not with smallpox.

662
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,467
If he had developed eschars,
I would've noticed.

663
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,802
You haven't been within
20 feet of the guy in hours.

664
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,721
Have them check.

665
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,516
Their job is to bleach
the body, Kill the virus,

666
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
and get it out of there
for Dr. House's sake.

667
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,146
Bleaching the body will destroy
all evidence of rickettsialpox.

668
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,941
There is no evidence.

669
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,984
I'm not trying to
hurt anyone here.

670
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,155
I'm not lying to you.
This is smallpox.

671
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,126
House, you have
to examine the body.

672
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,034
I'm not going anywhere near it.

673
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,130
Look for eschars. Hurry.

674
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,591
You think it's R-pox?

675
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,719
The Captain had a cat.
He lost his fur and then died.

676
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,148
Step back, Dr. House.

677
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,368
It's kind of hard to do
an autopsy in oven mitts.

678
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,661
Take them off.

679
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,997
Says the woman standing
behind two panes of glass.

680
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,164
Do you believe me?

681
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,750
Forget me.
Do you believe you?

682
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,420
You think it's
rickettsialpox, don't you?

683
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,756
If it is, it's curable, and she's
gonna die unless we can prove it.

684
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,597
You really are annoying.

685
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,197
Come on, House.
Come on.

686
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,874
Eschar.

687
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,130
Eschars.

688
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,768
Start the girl on
doxycycline right now.

689
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,621
Mommy!

690
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,043
- You were
good with her. - Yeah.

691
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,544
Only after being bad.

692
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,004
It takes practice.

693
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,424
Maybe I should get a puppy.

694
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,260
Yeah. Or pregnant.

695
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,105
Hey.

696
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,151
You're gonna be okay.

697
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,783
Hey.

698
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,118
Hey.

699
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,259
Buy you breakfast?

700
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,677
No, thanks.

701
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,764
You can pay if it's starting
to feel like I'm carrying you.

702
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,891
House, stop.

703
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,897
When I was dying,

704
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,442
you realized that
a little white lie

705
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,861
between co-workers
wasn't such a big deal.

706
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:56,824
Yeah, and that was true,
when you were dying.
