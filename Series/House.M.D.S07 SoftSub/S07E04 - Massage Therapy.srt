1
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,276
Billy?

2
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,278
Is anyone here?

3
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,376
Billy?

4
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,733
Hey.
Hey.

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,985
I just noticed the
front door was open.

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,321
Maybe you left it that way?

7
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,824
I don't know, I thought
I heard something.

8
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,160
I mean, I know the whole
house creaks, but I was just...

9
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,454
You have any doubts,
go to the Cassanos'.

10
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,749
I'm in the car,
I'm a few blocks away.

11
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,169
No, I'm sure it's
nothing. Love you.

12
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,560
Oh, God.

13
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,815
The door banged shut, I'm
sure it was just the wind. God.

14
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,066
It's okay.

15
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,901
It's okay, it's just me.

16
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,069
Huh.

17
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,490
You all right?

18
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,909
Margaret.

19
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,495
Hey!

20
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,249
Margaret! You okay?

21
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,417
My stomach!

22
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,442
I get it!

23
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,653
You're jealous of my new cane,

24
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,489
So you hired a new doctor
that you could lean on.

25
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,659
Exactly. Nothing to do with the fact
that you instructed me to hire one.

26
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,663
Dr. House, this is Dr. Kelly
Benedict, your new fellow.

27
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,749
Nice to meet you.

28
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,251
Um...

29
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,421
I just finished my psychiatry
residency at St Jude's.

30
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,881
And I loved studying the mind,

31
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,402
but I thought I could make
more of a difference, or at least...

32
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,593
Man, you're hot.

33
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,471
I mean, seriously.

34
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,324
Thirty-year-old female... I
know what you're thinking.

35
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,768
"She looks like Cameron, and he's
hired her solely to sleep with her."

36
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,311
No. None of us
were thinking that.

37
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,438
Well, you should have.

38
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,356
But you'd be foolishly wrong.

39
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,110
Yes, he's been dating at a
near-Clooney pace recently,

40
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,613
but at this point, the only hole
he's trying to fill is the one in his soul.

41
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,658
Which means it's the emotional
connection with Cameron he misses.

42
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,828
Did you ever marry a dying man,
and if so, did you freeze his sperm?

43
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,665
Okay, so Cameron's
his ex, but the sperm...

44
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,959
She's not like Cameron.

45
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,937
Then why did you make her
wear Cameron's clothes?

46
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,629
No. I'm wearing
my own clothes.

47
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,797
Thirty-year-old female.

48
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,591
Severe vomiting
and abdominal pain,

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,844
preceded by three days of
moderate pain, slightly elevated LFTs.

50
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,512
Could be lead...

51
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,057
Ah-ah-ah. If I know
Dr. Shameron, and I think I do,

52
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,604
she'll want this chance
for a little stuff-strutting.

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,070
Okay. Hepatitis A...

54
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,655
Serologies are negative.

55
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,781
Right. Uh...

56
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,410
Appendicitis... That
hasn't ruptured by now?

57
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,829
It's hepatic fibrosis.

58
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,041
At the risk of having
Foreman snark at me, too,

59
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,876
lead poisoning could also work.

60
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,005
Liver angiogram
to check for fibrosis,

61
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,507
search the home
for heavy metals.

62
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,079
What's your position on the
legality of illegal break-ins?

63
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,347
That's more of a second-week
type activity. We'll do the angiogram.

64
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,432
I'll meet you in
radiology, third floor.

65
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,855
She was nervous.
Give her a break.

66
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,106
Oh.

67
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,692
And she's not like Cameron.

68
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,695
True. Cameron had
much smaller breasts.

69
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,866
By which I mean,
she was smarter.

70
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,670
How are things going with Cuddy?

71
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,879
Great.

72
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,130
We've gotten to fifth base.

73
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,885
That's two home runs, and
then she gives me back a triple.

74
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,555
I could see you on this one.

75
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,306
Am I wearing a dashiki?

76
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,811
Easy Rider auditions
ended four decades ago.

77
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,980
Are you sleeping over there yet?

78
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,774
Nope. She comes over,
we hook up, she leaves.

79
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,068
Whose idea was that?

80
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,319
Mine.

81
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,321
But I let her think it's hers.

82
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,698
It's the fun of a relationship.

83
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,741
You get the sex, the dinners,

84
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,868
videogame partnership.

85
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,620
I also get a full night's sleep.

86
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,248
Okay. Taking it slow.
That could work.

87
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,166
You are spending time
with the kid.

88
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,420
As little as possible.
That is one boring child.

89
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,214
House, she's a toddler.
I know.

90
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,217
Grading on a curve.
It's that bad.

91
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,012
You think you were a
scintillating wit at two and a half?

92
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,180
I wasn't trying to eat shoes.

93
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,975
Cuddy could have adopted
a golden retriever.

94
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,769
Yeah, things are
definitely going great.

95
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,856
We'll get to it
when we get to it.

96
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,069
You really like these, or are you
just avoiding a touchy conversation?

97
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,196
Nah. This one's
too metrosexual,

98
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,616
this one is too heterosexual.

99
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,742
They're identical.

100
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,368
Do you even want my input?

101
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,620
No.

102
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,163
Then why did you invite me?

103
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,541
Who would drive my
car home if I buy a bike?

104
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,340
You did fine. House is
just trying to get at me.

105
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,383
And he's wrong, by the way.

106
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,261
I hired you because you were
the most qualified applicant.

107
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,971
Injecting dye.

108
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,558
Dr. Foreman didn't seem
to like me, either.

109
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,895
Oh, well, he takes
a little while to warm up.

110
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,564
In my case, I'm hoping
year seven does the trick.

111
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,360
Tapering cutoff in the left
branch of the hepatic artery.

112
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,861
Tumour?

113
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,571
Looks more like scar tissue.

114
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,366
From what? Surgery?

115
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,617
Probably.

116
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,243
Look at her rib cage.

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,621
She broke five
or six bones at some point.

118
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,123
She didn't tell us about this?

119
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,626
No, she didn't.

120
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,841
I checked the pipes
and the paint.

121
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,177
It's not lead poisoning.
You got anything?

122
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,013
Yeah. I was looking around,
and in the corner over there,

123
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,891
I found a question about why you
have a problem with our new doctor.

124
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,812
Sorry. We should all be super polite
in the DDxs, fail to correct each other,

125
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,017
and then treat patients
for diseases they don't have.

126
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,816
Dude, is this about Thirteen?

127
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,193
No. Why are you
calling me "dude"?

128
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:51,114
Maybe it's hard seeing House
replace her when you still got feelings?

129
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,533
One, I don't have feelings
for Thirteen beyond friendship,

130
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,702
two, it's a temporary
replacement,

131
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,453
and three, "Dude"?

132
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,163
It felt right.

133
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,851
The day the patient collapsed,
she say where she was working?

134
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,978
A cleaning job in Summit,
then she went straight home.

135
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,297
Then why's she got a credit card
receipt for lunch from a cafe in Trenton?

136
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,510
I'm not hiding anything.
I just got the days wrong.

137
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,554
I worked in Trenton on Tuesday,

138
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,556
I worked in Summit on Monday.

139
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,974
I guess it slipped my mind.

140
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,143
And breaking eight ribs,
that slip your mind, too?

141
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,312
You know how I was on
the cycling team when I was at UMass?

142
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,191
Well, during training, I fell off my
bike, right onto a sprinkler head.

143
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,568
Why didn't you tell us?

144
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,819
That was 10 years ago.

145
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,321
I didn't think it could be
related to my stomach problems.

146
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,607
We're gonna need to see
the records from the operation.

147
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,700
You think it is related?

148
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,177
The strange stuff
we found in your liver,

149
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,995
it's probably hepatic fibrosis,

150
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,140
but it could also just be a
screw-up from your old surgery.

151
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,000
The operation was done
at the university hospital.

152
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,669
Hopefully, they still
have the records.

153
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,007
Come back. Just
one more time. You'll love it.

154
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,634
My wrists are tired.

155
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:58,306
I can't defeat NoobDecimator98
all alone. Come on, we're a team.

156
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,640
You understand, right?

157
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,851
Babysitter's leaving
in half an hour.

158
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,354
Oops! You're right.

159
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,816
Scram, I got a massage
coming by in five.

160
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,862
It was at that moment she realized
the romance was already gone.

161
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,533
Headshot!

162
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,587
Oh! Hi.

163
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,547
Hi.

164
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,813
I called UMass. There's no
record of any surgery for Margaret.

165
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,105
You use her maiden name?

166
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,542
No, Kelly knows nothing about
the concept of married names.

167
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,443
It wasn't covered in
her psychiatry residency.

168
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,321
Margaret was never even
registered at the university.

169
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,198
Call the other hospitals
in the area.

170
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,616
Done. Nothing.

171
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,011
Sol ran her social security number
through one of those websites.

172
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,745
Her number matches her name.

173
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,039
But she's got no credit
history until three years ago.

174
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:09,252
And based on her number,
she was born around 1945.

175
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,420
She stole someone's identity.

176
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,556
Supraventricular
tachycardia, 150 bpm.

177
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,474
Carotid massage?
Not responding.

178
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,743
- I'll get the adenosine.
- Tried already.

179
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,936
Get the pacemaker,
we can overdrive her.

180
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:38,865
Dorothy. Dorothy. Dorothy,
dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

181
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,950
What's wrong with me?

182
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:46,038
Well, on the one hand, you've got some
mysterious heart and tummy problems.

183
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,625
On the other, you look
great for a 65-year-old.

184
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,169
So who are you?

185
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,464
And no, that's not some weird
Canadian pronunciation of "how."

186
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,885
They're saying you
changed your identity.

187
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,845
What are they talking
about, Margaret?

188
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,556
I don't know.

189
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,059
Well, that falls in the
"obviously stupid lie" category.

190
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,272
Which you're familiar with from the
one you told us about your bike accident.

191
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,773
You thought we'd never check?

192
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,822
Five years ago, I was married.

193
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,199
Who was he?

194
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,161
Just a guy.
I met him in high school.

195
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,621
He was older.

196
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:33,002
He used to get
jealous, do drugs.

197
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,170
Those broken bones?

198
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:39,050
He would tell me to
take off all my clothes,

199
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:43,304
so he could inspect me,
then he would hit me.

200
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,143
I got a restraining order, ran
away. And he found me anyway.

201
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,520
That's when he broke my ribs.

202
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,191
I moved away again, to Arizona.

203
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,070
Came back from work one day,

204
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,574
he'd broken in, fed
pesticides to my dog, killed her.

205
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,619
I bought a dead
woman's identity,

206
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,455
changed my name, moved here.

207
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,333
Is this related to why you
were in Trenton yesterday?

208
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,922
There's a support group for
abused women at Trenton General.

209
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,049
I go a lot.

210
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,801
What's his name?

211
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,511
Please don't do this.
I don't...

212
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,929
Just tell me.

213
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,098
Carl.

214
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,225
Carl what?

215
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,310
This is why I didn't tell you.

216
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,187
'Cause you go confront
him, he'll Kill you.

217
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,732
Well, I got another name you
could tell us instead. Yours.

218
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,570
It's Jenny.

219
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:51,747
Now, some person seemed to think that I
was not being fair to you in our last DDx,

220
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,666
because I made you nervous.

221
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,752
So this time,
I'm gonna put you at ease.

222
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,047
It's just you and old Doc House.

223
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,467
Couple of pals
chittin' the chat.

224
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,052
Why not just place her chair above a
trap door with a shark tank underneath?

225
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,975
Because Wednesday's when
I get my shark tank cleaned.

226
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,811
Also, because
I'm giving her a chance.

227
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,021
You're giving her a test.

228
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,188
This whole job is a test.

229
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,483
I'm giving her the chance to
fail it sooner rather than later.

230
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,818
Or pass.

231
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,950
Arrhythmia and elevated LFTs rule out
hepatic fibrosis. So heart and stomach.

232
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,886
Gastritis. Explains the
stomach, not the heart.

233
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,055
Atrial fibrillation? Explains
the heart, not the stomach.

234
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,498
Sorry, sorry.
Cystitis.

235
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,876
Explains the... Nothing.

236
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,586
I meant cholecystitis.

237
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,337
Would have showed up
on the physical exam.

238
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,661
Do we have to sit here all day?

239
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,567
You got a better answer than
she does, then let's hear it.

240
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,676
I'm sure she's already
starting to think how,

241
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,055
if we add the symptoms
to an abusive ex,

242
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,641
the fact that she'd just
eaten, the opened door...

243
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,520
Rhymes with "moison"?

244
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,814
You think her ex-husband
tried to poison her?

245
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,860
Even if he found her somehow,
these abusers have a pattern.

246
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,405
He beat her with his hands.
Poison's too impersonal, it doesn't fit.

247
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,657
Exactly, but
the counterargument is...

248
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,119
Her ex poisoned her dog.

249
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,080
Oh.

250
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,206
Right.

251
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,043
She said he used pesticides. He
could have stuck some in her dinner.

252
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,836
Treat with pralidoxime.

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,006
A for effort?

254
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:37,228
House was wrong trying to come up
with a complicated reason you hired Kelly.

255
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,064
Thank you.

256
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,024
It's actually quite simple.

257
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,193
You think she's hot and
you want to sleep with her.

258
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,489
Well, it's nice to see you finally
taking an interest in my life.

259
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,674
We should go bowling sometime.

260
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,743
I'm just saying if you spend all your
off-work time and energy getting laid,

261
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,428
it's gonna spill into
your work as well.

262
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,789
She's smart.
You didn't interview her.

263
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:01,127
I did glance at her résumé.
Middling grades, middling med school.

264
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,755
She was editor for Rutgers'
daily undergrad newspaper.

265
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,342
That shows a lot more guts and
determination than med school grades.

266
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,052
Uh-huh?

267
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,013
How long did you interview her?

268
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,723
Forty-five minutes, at least.

269
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,352
How much of that was
after you decided to hire her?

270
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,397
You saw what you wanted to see.

271
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,735
This guy broke into our house?

272
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,404
That's the theory.

273
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,031
I don't know.
It could be true.

274
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,493
And you didn't tell me about
him because you didn't trust me?

275
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,054
I just didn't want
you to get involved.

276
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,914
I'm already involved.
We're married.

277
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,543
It was the worst time in my
life. I wanted to block it out.

278
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,420
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,673
I gotta get out of here.

280
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,841
Where are you going?

281
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,384
I don't know.

282
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,766
Hey.

283
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,270
So I'm seeing you tonight.

284
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,771
Yes.

285
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,940
And you would have even
if you hadn't told me that.

286
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,194
I was just wondering...
Your masseuse?

287
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,361
Brandi.

288
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,365
I'm sure I'm imagining this, although
not as sure now that I know her name,

289
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,953
but she seems a little... How
do I say this? I don't know.

290
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,956
A bit slutty.
Well, she is a hooker.

291
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,793
If she's not slutty, she's
doing something wrong.

292
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,212
What?

293
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,214
Did you have sex with her?

294
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,465
Yesterday?

295
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,344
Ah! You're getting
confused by the hooker thing.

296
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,096
No, of course not.
I'm dating you.

297
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,141
But you used to
have sex with her?

298
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,395
Well, it was a
massage-plus-happy-ending sort of thing.

299
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,941
Now it's more of a sad ending.

300
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,401
Because of you.

301
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,908
I've tried 15 different massage
therapists in the last few years.

302
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,244
I don't know why, but
she's the best I've found.

303
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,079
She makes my leg feel better.

304
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,998
So you really think that
I would be okay with you

305
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,085
getting a massage from a
hooker you used to have sex with?

306
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,670
You don't mind the massage part.

307
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,172
You mind the sex part,
which doesn't exist any more.

308
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,924
I know a great
physical therapist.

309
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,343
I will give you her number.

310
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,489
Why would I give up one who
definitely works for one who might work?

311
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,014
Because I asked you to.

312
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,308
Well, that's not really
an argument now, is it?

313
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,312
I won't see you until
you stop seeing her.

314
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,317
Well, that's an argument.

315
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,363
How's our patient doing?

316
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:39,660
Well, she's stable but it's too early
to tell if the pralidoxime is working.

317
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,622
Come on, go home. You can't
re-cram all of med school right now.

318
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,208
I'm feeling a lot
of pressure here.

319
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,933
You were the editor
of your school paper,

320
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,629
I think you know how
to deal with pressure.

321
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,965
No, I wasn't.

322
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:57,219
On your résumé, it said, "Rutgers
Daily Herald, Editor." Didn't it?

323
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,804
I wasn't head of the paper.

324
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,723
That's called
"Editor-in-Chief."

325
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,850
I was just a writer.
We're all called editors.

326
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,976
Ah.

327
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,062
Did you hire me because of that?

328
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,564
Not entirely.

329
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,317
Look, if you're having
buyers' remorse...

330
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,402
I'm not. I'm not.

331
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,156
You might wanna check out
volume two on infectious diseases.

332
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,911
Patient's husband just
got admitted to the ER.

333
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:34,840
Let's say you had a
really fantastic handyman.

334
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,803
I was hoping you'd interrupt my
cooking to ask about handymen.

335
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,888
Do go on.

336
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,016
Would Sam ask you
to stop using him,

337
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,828
because you might have had a
sexual relationship with him in the past?

338
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,272
Yes, the age-old
hooker-massage conundrum.

339
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,858
Cuddy might have mentioned
something about it.

340
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:57,363
Let's say you're right, completely
right about everything. Give in anyway.

341
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,727
This isn't a point of pride,
this is a point of principle.

342
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,785
Right, you're the Rosa Parks
of hooker massages.

343
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,703
The principle is
she's being irrational.

344
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,207
I give in on this, it sets the
stage for the whole relationship.

345
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,377
Putting up with irrationality is the
foundation for every relationship.

346
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,712
I agree with Sam when she's
calling her father a monster.

347
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,440
I agree with her when
she's calling him a saint.

348
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,184
And in exchange,
I get to have sex with her.

349
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,635
And I'm sure she has
similar tradeoffs with me.

350
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,304
Relationships are hard.
You have to make sacrifices.

351
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:27,768
So, sacrifice being crazy.
Go get her a gift, apologize.

352
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,980
You've finally made
a good point.

353
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,942
Which clearly
you've misunderstood,

354
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,652
based on how quickly you agreed.

355
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,404
Kitchen's burning.

356
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,155
Oh!

357
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,992
We gotta get you
thinking like House.

358
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,160
The husband's in the ER,

359
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,663
if he's got similar symptoms,
it could mean environmental.

360
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,332
Which helps our
organophosphate theory.

361
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,792
Or maybe it's an infection,

362
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,168
which would mean we were wrong.

363
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,336
Exactly.

364
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,214
Or maybe he just got sick
with something else.

365
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,341
A coincidence?
Yeah.

366
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,927
Here's one big piece of advice,

367
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,637
House doesn't buy coincidences.

368
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,683
Okay. It's not
environmental.

369
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,526
What happened to you?
What does it look like?

370
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,663
It looks like someone kicked
your arse. What happened?

371
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,896
I looked in her address book.

372
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,249
There's a guy named
Carl in Brooklyn.

373
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,691
She told you to
stay away from him.

374
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,026
I'm not so good at following
directions sometimes.

375
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:23,031
I found him, I got angry,
which I also do sometimes.

376
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,843
He said he didn't know
what I was talking about,

377
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,702
he wouldn't let me in,
I got more pissed.

378
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,180
Next thing I know, I'm on the
floor, and he's called the cops.

379
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,372
You get arrested?

380
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,708
No, he didn't press charges.

381
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,210
Well, you should press
charges. If he tried to poison her...

382
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,130
No. He really didn't know
what I was talking about.

383
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,048
He was just some guy
that Margaret...

384
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,552
Damn it, that's not even
her name, Jenny just...

385
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,555
Some guy that Jenny
used to work with.

386
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,018
I was stupid. I just assumed
the name Carl was...

387
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,815
I just wanted to find
the guy that poisoned my wife.

388
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,818
What's up?

389
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,239
Pyrexia, 103 and rising.

390
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,241
I'll be right up.

391
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,077
Your wife just
spiked a fever. What?

392
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,704
What's that mean?

393
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,414
She wasn't poisoned.

394
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,510
What are you doing?

395
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,430
Just letting you all share in the joys
of my last trip to Carlsbad Caverns.

396
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,241
Which the husband probably
would have beaten up

397
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,100
if he'd found it
in the address book.

398
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,102
Would you mind standing
next to the screen?

399
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,688
Yeah, she'd love to become
a target for your ridicule.

400
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,856
She's not already?

401
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,274
Endocarditis?

402
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,610
Normal EKG.
No Osler nodes.

403
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,736
Right, Dr. Kelly.

404
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,904
Kelly's her first name.

405
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,697
What's your point,
Dr. Robert? Run an echo.

406
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,200
I already did. No
vegetations, valves are clear.

407
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,953
Snapilicious! But as
I always like to say,

408
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,097
it's better to be a Helpful
Helen than a Negative Nelly.

409
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,624
So while you're cooking up
some ideas of your own,

410
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,211
allow me to present theory
2.0 of why Chase hired you.

411
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,797
Dr. Kelly, meet
your doppelganger.

412
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,968
Oh, no.
Hold on a second.

413
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,887
Come on. House.

414
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,391
Is that... That's Baby
Chase and his mum.

415
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,725
That's adorable.

416
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,144
Never mind the baby.
Peep the babe.

417
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,897
Note the cheekbones
and eye shape.

418
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,768
They do actually look alike.

419
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,086
I know what you're thinking,
"Chase wants to sleep with his mom."

420
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,362
But who wouldn't hit that,
if that looked like that?

421
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,403
It's a classic case
of what Freud called...

422
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:28,073
Stop.

423
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,741
This isn't about Chase's mother.

424
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,755
You're wrong. What do
you mean, he's wrong?

425
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,328
It is about your mom?
No.

426
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,496
So it's about...

427
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm assuming he thought I'd
be a good member of the team.

428
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,502
And on that subject,
what about Legionnaires'?

429
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,256
Taub said he saw a rattle-y, old
air conditioner in the patient's house.

430
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,651
I don't care if he saw her
licking a petri dish of bacilli.

431
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,843
There's no lung involvement.

432
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,208
All we know is we don't see it.

433
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,513
Dehydration from the fever
could hide the pneumonia.

434
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,017
Okay. Forget
the mom theory.

435
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,353
Now water the patient,
treat for Legionnaires'.

436
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,524
Hey, Taub. You didn't
write up the AC system.

437
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,192
Did you mention it to Kelly?

438
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,319
No.

439
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,321
You mentioned it to Chase?

440
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,823
Yeah.

441
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,533
Whose idea was Legionnaires'?

442
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,370
Dr. Chase's.

443
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,873
Well, you get major points
for trying to trick me.

444
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,791
Unfortunately, you lose
them all for failing.

445
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,795
Hold that, hold that.

446
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,381
See, now you're frowning, you
can really see the resemblance.

447
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,053
Who gives a crap
if I prepped her?

448
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,555
House. And that's just
off the top of my head.

449
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,723
Why are you doing this?

450
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,928
You're trying to make me
look bad So you look better?

451
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,145
Or you don't like her? Or
you're angry at me? What?

452
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,398
We hire someone unqualified, it's
just dead weight we'll all be pulling.

453
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,484
Me especially.
You especially, why?

454
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,152
What do you mean, why?
Because I'm...

455
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,862
You're what? You're
my boss or something?

456
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,572
Something like.

457
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,741
So that's what it is.

458
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,053
You're angry that House gave
me the chance to hire someone,

459
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,555
'cause you still think you're at a
different level to everyone else.

460
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,498
That's just pathetic.
I am at a different level.

461
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:04,086
Which is reflected in what,
exactly? Your title? No.

462
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:09,007
Your salary? Not really.
Your responsibilities? Hardly.

463
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,258
Your attitude?

464
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,844
Ah.

465
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,179
I think we've finally found it.

466
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,367
Doesn't change the fact that you made a
bad decision because you wanna get laid.

467
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,077
Or the fact that you're
courageously picking on Kelly,

468
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,581
'cause you're scared
to take on House.

469
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,106
Congratulations.
You're a real leader.

470
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,373
I am Felipe.

471
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,018
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

472
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:48,130
Dr. House was worried how you
left things. He is giving you massage.

473
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,590
As an admission
he was wrong? Yes.

474
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,554
Well, tell him thanks, but I have a
meeting with Dr. Schatz in 20 minutes.

475
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,391
He says you would say that,
and to say, "No, you don't."

476
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,310
Well, tell him he needs to
stop canceling my appointments,

477
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,312
because I will just
reschedule them.

478
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,441
He says you would
say that, and to say,

479
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,860
uh,

480
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,824
"That Dr. Schatz is
a fat, lonely moron

481
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,911
"who, in an effort to have
contact with a human female,

482
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:24,082
"makes the same exact complaint
about parking spaces every month,

483
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,503
"and you know you have
to stop enabling him."

484
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,842
I have great fingers.

485
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,101
That's so nice.

486
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,687
Thank you.

487
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,192
How long have you
been a masseur?

488
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,861
What is that, "masseur"?

489
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,822
A massage therapist?

490
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,115
Oh.

491
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,117
No, not long.

492
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,497
How did my boyfriend find you?

493
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,790
Boyfriend?

494
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,375
Dr. House.

495
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,545
He is your boyfriend?

496
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,381
Why is that surprising?

497
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,219
I just mean, if he found me,

498
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,721
I do not think
he's got no girlfriend.

499
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,225
Are you a prostitute?

500
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,518
Are you a cop?

501
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,603
Then no.

502
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,649
Get your hands off me.

503
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,367
I didn't know you smoked.

504
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,077
I don't.

505
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,916
I don't mind screwing up.

506
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,894
I've screwed up in my life,
and I've gotten over it.

507
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:54,339
But I'm not a cheater and I'm
not a liar, and now I feel like both.

508
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,052
You're right.
I'm sorry.

509
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,098
You work with House, you kind
of get a messed-up perspective

510
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,701
of what's permissible
in the workplace.

511
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,019
Maybe I should just quit.

512
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,773
No. You're smart,
you're hardworking.

513
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,442
Yeah, but I'm not like you guys.

514
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,028
Use what makes you different.

515
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,281
A lot of this job is reading
people, dealing with them.

516
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,869
You're a psychiatrist.
Use your skills.

517
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,554
You okay?

518
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,974
I checked with Trenton General.

519
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,435
There's no support group
for abused women.

520
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,644
Maybe it was just...

521
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,565
If she was lying about that,
what else is she lying about?

522
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,569
I mean, maybe she wasn't even
abused. Maybe she's a criminal.

523
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,822
Who the hell knows? You
don't know, that's the point.

524
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,159
The way she's acting, that's
the way abuse victims act.

525
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,579
Their personalities are affected
by what they went through.

526
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,122
They find coping mechanisms.

527
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,167
I gotta talk to her
about this Trenton thing.

528
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,421
If you wake her up, make
her feel defensive, it'll go bad.

529
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,508
She doesn't need any more
hostility or aggression in her life.

530
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,180
Okay.

531
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,063
Seriously? A massage
from a male hooker?

532
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,690
He was?

533
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,192
Huh!

534
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,362
Well, it doesn't
bother me at all.

535
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,155
I guess we both learned
a valuable lesson.

536
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:46,117
Except that I didn't use to
have sex with him, you idiot.

537
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,829
Plus, he was a gay hooker.

538
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,208
Have you any idea how hard it
is to find a straight male hooker?

539
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,295
Come on.
It's a massage!

540
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,131
I don't care
who gives it to you.

541
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,092
Why not treat me the same way?

542
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,845
I'm sure that some part
of you believes this idiocy,

543
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,307
but you can't possibly be
stupid enough to think that

544
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,601
you can convince any part of me.

545
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,898
And that can only mean you're
trying to sabotage this relationship.

546
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,027
Why would I do that?
We're doing fine.

547
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:25,365
Because the next step from fine is
serious. And you can't handle that.

548
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,535
So you're trying to keep me at
arm's length with all this crap.

549
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,497
How about you?

550
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,457
I have been completely
open with you.

551
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,209
You won't let me sleep over.

552
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,754
You basically haven't
introduced me to your daughter.

553
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,173
But do you want to
spend time with her?

554
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:47,595
Honestly, before this,
I would have said no.

555
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:54,602
But, yeah, how are we ever gonna be a
couple if you keep hiding her from me?

556
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,479
House.

557
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,400
I need to protect her.

558
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,739
If I let you into her life
and you go away...

559
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,952
I can call it what it is.

560
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,206
I'm not the only one
who's holding back.

561
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,467
Hey, baby.

562
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:31,347
I am not getting mad. I'm just
trying to understand you here.

563
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,729
But there's no meeting like you
talked about at Trenton General.

564
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,065
You see, it turns
out that... Turns out.

565
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:44,277
The turnout. The turnout.
It's been turned. Turning.

566
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,487
What?

567
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,447
Turning.
Hey.

568
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,949
The turnout. The
turnout. It's turning. BILLY: Hey.

569
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,877
You're going to burn.

570
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,928
What's happening to her?

571
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,583
It's hit her brain.
Whatever "it" is.

572
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,837
Opacity in the left
temporal lobe.

573
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,380
It could be nothing.

574
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,050
Which would get us nowhere,
so let's assume it's something.

575
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,301
What kind of something?

576
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,511
Abscess.

577
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,888
Or lymphoma, or Wegener's.

578
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,892
We'd have to biopsy it to be sure. Any
of them could explain all of the symptoms.

579
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,354
You know, we're assuming
everything is connected.

580
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,275
Because it probably is.

581
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,945
But her delusions are
consistent with mental illness.

582
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,864
Bipolar disease, for example.

583
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,491
She's 30, it could be hitting
her right now for the first time.

584
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,494
So her mind just happens to
fall apart right after her body?

585
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,204
I thought I was
having a bad week.

586
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,373
I know it sounds
coincidental, but...

587
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,458
You know what, I'm
back to the Cameron theory.

588
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,182
But you hired the dumb
version of Cameron,

589
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,690
so you can fire her
and get revenge...

590
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,589
Give her a break.

591
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,965
What, you switched sides?

592
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,594
Let me guess, Chase represents
the dumb version of Thirteen...

593
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,524
I realized if we all
just keep pressuring

594
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,598
Kelly, of course she's
gonna get stuff wrong.

595
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,142
It's irresponsible of me
to let that happen.

596
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,313
You are a true leader of men.

597
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,481
Get someone to cut into
her head and get me a biopsy.

598
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,668
Whoa!

599
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,463
Just say "hold on" next time.

600
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,882
Her temperature's normal.

601
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,051
So what? She was on
the cooling blanket.

602
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,637
We took her off an hour ago.
She should be febrile again.

603
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,769
Tell House one of the patient's
symptoms just disappeared.

604
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,480
Could it be Legionnaires',
and our treatment worked?

605
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,667
I wish, but no, we've been hydrating
her, and there's still no lung involvement.

606
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,693
So relapsing, remitting fever.

607
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,571
Malaria, dengue...
Why wasn't she frozen?

608
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,699
This morning.

609
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,552
If you put a healthy person
on a cooling blanket,

610
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,286
they'd be chilled like
a fine chardonnay.

611
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,164
She's a nice warm Merlot,
98.6 all day.

612
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,958
I didn't want her to freeze.

613
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,336
So you titrated the blanket. As her
fever dropped, you lower the power.

614
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,504
Exactly.

615
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,173
So it's been on the
lowest setting since when?

616
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,591
Yesterday afternoon.

617
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,928
Which means we could have known that
her fever was gone yesterday afternoon.

618
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,308
The fever was brief.
Sounds like a reaction to medication.

619
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,852
The antibiotics?
Without vomiting?

620
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,187
When did she last puke?

621
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,023
Not since she was admitted.

622
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,734
Two down.

623
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,780
Shooting for three.

624
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,311
You're gonna
turn her pacemaker off?

625
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,248
You sure that's a good idea?

626
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,417
No. But it might be.

627
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,592
No tachycardia.

628
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,722
So only the delusions are
left, if they're even still there.

629
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,559
Maybe it is a bipolar disorder.
She's female, she's 30...

630
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,103
It's not a coincidence.
You gotta stop doing this.

631
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,898
But it could've been prompted
by the physical symptoms.

632
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,237
You couldn't be more wrong.

633
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,949
You got the cause
and effect backwards.

634
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,744
Start her on haloperidol
and lorazepam.

635
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,332
Give it a few hours to take
effect. Call me when she awakes.

636
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,799
Still hallucinating.

637
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,386
Can you hear me?

638
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,600
What are you looking at?

639
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,227
The table, it's on fire.

640
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,689
If it was, you think
I'd be able to do this,

641
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,108
without screaming for my mommy?

642
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,735
Thank you.

643
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:40,281
Don't be too impressed. It's
mostly the happy pills you put her on.

644
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,159
But she can talk to us now.

645
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,996
The obviously stupid lie you
told us about your hospital records,

646
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,040
it turns out to have been
un-obviously un-stupid.

647
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,377
You thought
you wouldn't get caught,

648
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,879
'cause you thought that
you'd be cured and back home

649
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,548
by the time we spoke
to the other hospital.

650
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,384
Because you knew
what was wrong with you.

651
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,596
Your doctor was treating you
with risperidone, right?

652
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,199
That's why you were in Trenton.

653
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,393
You had the stomach pain, you went
to see him, he wanted you to taper off...

654
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,978
Her doctor's not in Trenton.

655
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,688
Not the one you know about.

656
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,984
If you haven't figured it out
by now, your wife has a secret.

657
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,987
What the hell
is he talking about?

658
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,406
This about your ex?

659
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,492
The ex was not SO much
a secret, more of a lie.

660
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,744
You weren't married
before, were you?

661
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,540
I'm sorry, I didn't want
you to know about it.

662
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,500
Know about what?

663
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,170
She's sick. She's been
sick for years.

664
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,298
Maybe it put you on the streets,

665
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,551
maybe that's where
you got the broken bones.

666
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,971
She's only suffering
from one condition.

667
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,224
Everything else is side effects
of the drug that was treating it.

668
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,977
When she stopped taking
the drug, the side effects faded,

669
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,105
but the underlying
disease is still there.

670
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,068
Why don't you tell your husband?

671
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:09,287
Billy, I'm schizophrenic.

672
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,546
That's the kind of
thing that a recent

673
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,385
psychiatric resident
might have figured out.

674
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,688
What the hell am I
supposed to do now?

675
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,733
Nothing. Her physical
symptoms are gone.

676
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,295
We'll put her on a different
anti-psychotic for the mental ones.

677
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,695
You can take a nap.

678
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,655
This is not who I married.

679
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,201
Of course she is.
You just didn't know it.

680
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,036
I don't know if
I can stay with her.

681
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,205
Sorry, as your
marriage counselor,

682
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,582
I'm not allowed to talk to
you without your wife present.

683
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,878
Just tell me how hard it would
be for us to handle this, medically.

684
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:03,883
Look, if you want me to give
you a reason to leave her, fine.

685
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,110
Apparently you haven't noticed,

686
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,928
but she's got a serious
mental illness.

687
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,597
It's too hard.

688
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,478
It's always hard.

689
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,330
Okay, so I made a mistake.

690
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,666
Kelly will make a fine doctor,

691
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,335
but she's not ready
for the team.

692
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,546
Up to you.

693
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,133
What? You like her now?

694
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,219
Nope. But she got me
to the right answer,

695
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,221
which none of
the rest of you did.

696
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,558
If you want to give her
another shot, go for it.

697
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,602
Okay. I will.

698
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,145
Great.

699
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,023
It'll make it easier
for you to sleep with her.

700
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,652
Come on. Why else
would you have hired her?

701
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,571
That's not why I hired her.

702
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,397
What are you doing?

703
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,691
Got bored with the porn
on my computer.

704
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:49,196
You got any girl-on-girl-
on-girl-on-vibrating-object-on-girl stuff?

705
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,116
I wouldn't have to do this

706
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,827
if you'd gave me the name of
that physical therapist you like.

707
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,955
You done with Brandi?

708
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,042
Eh... Knobby hands.

709
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,629
I will get you the name.

710
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,863
Let's stay at my place
tonight, okay?

711
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,636
Will you get cable?

712
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,012
Then we'll have
to have more sex.

713
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,639
Okay.

714
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,521
What are you doing?

715
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,524
Quitting before House fires me.

716
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,318
Hold on.

717
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,778
We both know he is.

718
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,366
But maybe there's a bright side.

719
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,659
What?

720
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,580
You really looked out for me.

721
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,375
And you seem like
a really good guy.

722
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:49,048
And I never date anybody
who I work with, but...

723
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,388
Yeah. Sorry it
didn't work out.

724
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,435
You want to get dinner
tomorrow night?

725
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,162
You want some more meat?

726
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,039
This is meat?

727
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,126
Yes, please.

728
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,890
Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Kid,
come on, come on, come on.

729
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,059
Come on.

730
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,020
Hey, hey.

731
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,162
Aren't you adorable.
