1
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,140
-Hello?
-Do you ever pray on a difficult problem?

2
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,560
Connie.

3
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,800
l had this revelation.

4
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,770
New York City is not
a domestic destination like, say, Dallas.

5
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,530
l'm sorry. What?

6
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,910
You know, God speaks to us.
We have an impulse and we act on it.

7
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,380
-That's very interesting.
-So how do we know to do it, Don?

8
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,910
How do we know to do something?

9
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,960
lnstinct.

10
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,330
So, you're just like a dog?

11
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,210
l knew the patina of the Waldorf would
shine over all my domestic properties,

12
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,760
but it hasn't worked abroad.

13
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,470
l know l just gave you New York,
but can you help me with that?

14
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,060
You want me to take
your international business, Connie?

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,610
l want you to earn it. A little bit of wow,
as a lady friend of mine used to say.

16
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,540
Let me think on that.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,820
lt sounds like pride, but l want Hiltons
all over the world, like missions.

18
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,960
l want a Hilton on the moon.
That's where we're headed.

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,160
Okay.

20
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,960
America is wherever we look,
wherever we're going to be.

21
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,850
-That's very good, Connie.
-You're the one who said that to me.

22
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,100
Well, l guess it's not that memorable.

23
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,310
Write up a proposal for
the New York Hiltons as convention spaces.

24
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,570
Send it over to me by noon.
l'll take it on the plane.

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
Done.

26
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,360
Goodbye.

27
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,590
-l'm sorry about that.
-lt's okay.

28
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,340
l don't think the 4:00 a.m. feedings
are over yet.

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,460
"l want what l want when l want it,"

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,930
and you don't care what it does
to the rest of us.

31
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,590
Like someone else l know. Yeah.

32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,800
Baby's up every three hours.
Hilton only calls every four.

33
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,680
l think you like it.

34
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,780
What are you doing?

35
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,070
l can't sleep. l'm going in.

36
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,680
What are you doing?

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,880
-l'm running.
-ln the dark?

38
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,020
lt's cool, it's quiet and no one bothers me.

39
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,810
You're wrong about that.

40
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,610
Let me give you a ride.
Where are you going?

41
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,940
l'm going home,
and the whole idea is to run there.

42
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,690
Well, take a break. You smoke?

43
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,830
-The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King...
-Take me up to Ross Lane.

44
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,210
...president of the southern Christian
Leadership Conference, spoke at the march.

45
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,880
I have a dream that my four little children...

46
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,790
-Don't.
-...will one day live in a nation

47
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,050
where they will not be judged
by the color of their skin

48
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,090
but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today.

49
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,980
Two young women were brutally murdered
in their Upper East side apartment...

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,610
When school starts,
l'm going to read it to the kids the first day.

51
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,120
Do you think they can understand it?

52
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,040
l think they already know it, and it'd be nice
for them to hear an adult say it.

53
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,110
Who are you?

54
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,170
l mean, dumb or pure?

55
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,090
Running out here in the middle of the night
and l run into you.

56
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,170
-How did that happen?
-What are you doing on the road?

57
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,850
l don't know. l can't sleep.

58
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,520
-Right or left?
-Just let me out up here.

59
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,540
-lt's a nice house.
-l rent the apartment over the garage.

60
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,260
-Have coffee with me.
-You'll be late for work.

61
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,720
l'm always late. lt's coffee.

62
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,890
Maybe that's why you can't sleep.
Too much coffee.

63
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,450
Good morning.

64
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,830
Sorry.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,920
How long have you been there?
l had no idea.

66
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,750
Can you get me some coffee, please?
And l need you to type this up

67
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
and get it to Hilton
before he leaves for Europe.

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,850
Actually, he's going to California.

69
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,510
He already left two messages on the service.
Do you want me to get him?

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,190
-This. Coffee. Hilton.
-Of course.

71
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,960
-Mr. Draper usually brings this in.
-He left early.

72
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,120
-Can we go outside now?
-lt's raining. Go upstairs.

73
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,090
-l did not sleep last night.
-Go take a nap. l'll shop in the afternoon.

74
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,020
lt could either be the view of the Acropolis,
orjust these big columns,

75
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,110
like you're standing there.

76
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,610
Then below it,
"Your window on the world. Hilton," period.

77
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,610
That window looks as old to me
as those columns.

78
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,030
Did anybody look at a picture
of the Athens Hilton?

79
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,700
Sliding doors don't read as windows.

80
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,550
And believe it or not,
we're not allowed to pretend

81
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,620
that that's the view from the window
of the Hilton, because it's not.

82
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,290
Other than that?

83
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,540
The tag is flat.

84
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,020
-Well, that one's yours.
-That doesn't make it good.

85
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,130
lf it's bad, don't use it.

86
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,550
What else?

87
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,310
There are 1 6 graphically-perfect reduced
photographs of Hilton hotels all on a grid.

88
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,570
-Simple headline.
-"Go. We'll meet you anywhere."

89
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,330
Now that l can finally understand you, l am
less impressed with what you have to say.

90
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,400
That's your work, too.

91
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,240
-Who's we?
-We are Hilton.

92
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,080
And how do l know that?

93
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,430
Take out a magnifying glass
and look at one of those tiny hotels?

94
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,430
l write "Hilton" very big under this Greek.

95
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,720
There is no deadline.

96
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,970
l want to see work as you think of it.
Give me more ideas to reject.

97
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,680
l can't do this all by myself.

98
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,530
-l'm telling you, it's bad for me.
-What's that supposed to mean?

99
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,800
And cut! Well, l think we've finally got it.

100
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,720
l told you, you had it the first time,
if that's what you want.

101
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,300
And l told you l want what you want.

102
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,340
-Where is he supposed to be looking?
-Onto the horizon.

103
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,060
We want people to focus on the Lucky.

104
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,150
-This is what your father signed off on.
-Let me see it again.

105
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,810
Nathaniel, again, please.
Watch through the camera.

106
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,060
That's a good idea.

107
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,560
Action.

108
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,420
l just don't know what he's looking at.
l want him staring right at us at the end.

109
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,680
There's a style for the draw on these spots
and it's stop, inhale, 1 ,000-yard stare.

110
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,880
Tell me what you think.

111
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,600
l think you're the client
and we should do what you want.

112
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,610
-lt can make people very uncomfortable.
-Walter Cronkite does it every night.

113
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,810
Let's take a risk together,
shall we, Sally?

114
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,820
Going again. This time, Nathaniel,
on the draw, look right in the lens.

115
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,180
It's Wednesday, september 4th,
and currently 64 degrees in Manhattan.

116
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,060
We have to get a pencil case.

117
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,470
-What's wrong with your pencil box?
-How was the first day?

118
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,740
l wish l could've found the camera,

119
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,520
just so we could see the difference
on your face

120
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,160
from when you left this morning
to when l picked you up.

121
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,360
-So, you like your teacher?
-She's okay.

122
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,080
lt's Mrs. Patton. All they do is draw.

123
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,700
ls this today's mail?

124
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,710
-l'll get him.
-Would you?

125
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,450
You're so quiet. You must be tired.

126
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,750
l'm not tired. l really want a pencil case
to put in my loose-leaf.

127
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,330
We'll see.

128
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,260
Lucky strike, the hard-working smoke
with that smooth and honest taste.

129
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,800
-Cut.
-So, it's a rhythm?

130
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,890
That's true. Obviously, it'll sound better
with the announcer's voice.

131
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,340
lt sounded like you had a half a pastrami
in your mouth.

132
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,390
lt's a scratch track. l didn't know
you were gonna show it to the client.

133
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,320
l know l'm supposed to stay away
till the screening,

134
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,570
but l am fascinated by this process.

135
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,240
You're thinking about getting out
of cigarettes and into the movies?

136
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,450
Not while my father's alive.

137
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,690
Well, if we rerecord the sound tonight,
we can probably finish this.

138
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,950
l heard you the first time.
l'll be in the booth.

139
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,750
l'd appreciate it if you'd forget
all that nonsense l was saying before.

140
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,630
-What are you talking about?
-The movies, my father.

141
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,190
-Forgotten.
-Sorry, but l had a long, wet lunch.

142
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,940
-Really? Too much to drink.
-And other things.

143
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,270
Secretaries nowadays,
they don't give you a choice.

144
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,190
You know what l mean?

145
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,450
-l don't have a secretary.
-How'd my shot turn out?

146
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,490
l'm not sure. l think it's gonna feel strange.

147
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,960
Lucky Strike has a way of doing things.
Look at this.

148
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,760
Yeah, see? l don't think that's so bad.

149
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,010
Come on. He's not coming back for a while.

150
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,440
l'll lock the door.

151
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,650
-l'm married.
-So am l.

152
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,580
-There's been a misunderstanding.
-l know what l know.

153
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,660
Jerry should have the tracks done.

154
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,260
You can see the whole thing tomorrow
or when it's done.

155
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,540
l'll probably be busy tomorrow.

156
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,310
l got it. You're at work. That's too bad.

157
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,960
-How about a nasty old alligator?
-He has a point.

158
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,670
Down, Sue. I'll handle this.

159
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,880
"Henry, I'm so pleased there's a place
that I can write to you.

160
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,830
"The children are finally
back in school now, and I must admit

161
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,460
"that I like the idea of looking forward
to the mail's arrival every day.

162
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,760
"Well, not every day. Ha, ha.

163
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,940
"I don't write many letters anymore,
so I apologize in advance

164
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,190
"if I'm unable to accurately
express my thoughts.

165
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,270
"But I do have thoughts,

166
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,060
"and I suppose I wonder too much
where you are and what you're doing.

167
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,740
"We've only met three times,
you know that? Isn't that strange?

168
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,450
"I wish I had a clearer picture of you
in my mind.

169
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,840
"Anyway, that's all I have to report.
I hope to hear from you. B."

170
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,550
Don't touch it.

171
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,350
-l've seen this one. lt whitens.
-lt's not about what you want to watch.

172
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,940
l have to make sure
they run every commercial.

173
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,890
...pillowcases, socks, towels, everything.

174
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,230
My mother-in-law says
l look like Perry Mason.

175
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,200
lt's not a compliment.
lt means she thinks you're fat.

176
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,530
-Crane.
-Harry, it's Lee Garner.

177
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,450
l knew you'd still be there.

178
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,540
-You work hard, don't you?
-For you? You bet.

179
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,220
Look, l don't want to keep you,
but l have a bit of a problem.

180
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,890
-What's wrong?
-lt's that Salvatore fellow, the director.

181
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,310
He's no good. l'd like him gone.

182
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,220
-What happened?
-Well, l can't work with him. Get rid of him.

183
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,360
-Well, l can't do that.
-Excuse me?

184
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,080
No, l'm not really... l can't.
Pete and Roger handle your account.

185
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,780
No, no. No, no, no, Harry.
l want you to take care of this,

186
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,580
and l want you to keep it just between us.

187
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,710
Crane, you there?

188
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,670
Listen, Lee. l hope you know
the commercial's turning out beautiful.

189
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,850
-You really have an eye, you know.
-l do, do l?

190
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,260
-Are you enjoying the city?
-l am. Plenty to do.

191
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,100
Well, you have a good night.
l should get back to work.

192
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,600
-Sorry to trouble you. Good night.
-Good night.

193
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,950
-What was that?
-You don't want to know.

194
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,160
-l think l do.
-l can't tell you.

195
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,040
Now l really do.

196
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,370
-Lee Garner Jr. asked me to get rid of Sal.
-What'd he do?

197
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,050
l didn't ask. He was drunk as a skunk
and he's scary to begin with.

198
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,590
What are you gonna do, call Campbell?

199
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,050
That's the other thing.
He said to keep it between us.

200
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,000
What are you gonna do?

201
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,210
l'm not gonna panic
and do something stupid like l usually do.

202
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,590
-That's a good start.
-l can't really do anything, can l?

203
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,470
He was really drunk.

204
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,600
The show's on.

205
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,740
Great, l missed all the commercials.

206
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,080
-Hello?
-Don, it's Conrad Hilton.

207
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,040
ls it?

208
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,580
Now, don't be like that.
l know it's a privilege to call you at home.

209
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,250
l don't think l've worn it out. lt's 1 1 :30.

210
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,230
-lt's not a problem, Connie.
-Can you come have a drink with me?

211
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,900
-Right now?
-You can say no. l've heard it before.

212
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,900
And for all you know,
you're not the first person l asked.

213
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,660
l'll be there.

214
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,160
Give me an hour.

215
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,030
Hello?

216
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,170
-So what is that, moonshine?
-No, but it is from Prohibition.

217
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,710
l have two cases,
and they both say "hair tonic" on the side.

218
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,680
l remember this.

219
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,810
l think you know
l'm in a bit of a crisis tonight.

220
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,040
-l didn't know that.
-l think about my business day and night.

221
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,920
And l'm a harsh critic, especially of myself.

222
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,120
And sometimes it collects, and l feel bad.

223
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,710
And then l realize
maybe that's the reason l'm so lonesome.

224
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,380
-You might be working too much.
-l'm not working enough.

225
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,690
lt's my purpose in life
to bring America to the world,

226
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,810
whether they like it or not.

227
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:08,780
You know, we are a force of good, Don,
because we have God.

228
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,780
Communists don't.

229
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,250
lt's their most important belief.
Did you know that?

230
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,720
l'm not an expert.

231
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:26,350
Generosity. The Marshall Plan,
you remember that?

232
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,470
Everyone who saw our ways
wanted to be us.

233
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,640
l'm glad you're telling me this.

234
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,690
After all the things we threw at Khrushchev,
you know what made him fall apart?

235
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,940
He couldn't get into Disneyland.

236
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,160
-That's good.
-You never heard that?

237
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,330
Well, l did, but when l hear you say it,
it sounds beautiful.

238
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,670
l don't want any politics in my campaign.
You know that.

239
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,060
But there should be...

240
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,850
Goodness, and confidence.

241
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,350
Thanks for listening to me, Don.

242
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,870
You know, sometimes l look around here,

243
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,070
and l think, "By golly, l'm King Midas."

244
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,550
Stop it. You're not.

245
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,470
You're my angel, you know that?
You're like a son.

246
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,860
ln fact,
sometimes you're more than a son to me

247
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,860
because you didn't have what they had,

248
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,150
and you understand.

249
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,250
Thank you.

250
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,620
l mean it.

251
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,490
Come in, come in, come in.

252
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,310
l drove all the way down to get the mail,
and then l turned around and l debated it.

253
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,400
-l went past the exit a dozen times, and...
-My girl is due back.

254
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,000
l know l shouldn't be here.

255
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,950
lt's just, l wanted to see you.

256
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,910
l wasn't thinking.

257
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,510
-What do l say? Why are you here?
-There you are.

258
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,310
Carla, this is Henry Francis.
He works for Governor Rockefeller.

259
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,270
lt's nice to meet you.

260
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,730
So anyway, l think this is
an excellent venue for a fundraiser.

261
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,660
-Good. l'll have to check with my husband.
-Of course.

262
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,190
Carla, will you show Mr. Francis out?
l think l left the bath running.

263
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,150
-A pleasure to meet you.
-You as well.

264
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,300
l can't get this. Lucy, do you mind?

265
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,410
Jesus, knock it off.

266
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,480
lt's a Lucky Strike commercial.
lt's got three cuts in it.

267
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,860
So the hillbilly says, "That ain't my finger."

268
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,950
l'm gonna have to hear
the beginning of that joke.

269
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,290
Lee? Lee!

270
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,040
-What's going on?
-l have no idea.

271
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,510
Does someone know what's going on?
Speak up.

272
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,810
l know.

273
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,640
Lee Garner Jr. called me
a couple of days ago. l'm sorry.

274
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,820
-Why is he calling you?
-l don't know.

275
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,060
-He did, and he told me to get rid of Sal.
-What?

276
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,780
And you made an executive decision
to do nothing?

277
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,990
He was really drunk.
l thought it would blow over.

278
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,240
l didn't even think he'd remember.

279
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,480
When you get in trouble,
you call Mommy and Daddy.

280
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,990
He told me not to tell you,
so what was l supposed to do?

281
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,710
Everyone's an account man. What exactly
do you think we do here, Crane?

282
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,460
We handle clients.

283
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,620
-He wouldn't say a word. He just left.
-Sal, you're fired.

284
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,170
-Are you serious?
-Lee Garner Jr. wants you fired.

285
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,060
We're gonna find out
what he wants to do with you, imbecile.

286
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,560
-Oh, God.
-What the hell happened?

287
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,010
What is going on?

288
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Now, you're gonna use your dying breath
to tell Don to fix this.

289
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,820
-Don?
-Lee Garner has a problem with creative,

290
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,940
let Don solve it.
He does it all now anyway. Now!

291
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,210
-What did Lee say to you?
-Nothing. l have to talk to Don.

292
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,790
-Let me talk to Don.
-l'm doing as l'm told. ls he busy?

293
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,910
l can see you and l can hear you.
What do you want?

294
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,170
Who died?

295
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,640
-l screwed up with Lee Garner Jr.
-What?

296
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,430
-How do l explain this?
-He told Harry to fire me.

297
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,650
-Harry?
-l didn't, but now Roger did.

298
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,190
-Roger did what?
-He fired me.

299
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,150
Roger said to tell you to fix it.
Those are his words.

300
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,810
Fantastic.

301
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,610
That's a $25 million account
you stuck your nose in, Crane.

302
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,740
Just get out.

303
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,580
What happened?

304
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,300
Lee Garner got drunk,
and he told Harry to fire me,

305
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,090
and then Roger got angry and he did.
l think if l get away from Lucky Strike

306
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,850
and lay low from Roger for a day or two,
everything will be fine.

307
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,100
l understand what just happened.
What happened with the cut?

308
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,600
-The commercial's fine.
-Sal, something must've happened.

309
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,690
l can't help you unless you tell me.

310
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,940
-We had a misunderstanding.
-Jesus. l'm not gonna ask again.

311
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,200
He was drunk,
and he cornered me in the editing room.

312
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,420
-Cornered you?
-Yes.

313
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,090
And l backed him off,
l told him l was married,

314
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,670
and he was embarrassed and he left.

315
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,260
-You must've been really shocked.
-l was, believe me.

316
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,300
But nothing happened,

317
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,820
because nothing could have happened
because you're married?

318
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,850
-Don, l swear on my mother's life.
-You sure you want to do that?

319
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,290
Who do you think you're talking to?

320
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,570
l guess l was just supposed to do
whatever he wanted?

321
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,030
What if it was some girl?

322
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,540
That would depend on what kind of girl
it was and what l knew about her.

323
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,660
You people.

324
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,010
l didn't do anything but turn him down.

325
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,260
He's a bully.

326
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,300
Lucky Strike can shut off our lights.

327
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,450
l think you know
that this is the way this has to be.

328
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,120
You'll do fine.

329
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,440
Get me Lee Garner Jr.

330
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,230
l said l don't want salad.

331
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,820
Watch your tone, young man.
Carla works for me, not you.

332
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,610
-What do you want instead?
-You might as well call it a day.

333
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,200
Okay. Thank you.

334
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,090
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi.

335
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,720
How was your day?

336
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,300
Not good.

337
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,930
l didn't want to bother you with it,
but that man dropped by today

338
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,840
from the governor's office. Carla met him.

339
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,070
Francine sent him over here.

340
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,240
They want to have a fundraiser,
but her house isn't big enough.

341
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,700
l don't care, as long as l don't have to go.
When is it?

342
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,740
Well, l should be going.

343
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,660
Soon. Next week, l think.

344
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,540
-A fundraiser for Rockefeller.
-For the campaign.

345
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,340
-l'm gonna go lay down. Good night, Carla.
-Good night.

346
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,130
-Good night, children.
-Good night.

347
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,290
Bye.

348
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,090
Good night, Mrs. Draper.

349
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,560
lf you're here, do l have to be here?
Because l'm leaving.

350
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
-No, go ahead.
-Good night, boss.

351
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,670
-Henry Francis.
-Hello. I thought I'd get the service.

352
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,800
This is Betty Draper.

353
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,310
l know that.
Listen, l shouldn't have come by like that.

354
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,220
-l hope l'm not calling too late.
-No, you're not.

355
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,640
l checked with my husband
about the fundraiser.

356
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,280
-The fundraiser?
-Yes, we'd be glad to do that.

357
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,810
How's Tuesday the 1 7th?
Can you make it then? ls that good for you?

358
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,530
Okay. l guess
you're going through with this.

359
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,120
l had to.

360
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,040
l'll have my girl call you tomorrow
to make it official.

361
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,870
l look forward to it. Let me know
what's usually provided by the host.

362
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,870
Sure.

363
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,960
Goodbye.

364
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,140
Good night, Betty.

365
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,640
Rome, Tehran, Tokyo
are magnificent destinations,

366
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,400
and that's really been the focus
of almost every campaign you've had

367
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,980
up till now.
How to lure the American traveler abroad.

368
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,410
What more do we need than a picture
ofAthens to get our hearts racing?

369
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,410
And yet the average American
experiences a level of luxury

370
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,830
that belongs only to kings
in most of the world.

371
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,460
We're not chauvinists.
We just have expectations.

372
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,890
Well, now there's one word that promises
the thrill of international travel

373
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,770
with the comfort of home. Hilton.

374
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,930
"How do you say ice water
in ltalian? Hilton."

375
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,350
"How do you say fresh towels
in Farsi? Hilton."

376
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,280
"How do you say hamburger
in Japanese? Hilton."

377
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,290
"Hilton." lt's the same in every language.

378
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,960
Maybe fried chicken. l don't like
the sound of "hamburger" and "Hilton."

379
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,390
Besides, "hamburger"
is already a foreign word.

380
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,960
We'll see.

381
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,930
lt's good. Very good.

382
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,810
lt's clever, yet friendly. Draws you in.

383
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,070
But what about the moon?

384
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,870
-Excuse me?
-There's nothing about the moon.

385
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,660
Well, right now,
that's not an actual destination.

386
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,380
That wasn't the point.
l said l wanted Hilton on the moon.

387
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,590
l couldn't have been more clear about it.

388
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:36,960
Well, l'll admit l misunderstood that.
l'm sure there's a way to fit that into this.

389
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,090
Well, isn't this something?

390
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,770
l'd like to speak with Don in private.

391
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,210
This is a good campaign, one of the best.

392
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,540
lt's modern, it's witty, it's eye-catching.
lt will change your business.

393
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,470
Calm down.
l'm going to speak very honestly with you.

394
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:21,680
l don't think folks do that often.
Probably scared.

395
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,220
Or they trust my work.

396
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,480
You want me to just say yes
to everything you do?

397
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,480
Most ad men believe that clients are
the thing that gets in the way of good work.

398
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,680
l've never experienced that.

399
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,610
You did not give me what l wanted.

400
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,780
l'm deeply disappointed, Don.

401
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
This is a great campaign.

402
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:52,080
Fine. What do you want from me? Love?
Your work is good.

403
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,760
But when l say l want the moon,
l expect the moon.

404
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,520
-l said if he ran, l'd support him.
-l haven't decided yet.

405
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,120
l voted for Kennedy.
l'll probably vote for him again.

406
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,530
What a nice turnout.

407
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,820
-Where's Henry Francis?
-l don't know. Someone's supposed to talk.

408
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,120
l don't know anything about Rockefeller.
That's why l did this.

409
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,710
Well, l want to know
how he's gonna deal with the South.

410
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,500
Do you know how bad it must be
for the negroes

411
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,470
to descend on Washington like that
just to be heard?

412
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,550
Segregation is uncivilized. lt's that simple.

413
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,880
You know what my father says
about the South? "lt's not 1 963, it's 1 863."

414
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,890
Thank you.

415
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,690
Mrs. Draper, l'm Elsa Kittridge
and l work with Mr. Francis.

416
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,230
Pleasure to meet you.
l assume he's been delayed.

417
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,570
Actually he asked that l address the group
on behalf of the governor.

418
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,040
That's disappointing.

419
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,820
l mean, l don't think it's going
to help your fundraising

420
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,170
when you promise one thing
and deliver another.

421
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,960
Well, perhaps you're right,

422
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,170
but he seemed to think
l was a better match to the group,

423
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,250
and l am extremely informed.

424
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,430
ln fact, l'm the person
who briefs Mr. Francis.

425
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,850
l think you'll see l won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

426
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,560
-Please, begin whenever you want.
-No, you begin, dear.

427
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,110
Excuse me, my name is Betty Draper.
Welcome to my home.

428
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,330
-We're going to listen to...
-Elsa Kittridge,

429
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,460
Associate in the Governor's
lnformation Office.

430
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,700
First l would like to dispel the rumor that
there is a mandatory contribution tonight.

431
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,790
This is a taking of a pulse,
an exchange of ideas.

432
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,770
Please see that we're not disturbed.

433
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,160
Hey!

434
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,410
Mr. Francis, do you need anything?

435
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,590
-No, Marjorie, l dropped something.
-Where were you last night?

436
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,260
-Calm down.
-Why didn't you come?

437
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,840
Why did you send that woman?

438
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:52,180
-l watched the door all night like a sap.
-l'm sorry, but l wanted you to come to me.

439
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,140
-The ego.
-Would you listen to me?

440
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,020
-You had to come to me.
-And why is that?

441
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,700
Because you're married.

442
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,670
No, Henry.

443
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,810
What's wrong?

444
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,560
Please. We're locked in this office.

445
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,070
What? On the desk? On the couch?

446
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,690
-We should get a room somewhere.
-No.

447
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,190
lt's tawdry.

448
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,920
l'm sorry.

449
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,550
l'm very sorry. l started this.

450
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,430
l don't know what you want.

451
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,810
Goodbye.

452
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,360
-Mr. sterling's here to see you.
-Send him in.

453
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,290
l heard Conrad Hilton left this building
in a huff yesterday.

454
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,880
Who told you that?

455
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,490
You've got your face so deep in Hilton's
lap, you're ignoring everything else.

456
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,040
-Everything's under control.
-You won't even let me meet the man.

457
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,010
What do you think accounts does,
besides limit your brilliance?

458
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,140
l'd tell you,
but l don't want to hurt your feelings.

459
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,550
Keep joking about it.

460
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,730
We've had two clients in one week
leave here angry. lmportant clients.

461
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,570
ls that what you want this place
to be known for?

462
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,820
That and some guy losing his foot
in a lawnmower?

463
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,940
l want to put you on notice,
you are in over your head.

464
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,620
These children,

465
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,240
unoffending, innocent and beautiful,

466
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,140
were the victims
of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes

467
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,890
ever perpetrated against humanity.

468
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,760
You can leave it on your station.
l don't mind.

469
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,140
-lt's all right.
-What was that?

470
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,200
The funeral service
for the little girls in Birmingham.

471
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,280
lt's so horrifying.

472
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,030
Are you okay? Do you need a day off?

473
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,500
No, l'm fine. Thank you.

474
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,040
l hate to say this, but it's really
made me wonder about civil rights.

475
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,430
Maybe it's not supposed
to happen right now.

476
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,050
-Hello, Mr. Draper.
-Hello.

477
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,090
You just missed bedtime.
They're probably still awake.

478
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,900
No, don't bother with dinner.
We got Chinese takeout.

479
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,070
Listen, Marty needs me
to look over this work.

480
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,420
Don't wait up for me.

481
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,340
l love you, too.

482
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,870
Betts.

483
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,540
What?

484
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,710
Hilton just called. l'm going in.

485
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,180
l didn't hear the phone.

486
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,720
Go back to sleep.

487
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,840
-Someone's going to see you.
-Then let me in.

488
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,480
This is nice.

489
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,370
What can l do for you?

490
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,860
l don't know. l wanted to talk.

491
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,410
Right. Says the man
as he unbuckles his pants.

492
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:58,000
What do you want me to say?
You've been flirting with me for months.

493
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,000
-So what?
-So, l can't stop thinking about you.

494
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:08,640
Because l'm new and different.
Or maybe l'm exactly the same.

495
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,930
Tell me you've run past that stretch
of highway in the past two weeks

496
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,900
and not thought of me,

497
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,390
not looked for me.

498
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,200
But then l have the luxury
of that last half-mile home

499
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,910
where l go through every step of the future
until it ends.

500
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,580
l know exactly how it ends.

501
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,580
So what?

502
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,950
You live two miles from here.
Your daughter was my student.

503
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,460
l've seen your wife in the market.

504
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,760
l don't think
you've done this before this way.

505
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,230
l want you.

506
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,680
l don't care. Doesn't that mean anything
to someone like you?
