1
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,820
l don't care if it's windy or rainy,

2
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,320
there's no reason for a shake roof to fail
if it's laid right.

3
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,330
Except that one.

4
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,240
No flashing around the chimney.
That's gonna cost them.

5
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,550
Go around!

6
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,510
Now, l'm gonna push it up
to 25 miles an hour.

7
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,180
That's what we're allowed to do here.
You've got to really pay attention.

8
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,870
Fifteen minutes of news
and nothing about the Holy Father.

9
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,740
He's still dead, Ma.

10
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,160
-The shower cap hold up?
-Yes.

11
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,540
Piece ofjunk.

12
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,620
lf you want, l'll have Gerry come over
and fix your shower.

13
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,930
lt was fixed, but l think Ronnie the super
sneaks in and breaks it.

14
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,420
For all l know
he's going through my things right now.

15
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,180
You don't like getting
a little bit of attention?

16
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,920
Anita, this man does not look
the way you want him to.

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,890
l'd offer you a room,
but since Mom moved in, l don't have it.

18
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,430
l want to move to Manhattan.

19
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,520
Really? lt's so far away.

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,810
lt is far, and l commute almost two hours
total every day, five days a week.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,150
-That's an extra week of work each month.
-My goodness. l never thought of that.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,740
Pegs, the rents there, they're outrageous.

23
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,250
l know, but l'm already spending a fortune
between subway fare,

24
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,950
cab fare on late nights,

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,790
pantyhose... lf l can't find a newspaper,
the cane on the seats destroys them.

26
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,140
And it'll be easy with that savings
and a roommate.

27
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,270
Jeez Louise,
you've really been thinking about this.

28
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,730
Ma, it's not good for it!

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,180
Why don't you move in here
and we send her to Manhattan?

30
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,560
You gonna be one of those girls?

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,310
l am one of those girls.

32
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,210
Well, Ho-Ho, l observed your wishes
for secrecy, but now is the time.

33
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,780
Gentlemen.

34
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,670
lmagine the perfect mixture of athletics,
spectacle and speed.

35
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,890
Jai alai.

36
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,680
Jai alai is like handball,
only you fling the ball

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,470
and catch the ball with this basket thing.

38
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,640
lt's more complicated than that.
And dangerous.

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,220
l'll leave the loose-leaf, but it shows
the way jai alai attendance is growing.

40
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,180
ln seven years, it'll eclipse baseball.

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,990
Go ahead, you can laugh,

42
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,450
but it's got the same fingerprint as baseball,
only better.

43
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,030
A special stadium called a fronton,

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,330
and you can sit real close, which is a thrill
because the ball goes 1 75 miles an hour.

45
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,160
And it's got Patxi.
He's Babe Ruth, only handsome.

46
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,250
This is Patxi.

47
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,350
l was looking for boxers,
but l bought his contract instead.

48
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,690
-He's the greatest player in the world.
-Mel Ferrer.

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,850
l'm terrified of him catching balls
in the face.

50
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,060
So, let's say there's enough money.

51
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,950
How would you chop it up?

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,980
Well, most of it's going
to end up in television.

53
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,940
Perfect, because l want a TV show.

54
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,780
-A sports show?
-Did you see Patxi?

55
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,120
You don't see him flying around the world,
solving crimes and banging broads?

56
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,040
Harry has excellent relationships
with the networks.

57
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,130
-Well, it'll probably have to be ABC.
-No, no.

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,630
l want to be on all the networks, like when
the President addresses the nation.

59
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,190
Tuesday night, 8:30 to 9:00,
all three networks, the same show.

60
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,310
-No one's ever done it.
-Because...

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,820
That's true.

62
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,070
How about a star-studded
big musical special with a jai alai match.

63
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,240
-Desi Arnaz.
-What else you got?

64
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,790
-Well, there's print.
-Women's magazines.

65
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,330
A glamorous night in Miami
with a free admission.

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,090
-Tuesday night is ladies' night.
-And, of course, newspapers are key,

67
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,000
but you can't limit yourself
to less than 1 0 markets.

68
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,840
This is impressive.

69
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,600
-Don't get up.
-Horace, this is Don Draper.

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,510
-l told you he'd be stopping by.
-Well, don't let me interrupt.

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,770
So far, for the jai alai campaign,

72
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,140
Sterling Cooper will produce
an adventure program

73
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,480
starring your handsome fellow,
a musical spectacular...

74
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,740
On all three networks,
and it has to be in color.

75
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,190
CBS doesn't have color.

76
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,500
Fine. l'd like to get
the ladies' magazines in color,

77
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,460
and maybe a color page
in the Sunday paper.

78
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,880
-What about radio?
-You'll have to take radio the way it is.

79
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,630
l don't think it's worth anyone's time
unless you're willing to commit to at least

80
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,400
-$1 million, to start.
-Sure, but that's a third of my ad budget.

81
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,270
Well, as they used to say
at the freshmen mixer,

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,740
-"When you get a yes, you go home."
-Only, Humps, you never got one.

83
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,910
Listen, Draper, l'd love to buy you dinner,
run some slogans by you.

84
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,740
Actually, Ho-Ho, we buy you dinner.

85
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,750
That was fun.

86
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,680
l'm going to have to buy Campbell
a case of something.

87
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,930
Patxi.

88
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,890
During the Depression, l saw somebody

89
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,380
throw a loaf of bread
off the back of a truck.

90
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,340
lt was more dignified.

91
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,190
Are you going to have trouble
sleeping tonight?

92
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,320
l've seen clients
far more defenseless than he.

93
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,490
Well, as the Bible says,
"Enjoy your fatted calf."

94
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,450
Campbell, did you tell him
who this idiot's father is?

95
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,540
He said he's a shipping magnate,
not a client.

96
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,710
Horace Sr. is connected to Bert Cooper
in a million ways,

97
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,590
and l don't know if he would like
what just happened in there.

98
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,870
You want to run it by his daddy?

99
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,050
He's my age.
So he was born with a lot of money.

100
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,760
He has a dream,
and it's ourjob to make it come true.

101
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,140
Well, there you have it.

102
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,760
Nicely done, my boy.

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,530
Elizabeth. Get off your feet.
lt's bad for the baby.

104
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,820
-As soon as l finish the dishes.
-Sit with me.

105
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,490
Cleaning up for the maid.
You're just like your mother.

106
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,630
l don't like watching you commit suicide.
Neither do your kids.

107
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,760
What do you want, Daddy?

108
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,970
lt's all laid out in here,

109
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,310
my arrangements.
Just follow the directions.

110
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,260
l don't want to talk about this.

111
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,140
We talk about it now and then
we don't talk about it. That's the idea.

112
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,600
-Fine.
-Jesus. Smoke your cigarette.

113
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,320
Funerals are a dishonest business.

114
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,240
People don't want to think about it.
That's how they get you.

115
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,040
Remember what happened
with your mother?

116
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,080
The will's translucent or transparent
or something according to the lawyers.

117
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,800
You run the show.

118
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,880
-You took me in.
-Anything else?

119
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,720
l want you to have your mother's coats.

120
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,800
l gave Judy the Hudson seal,
but l want you to have the chinchilla

121
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,930
and obviously the mink.

122
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,070
They're in the cedar closet.
They key's in Gloria's end table.

123
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,560
Okay, Daddy.

124
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,150
You don't want to hear about it,
Scarlett O'Hara?

125
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,040
l have the folder.

126
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,330
You've always been sensitive.
That's my fault for shielding you

127
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,430
from all the dangers out there.
That's probably why you married this joker.

128
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,670
lf you'd even known what was possible...

129
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,150
But that's that. l wrote it down.
We never have to talk about it again.

130
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,850
l don't understand
why you like talking about this

131
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,950
when you can see so clearly
that it upsets me.

132
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,440
You're being selfish and morbid.

133
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,950
l'm your little girl.

134
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,110
And l know it must be horrible
to be looking at whatever you're looking at,

135
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,620
but can't you keep it to yourself?

136
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,470
-What kind of mood is he in?
-l'm never right.

137
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,880
-Anybody been outside? Do l need a coat?
-l'd take it.

138
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,480
Don, George Caan dropped out of Patio
to direct a picture in LA.

139
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,850
l look forward to his average work.
Replace him.

140
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,050
There's no time and there's no talent.

141
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,520
What were you gonna do
if you had to fire him?

142
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,980
-Have Sal do it.
-Are you serious?

143
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,350
-Sal, do you want to do it?
-Of course l do.

144
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,530
lt sounds good,
but it makes me very nervous.

145
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,070
lt's lifted straight from Bye Bye Birdie.
lt's a single shot.

146
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,330
Sal did the storyboards. l could go on,
but l don't think l should have to.

147
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,490
-Allison?
-Keens chophouse.

148
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,120
Thank you, Don.

149
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,170
Tag. You're it.

150
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,670
Hey. You don't want
to cut towards yourself.

151
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,380
There we go. Get down.
l've got some great things in here.

152
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,300
This is an exact imitation
of the Gettysburg Address.

153
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,390
-You know about Honest Abe?
-He learned to read by candlelight.

154
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,930
That's right.

155
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,110
Well, l'll be.

156
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,400
Don, look at this.

157
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,750
Victory medal, France.

158
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,960
l should have another for beating the clap.

159
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,080
Here we are.

160
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,540
Wow!

161
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,880
That spike, it's Prussian.

162
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,520
Germany's greatest soldiers.
You had to respect that.

163
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,860
That's where l got him.

164
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,700
-You see that? Dried blood.
-You shot him?

165
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,990
l think so. l shot lots of them.
They were trying to kill us.

166
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,860
-War is bad.
-Maybe,

167
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,790
but it makes a man out of you.

168
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:56,590
Living off the land, battling the elements,
standing alongside your brothers.

169
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,040
-Ask your pop.
-Gene.

170
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,960
-What?
-Gene, don't.

171
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,130
-Come on.
-Bobby, give it back.

172
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,970
Let him have it! That's why l got it!

173
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,270
-Can't l have it?
-There was a person in that helmet.

174
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,810
-An enemy.
-Bobby, it's a dead man's hat. Take it off.

175
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,690
Keep it on. lt's yours.

176
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,550
There was this girl...

177
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,480
You like? lt was on sale at A&S.

178
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,650
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.

179
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:13,450
Kitty.

180
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,380
l'm working.

181
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,050
-Something's wrong, isn't it?
-No.

182
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,230
No, no, no, don't say that. Don't say that.

183
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,600
-l'm not myself.
-What does that mean?

184
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,240
Why are men so embarrassed
to share their emotions?

185
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,580
Please. Sal...

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,870
The past few months... Something's wrong.

187
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,010
-Well, that's not true.
-lt is true.

188
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,760
You know, l don't need that much, but...

189
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,310
l do need tending.

190
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,400
-l'm so sorry.
-Well, what can l do?

191
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,610
You won't even tell me.

192
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,150
Make some excuse.

193
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,420
For the last six months, maybe a year, even,
l've watched my job disappear.

194
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,340
Nobody wants illustrations anymore.
lt's all about photography.

195
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,140
And yes, l've been nervous.

196
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,390
And now l have this opportunity

197
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,560
to do something
that really does have a future.

198
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,050
So it's been building to this,
and tomorrow you will triumph

199
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,560
and come home a conquering hero.

200
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,200
-What's wrong with you?
-Well, l do have one horrible flaw.

201
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,690
l love you.

202
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,460
l don't want to fail.

203
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,790
Just... With a single mistake,
the entire shot is ruined.

204
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,920
So what? You've seen the movies.
Take two. Take three. Do it again. Action.

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
lt's one shot, the whole thing.

206
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,090
-lt's the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.
-l'm trying to remember.

207
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,590
She starts singing
against a blue background,

208
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,220
and her voice is very girlish.

209
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,190
-Yes. Yes, l remember that.
-And she's offering us this can of Patio.

210
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,600
And she's on a treadmill,
but you can't see it.

211
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,530
-She's walking back and forth?
-No, no. She walks towards you.

212
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,580
The wind is blowing in her hair,

213
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,110
and she sings about
how Patio is low in calories.

214
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,740
And then she extends her hand out
and she waves goodbye.

215
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,790
Then we move back, too,

216
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,950
but she stops,
and she takes her dress in her hands

217
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,830
and she runs forward as fast as she can.
But then she turns her back

218
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,630
and looks seductively over her shoulder.

219
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,140
The treadmill pulls her back again
and she comes towards you one last time,

220
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,400
dancing right up to the camera.
She sort of pushes her shoulders together

221
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,070
and leans over with the can
and she smiles. "Hello, Patio."

222
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,540
Something like that.

223
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,540
Sound good?

224
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,920
You're gonna do great.

225
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
-You really think so?
-Yes.

226
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,890
Don, l'd like you to meet Horace Cook.

227
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,780
-We've met. Lincoln Center.
-Of course.

228
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,520
Have a seat.
Lane has brought it to my attention

229
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,360
that Mr. Cook's son
has approached us for work.

230
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,790
Actually, it was Don who thought it best,
out of deference, to include you.

231
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,080
We're not psychiatrists.
There is no confidentiality.

232
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,830
That's not strictly true, but you are family
and, well, it appears to be a lot of money.

233
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,640
Bert seemed alarmed.
What exactly happened in this meeting?

234
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,260
-Well, you know, your son has a dream.
-Yes, jai alai.

235
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,730
When he first mentioned it
l assumed he was gambling,

236
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,730
but he seems convinced
of its financial potential.

237
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,390
And there's no reason to doubt that.

238
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,690
Are you drunk? lt's like Polish handball.
You can't even play it if you're left-handed.

239
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,490
There's no wall on that side.

240
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,320
Well, then, that's done with.
We needn't be involved.

241
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,960
Bert, you know that's not the way
the marketplace works.

242
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,590
A man comes through your door,

243
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,960
he knows what he wants,
he's got the money to back it up,

244
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,170
-you do your best.
-Perhaps l'm unclear

245
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,590
because l'm childless, but they're not.

246
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,840
Well, should you be lucky enough
to strike gold,

247
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,610
remember that your children weren't there
when you were swinging the pick.

248
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,280
l've seen his plan. lt's gibberish.

249
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,020
But if you refuse him,
he'll only find someone else.

250
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,250
My son lives in a cloud of success,

251
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,960
but it's my success.

252
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,790
Perhaps when that evaporates
and his face is pressed

253
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,040
against the reality of the sidewalk,
he'll be of value to someone.

254
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,210
"Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten."

255
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,390
That's how l was raised.

256
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
So you want us to proceed?

257
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,570
When we put that money aside for him,
he was a little boy.

258
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,990
We didn't know
what kind of person we were making.

259
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,740
Don't be so hard on yourself.

260
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,780
Easy for you to say.
He doesn't have your name.

261
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,490
You'll stay for lunch. No discussion.

262
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,410
A pleasure to see you again.

263
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,250
Pleasure.

264
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,050
-l'll sign him tonight.
-Very good.

265
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,650
These are ideas.

266
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,520
You can skip some if you want to,
but do not go out of order.

267
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,270
Hello, this is Margaret.

268
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,490
Hello, my name is Elaine and l'm 22,

269
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,290
and l have a good job
and l'm interested in a roommate, too.

270
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,340
Well, it's nice to speak with you, Elaine.
Where do you work?

271
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,870
Well, l live in Teaneck, New Jersey,

272
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,000
so l want to be in this city
to be near my job.

273
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,220
-I work in a tannery on the West Side.
-Really? They make leather?

274
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm a secretary,

275
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,560
but l am around animal skins and carcasses
most of the day,

276
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,260
so l don't keep pets.
The smell makes them go crazy.

277
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,700
l don't know if the West Side
is what l had in mind.

278
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,490
l need someplace near a major hospital.

279
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,490
My face is very badly burned

280
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,660
and l need frequent prescriptions
for unguents and salves.

281
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,090
-lt would have to be two bedrooms.
-Two bedrooms is good.

282
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,460
Now, about the bathroom,

283
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,210
I'm going to need some help there.

284
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,190
Who is this?
You know something? You're a jerk.

285
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,530
-Why do you do that?
-l've got a salt tooth.

286
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,580
-lt's right here in the back of my mouth.
-Grandpa.

287
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,710
lt's getting harder to fool you.
l got two spoons.

288
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,750
Mommy doesn't let us
have ice cream before dinner.

289
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,590
ls she afraid you're going to be fat
like she was?

290
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,800
Your grandma Ruth used to
drive her to town to run errands

291
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,230
and make her walk herself home.
That put a stop to it.

292
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,560
-You remember Grandma Ruth?
-She gave me a ukulele.

293
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,510
-Did you learn it?
-No.

294
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,930
You can, you know. You're smart.

295
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,770
You remind me of your grandma
more than your mother.

296
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:13,400
You know, she did drafting
in the 20s for this engineer.

297
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,320
-A little bald man. He wasn't a threat.
-That's good.

298
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,750
You can really do something.
Don't let your mother tell you otherwise.

299
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,730
You know, she won't let me eat this either,
and l don't want to be the only one,

300
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,060
so l'll tell you what.
l'm gonna keep a lookout.

301
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,980
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.

302
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,570
-She's coming! Quick, hide it!
-l knew you were gonna do that.

303
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,040
This tastes like chocolate,
but it smells like oranges. You smell that?

304
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,290
A year from now there'll be nothing
but rum and Mexican beer in this place.

305
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,510
-You ever have Mexican beer, Humps?
-l don't drink a lot of beer.

306
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,760
You have to when you're there.
Amoeba, dysentery.

307
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,050
Patxi caught a bug, lost eight pounds.
That's a lot on his frame.

308
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,900
Ho-Ho was saying a photo of Jack Kennedy
enjoying jai alai

309
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,440
would be a tremendous endorsement.

310
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,070
My father hates Kennedy,

311
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,700
'cause he knew Old Joe
when they were criminals together.

312
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,490
Plus, Dad's against integration.
He called Patxi a wetback.

313
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,860
Jack Kennedy certainly ended up
with a betterjob than his father.

314
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,990
l know this idea sounds crazy,
but read your history.

315
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,410
l've got a 50% chance, at least.

316
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,160
My father's dead,
but l know he'd be interested.

317
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,140
This is his kind of investment.

318
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,430
l think about the way
my father made his fortune,

319
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,180
renting ships for troop transport
during the war.

320
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,550
He didn't care about the Germans.

321
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,940
And then l think,
l could really do something.

322
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,410
l might not be president, but l could...
l could build something.

323
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,440
And people will like it,
and l'm going to be the father of this sport,

324
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,780
and people are gonna be dying
to do business with me, even my father.

325
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,790
l have this image in my mind.

326
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,720
lt's his 75th birthday,

327
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,790
and l give him a team.

328
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,550
l want to give you a piece of advice.

329
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,820
l've been doing this a while,
and l applaud your enthusiasm,

330
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,360
but l think you should take this decision
a little more seriously.

331
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,730
-What are you saying, Don?
-Let him... Let him talk.

332
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,950
You have a great fortune,
and that's not just money. That's the future.

333
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,040
And we will take all of your money,
l promise you,

334
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,970
but l think you should reevaluate
this particular obsession.

335
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,080
You can do better.

336
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,600
That's a sales technique, isn't it?

337
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,560
You zig away from me
and l zag back into your arms.

338
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,440
You know,
l've got the galleys of this book by Ogilvy.

339
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,870
Learned a lot about advertising.

340
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,700
Then why aren't you eating dinner
with Ogilvy?

341
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,330
'Cause Campbell talked me out of it.

342
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,800
Now let's get one thing straight.

343
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,120
lfjai alai fails, it's your fault.

344
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,920
l'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

345
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,470
Don't apologize. Everybody thinks that.
Nobody says it.

346
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,830
Are you removing that or moving it?

347
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,650
Did everybody in Manhattan decide
l'm not allowed to live here?

348
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,240
No. Actually, l think the right girl
could have a very good effect on you.

349
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,160
l do, however, find your ad unfortunate.

350
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,250
lt's perfect. l proofed it thoroughly.

351
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,840
"Clean, responsible, considerate.

352
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,040
"l have some nice furniture
and a small television."

353
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,550
lt reads like the stage directions
from an lbsen play.

354
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,430
So what, then? You'll give me some ideas,

355
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,270
and l'll use them,
and you'll all have an even bigger laugh?

356
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,100
No, l thought l'd tell you
how to get a roommate.

357
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,940
This is not the way.

358
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,950
Fine.

359
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,740
Please, Joan, tell me how to do it.

360
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,710
-For one thing, why "Margaret"?
-lt's my name and it's more adult.

361
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,050
But this is about two young girls
in Manhattan. This is about an adventure.

362
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,510
Am l wrong?

363
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,760
lf this were me, l would say something like,

364
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,710
"Fun-loving girl, responsible sometimes.

365
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,010
"Likes to laugh. Lives to love.

366
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,650
"Seeks size six for city living
and general gallivanting.

367
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,730
"No dull moments or dull men tolerated."
Or something like that.

368
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,810
Well, thank you. That's very helpful.

369
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,330
And don't put it up there.
Everyone here knows you.

370
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,480
Branch out.

371
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,650
Good night, Peggy.

372
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,020
Don. There you are.

373
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,740
l was just on my way over to Lane.
l've got signatures.

374
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,030
Horace Cook, Jr. is all dressed
and ready for the oven.

375
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,730
ln light of all of the trepidation,

376
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,980
perhaps you should deliver this
to Lane yourself.

377
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,920
-Are you following me?
-l spent two years at Dartmouth

378
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,160
hiding him from shylocks.
Let me enjoy my payday.

379
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,020
Mr. Hooker,
has Lane stopped by the clubhouse?

380
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,300
l'll go and get him.

381
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,980
That's called a cesta.
lt's made of reeds from the Pyrenees.

382
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,690
The ball is called a pelota.
They just sent all this over.

383
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,310
So did Horace have any more ideas?

384
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,110
For one thing,
he wants us to call it the NJAA.

385
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,750
National Jai Alai Association?

386
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,170
He has no idea how confused
America's gonna be about that "J."

387
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,590
Look at this camaraderie.

388
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,750
Perhaps we've discovered
America's pastime after all.

389
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,470
Full steam ahead.

390
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,680
-Bravo, boys.
-How about Patxi: The Motion Picture?

391
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,060
God, l wish l was a part of this.

392
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,060
l've informed the home office.
There was a flutter of adding machines.

393
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,650
Well, you heard him, boys.

394
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,140
Don't stop until you see the whites
of his pockets.

395
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,480
Cosgrove.

396
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,310
Good God.

397
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,070
Bill it to the kid.

398
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,840
-What the hell is that?
-lt's an English muffin.

399
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,010
The hell it is. Put it away.
You can eat at school.

400
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,220
l already ate my breakfast.

401
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,260
Well, don't keep me waiting this afternoon.

402
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,420
l want you dressed and ready for ballet
at 3:00 on the button.

403
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,260
-No dawdling.
-Okay.

404
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,650
l'm gonna buy fruit. What do you want?

405
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,070
-Peaches, please.
-Peaches give me a rash.

406
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,240
Your sister likes them.

407
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,290
Are you Peggy?
They just sent me back from reception.

408
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,160
-l'm Karen Ericson.
-Yes, l am. How nice to finally meet you.

409
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,950
You have your own office.
Wowee! At the travel agency, it takes years,

410
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,040
and Martha Winston's the only girl,
and she's married to the boss.

411
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,050
Well, it's different up here.

412
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,380
Everyone on the first floor
loved your humorous ad.

413
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,890
You seem like someone
l could really be friends with,

414
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,840
not like the last girl.

415
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,640
Well, l'm fun and l love to have fun.

416
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,680
She was always keeping her door shut,

417
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,640
and l think you should only close your door
for one reason.

418
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,150
What's that?

419
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,230
l just don't get along with women
like l do men,

420
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,570
but she left to get married,
so l must be some kind of good-luck charm.

421
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,200
-Do you have a steady?
-No, l'm still playing the field.

422
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,170
There are so many interesting men
out there. Except sailors.

423
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,960
l have a couple of rules.
One of them is l don't like sailors.

424
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:14,640
-No sailors. l agree.
-So, Peggy Olson, l have to ask,

425
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,720
-are you Swedish? Because l am.
-Norwegian.

426
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,020
Well, we won't tell my parents.

427
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,100
l'll make appointments and come by at 5:00.
Or do you want your girl to do it?

428
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,230
l finish up around 6:00.

429
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,660
-Well, then tomorrow?
-Most days.

430
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,900
Can we look on Saturday?

431
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,120
-But not this Saturday...
-You work on Saturday?

432
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,540
Not every Saturday.
And Saturday nights never.

433
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,120
l'm out in the city, ready for fun.

434
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,210
Well, okay. l'll call you, roomie.

435
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,120
l got you a sandwich.

436
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,000
-l'm gonna walk around the park.
-Well, have fun, roomie.

437
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,160
lt's Mommy.

438
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,660
-Where's Grandpa Gene?
-lt must've slipped his mind.

439
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,250
-Where is he?
-Probably at home.

440
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,510
l'm sure he'll be there when we get home.

441
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,150
Bye, bye, sugar

442
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,240
Hello, Patio

443
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,790
When the cake
is on the plate

444
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,620
I'm afraid
to gain the weight

445
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,490
But now I have
some extra room

446
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,870
Patio,
you make me swoon

447
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,620
Diet cola tastes divine

448
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,710
Get your own,
'cause this one's mine

449
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,720
It's the brand new
slender you

450
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,590
Now we'll have you
singing too

451
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,010
Bye, bye, sugar

452
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,520
It's great
to see you go

453
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:36,240
So bye, bye, sugar

454
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:48,620
Hello, Patio

455
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:02,140
-l can't even tell you how thorough Sal was.
-Well, l appreciate that, but this is...

456
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,300
l don't know.
This is not what l thought it was gonna be.

457
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,140
Glad l'm not alone.

458
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,600
Look, l don't think there's any ambiguity
about this being exactly,

459
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,070
and l mean exactly, what you asked for.

460
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,320
l know,
but there's something not right about it.

461
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,190
-What?
-l can't put my finger on it.

462
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,700
-l wish l could, but l can't.
-lt's an exact copy, frame for frame.

463
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,450
l'll tell you what. Why don't we send a dupe
back to the office with you?

464
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,300
No. l'm sorry.

465
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,220
l wish l could explain it,
but it's just not right.

466
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,340
l'm gonna be magnanimous
and say it's our idea and our failure,

467
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,220
but it is a failure.

468
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,470
That is magnanimous.

469
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,440
-l'm sorry about that.
-Maybe next time.

470
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,860
lt's true. lt's not right.
lt doesn't make any sense. lt looks right,

471
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,960
it sounds right, smells right.
Something's not right. What is it?

472
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,070
lt's not Ann-Margret.

473
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,430
Mommy, there's a policeman! Hurry!

474
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,850
Yes, may l help you?

475
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,650
-Are you related to Eugene Hofstadt?
-Yes, l am. What is it?

476
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,580
We regret to inform you
that he passed away.

477
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,290
-Oh, God.
-No! No!

478
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,280
l'm fine.

479
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,120
-What happened?
-He collapsed in line at the A&P.

480
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,410
l'm so sorry, ma'am.

481
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,140
l...

482
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,420
Well, we need to know
what you'd like to do with his body.

483
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,010
Yes, of course.

484
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,490
-Mr. Romano's here to see you.
-Send him in.

485
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,680
l figured l'd bring myself to the woodshed.

486
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,390
lt must be horrible
having a client insist on something

487
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,430
and then change their mind
once they've seen it.

488
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,840
-l hope it never happens to me.
-l was the director and l let you down.

489
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,520
-l'm in a meeting.
-l have Mrs. Draper on the line.

490
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,200
-lt's urgent.
-l can go.

491
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,570
What's the matter?

492
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,370
l'm sorry, Betts.

493
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,630
l'm...

494
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,380
l'm very sorry.

495
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,710
Do you want me to call William?

496
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,760
Just stay put. l'll be right there.

497
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,390
-l have to go.
-ls everything okay?

498
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,930
There's nothing you can do.

499
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,900
Don't ruin the only good thing
to come of this.

500
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,060
You are now a commercial director.

501
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,250
How do l know you're not just saying that
to make me feel better?

502
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,920
You'll know when l hire you again.

503
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,990
Allison, l'm going for the day.

504
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,130
Okay, Ma.

505
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,590
Oh, my goodness. lt's beautiful.

506
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,590
ls that all the noise that this was?
Why didn't you wait for Gerry to help?

507
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,180
Because he's playing cards
and Peggy gets up early.

508
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,110
-Say thank you, Ma.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

509
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,600
An Admiral. You must be doing well.

510
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,830
-l am.
-What's the matter, peaches?

511
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,370
Sit down, Ma.

512
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,070
What's this about?

513
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,490
Don't, Anita. Stay.

514
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,420
Ma, l'm having problems with my apartment,

515
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,430
and my commute is very long and...

516
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,970
lt doesn't mean nothing
if you want to stay here with us.

517
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,940
Your father and l lived
with grandma and grandpa for years.

518
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,150
Your sister was born there.

519
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,140
Ma, l'm getting an apartment in Manhattan.

520
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,870
-Well, that makes sense.
-lt really does.

521
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,290
Yeah, l guess l'm the kind of mother

522
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,620
who'd rather have a new TV
than a daughter.

523
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,200
l got you a new TV
because you needed one.

524
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,260
You got me a new TV
'cause you think l was born yesterday.

525
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,250
You belong in the city.

526
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,000
Do you see this, Anita?
This is what they do. Family is cheap.

527
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,930
Well, take it back, okay?

528
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,930
Because it's just going to remind me
of how stupid you think l am.

529
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,180
Ma! You knew she'd have
to move there eventually.

530
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,270
Now, someday both of you
are going to feel this,

531
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,280
this... This broken heart l'm carrying.

532
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,110
You'll get raped, you know that?

533
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,780
lt's just as dangerous as here,
and l'm going to have a roommate.

534
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:07,740
She's a nice girl. Her name
is Karen Ericson. She's Norwegian.

535
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,800
-There's a man, isn't there?
-No.

536
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,340
Why would l ever believe anything you say?

537
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,750
Stop it, Ma. You're being cruel.

538
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,930
Good night, Ma.

539
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,610
-That wasn't so bad.
-Really?

540
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,480
She's been through a lot of change lately.

541
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,740
The Holy Father dying,
that was very hard on her.

542
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,160
It has become one country

543
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,340
because all of us
and all the people who came here

544
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,880
had an equal chance
to develop their talents.

545
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,260
We cannot say to 10% of the population
that you can't have that right,

546
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,760
that your children can't have the chance
to develop whatever talent...

547
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.

548
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,980
What does that mean?

549
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,680
There were two Eugene Hofstadts
at his bank,

550
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,320
so he had to be called Eugene Hofstadt,
number two.

551
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,440
Well, he's with Ruth now.

552
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,780
l hope so.

553
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,090
Once he asked,

554
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,710
"What's gonna happen when l get to heaven
and l have two wives?"

555
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,140
Knowing Gloria,
l don't think that's gonna be a problem.

556
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,680
Betts, don't eat that.
lt was in his car all day.

557
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,730
l don't care.

558
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,890
-Why are you laughing?
-Sally, sweetheart...

559
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,940
-We weren't laughing, honey.
-l heard you. l heard you laughing.

560
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,570
How can you be sitting there
like nothing's happening?

561
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,040
Like he's not gone?
He was here, now he's not here.

562
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,780
He's gone forever
and nobody even knows that.

563
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,120
Stop it.

564
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,130
-You're being hysterical. Calm down.
-He's dead!

565
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,880
He's dead and he's never coming back!
And nobody cares

566
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,340
-that he's really, really, really gone!
-Sally, go watch TV!

567
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,150
The United States army convoy
was delayed by soviet border guards,

568
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,120
when the convoy commander
rejected commands that his troops

569
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,620
leave their vehicles for a head count.

570
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,250
The Russians finally allowed
the convoy to pass. Robert?

571
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,660
Dumbstruck police
and horrified crowds gathered

572
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,750
as an elderly Buddhist monk
set fire to himself today,

573
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,290
resulting in his death.
The bizarre act was a protest

574
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,760
against the mostly Catholic government
of Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam

575
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,840
and their supposed campaign
of discrimination.

576
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,480
The New York Stock Exchange today
saw slight gains in moderate trading

577
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,190
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose nearly two points.

578
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,430
And now here's Stan Baker
for Winston cigarettes.
