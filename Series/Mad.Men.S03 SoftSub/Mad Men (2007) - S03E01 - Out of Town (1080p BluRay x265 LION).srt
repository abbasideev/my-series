1
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,760
Do you know how hard l've prayed?
Why does he make me suffer?

2
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,640
-God will give you a child.
-Let me see her.

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,450
-So you killed another one.
-'Cause you had nothing to do with this.

4
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,870
Maybe you ought to stay off her
once in a while.

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,710
Get out, you witch!

6
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,670
I've got 85, and my boots are off.

7
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,510
You don't have a sheath.

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,020
l'll get one, but that'll be another quarter,
and this is all l have.

9
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,860
Go wash yourself.

10
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,740
You get me in trouble and l'm gonna
cut your dick off and boil it in hog fat.

11
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,190
I'm gonna cut his dick off...

12
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,040
l'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

13
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,910
What was that, sweetheart?

14
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,340
l'm cold.

15
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,350
Do you want to hold him?

16
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,510
l'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

17
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,920
-lt's midnight. What do you want?
-l told you God would give you a child.

18
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,720
Whose is it?

19
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,350
ls your husband home?

20
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,010
God is giving you a child.

21
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,570
His name is Dick, after a wish
his mother should've lived to see.

22
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,820
Come on. Drink this.

23
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,780
You know, there's no point
in both of us not sleeping.

24
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,550
-She wakes up at night when l drop off.
-You so sure it's a girl?

25
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,010
Well, believe me,
she knows what she wants.

26
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,420
l packed your valise.

27
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,270
-l could have done that.
-Well, you'll get a chance.

28
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,140
The clasp is broken.

29
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,480
Carla said she saw Sally hitting it
with a hammer.

30
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,150
She's taken to your tools
like a little lesbian.

31
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,160
Am l ever going to sleep again?

32
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,000
At least you don't look tired.

33
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,470
l just want everything to be perfect.

34
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,390
l want her to come into our home
at its best.

35
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,980
Close your eyes.

36
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,990
-You're on a warm, sandy beach...
-Because l'm a whale.

37
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,690
You're on a warm, sandy beach.

38
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,960
You can smell the faint scent
of coconut oil.

39
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,840
And as you slide your hands

40
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,390
through that cold patch of sand
underneath the shadow of your deck chair...

41
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,220
You're good at this.

42
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,470
Lola?

43
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,310
Lola. Hello?

44
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,330
Yes, but on occasion,

45
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,500
you have to resign yourself
to sleeping where you are.

46
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,420
That's why they sell subway tokens, silly.

47
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,410
Lola.

48
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,760
-You're looking lovely today.
-Thank you. Are you here to see me?

49
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,590
No, l'm just verifying some information.
Thank you, Lola.

50
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,300
He just always stops by
concerning the strangest things.

51
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,030
-Yesterday it was my engagement ring.
-Enough, Lola.

52
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,850
You know there's something
about the way he talks.

53
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,310
l could listen to him read the phonebook.

54
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,530
Well, when he gets to "S,"
l need Howard Sullivan at Lever Brothers.

55
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,380
Remarkable.

56
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,420
l picked it for its sensuality,
but it also, in some way,

57
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,380
reminds me of our business.

58
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,840
Who is the man who imagined her ecstasy?

59
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,670
Who indeed?

60
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,650
-We were just talking about you.
-Burt's on his way. Where's Roger?

61
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,820
Probably taking another Grecian treasure
out of its crate.

62
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
l apologize for Baltimore. lt has to be done.

63
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,820
lt's a sales call.
lsn't there more l can do here?

64
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,370
lt's not a sales call.
You're the face of our business.

65
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,830
They need someone they can trust.

66
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,200
London Fog. How ludicrous.

67
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,630
-Really? l have one.
-So do l.

68
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,510
No, of course. lt's just the name.

69
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,630
There is no fog in London.
There is no London fog.

70
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,880
-Are you sure about that?
-Quite. Never was.

71
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,010
lt was the coal dust from the industrial era.
Charles Dickens and whatnot.

72
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,520
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Peterson is here to see you.

73
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,320
-Come on in, Burt.
-Hey, Don. Bert, Lane.

74
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,750
-We need you to have a seat, Burt.
-Okay.

75
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
You got a blindfold, too?

76
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,180
This isn't easy.

77
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,550
-lt really isn't.
-Oh, God.

78
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,680
l really thought l'd made it.

79
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,400
l know it's unkind,
but it's generous and it's fair.

80
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,640
-Well, why the hell did you wait so long?
-lt was brought to our attention

81
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,020
that your wife was undergoing radiation.
We thought it decent to wait.

82
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,790
That was decent.

83
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,620
Sorry l'm late. Did l miss anything?

84
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,960
Sad meeting. Sorry about that.

85
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,220
lt wasn't easy.

86
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,600
-We'll see how you do without my Rolodex.
-We're going to take that risk.

87
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,230
You make me sick. You're the dying empire.

88
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,150
-We're the future.
-Burt, control yourself.

89
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,560
-No, l'm the head of accounts, damn it!
-l'm sure we'll regret it. l'm serious.

90
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,070
See you on the breadlines, fellas.

91
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
ls that the last of it?

92
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,030
Because l don't like how much
l'm getting used to these.

93
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,710
l don't know anything you don't know.

94
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,660
You understand there's no point ever
in making over $40,000

95
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,830
when you'll be taxed 69%?
You're working for them.

96
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,000
And God forbid you really make it.
Everything over 70 grand is 81 %.

97
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,170
-Even if you're married?
-Fellow comrades in mediocrity,

98
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,890
l want you to listen very carefully.
You can all go straight to hell.

99
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,530
l heard he's going in-house at Nabisco.

100
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,370
-You're sure it's not starting again?
-Mr. Campbell's office.

101
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,740
-What?
-l'll let him know.

102
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,330
-The firings.
-Mr. Campbell, Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

103
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,010
-l'm at lunch.
-l'll bring you a doggy bag.

104
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,250
Holy crap.

105
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,800
You couldn't have pulled me aside
to say that?

106
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,310
l'm sure it's nothing.

107
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,350
How the hell am l supposed
to live like this?

108
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,310
Drop dead, you limey vulture!

109
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,450
Son of a bitch!

110
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,020
l assume you can continue
to handle this beautifully

111
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,030
while l dispense psychotherapy
to the girls in the pool.

112
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,710
You Americans don't know
how to handle your emotions.

113
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,240
lt's unbecoming.

114
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,420
His wife is sick. And if you had talked
to his girl, she would've informed him.

115
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,300
So he would've had a longer walk
to Mr. Cooper's?

116
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,800
And if you had talked to me,

117
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,800
l would have been waiting
with his coat and his Rolodex.

118
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,670
While we're on the topic of decorum,

119
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,760
l'd like to speak with you
about the way l'm being addressed.

120
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,470
Could you be more specific?

121
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,300
The switchboard. l'm not John.
l'm Mr. Hooker.

122
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,310
That's the way they've been taught
to address the secretaries.

123
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,900
Yes, well, as l've explained,
in Great Britain...

124
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,230
A truck is a lorry and an elevator is a lift.
l've got it, Mr. Hooker.

125
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,530
Despite your title, you are not a secretary.

126
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,410
-l'm Mr. Pryce's right arm. l'm not his typist.
-Of course.

127
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,000
Good luck, everybody. Good luck!

128
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,090
l assume you will let him know
when Mr. Peterson has left the building.

129
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,510
-How are we today?
-Very well, thank you.

130
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,770
-Burt Peterson's left the agency.
-Really?

131
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,820
Yes. l can't speak for everyone here,
but l like you.

132
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,410
-And l like you.
-But you don't know me.

133
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,780
But l will make that effort,
if given the opportunity.

134
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,080
Pardon?

135
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,950
l apologize that l haven't been
more welcoming, socially.

136
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,580
lt seemed until your wife arrives...

137
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,960
l didn't want to make it awkward
with a threesome.

138
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,050
Although, now that l think of it,
perhaps your being alone

139
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,340
is all the more reason
l should've offered my hospitality.

140
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,890
-Do have a seat.
-Why?

141
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,810
ls something wrong?

142
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,400
l don't know. You just removed
the head of my department,

143
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,820
and now you're offering me a chair.

144
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,700
How cruel of me. l wanted to inform you
that you're now head of accounts.

145
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,820
-Excuse me?
-lt seemed like the right thing to do,

146
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,490
despite your lack of hospitality.

147
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,200
The specifics are pending,
as is the announcement.

148
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,750
ls this really happening?
l need to know it's certain.

149
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,800
Yes, but...

150
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,600
-Wonderful. Thank you.
-Splendid.

151
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,700
-Well, it turns out things are splendid.
-That's good.

152
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,530
Could you get my wife on the phone?

153
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,010
I have Mrs. Campbell for you.

154
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,630
-How are you, sweetheart?
-What are you doing?

155
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,930
l know l told you this morning.
l'm having luncheon,

156
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,110
with the Docents' committee from the Met.

157
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,820
-How are they?
-Since when do you care?

158
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,030
Since l was made head of accounts.

159
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,730
-No!
-Yes.

160
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,570
Oh, my goodness! Peter, that's wonderful!

161
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,450
lt really is.
l knew it would happen one day for real.

162
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,660
-l love the sound of your voice right now.
-That's because l'm already drunk.

163
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,220
Good for you. Just one more minute.
My husband got some good news.

164
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,710
-Make a reservation. Surprise me.
-Okay.

165
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,460
-l should call my mother.
-Peter.

166
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,400
Don't go to the well. There's no water there.

167
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,520
l don't even know if l'm getting a raise.
l didn't ask. l forgot.

168
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,560
That's very noble. You see?
One doesn't need money to be fulfilled.

169
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,770
Don't let those ladies from the Met
hear you say that.

170
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,690
-l should go.
-Bye.

171
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,460
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

172
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,960
l heard you wanted to see me,
so l grabbed a sandwich.

173
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,220
-What can l do for you?
-Mr. Peterson's left the agency.

174
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,670
lf that's your news,
l think you've been scooped.

175
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,180
So you've heard?

176
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,970
Let's just say he did not
"go gentle into that good night."

177
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,860
So you're probably wondering
where that leaves you.

178
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,740
-Should l be worried?
-No, l should say not.

179
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,240
We're making you head of accounts.

180
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,200
Spectacular. Thanks a lot.

181
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,170
We're charting the course
of transition right now.

182
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,580
There are many details to come.

183
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,710
l wouldn't be much of an account man
if l didn't ask what it pays.

184
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,290
l wouldn't be much of a financial officer
if l wasn't prepared to disappoint you.

185
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,340
lt's 21 , but we'll reevaluate this year.

186
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,300
Ken, this is not for broadcast.
There'll be a formal announcement.

187
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,190
Great.

188
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,580
You believe this?
What is the world coming to?

189
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,720
-That is a big bottle.
-That's not a bottle. That's his date.

190
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,630
-"My, oh, my, what a big bottle you have."
-"l'm sorry, honey, but l'm taken.

191
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,590
"l just pawned my typewriter
so we could be together all weekend."

192
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,610
The captain's about to announce
our descent into Friendship. Quick refill?

193
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,220
l don't know.
Don't you need something to run the plane?

194
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,770
-And what about you, Mr. Hofstadt?
-Excuse me?

195
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,150
l took a look at your luggage.
You're William Hofstadt?

196
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,750
Bill. Call me Bill.
And this is my associate, Mr. Fleischmann.

197
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,570
-Sam.
-Shelley.

198
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,750
-Are you headed to Baltimore or DC?
-Baltimore.

199
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,050
Well, how about that?
We're heading to Hausner's for dinner.

200
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,170
You should've been in line two hours ago
if you want to eat by 8:00.

201
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,600
Lorelei has made some inroads
with the maitre d'.

202
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,770
Well, we have to check in,
and we have an early meeting.

203
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,480
-Where are you staying?
-The Belvedere.

204
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,270
Well, this is too much. Us, too.

205
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,020
7:30. lt'll be a hoot and a half.

206
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,360
Now you have to take
someone else's luggage. Bill Hoffman's.

207
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,630
Hofstadt. My brother-in-law.

208
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,710
He borrowed a suitcase
to go to Puerto Rico,

209
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,790
but he never tires of putting his name
on other people's things.

210
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,800
l've flown a few times, but l've never
actually seen a stewardess that game.

211
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,760
Really?

212
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,060
This is your captain...

213
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,890
Hello, Kenny. Any plans tonight?

214
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,730
All l know is to avoid Grand Central.
l heard Burt Peterson's still at the bar.

215
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,830
Oh, no. lt had to happen, l guess.

216
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,920
He didn't put up much of a fight.
Not counting today, l mean.

217
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,240
-lt's a tough job.
-No doubt about that.

218
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,970
l just want to let you know,
l've always been a big fan of your work,

219
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,850
and l've been very vocal about it.

220
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,030
l appreciate that.

221
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,480
Maybe now things will finally settle down.

222
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,190
That's true.

223
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,870
Listen, l just want to say
that through all of this,

224
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,750
l know that you were there reminding me
that l can do this job.

225
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,720
Well, you're welcome.
l guess it's because l think you can.

226
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,090
-Have a good night.
-You, too.

227
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,140
And my friend and l were listening
to some radio program,

228
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,070
and we had this huge bag of Fritos...

229
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,990
We're not allowed in uniform...

230
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,080
So, at some point my friend stops eating,
but l can't.

231
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,450
And l ate all of them and l got so...
lt was quite unladylike.

232
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,090
-And l still can't eat them to today.
-Too much of a good thing. lt happens.

233
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,890
l think accounting sounds fascinating.

234
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,680
Going through other people's
bank accounts? lt sounds sexy.

235
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,840
Jesus, Lorelei, how deep
did you have to dig to come up with that?

236
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,600
Why would you insult a man's profession?

237
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,390
No, it's okay. l don't usually tell people
l'm an accountant.

238
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,280
Listen, Billy, Sam,
l didn't mean to insult your profession.

239
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,490
Don't sweat it.

240
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,490
Of course, you do know
there are different kinds of accountants.

241
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,040
Are there?

242
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,590
-Tell them what we do.
-l don't know, Bill.

243
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,520
-l'm gonna have to swear you all to secrecy.
-You can't guarantee that.

244
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,060
You're right.

245
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,770
Well, someone just brought everything
to a screeching halt.

246
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,390
We'll be good.

247
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,900
You ever heard of James Hoffa?

248
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,460
You know, l don't just throw away
newspapers every day, l also read them.

249
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,990
There is a lot of money missing.

250
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,670
And they don't really keep receipts.

251
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,330
-So you're a couple of G-men?
-No, we're accountants.

252
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,260
lsn't the service exquisite?
l'm based in New York.

253
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,820
l'd always rather be there,
but it's my job to be out of town.

254
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,620
l don't know. l keep going to a lot of places

255
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,480
and ending up somewhere
l've already been.

256
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,540
-How about a nightcap?
-Well, l don't know.

257
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,590
Your face is red.

258
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,130
Order for us.

259
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,120
Felt self-conscious there for a moment.
We're the only ones without a uniform.

260
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,370
-Good night, Bill.
-Sam.

261
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,710
Shelley, it's been swelly.

262
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,140
-Well, this is me.
-Let me see if it's different than my floor.

263
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,420
What are we doing?

264
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,140
l don't know.

265
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,110
l'm engaged.

266
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,120
On the other hand,
you might be my last chance.

267
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,220
l've been married a long time.
You get plenty of chances.

268
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,300
lt's my birthday.

269
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,020
Really? ls it?

270
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,940
lt really is.

271
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,900
Let me see your driver's license.

272
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,820
That's not gonna help.

273
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,330
Happy birthday.

274
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,790
Hello. My air conditioner does not work.
lt is stagnant in here.

275
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,260
Take your hand out. l can't breathe.

276
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,510
Stand up.

277
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,980
Lorelei thinks you look like Ty Power.
Remember him?

278
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,940
Go on.

279
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,050
And while you're distracted,
l'm gonna take off my shoes. ls that okay?

280
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,350
Your turn.

281
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,480
Not yet.

282
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,670
Do you like?

283
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,500
Everyone's always asking me
if l was a model, but l wasn't.

284
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,480
The one l have at home is different.
Hope l didn't break it.

285
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,940
No, it's fine. Just a minute.

286
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,140
Thank you.

287
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,730
Airplane.

288
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,710
Oh, God.

289
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,430
Jesus.

290
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,730
-What is that?
-Fire alarm.

291
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,810
Come on, let's go.

292
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Come on. Forget your shoes.
Let's go. Come on.

293
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,720
Come on.

294
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,660
Do you have another cigarette?

295
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,750
Everything's okay, folks.

296
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,150
-Morning.
-Morning.

297
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,580
You ever get nervous
wearing that on the subway?

298
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,660
l don't ride the subway.
l do worry about being followed, though.

299
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,210
l think Lola takes a horse and buggy.
She's never on time.

300
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,130
-l'm not at work yet.
-l don't want to sit in my office

301
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,080
and listen to someone
talk about their water retention.

302
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:10,710
-Peggy, brides are very self-conscious.
-lf she's so worried about getting married,

303
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,300
then why is she shamelessly flirting
with Moneypenny all the time?

304
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,310
-Don't call him that. He hates that.
-Are you defending him?

305
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,230
He's repellant. Reminds me of a doorman.

306
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,070
And the typing she does for him?

307
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,240
Oh, God, l'm so glad
l'm gonna be out of here soon.

308
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,900
-That's very comforting, Joan.
-There's nothing l can do.

309
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,410
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

310
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,880
Mr. Pryce just called. There's a meeting
for the heads of accounts immediately.

311
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,000
Excuse me?

312
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,640
Mr. Pryce called a big meeting
for you and Mr. Cosgrove.

313
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,960
What are you talking about?

314
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,640
Whatever the circumstances,
it's nice to see you.

315
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,550
l'm just here to show you
the continuity of our service.

316
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,930
That with or without Burt Peterson,
you are on our mind.

317
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,580
-l apologize.
-Morris, you remember Salvatore Romano.

318
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,370
l don't know how,
but l left my plane ticket at the hotel.

319
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,950
He's the guy with the marker who always
does what l say. Words, pictures.

320
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,620
-Sal, this is Howard.
-Pleasure.

321
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:31,470
-l don't remember... Do you have a family?
-Not yet. l have a wife.

322
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,520
Well, Howard is my son.
He's gonna be part of this from now on,

323
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,770
starting with taking you two gentlemen
on a tour.

324
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,820
That's it? You're not gonna say anything?

325
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,740
My father is extremely concerned
about the business right now.

326
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,530
Well, is it about our work?

327
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,940
l mean, we don't want
to take credit for everything,

328
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,900
but two of every three raincoats
sold last year

329
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,240
had "London Fog"
stitched on the inside pocket.

330
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,170
Dad is worried that everyone who's ever
going to buy a raincoat already has one.

331
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,420
Because a business has to get bigger
every year. That's capitalism.

332
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:18,050
Well, our worst fears lie in anticipation.
That's not me, that's Balzac.

333
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,850
Balzac, huh? You are not Burt Peterson.

334
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,320
l've been investigating umbrellas,
bags, hats.

335
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,610
There are companies
that all they do is make hats.

336
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,360
London Fog is a 40-year-old brand
that sounds like it's existed forever.

337
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:39,210
You've established, with our help,
that it means one thing, raincoats.

338
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,990
New products aside, there will be fat years
and there will be lean years,

339
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,120
but it is going to rain.

340
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,470
That's true.

341
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,890
Let's see if we can find you some earplugs.

342
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,400
Bacardi, Belle Jolie, Birds Eye,
Cadbury, Campbell Soup lnternational,

343
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,570
Cartwright double-sided aluminum,
Chevron oil, Dunkin' Donuts,

344
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,860
General Foods Europe, Kodak,
Lever Brothers, Martinsons, Popsicle,

345
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,360
Relaxacisor, Rio De Janeiro,
which is dormant,

346
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,240
United Fruit, Warner Brothers.

347
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,830
And now for Mr. Campbell.
Admiral Television, Alpine Real Estate,

348
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,840
Bethlehem Steel, Con Ed, Gillette, Gorton's,
Liberty Capital Savings, Lucky Strike,

349
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,460
Maytag, North American Aviation,
P&G Pampers, Playtex, Samsonite,

350
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,170
Secor Laxatives, Snyder's Ketchup, Utz.

351
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,090
-Why does he have Utz?
-Some of this was done based on accounts,

352
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,430
and some of this was done
based on relationships,

353
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,400
and you figure out what happened with Utz.

354
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,780
So you decided all of this?

355
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,740
Forty-two cents of every dollar
at this agency

356
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,280
is spent in the television department,
but no, we did.

357
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,110
-What are these "O's" for?
-Olson.

358
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,780
-She's all over the place.
-You know that's not true.

359
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,410
You're each taking half the company.

360
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,790
Of course it's possible
someone could distinguish themselves.

361
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Would be easier that way.

362
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,800
-Can you believe this?
-lf you're upset, you seem to be hiding it.

363
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,440
l'm excited.
l mean, l feel badly about Burt Peterson.

364
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,570
Three kids, wife with cancer.

365
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,990
But you greased up the chute
and shoved him down it.

366
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,610
What could possibly be the matter?

367
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,250
Why did you even accept this?
You have no interest in this.

368
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,630
-Why wouldn't l want this?
-Because you're no good.

369
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,660
They want us to hate each other.
l refuse to participate in that.

370
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,870
Very nice. Very, very nice.

371
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,680
Look at you. Never break a sweat.

372
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,550
You're right, l should just lay down and we
should run together, holding hands.

373
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,200
-What time is it?
-1 :1 5.

374
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,240
-We should be back in the office by 3:00.
-We're going back to the office?

375
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,460
l'm going to ask you something,

376
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,640
and l want you
to be completely honest with me.

377
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,560
London Fog.

378
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,900
lt's a subway car,
and there's a commuter looking up.

379
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,690
There's a girl with her back to us.
She's wearing one of those short tan ones,

380
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,240
but it's open. Her legs are bare.

381
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
We know what he's seeing.

382
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,120
"Limit your exposure."

383
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,930
That's it.

384
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,930
Good.

385
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,700
Mr. Hooker, may l speak with you?

386
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,490
l thought it was a good idea that PPL
had an office for when visitors come.

387
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,030
Of course,
it would make sense for someone

388
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,620
to be occupying it in the meantime.

389
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,210
l rustled up an office for you.

390
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,090
l hope you find it appropriate
to your status.

391
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,590
My position.

392
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,890
lt's near Mr. Pryce.
lt's not exactly in the thick of things,

393
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,800
but you will have someone
to attend to your typing,

394
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,400
to avoid you siphoning off the man-hours.

395
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,520
-My own girl? Of my choosing?
-l will have a lineup.

396
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,390
Did he take the ant farm?

397
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,810
No, it's actually Mr. Cooper's.
lt just lives there.

398
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,070
Hello, sweetheart. Now, don't be cross.
l'll only be a minute.

399
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,510
-Do you have a fever?
-No.

400
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,510
"The buck stops here,"
unless it stops over there.

401
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,590
What's the matter?

402
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,850
There's two heads of accounts.
Kenny Cosgrove and l are sharing it.

403
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,910
-l'm so sorry.
-l was sitting there and they just read off

404
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,160
a list of names, a list of companies.
That's my life.

405
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,800
l know you won't like hearing this,
but you're a lot like my father.

406
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,370
You're an ambitious man,

407
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,630
and an ambitious man is never happy
with what he has.

408
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,270
Why does it always have to be like this?
Why can't l get anything good all at once?

409
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:37,480
This is an amazing opportunity.
They believe in you. Don't turn it sour.

410
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,520
lt's a test. Why not just cut it short
and tell them l want it?

411
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,560
You can do whatever you want,
but they do not want to hear your outrage.

412
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,360
-They want you to beat Ken.
-l know what they want, Trudy.

413
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,440
And honestly, l don't know.
l can't live with this!

414
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,250
But you'll try.

415
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:13,770
lt's great. lt's a great ad.
So, how was everything in Baltimore?

416
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,430
Out of town. Don Draper.

417
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,940
-lt was first class.
-Go on.

418
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,010
Two old married men.

419
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,520
There was a fire in the hotel,
but no casualties.

420
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,030
That's too bad.

421
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,700
For casting this lucky fellow in the subway,
what's he look like?

422
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,950
l don't know. A little excited.
A little shocked.

423
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,820
-No, what's he look like?
-Handsome.

424
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:48,370
Your girl's gone.
l have Stolichnaya and Cuban cigars.

425
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,420
l sent them from Greece.
l should've tried a pound of opium.

426
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,810
Help yourself.
So, Cosgrove versus Campbell.

427
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,860
ls Cooper playing God or Darwin?

428
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,990
l know it sounds Japanese,
but it's not Cooper.

429
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,410
Lane read about it
in some management book?

430
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,120
l think it came from the home office.

431
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,330
When he told me about it,
l thought he was joking.

432
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,920
l told him it was a stupid idea,
but they don't always get our inflection.

433
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,380
-Can l speak with you for a moment?
-Come in.

434
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,460
What?

435
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
l...

436
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:44,390
l just wanted to let you both know
how honored l am with this promotion.

437
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,030
Help yourself. Not the Stoli.

438
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,820
Hello. Mr. Campbell, l was going to tell Don,

439
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,290
but l can tell you myself.

440
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:07,090
l have an old pal at the mayor's office
that wants to do a small campaign for...

441
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,540
l don't know,
something about Penn Station.

442
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,050
lt'd be my pleasure. Bert?

443
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,470
ls there any brandy?

444
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,720
Any glass will do.

445
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,730
l told him that despite life
under British rule,

446
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,350
we still had a real Yankee.

447
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,660
l don't care what they say.
London Fog is a great name.

448
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,250
l like the ants.
There's no shortage of distractions here.

449
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,590
Now, if we can find a proper pub,
we'll have everything.

450
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,260
Why do you have this office?

451
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,770
l thought it was necessary that we have
a place for when superiors visit.

452
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,520
Of course, it would make sense
for someone to occupy it in the meantime.

453
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,650
lt's a harebrained idea.

454
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,940
We just fired one third of their workforce.

455
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,240
lt's unseemly
to go through their pockets as well.

456
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,620
A visitor's office is good,
but you sit out front.

457
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,370
Of course. lt was presumptuous.

458
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,310
-This place is a gynocracy.
-Hadn't noticed.

459
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,720
My only point is,
if you decide to take the train tomorrow

460
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,060
and you run into Carlton,
l told them we were busy.

461
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,190
Our stories are straight.

462
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,740
Sally has something to tell you. Sally!

463
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,830
l got it out of her. Out.

464
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,330
Go ahead.

465
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,720
l'm sorry l broke your suitcase.

466
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,850
Find out how much it is to repair,
and it'll come out of your allowance.

467
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,310
-l don't have an allowance.
-Then don't break things.

468
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,550
l just thought... l just didn't want you to go.

469
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,490
Come here.

470
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,330
l will always come home,
and you'll always be my girl.

471
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:04,710
-Your eyes look tired.
-l don't sleep well when l'm not here.

472
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:09,770
You squint too much.
You need reading glasses.

473
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,890
Daddy, Daddy! Are these for me?

474
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,480
-Yes.
-Give me that. lt's a stickpin.

475
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,910
There you go.

476
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,590
-Was l really in there?
-Nine months.

477
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,910
Tell me about the day l was born.

478
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:51,340
Well, it was the middle of the night,

479
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,400
and it was raining very hard.

480
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,940
And l had just come home from work.

481
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,210
He did not feel like getting back in the car,
but he did.

482
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,840
He took my suitcase
and my little stuffed Eeyore

483
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,470
that l knew l was going to give you.
