1
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,900
And after that,
l played the nurse in Romeo and Jiliet.

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,400
And after that l played Dorine the maid
in Tartuffe by Molière.

3
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,120
And l guess that's it.

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Thank you, Hillary.

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,740
l'd love it if you could do the twist
one more time.

6
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,800
Thank you, Hillary. We'll let you know.

7
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,930
Harry, you are not in this process.
You're a spectator. Don't forget it.

8
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,090
Bacardi's coming in on Tuesday
to see if Daiquiri Beach has legs.

9
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,800
Don wants copy Monday morning
and art Monday night.

10
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,310
-We should probably have the whole team.
-This weekend? No.

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,360
l'm sorry, but we just heard about it.

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,060
-Bullshit.
-l have plans. l really do.

13
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,860
Well, l would love to work all weekend,
but l'm just a spectator.

14
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,120
Whose crack did it fall through?

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,610
Because you are going
to spend the weekend being our slave.

16
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,370
-No finger-pointing.
-The bad news is

17
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,050
they need five more vacation situations
for Bacardi rum.

18
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,550
The good news is
we're going to be out of your hair.

19
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,970
Jane and Roger Sterling's
garden party on the island.

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,040
-Derby day.
-You're going back in time?

21
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,590
Are any of you wearing seersucker?

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,310
l don't want to look like
a barbershop quartet.

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,600
-You're all going?
-l really wish l wasn't.

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,430
Well, then don't. Give me your glasses.
l'll go as you.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,150
Sorry about that.

26
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,740
-Good luck, gentles.
-Sorry.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,570
You know, we all started at the same time.

28
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,940
-l've been here six years longer than you.
-They hate creative.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,370
My goodness.
l didn't expect to see you here.

30
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,420
-For a little while longer.
-Lovely to see you, Jane,

31
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,310
l mean Mrs. Sterling.

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,890
l'll catch up with you, girls.

33
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,230
l just stopped by.
Roger had my rings resized.

34
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,440
l keep losing weight.
Where are you living now?

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,270
Same old place, but we're looking.
We're thinking about Riverdale.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,730
lt's near Columbia Pres
and Greg wants a yard.

37
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,450
l don't know. l get a nosebleed
anywhere above 86th Street.

38
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,710
-God, it's so great to see you.
-Likewise.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,800
Joan, l have a tiny favor to ask you.

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,550
They're doing construction
in front of the building

41
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,760
and my driver's gonna be circling,

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,350
so if you could have one of the girls
run down at 1 :1 5 and flag him down.

43
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,510
Hello, Ginger.

44
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,530
Olive, from now on, there's no need
to include Mr. Crane in casting.

45
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,440
Of course.
And l brought you tea and coffee.

46
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,530
l'll just have whichever one you don't want.

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,830
l... Coffee. That's what l usually drink.
That's what l've been drinking, right?

48
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,990
Well, Lola said
you don't like a second cup of coffee

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,990
because it makes you edgy.

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,080
l want you to forget everything
Lola told you.

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,890
l left for an hour
to go get the nylons for tomorrow,

52
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,630
and look what happened.

53
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Carla said he thought he was on KP duty.

54
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,570
-We don't have to go, you know.
-l said we would.

55
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,480
lt's Roger and Jane.

56
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,270
l want to go. l bought a dress.

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,130
"The warmth of the climate
disposed the natives

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,490
"to the most intemperate enjoyment
of tranquility and opulence,

59
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,170
"and the lively..."

60
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,800
Licentiousness.

61
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,380
Go ahead.

62
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,230
"...of the Greeks was blended
with the hereditary softness of the Syrians.

63
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,270
"Fashion was the only law,
pleasure was the only pursuit

64
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,410
"and the splendor of dress and furniture

65
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,830
"was the only distinction
of the citizens ofAntioch."

66
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,190
-Gene.
-Hello, Don.

67
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,160
-How's Babylon?
-Bedtime.

68
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,880
lt's all right. Go wash your teeth.

69
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,830
You just wait. All hell's gonna break loose.

70
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,670
Good night, Grandpa Gene.

71
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,620
-Like that.
-Paul Kinsey with a two-stroke lead.

72
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,980
-What is your secret?
-l use Harry Crane's paddle

73
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,280
and l pretend that's his fat head.

74
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,320
What kind of fruit do you put in this?

75
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,540
-lt's rum and Coke. l don't know.
-A cherry? All we have is olives.

76
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,220
New drinks, new copy or both?

77
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,040
Bikinis that match the drinks and new copy.
Something cute.

78
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,460
"lt's Bacardi-licious."

79
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,470
"lt's Bacardi-lightful."

80
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,360
We're supposed to sit here
and pretend like we're on vacation?

81
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,730
-They're probably drinking mint juleps.
-Booze puts me to sleep.

82
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,320
l will take grass any hour of the day.
lt helps me think.

83
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,320
When l was at Princeton,
l wrote my senior thesis

84
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,080
on the passions of the Stoics.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,540
Mary Jane was my muse.

86
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,330
Paul helps me sleep.

87
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,000
Peggy, go get a blender.
Maybe we can turn this into a frappé.

88
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
-You get it.
-l'm eating.

89
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,060
Olive?

90
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,400
-What are you doing here?
-Well, if you're working, l'm working.

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,730
-lt's okay for you to go home.
-l already canceled my plans.

92
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,740
Phil and l were going to
drive up to The Cloisters.

93
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,200
And Steven, my son,
he's at Boston College.

94
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,000
He was thinking of coming down
with his girlfriend,

95
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,800
but l'm not sure that's working out.
He's picky.

96
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,760
Anyway, so Phil's taking a trip to the dump,
and here l am, no worse for wear.

97
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,220
Don't l seem as important as Cosgrove?

98
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,690
l mean, Campbell makes sense,
to the manner born.

99
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,140
-So you like to get high?
-Whenever l can.

100
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,950
My cousin used to know someone,
but he got married.

101
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,700
Who's your friend?

102
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,240
A guy like you?
There must be somebody you can call.

103
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,160
Yeah. No. Of course.

104
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,410
Sally, get up here.

105
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,130
l just walked backwards
all the way from the living room.

106
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,390
Zip.

107
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,050
You look pretty.

108
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,550
l look like an open umbrella.

109
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,270
Grandpa says you're going to a soirée.

110
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,980
Don't bother him.

111
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,940
Go watch TV.

112
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,870
-Grandpa?
-l'm indisposed.

113
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,310
What are you doing?
You're going to break it.

114
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,020
-Who told you that?
-l've done it.

115
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,360
lf it happens, l'll go get my little
screwdriver and put on a new one.

116
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Jesus, l stink.

117
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,830
l can finish up out here.
You take a nice, long bath.

118
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,550
No. No, no, no.
Ettinger goes at the head of the table.

119
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,170
He's the chief of surgery.
lt's where he always sits.

120
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,470
Not in your home, Greg.
Host at the head, hostess at the foot

121
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,090
or whichever is nearest to the kitchen,

122
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,340
-and then it's boy, girl, boy, girl.
-Who says?

123
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,470
Emily Post. Everyone.

124
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,890
Ronald Ettinger does not read Emily Post.
He's going to expect to sit there,

125
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,200
and he's going to expect me
and Rick Stolich to be his footstools.

126
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,480
Well, l won't have their wives think

127
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,110
you have a wife who doesn't know
how to set a table.

128
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,020
Joanie, l don't want
to have a fight right now.

129
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,780
Then stop talking.

130
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,200
A buffet would be slightly more casual
and people could sit where they will.

131
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,750
And we could put the chafing dish
that they gave us right in the middle.

132
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,590
Perfect.

133
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,380
Hey.

134
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,450
...urged by Republicans
to appoint a special prosecutor

135
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,700
to investigate the scandal-ridden
State Liquor Authority.

136
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,940
The governor has expressed confidence...

137
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,990
Carla.

138
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,330
Carla?

139
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,750
ls she here?

140
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,340
Look at you.

141
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,800
l know l look good for my condition,
but l'm still in my condition.

142
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,840
-Did they leave yet?
-No, l think they're in the living room.

143
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,630
Well, l've been robbed.

144
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,930
l had it right here and now l don't.

145
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,710
Daddy, what are you talking about?

146
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
l had $35. Now l have $30.

147
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,110
-Are you sure?
-Mr. Hofstadt,

148
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,010
why don't you go sit down
and we'll all look for it?

149
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
You'll look for it, will you?

150
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,070
Daddy, you know how forgetful you are.

151
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,440
l'm missing $5.

152
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,700
l'll give you $5.

153
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,360
Don, will you give him something?

154
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,290
-Here, Gene. Here you go.
-No, l don't want your money.

155
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,540
You people, you think money
is the answer to every problem.

156
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,250
No, just this particular problem.

157
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,180
Daddy, l'm sorry.
l don't know what you want.

158
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,720
l want my $5!

159
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,850
Well, l think l am finally ready to go.

160
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,900
Come on, let's go out in the yard.

161
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,030
l forgot how many tourists there are
in midtown.

162
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,780
They're like vermin.

163
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,910
Jeffrey, this is my colleague Smitty.

164
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,240
-How you doing, Jeff?
-Not bad. Not bad at all.

165
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,910
-So what do you have for us?
-What do you want?

166
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,220
l've got Dexies, Benzedrine strips, boo.

167
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,550
Probably get you junk
if you really wanted it.

168
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,850
-How do you know each other?
-Jeffrey's an old friend.

169
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,480
You're looking at the two great cocksmen
of Princeton '55.

170
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,970
The times you must have had.
Can we buy some dope?

171
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,680
l'll give you all four for $1 0, plus delivery.

172
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,120
l'm just kidding, but l should.
l mean, you never call me.

173
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,110
When's the last time l saw you?

174
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,540
-Give me your sweater.
-lt's mohair.

175
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,060
-May l?
-Relax. Sit down.

176
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,970
You ever look out this window?

177
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,090
lt's beautiful.

178
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,590
Nice to see you both. lsn't this something?

179
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,300
Betty, you remember Trudy.

180
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,510
Harry Crane. My wife, Jennifer.

181
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,270
Ken Cosgrove. We've met.

182
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,730
-Nice to see you all again.
-When are you due?

183
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,070
Any minute. Can't you tell?

184
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,140
That last month was the worst,

185
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,060
-but of course this is your second.
-Third.

186
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,270
-How old is yours?
-Eight months. Beatrice Grace.

187
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,280
Should we take a tour?

188
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,710
-l grew up in a club just like this.
-Me, too.

189
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,290
That portly fellow in the glen plaid,
second at DuPont.

190
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,550
The one next to him, Pan Am.

191
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,400
Don't hand out your card.

192
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,620
-Now you're getting ridiculous.
-Maybe it fell out of your pocket.

193
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,790
-lt didn't.
-Well, l didn't take it.

194
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,540
-l didn't say you did.
-Not yet.

195
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,170
Will you stop it, Viola?

196
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,760
My name's not Viola. lt's Carla.

197
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,410
Do you know Viola?

198
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,390
We don't all know each other, Mr. Hofstadt.

199
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,880
Done looking already?

200
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,770
Really?

201
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,880
-Are they still here?
-Yes, they're in Mr. Kinsey's office.

202
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,230
l know what they're doing.
You don't want to go in there.

203
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,140
-What are they doing?
-All l'm saying is,

204
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,010
they obviously don't want to work,
so you should just go home.

205
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,490
l love the commercials where the dog runs
right up to the bowl of food.

206
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,190
How do you make him do that?

207
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,700
-You starve him?
-So you two got a lot of girls?

208
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,910
Shit.

209
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,010
ls that that old lady again?

210
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,670
-Let me in.
-Go away.

211
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,510
lt stinks out here.

212
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,680
Come in quick.

213
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,720
What are you doing?

214
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,860
l know what you're doing. Who are you?

215
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,140
Jeffrey Graves, Princeton, '55.

216
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,600
Look, l need it for inspiration.

217
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,620
lt's Saturday, for God's sake.

218
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,770
You can go home. We'll do the work.

219
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,690
Are you kidding?
We'll end up with nothing.

220
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,280
l've got some ideas we can kick around,

221
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,830
but you're gonna have to tell me your name,
sweetheart.

222
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,970
l'm Peggy Olson,
and l want to smoke some marijuana.

223
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,300
You won't like it.

224
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,380
How do you know what l'll like?

225
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,810
You never ask me how l feel about anything

226
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,720
except brassieres and body odor
and makeup.

227
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,820
l'd like to know how you feel
about a lot of things.

228
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,400
-Jesus. Give it a rest.
-Come on.

229
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,910
Just like a strong cigarette.

230
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,200
Can you believe this?

231
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,400
The sun shines bright

232
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,520
On the old Kentucky home

233
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,060
'Tis summer

234
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,900
And the darkies are gay

235
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,910
The corn top's ripe

236
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,580
And the meadow's in the bloom

237
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,670
While the birds make music all the day

238
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,840
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor

239
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,540
All merry, all happy...

240
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,420
Can we go?

241
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,100
What about the horse race?
What about supper?

242
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,520
Don't disappear. l want to dance.

243
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,720
And my old Kentucky home

244
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,640
Good night

245
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,030
l did this at home for her
with a little shoe polish.

246
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,490
She thought it was a scream.

247
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,820
l love it.

248
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,580
Weep no more

249
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,290
my lady

250
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,830
Oh, weep no more today

251
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,090
Can l get an old-fashioned?

252
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,970
We're on the same mission.

253
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,390
This bar looks like it was set up
by a blind man,

254
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,340
and there's no bourbon.

255
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,270
There's a hole at the end here.

256
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
l don't have a lot of time.

257
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,790
-Rye okay with you?
-You look like you know what you're doing.

258
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,210
l'm Connie, by the way.

259
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,540
Don.

260
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,120
Service always this good around here?

261
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,640
-You're not a member either?
-No, no.

262
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,250
Nice piece of property, though.

263
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,220
Who are you hiding from?

264
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,060
l am at work disguised as a party.

265
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,320
l'm at work disguised as a wedding.

266
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,700
l hate other people's weddings.

267
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
-Why's that?
-Make me nervous,

268
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,860
all those expectations.

269
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,040
And these poor kids in here,

270
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,540
that is a match made in the boardroom.

271
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
When l was a boy,

272
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,010
there was a mansion on the river
l used to paddle by in my johnboat.

273
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,010
Twinkling lights, violins,
girls giggling about something.

274
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,530
lt's different inside.

275
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,080
-Where you from?
-San Antonio, New Mexico,

276
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,380
before it was a state. Don't ask me that. Old.

277
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,160
You look fit.

278
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,620
You ever see

279
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,040
A MidsimmerDream with Mickey Rooney?

280
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,080
A Midsummer Night's Dream?

281
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,130
By golly, you're prickly.

282
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,440
l'm Republican, like everyone else in there,

283
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,890
but somehow,
no matter how expensive my cufflinks,

284
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,030
l feel like l've got the head of a jackass.

285
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,070
Where l grew up, there was a roadhouse.

286
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,240
lt boasted live music.
That meant a drum, a bass

287
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,830
and a player piano with nobody at it.

288
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,950
l parked cars.

289
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,740
Fancy people would go there.

290
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,830
They'd get loud, they'd get drunk,
but they wouldn't let me use the toilet.

291
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,670
So when nature called,
l'd open up a trunk and relieve myself.

292
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,800
-You didn't.
-l was 1 5.

293
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,390
There's probably some kid out there
doing it to us right now.

294
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
Where you come from?

295
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,480
Pennsylvania by way of lllinois.

296
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,080
We lost our farm, ended up in coal country.

297
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,690
And here you are.

298
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,490
A pleasure to meet you, Don.

299
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,920
Hell of a cocktail.

300
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,940
Rum. Have some.

301
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,240
Some rum?

302
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,530
lf you were feeling it, you'd be hungry.

303
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,730
l am hungry, but it's not worth moving.

304
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,960
She is a riot. Makes me wish l had a job.

305
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,920
Bacardi Eisenhower.

306
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,010
What are you laughing about?

307
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,630
You do have a job, Jeffrey.
You're a drug pusher.

308
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,270
What is that, an English accent?

309
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,720
lt's a little different than freshman year.

310
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,770
Kinsey was a real Jersey.

311
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,980
l guess that's why they have scholarships.

312
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,820
Get out.

313
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,790
You're arrogant. And you know what else?
You can't sing.

314
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,580
Take it back.

315
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,890
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here not to fight.

316
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,750
Take it back, Graves.

317
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,680
Fine. l guess they kicked you out
of the Tigertones because you were too tall.

318
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,020
Graves...

319
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,760
We're done here.

320
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,640
And by the way,
l left the 'Tones because l had mono.

321
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,870
Fine. Why don't you sing a little
and let them be the judge?

322
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,010
l am so high.

323
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,970
l wish you were waiting for me.

324
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,440
So who are you waiting for?

325
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,930
A friend.

326
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,700
What is that like?

327
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,240
l don't know.

328
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,540
l don't think about it.

329
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,530
Right now, it's uncomfortable, mostly.

330
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,490
But it moves around in there.

331
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,090
lt does.

332
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,880
l'm going to blame this on martinis, but...
May l?

333
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,610
She's not moving now.

334
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,870
Who are you waiting for?

335
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,210
My date.

336
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,370
You can't show up to these things stag,

337
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,580
but then you run into people.

338
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,730
l apologize. There was a line for the mirror
and l feel like l'm melting.

339
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,970
No trouble at all.

340
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,200
l hope they start playing some real music.
l'm in the mood to dance, aren't you?

341
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,070
Martinis.

342
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,040
Please, don't stand on ceremony. Dig in.

343
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,660
l'll cut the cheese.

344
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,170
What are you laughing about?

345
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,080
Everything is some private joke with them.

346
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,250
What were you giggling
about the other day?

347
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,130
-A code pink.
-What's that?

348
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,980
They put a call over the PA

349
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,010
whenever there's an
attractive unconscious female.

350
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,350
l've never heard of that.

351
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,610
-Me either.
-Sounds like where l work.

352
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,700
-l'm gonna check the roast.
-You need a hand?

353
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,030
-l don't think so.
-Nonsense.

354
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,740
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

355
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,870
Thanks.

356
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,540
You really have a lovely place.

357
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,700
l'm glad you like it. l did most of it myself.

358
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,880
You must do well.

359
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,000
lt's not easy. Not that l'm complaining.

360
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,800
You think they make no money now?

361
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,880
You should've seen back when
Ronald and l were first married.

362
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,550
l taught kindergarten
and made three times what Ron did.

363
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,810
We lived in a pit.

364
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,640
But one day
you'll look back on this time and smile.

365
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,280
Just don't get pregnant.

366
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,890
Excuse me?

367
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,660
The last thing you want right now is a child.

368
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,700
l told her the same thing,
but she doesn't listen. She's a nurse.

369
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,750
You do what you want.

370
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,240
lf Greg becomes chief resident,
then things will get easier.

371
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,450
The fact that Greg can
get a woman like you

372
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,260
makes me feel good about his future,
no matter what happens.

373
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,590
Bobby, Sally, suppertime!

374
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,930
You have to eat something.

375
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,860
You don't tell me what to do.

376
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,950
You either eat or you don't eat,
but there'll be no more of that.

377
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,990
l told you l'm not hungry.

378
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,820
-l want my money.
-You don't even know that you lost it.

379
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,280
Maybe you should lie down. Sally!

380
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,820
Grandpa, is this it?

381
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,440
Grandpa, is this your money?

382
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,450
l don't know. Let me see it.

383
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,410
Yeah, that's it, all right.

384
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,380
Well, that's a relief.
Sally, your food's getting cold.

385
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,890
Excuse me.

386
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,020
Why, thank you.

387
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,940
He's pretending like
we didn't have a fight on the way over.

388
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,830
He seems amenable right now.

389
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,160
l warned him that with this set

390
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,610
there was a good chance
one of my old beaus might appear.

391
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,530
-And yet they didn't.
-Which is a relief.

392
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,960
l don't want to. All l have to talk about
is work, which is verboten.

393
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,620
Well, that's nonsense.
You're very charming.

394
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,830
Come on. l'll talk.

395
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,750
They want to know
we're having a good time.

396
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,930
Well, we're really having a good time.

397
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,690
Haven't seen you two on the dance floor.

398
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,780
l don't move that well right now.

399
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,330
Don loves to dance,

400
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,250
but l think l'm disappointing him
because l don't feel like it.

401
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,540
Your asses are going to
wear out those chairs.

402
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,790
Roger.

403
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,750
Don, Betty, this is Henry Francis and...

404
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,930
Sherry Ardmore.

405
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,510
Henry works in the governor's office.

406
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,960
Don Draper. This is my wife, Betty.

407
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,190
Hank, tell them where
you were this afternoon.

408
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,230
-Roger...
-They're gonna read about it in the paper.

409
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,690
He just came from Pocantico.
Rockefeller married Happy.

410
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:47,230
She just got divorced a month ago.
She has four children.

411
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,410
You see? That's the first reaction.

412
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,190
Divorce is political hari-kari.

413
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,070
Now we'll be stuck with Goldwater.

414
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,540
The primaries are still a long way off.

415
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,000
-Why did Rocky marry her?
-They're in love.

416
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,000
We're going to dance.

417
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,090
Betty, Don,
are you sure you're not up for it?

418
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,330
l have got to bring a date next time.

419
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,440
"This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends

420
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,660
"This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper"

421
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,160
We got it. You're educated
and you sang in the Tiger...

422
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,790
-What are they called?
-Tigertones.

423
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,250
l went to the University of Michigan.

424
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,040
l went to Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.

425
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,310
Can you believe her?

426
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,560
l keep thinking about rum,
and l keep thinking about Cuba,

427
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,480
and l keep thinking about
how we're all going to die.

428
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,480
-We almost died.
-But we didn't.

429
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,360
How about something about life?

430
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,780
Let's go on the roof.

431
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,330
And do what?

432
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,250
Think about Daiquiri Beach.
We need five more situations for rum.

433
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,590
On the roof is a good idea, actually.
A hammock right between the clotheslines.

434
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,800
And you still say Daiquiri Beach.

435
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,930
Are you working?

436
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,960
l think so.

437
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,310
You both can leave.

438
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,740
l'm in a very good place right now.

439
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,220
You left your purse in your office,
unattended.

440
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,010
-Someone could have stolen it.
-No one's here.

441
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,220
You think l don't know
what you've been doing in there?

442
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,650
-l don't know what to say.
-l've got nothing to hide.

443
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,360
Well, you're free to do whatever you want,
but you're not thinking about your future.

444
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,700
The thing is,

445
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,240
l have a job.

446
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,780
l have my own office
with my name on the door,

447
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,740
and l have a secretary. That's you.

448
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,830
And l am not scared of any of this.

449
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,430
But you're scared.

450
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,800
Oh, my God. You're scared.

451
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,980
Don't worry about me.

452
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,940
l am going to get to do everything
you want for me.

453
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,190
l'm going to be fine, Olive.

454
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,830
l really am.

455
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:02,010
Your expense report is ready
for your review. lt's on your desk.

456
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,720
l need you to get the Dictaphone set up,

457
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,940
and l need a glass of water,
and then you can go.

458
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,990
That's very pretty.

459
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,160
Thank you.

460
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,880
-When are you due?
-Early September.

461
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,800
You and the First Lady.

462
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,260
Well, l think she looks a lot better.

463
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,590
You could dress like that.

464
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,750
Go to Lord & Taylor
and ask for my friend Bunny Appelle.

465
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,680
-She'll take care of you.
-You really know everything, Joan.

466
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,890
Honey, would you talk to your husband?

467
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,350
l don't know what l'm going to do next year.

468
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,520
He is going to be a tough act to follow.

469
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,730
Those people in Texas
will be crawling all over you.

470
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,910
lf l ever need a pneumonectomy,
that's the man.

471
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,700
You heard me say it. Great hands.

472
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,950
Look, Greg, it's a complicated operation.

473
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Christ, that's not what l meant.

474
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,330
-lt happens.
-What happened?

475
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,010
l don't like to worry Joanie
about those kinds of things.

476
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,890
Come on. Everyone gets
a bad result every once in a while.

477
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:34,340
You know what? Enough shop talk.
This is not civilian conversation.

478
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,610
Do you want to play charades?

479
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,360
-Come on. You're terrible.
-No, l'm not.

480
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,600
Well, Joanie has many, many talents.
You should play for them.

481
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,020
-No.
-Come on. l'll go get it.

482
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,160
-You're all gonna love this.
-What do you play?

483
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,120
l am out of practice.

484
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,370
-Come on, Joanie.
-Wonderful!

485
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,010
Come on, just sing a little something.

486
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,430
lt'll be just like the olden days.

487
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,510
We used to sit in the parlor after supper.

488
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,550
My mother would play the piano
while we read.

489
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,740
Just let me have another bite
and then we can go.

490
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,640
l guess we're the last ones to eat.
That's what my mother always said.

491
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,640
Family holds back.

492
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,100
You shouldn't be filling your plate.
You're the hostess.

493
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,940
-l'll get you some food.
-Come on. Come on.

494
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,100
-You should sit down.
-Okay.

495
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,980
Oh, my God! You're pregnant.

496
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,110
-You're so beautiful.
-Thank you.

497
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,370
Don't you just love looking at her?

498
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,370
Aren't they a beautiful couple?

499
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,670
l knew you two would get back together.

500
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,130
l never had any doubt,
no matter what the problem was.

501
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,970
l'll take care of her.

502
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,840
You don't like me.

503
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,190
l'm a nice person.

504
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,640
What's going on here?

505
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,270
l should've eaten something.

506
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,490
Will someone please get her
a glass of milk?

507
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,250
Don, can l talk to you for a second?

508
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,460
What the hell was that?

509
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,210
Your wife's drunk.

510
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:00,770
l don't know what l did
to get under your skin.

511
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,480
Roger, it's late.

512
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,360
You know, my mother was right.

513
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,780
lt's a mistake to be conspicuously happy.
Some people don't like it.

514
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,070
No one thinks you're happy.
They think you're foolish.

515
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,610
You know, that's the great thing
about a place like this,

516
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,300
you can come here and be happy,
and you get to choose your guests.

517
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,520
Good night, Grandpa.

518
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,200
Get in here.

519
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,000
Sit down.

520
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,640
Where were we?

521
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:46,660
"The rustic manners of a prince
who disdained such glory

522
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,620
"and was insensible of such happiness

523
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,300
"soon disgusted the delicacy
of his subjects,

524
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,640
"and the effeminate Orientals
could neither imitate nor admire

525
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,720
"the severe simplicity
which Julian always maintained

526
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
"and sometimes affected."
