1
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,299
Daddy, don't.

2
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,848
It's 10:30. Why aren't you asleep?

3
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,642
- I'm afraid.
- Sally.

4
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,770
I know. You're not Thomas Edison.

5
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,023
What are you afraid of?

6
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:10,153
I'm afraid of what's going to happen
when you turn off the lights.

7
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,742
I'm home now.

8
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,620
Nothing can hurt you.

9
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,208
Except maybe this mess.

10
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,920
Pick up your room,
we'll get you a nightlight.

11
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,130
Okay.

12
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,259
Go to sleep.

13
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,984
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

14
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,195
I bet they're gonna make us work
over the holiday.

15
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:57,283
- And Cosgrove's late.
- Can we have everyone's attention, please?

16
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,121
This will only take a moment,
and it will not be repeated.

17
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,332
That's not true, Mr. Hooker.

18
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,002
We've just been informed
that there will be a visit

19
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,340
from the director and chairman of the board
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

20
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,302
the purpose of which is both friendly

21
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,388
and, of course,
to evaluate our performance.

22
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,559
- Mr. Hooker.
- The visit will commence tomorrow,

23
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,897
that is Tuesday, at 10:00
and will continue into the next day.

24
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:32,276
We apologize. We realize we were
to be closed Wednesday, July 3rd, but...

25
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,611
Come on.

26
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,908
They were unaware of the holiday.

27
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:44,163
Now we merely need
that everyone continue to operate

28
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,500
at the height of their productivity
and to make sure

29
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,754
that their desks and offices
are shipshape and Bristol fashion.

30
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,424
And by no means
should these preparations

31
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,845
interfere with our work today.
Very good, then.

32
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,390
Don, may we have a word?

33
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,275
Well, isn't this perfect?

34
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,697
Well, we'll just move it from lunch
to the end of the day.

35
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,825
I'm having a cake delivered.
How's that going to look?

36
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,493
A cake for what?

37
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,704
Tomorrow is Joan's last day. I told you that.

38
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,415
But if we're working on Wednesday,
wouldn't that be her last day?

39
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,875
I don't know why she'd come in.

40
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,253
Greg finds out about his residency
today or tomorrow. I'm not sure.

41
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,255
I think they're going away to celebrate.

42
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,266
on the state of television,
and, of course, account updates.

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,685
- Just a few minutes each.
- On each account?

44
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,187
No, a few minutes for each of you.

45
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,066
And Mr. Kinsey,
you might want to shave your beard.

46
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,569
What? Who the hell are you people?

47
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,196
That was a joke.

48
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,620
There's no need for panic.

49
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,165
Just think of this as the same
as any major client visit.

50
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,251
They're flying across the ocean
to have their knobs polished?

51
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,337
Fourth of July. Subtle.

52
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,299
- Get the door, will you?
- The British are coming.

53
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,513
I assume you know what this is about.

54
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,310
I have a theory.
I believe they're coming to see you.

55
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,728
Why?

56
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,980
They've shown a great deal
of interest in you.

57
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,692
Ever since you swung around your privates
in the boardroom with Duck last year.

58
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,071
They study and dissect your work,
trying to decipher

59
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,990
what is your particular American genius.

60
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:51,123
- What do you think it is? The presidency?
- No, I think it'll be a creative umbrella

61
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,085
with a dual position
in London and New York.

62
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,505
- London?
- Bye-bye, Don.

63
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,301
How congenial you two are.

64
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,680
I hope you can maintain this pretense
when they arrive.

65
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,098
Excuse me?

66
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,394
Kiss and make up
before you cost us all something.

67
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,231
- You're being melodramatic.
- Miss Blankenship,

68
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:20,403
please make an appointment at Angelo's
for Misters Sterling and Draper,

69
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,656
the soonest available.

70
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,117
- I have my own barber.
- That's not necessary.

71
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,412
Enough. Everyone wants Martin and Lewis.

72
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,623
Reconcile.

73
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,796
Damn it!

74
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:54,311
It's done! John Deere is done.
The 110 lawn and garden tractor

75
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,274
with snow thrower and transparent
vinyl enclosure, and a key.

76
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,237
Look at him. He just brought in a mastodon.

77
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,241
Sorry I'm late.

78
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,952
Big accounts move slowly,
but the John Deere doesn't.

79
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,914
Listen, Mr. Clampett. You might want to get
your iron horse out of reception.

80
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,791
I will, after everybody sees it.

81
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,502
- No, P.P.L. is coming.
- When?

82
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,130
- Tomorrow morning.
- And we have to work Wednesday.

83
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,134
- We have to give presentations.
- You got that one just in time.

84
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,595
Yeah, I guess I did.

85
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,646
She's in here!

86
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,485
I'm resting,
and your little brother's sleeping.

87
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,737
All he does is sleep.

88
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,407
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.

89
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,036
- Go bang your head against a wall.
- Mom.

90
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,330
Only boring people are bored.

91
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,167
- Can I pet him?
- Don't wake him.

92
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,799
Come over here.

93
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,010
Go play.

94
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,854
You can sleep all you want,
little pig in a blanket.

95
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,651
That is quite a shave.

96
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,030
I'm thinking about my toes right now.

97
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,533
- Go to town.
- He's next.

98
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,787
- I already had one.
- See, that's not true.

99
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,623
You think
there's something feminine about it?

100
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,627
My father was the tallest, handsomest,
vainest man in New York,

101
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,754
and he got his nails done.

102
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,428
He had his fourth coronary
behind the wheel and hit a tree.

103
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,140
The windshield severed his arm,

104
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,476
and he was dead,
so they never put it back on.

105
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,272
In the casket he had one hand.
The nails were perfect.

106
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,902
- I don't believe that story.
- Okay, so he hit another car and not a tree.

107
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,451
It's my company. Why should I be nervous?

108
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,745
Because you sold it.

109
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,332
So that's it? That's what I did to you?
I got you a half-million dollars?

110
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,170
- I'm really sorry about that.
- No one said you did anything.

111
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,089
You sound like Burl Ives.

112
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,094
Part of the problem with Mona

113
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,515
is that one day
she just started judging people.

114
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,767
Never gave a crap before.

115
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,772
I'll tell you right now, Don.
I don't like being judged.

116
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,735
Listen, Roger... I'm okay, Angelo.

117
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,617
We don't need to talk about this anymore.
I promise.

118
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,039
I was holding out for gratitude,
but I'll take that.

119
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,333
Thank you.

120
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,087
Well, maybe now you'll have the money
and the glory.

121
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,258
Call the photographers,
type service and vendors

122
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,844
and tell them all deliveries should come
between 9:30 and 11:00

123
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,473
so the British can see lots of activity
when they arrive.

124
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,724
Now.

125
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,686
Are you being short with me
because you think it'll make parting easier?

126
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,813
My mother used to do that.

127
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,525
I'm noticing for the first time
that the ladies out here are rather plain,

128
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,946
- present company excluded.
- Well, we could hire some prostitutes.

129
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,157
I know your prime minister
enjoys their company.

130
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,659
The secretary of war,

131
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,577
and you'd do best
not to bring that up tomorrow.

132
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,413
- I apologize.
- Well, I apologize that tomorrow's visit

133
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,624
will steal from your spotlight.

134
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,336
Perhaps we can reschedule
your surprise party till after the holiday?

135
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,213
Why did you do that?

136
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:54,009
Do what? Mrs. Harris knows everything.
I'm sure she was expecting it.

137
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,931
I'm going to go home and make
a celebratory dinner for my husband.

138
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,724
And when you wake up
in the middle of the night

139
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,686
and wonder what you forgot, don't call me.

140
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,075
- Well, that's smooth.
- I got a shave.

141
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,537
- Why?
- They ordered me to do it.

142
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,832
We have an inspection tomorrow.
The British.

143
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,209
Well, you look very successful.

144
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,880
Hot or cold?
Swedish meatballs or chicken salad?

145
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,591
Chicken salad.

146
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,220
Did you pick up a nightlight?

147
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,683
I did, and I read her to sleep.
She was still clingy.

148
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,603
I don't remember her being that resentful
of Bobby when he was born.

149
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,691
- I don't know that she resents him.
- Well, she won't go near him.

150
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,695
She won't even go in his room
unless I make her.

151
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,407
- Why are they visiting?
- We don't know.

152
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,244
Delayed everybody's vacation plans.

153
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,081
He was perfect today.

154
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,917
- Who?
- Gene.

155
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,090
Would you ever want to live in London?

156
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,595
I'm serious.

157
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,807
Of course.
I could get a pram and a real nanny.

158
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,562
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

159
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,964
Where the hell were you?

160
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,135
I told you I was going for drinks
with the docs.

161
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,763
You didn't tell me anything.
You didn't call me.

162
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:07,810
- I called you at work.
- That's a lie. I just ate dinner for two.

163
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,648
Get over here.

164
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,489
I know you're drunk. Come sit next to me.

165
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,169
So what happened?

166
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,214
I...

167
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,302
I didn't get it.

168
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,514
What happened?

169
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
It doesn't say anything

170
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,402
except that they made Doug Hutchinson
chief resident.

171
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,572
And I felt the floor open up under me.

172
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,788
So you'll get it next year.
You knew it was possible.

173
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,669
I ran into Eddinger
about a half-hour before the letter came,

174
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:20,841
and I could tell something was wrong.
He wouldn't look me in the eye.

175
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,844
I figured he felt bad

176
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,097
and I'd at least find out
what the hell happened.

177
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,729
- But he didn't feel bad.
- What are you talking about? He loves you.

178
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:44,072
He sat me down in his office
and he poured a drink and he said...

179
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,084
He said I had no brains in my fingers.

180
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,342
But he wrote you
all those nice evaluations...

181
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,346
Damn it, Joan! Doctors don't write
bad things about each other.

182
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,354
- So you'll go to another hospital.
- Not in New York.

183
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,399
If I want to stay in surgery,
I can go to Alabama or something.

184
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,376
So what happens?
You're still a doctor, right?

185
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,752
I am.

186
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:45,259
I'm just not a surgeon,
and I will never be a surgeon.

187
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:52,474
- Did they fire you?
- I don't want to talk about it, Joanie, okay?

188
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,145
I was hoping you were asleep.

189
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:04,027
I have another year of residency.
You're not gonna be able to leave your job.

190
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,865
- Greg, that's done.
- Well, get another one.

191
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,119
Honey.

192
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,086
Listen.

193
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,172
You are still a doctor.

194
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,261
I married you for your heart,
not your hands.

195
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,017
They all went out to celebrate.

196
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,396
I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't fake it.

197
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,692
I've been sitting in the Dublin House
since 2:00.

198
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,950
Go lay down. I'll undress you.
Just let me close the light.

199
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,487
Mr. Hooker, you neglected to tell me
that our guests have arrived.

200
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,655
To what do I owe the pleasure?

201
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,158
This is Mrs. Harris.
She was the office manager before me,

202
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,993
but she is off to greener pastures.

203
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,455
- Well, that's a shame. Guy MacKendrick.
- Joan Harris.

204
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:44,086
This is Mr. Harold Ford.
And you recall Saint John Powell.

205
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,838
- We've spoken on the phone.
- I believe that's true.

206
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,092
I just wanted to tell you,
I made a reservation at La Grenouille at 6:00

207
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,512
and got you two tickets to Oliver!
It's a wonderful show.

208
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,598
I've heard that.
A tragedy with a happy ending.

209
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,308
My favorite kind.

210
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,020
Thank you, Joan.
Shall I give you the threepenny tour?

211
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,860
Please let everyone know that they're here.

212
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,197
We have you scheduled to meet
with Sterling, Cooper and Draper,

213
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,740
and then with Mr. Pryce, of course,

214
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,118
and then a light lunch
in the conference room

215
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,161
with the personnel you requested.

216
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,331
Tomorrow, the presentations
and client meetings.

217
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,712
- Saint John, good to see you again.
- Peter Campbell. This is Guy MacKendrick.

218
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,048
I know everything about you.
You're a very impressive fellow.

219
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,553
- I wish I could return the compliment.
- Well, perhaps one day you shall.

220
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,644
Good morning, gentlemen.

221
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,314
- Hello.
- Miss Olson, one of our copywriters.

222
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,609
I know everything about you.
You are a very impressive young woman.

223
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,571
Why, thank you. I was just writing copy.

224
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,949
- As you were.
- I hope we chat later.

225
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,914
Mr. Draper is waiting for you
in Mr. Cooper's office.

226
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,332
This way.

227
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,672
That is a very handsome man.

228
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,393
- Good to see all of you.
- It's a pleasure.

229
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,897
Don, no worse for wear, I see.

230
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,900
What a delightful custom.
From the Far East, I assume?

231
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,027
- Japan.
- How was your trip?

232
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:37,073
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Harold Ford,
and this young man is Guy MacKendrick.

233
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,533
Mr. Cooper.

234
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,621
- Mr. Sterling, what an honor.
- Call me Roger.

235
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,123
- And you must be Don Draper.
- I am.

236
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,126
I can't tell you how exciting it is
to finally meet you.

237
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,128
That's very flattering.

238
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,007
Guy here has done a study of your work,
which is quite a compliment.

239
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,260
You see,
in addition to his inestimable charm,

240
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,721
Guy here has degrees
from Cambridge University

241
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,473
and the London School of Economics.

242
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,016
Three years at the Bank,
two years at McCann,

243
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,852
and his most recent coup, Mercedes-Benz.

244
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,480
- That's very impressive.
- I apologize.

245
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,692
I didn't realize he was going to recite
my entire curriculum vitae.

246
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,905
- You left out modest.
- Well, we're going to debrief Mr. Pryce,

247
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,990
and the plan is for you
to join us for luncheon.

248
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:23,537
- In the conference room at 1:00.
- Sounds like Agatha Christie.

249
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,873
Well, apparently our tour continues.

250
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,417
I look forward to... How do you say?
Catching up?

251
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,836
I as well.

252
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,924
Well, that was strange.

253
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,181
Look at that. The suspense is killing him.

254
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,813
Yes?

255
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,780
Mr. Powell and Mr. Ford are here to see you.

256
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,911
- Spectacles.
- Right.

257
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,376
Send them in.

258
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,631
- Gentlemen.
- Greetings, Saint John.

259
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,259
Harold, what a pleasure.

260
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,553
Please see to it
that Guy has a space to prepare.

261
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,473
- Right away.
- Gentlemen. There's coffee and cake.

262
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:38,445
We're very impressed, Lane.
Very, very impressed indeed.

263
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,908
In nine months,
you've trimmed every bit of excess,

264
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,453
increased billings,
and we haven't heard a word of complaint.

265
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,039
Yes, well, Pax Romana and all that.

266
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,541
Bravo. We've decided
to offer you something

267
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:55,003
that we hope you'll view
as a reward and a challenge.

268
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,257
- Is it in the box?
- In a manner of speaking.

269
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,887
Open it.

270
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,897
What is that? It looks like a snake.

271
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,567
Fancy that.

272
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,196
- Is it real?
- It was.

273
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,415
It's for our snake charmer.
We're sending you to Bombay.

274
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,919
Bombay? What would I do there?

275
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,965
Well, hopefully the same thing
you accomplished here.

276
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,224
Where shall I put this?

277
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,153
I guess I needn't find a spot for it
if I'm simply moving again.

278
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,321
Don't pout.

279
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,908
One of your greatest qualities
is you always do as you're told.

280
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,494
No, it's just the logistics.

281
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,998
My wife just settled,
my son just accepted to school,

282
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,543
- and now we're moving on?
- Nonsense. You're moving up.

283
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,217
That's the spirit.

284
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:37,022
So, without further ado,
I will give the floor to Guy MacKendrick.

285
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,067
Let me begin by offering
my warmest wishes and admiration

286
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,155
for Lane Pryce and his exemplary work.
It'll be hard to lose him,

287
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,491
but there's no doubt
that our loss is India's gain.

288
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,129
Now, let me say
there's no cause for anxiety.

289
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,382
There will be no further reductions
in the ranks.

290
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,593
Yes, that's good news.

291
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,681
If I might, I'd like to walk you through
this slight reorganization.

292
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,397
As before,
P.P.L. London will be the head of this body,

293
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,359
and Sterling Cooper, now more than ever,
our American presence.

294
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,613
Our business maturity
with your creative edge.

295
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:32,077
A triumvirate of Don and myself
and Mr. Cooper, our chairman emeritus,

296
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:36,623
will oversee three streamlined departments.
Creative, art and copy.

297
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,629
Account management, that's Mr. Cosgrove,
Mr. Campbell for the present,

298
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,633
and a combined television/media
department headed by Mr. Crane.

299
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,178
Mr. Sterling's not on that chart at all.

300
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,392
- That's true.
- Well, that was an oversight.

301
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,688
As you can see,
nothing much has really changed.

302
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:04,943
Frankly, my presence here
is just to ensure thorough communication,

303
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,279
that we help each other
on both sides of the pond.

304
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,533
Whether it be a sharing of creative genius,

305
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,703
media savvy,

306
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,624
or the unbridled acquisition
of new business.

307
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,669
I'm sure you all have a thousand questions.

308
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,257
But for the time being,
I say we inform the troops,

309
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,301
so that the transition
can begin immediately after the holiday.

310
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,179
- Shall I have Mr. Hooker prepare a memo?
- No. Nonsense.

311
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:37,100
I don't want this to be the kind of place
where such news is delivered that way.

312
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,434
Shall we?

313
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,112
Gosh, we're really going to miss you.

314
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,704
- What the hell just happened?
- They reorganized us,

315
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,498
and you're the only one in this room
who got a promotion.

316
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,376
- Really?
- Yes, really.

317
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,591
I apologize for my wild imagination.

318
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,683
See? It's clean.

319
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,439
That's not what I want to talk to you about.

320
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,574
What's this?

321
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,620
It's for you.

322
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,831
"For my new big sister,
the best in the world."

323
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,500
And my goodness, it's from baby Gene.

324
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,630
Look.

325
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,432
Baby Gene can't write.

326
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,479
Babies get fairies to do things.
You know that.

327
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,194
It's really from him. I'm not kidding.
I think you should open it.

328
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,296
- What is it?
- It's a Barbie.

329
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,892
I think he wants you to know
that he wants to be your friend.

330
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,066
And you are very important to me, too.

331
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,550
I'm sure you all have a thousand questions,

332
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,345
but before I raise a glass
to Sterling Cooper's future,

333
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,973
I should like to recognize its past.

334
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:27,270
Most recently,
the inspired stewardship of Lane Pryce.

335
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,771
Hear! Hear!

336
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,152
I'm also aware
of a rather significant milestone.

337
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:40,241
Mrs. Harris,
from those who've known you only hours

338
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:44,078
to those who have cherished
your nearly 10 years of service,

339
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:51,544
I wish you caviar and children
and all that is good in your new life.

340
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,258
There, there. That wasn't my intention.

341
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,433
Mrs. Harris, please.

342
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:19,989
We'll have our presentations tomorrow.
Let this afternoon be a fete worthy of Joan.

343
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,492
Enjoy the liquor and delicatessen.

344
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,416
Thank you. Thank you all.

345
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,546
- This is completely unnecessary.
- You'll be sorely missed.

346
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,299
We got you the cake.

347
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,635
Well...

348
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,646
So, what now?
They keep adding people above us.

349
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,484
One more promotion
and we're gonna be answering phones.

350
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,115
We should go say hi.

351
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,457
- This is good champagne.
- I don't think so.

352
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,963
I'm going to get something to eat.

353
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,600
Mr. Draper,
Conrad Hilton's office is on the line.

354
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,063
- What?
- Conrad Hilton, the hotel owner.

355
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,816
Yeah, I know what he does.
Why is he calling?

356
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,317
I don't know.

357
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,696
- And he's calling for me?
- Yes. Well, his office is.

358
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,074
Put him through.

359
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,584
- Donald Draper.
- Mr. Draper, this is Miss Wakeman.

360
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,879
Mr. Hilton has expressed a desire
to meet with you.

361
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,255
May I ask what this is regarding?

362
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,425
I just set his schedule.
When are you available?

363
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,723
- How about right now?
- Right now? Please hold.

364
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:17,356
- How far are you from the Waldorf Astoria?
- Fifteen minutes.

365
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,026
It's the presidential suite.

366
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,196
I'm on my way.

367
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:40,254
- Where's Miss Blankenship?
- She's down there saluting Union Jack.

368
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,091
- What is that?
- Chocolate pudding.

369
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,474
I wasn't even on the chart.
My name's on the wall out there.

370
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,894
- You want some?
- No.

371
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:59,106
I like to think, "I'm rich. They can't hurt me."

372
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,611
That's a mistake.

373
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,615
I'm being punished
for making my job look easy.

374
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:14,497
Although that kid, Guy, he has a spark.
He is a pure account man.

375
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,750
And what is that job all about?

376
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,463
I don't know. It's about listening to people

377
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,049
and never saying
what's really on your mind.

378
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,011
No. It's about letting things go
so you can get what you want.

379
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,144
Have a nice holiday. Enjoy the fireworks.

380
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,357
We took their money.
We have to do what they say.

381
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,665
My dad keeps talking about Vietnam.
I think he wants me to get drafted.

382
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:03,045
First of all, they're hardly drafting anybody.
Second of all, you're too old.

383
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:09,760
Third of all, I have a friend in the army,
and if you're smart, you're set.

384
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,848
He sits behind a desk at Fort Dix
and screws secretaries all day.

385
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:18,728
- Does he shoot the peoples?
- I don't know. I gotta take a piss.

386
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,192
- Joan.
- Yes?

387
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,695
- May I speak with you?
- Thank you.

388
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,869
I just...
I wanted to get you a card or a present.

389
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,997
It'd be nice if I gave you a gift for once

390
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,666
and you didn't wonder
if I wanted something.

391
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,501
Knock yourself out.

392
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,631
I don't want you to think
I never listen to you.

393
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,508
It's just we can't all be you.

394
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,512
Be that as it may,
I do take some credit for your success here.

395
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,442
- Hey, put that back.
- I'm going home!

396
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,240
I can't believe I'm gonna miss this!

397
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,042
I'm really happy
that you got what you wanted.

398
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,670
I remember on my first day
you said that could happen to me

399
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,382
- if I played my cards right.
- Are you getting sentimental?

400
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,177
Oh, my God.

401
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,723
Don't worry.
I'm sure we'll see each other all the time.

402
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,351
If we don't, I just have to say...

403
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,822
- For the love of Christ!
- Oh, my God.

404
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,199
My foot!

405
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,493
- Call an ambulance!
- Holy crap!

406
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,286
Jesus!

407
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,711
There's a tourniquet in the first aid kit.
You're gonna be okay.

408
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,630
Good God.

409
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,258
I can't feel a thing.

410
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,304
- God! What did I do?
- Get her out of here!

411
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,267
The ambulance is on its way.

412
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,991
- I'm Donald Draper.
- We've met before.

413
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,745
- We have, haven't we?
- Yellow Rock Country Club.

414
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:46,125
- We had a drink. Of course.
- You fixed it for me. Let me return the favor.

415
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,587
I can't believe you're Conrad Hilton.

416
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,922
- Connie.
- Don.

417
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:57,219
Food? Best kitchen in the world.
Got a salad named after it.

418
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,514
I'm fine. I really should have known that.

419
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,350
I don't know. Now...

420
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,106
After this comes out next week...

421
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,736
Well, they don't do that for everyone.

422
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,949
I think I look like an Arab.

423
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,619
How did you find me?

424
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,871
I called around,
told people I had a long chat

425
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,123
with a handsome fellow
from Sterling Cooper,

426
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,334
and your name never came up.

427
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,420
Apparently you don't have long chats
with people.

428
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,298
Well, here I am. What can I do for you?

429
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,512
What do you think?

430
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,893
I think you wouldn't be
in the presidential suite right now

431
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,313
- if you worked for free.
- Don, this is friendly.

432
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,818
Connie, this is my profession.
What do you want me to do?

433
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,822
I want you to give me one for free.

434
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,758
I don't think anybody wants to think
about a mouse in a hotel.

435
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,941
Well, that was my idea.
You got something better?

436
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,443
I might.

437
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,533
So, what do you want?

438
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,290
I'm not gonna lie.
I'd love a chance at your business.

439
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,626
Okay.

440
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,215
But the next time somebody like me
asks you a question like that,

441
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,885
you need to think bigger.

442
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,306
Well, Connie,

443
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,144
there are snakes
that go months without eating,

444
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,730
and then they finally catch something,

445
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,692
but they're so hungry
that they suffocate while they're eating.

446
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,655
One opportunity at a time.

447
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,661
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Draper, you have an emergency call.

448
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,205
Home or office?

449
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,083
Do you understand what's happened here?
That we're not to be trusted?

450
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,586
She's an idiot.
I didn't know she couldn't drive.

451
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,754
But you took the machine out.

452
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,589
You have to have respect
for that equipment.

453
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,343
- It's very safe when operated correctly.
- We had the world handed to us on a plate,

454
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:46,472
and then you swing in on a chandelier,
drop your pants and crap on it.

455
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,099
Jesus, it's like Iwo Jima out there.

456
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,477
We should put a rubber mat down
so Cooper can get around.

457
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,771
They're changing the carpeting.

458
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,315
- Any news?
- He might lose his foot.

459
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,735
Right when he got it in the door.

460
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,741
- Oh, God.
- Sit down, Sissy Mary. You're pale.

461
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,372
I take full responsibility.

462
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,709
Believe me, somewhere in this business,
this has happened before.

463
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,808
Joan. My God.

464
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:35,104
- I know. It's ruined.
- How is he?

465
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,357
I didn't expect you to come over.
I just thought you should know.

466
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,901
Honestly, when I called you,
I thought he might die.

467
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:45,364
- But he's not going to?
- No. He's lost the foot.

468
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,658
Jesus, that's awful.

469
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,994
Lane went to retrieve Powell and Ford
from dinner.

470
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,663
They've already talked to the doctor.

471
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,083
I'll wait.

472
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,596
Despite the circus today,

473
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:13,976
I hope you know
that you are going to be terribly missed.

474
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,730
That's nice to hear,
especially from you, Don.

475
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,537
I bet he felt great
when he woke up this morning.

476
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,291
I'm sure you're right.

477
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,546
But that's life.
One minute, you're on top of the world,

478
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,884
the next minute, some secretary
is running you over with a lawn mower.

479
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,054
Don.

480
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,892
I'm heartbroken.

481
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,812
- It's a terrible tragedy.
- One that surely could have been avoided,

482
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,440
although, Mrs. Harris,
thank you for your quick thinking.

483
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,485
- You may have saved his life.
- Such as it is.

484
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:10,157
He was a great account man. A prodigy.
He could talk a Scotsman out of a penny.

485
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:15,287
- Now that's all over.
- I don't know if that's true.

486
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,625
The man is missing a foot.
How is he going to work? He can't walk.

487
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,127
The doctor said he'll never golf again.

488
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:25,589
I'm afraid we have to reevaluate
our entire strategy.

489
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:32,179
- Lane will remain here indefinitely.
- We'll close the office tomorrow, obviously.

490
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,474
Mrs. Harris, please allow the company
to reimburse you for that dress,

491
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,434
just as a token of our gratitude.

492
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,104
I think Saint John and I
should see him if we can.

493
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,563
Of course.

494
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,450
You should get home
to that lucky husband.

495
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,576
Yes.

496
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,522
- Can I get you one?
- Sure.

497
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,823
I've been reading a lot
of American literature lately.

498
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,580
- Tom Sawyer.
- That's a good one.

499
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:46,336
I feel like I just went to my own funeral.
I didn't like the eulogy.

500
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,898
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

501
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:52,945
- Daddy!
- Hey. Hey, I got you. I got you. Just breathe.

502
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,956
Get him out, Daddy!
Please, Daddy, save me.

503
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,919
I don't even know what to say.

504
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,677
Daddy.

505
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,185
Calm down and tell me what's going on.

506
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,564
Grandpa Gene.
He's not supposed to be here anymore.

507
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,358
He's not.

508
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:35,362
He's called Gene, he sleeps in his room,
he looks just like him,

509
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,700
and I bet when he starts talking,
he's gonna sound just like him, too.

510
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,996
He's a baby. That's it.

511
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,920
I want you to go to sleep.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

512
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,275
Betts, this has to stop.

513
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,862
There's nothing I can do.
She's jealous of her little brother.

514
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,449
No, she's not jealous, she's scared,
and it's all because he has that name.

515
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:21,908
"That name."

516
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,952
You've never liked it
and you haven't hidden it well,

517
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:28,290
- and now you're bringing her into this.
- That's ridiculous. Let's talk about Sally.

518
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,044
She's a child. She'll get over it.
Now you have to.

519
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,422
He was my father and that was his name.

520
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:39,426
It's what people do, Don.
It's how they keep the memory alive.

521
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,679
He hated me and I hated him.
That's the memory.

522
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,389
That's his name!

523
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:54,107
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to wake him.

524
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,905
That's okay, honey. Everything's fine.

525
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,951
Come on. Let's get you to sleep.

526
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,564
Come over here.

527
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,872
You see? It's all right.

528
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,341
This is your little brother,

529
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,345
and he's only a baby.

530
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,724
We don't know who he is yet,

531
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,811
or who he's going to be.

532
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,525
And that is a wonderful thing.
