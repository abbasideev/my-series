1
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,190
Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell.

2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,770
l got your hot cocoa.

3
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,980
Wonderful.

4
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,740
l just got back from lunch,
and Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

5
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,990
-lt's instant.
-lt's from the diner.

6
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,540
l don't know how you can tell.

7
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,910
You can tell because
they use water instead of milk.

8
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,080
lt's warmer outside. lt's ridiculous.

9
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,340
The building will take care of it.
They always do.

10
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,510
Sorry about that.
This really is hitting the spot.

11
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,320
Come in.

12
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,410
Have a seat.

13
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,620
l believe l have
what is rather disappointing news.

14
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,290
lt's been decided that Mr. Cosgrove

15
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,950
will be made senior vice president
in charge of account services,

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,120
and you will be made
head of account management.

17
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,390
Really?

18
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,250
This is not to ignore
that you've distinguished yourself

19
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,130
and been of great service to the company.

20
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,550
What is it based on?
Our billings are neck and neck.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,470
ln fact, l think l've done a lot with
what l was given in this arbitrary scheme.

22
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,770
lt's become apparent

23
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,240
that you are excellent at making the clients
feel their needs are being met,

24
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,580
but Mr. Cosgrove has the rare gift
of making them feel

25
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,830
as if they haven't any needs.

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,460
-l see.
-l improved your title.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,720
And you tell your clients
there'll be no need to be deprecating.

28
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,580
-Bert and Roger know about this?
-This is under my authority.

29
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,020
And l have to commend you
on taking it as well as you have.

30
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,230
-l hope this was a difficult decision.
-lt was.

31
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,870
There you go.

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,930
-Where are you going?
-l don't feel well.

33
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,800
Why did you pick that place?

34
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,180
l don't know why a lunch counter
is any better than eating at your desk.

35
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,190
Well, you could've joined me for a drink.

36
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,310
l can drink at my desk if l want to,
and l'm not out $1 .25.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,120
l'm sorry l'm not as stimulating
a lunch companion as Doug.

38
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,070
-lt's Duck, and l work most lunches.
-Well, l don't like his aftershave.

39
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,570
l can smell it on you, and l can smell it
in the bathroom in the morning.

40
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,530
What's wrong with him?

41
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,580
Nothing. l don't even know
why l'm weighing in on men right now.

42
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,590
l think it's good
that you're being picky, finally.

43
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, there's nothing around
but married ones.

44
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,930
l mean, we can't all
throw caution to the wind.

45
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,930
But Duck's not married.

46
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,930
Then why are you with him?

47
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,030
-Well, this is me. You working late tonight?
-l don't know yet.

48
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,610
-Okay.
-Bye.

49
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,900
Wow. Van Cleef.
How very Jane Siegel-Sterling.

50
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,660
-They're blue and they're new.
-She's trying.

51
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,450
You always take her side.

52
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,460
l do not.

53
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,170
She started giving me advice.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,380
"Don't go to bed angry.
Let them do what they want.

55
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,680
"Dress sexy."

56
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,050
And all l kept thinking about was Daddy.
lt's disgusting.

57
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,800
Doesn't she know that?
That she ruined my life?

58
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,980
Your father had a part in it.

59
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,490
You don't think l know that?

60
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,290
-Brooks is different than your father.
-l don't want to get married.

61
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,080
Everything's pointing to the fact
that l shouldn't, and everybody knows.

62
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,710
Brooks knows. His mother knows.
Do you know what she said to me?

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,430
She said in lndia, if the wedding
doesn't take place at the appointed hour,

64
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,670
they burn the bride.

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,680
Just because she went to lndia
doesn't mean she's not an idiot.

66
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,360
And Jane. lf she's coming,

67
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,520
l'm not going.

68
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,270
She's coming, because your father's coming
and he paid for everything.

69
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,270
You're having the wedding.
The bride will not be burned.

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,780
Turn those earrings
into a tea service or something.

71
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,790
-Aren't you listening to me?
-l am,

72
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,670
and you're babbling like a little fool.
Go to your room.

73
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,920
-What?
-You heard me.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,420
You want to act like a child,
l'll treat you like one.

75
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,340
Would somebody get that?

76
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,350
-Hello?
-Daddy?

77
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,230
Are you alone?

78
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,680
-Yes, what's wrong?
-Nothing's right.

79
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,860
My bridesmaids are supposed to give me
something blue and something new.

80
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,770
-Or Mommy. She should know that.
-Who?

81
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,290
l don't like her, Daddy, and l've told you
l don't want her to be there.

82
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,870
-Honey, put your mother on the phone.
-He wants to talk to you.

83
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,510
You have to keep Jane under control.

84
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,790
Well, first of all, tell the bride
that everything is copacetic.

85
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,550
We both agree that she's nuts
and she should shut up.

86
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,600
Your father said that he's sorry
and that Jane will stay out of your way

87
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,680
-and that we're both tired of the drama.
-He said all that?

88
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,030
l'm not playing chicken anymore.
lf she wants to cancel the wedding,

89
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,930
l'll take the deposit out of her inheritance.

90
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,950
-He said the wedding's off.
-Fine.

91
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,610
You mean that?
You're not worried about lndia?

92
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,490
-Why are you doing this?
-Do you want to cancel it or not?

93
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,530
No.

94
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,280
Then go eat something.
l'm not taking that dress in again.

95
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,080
Why did Jane get her
such an expensive gift?

96
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,470
l didn't even know they saw each other.

97
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,140
-Of course you didn't.
-l forbid it.

98
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,890
-Can't wait to get her out of here.
-Everything okay?

99
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,070
Goodbye.

100
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,850
Jane! Get in here, now.

101
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,520
-l didn't know you were home.
-l overdid it at lunch,

102
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,360
as did you, l heard.

103
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,030
l'm sorry, sweetheart.
l just wanted to make amends.

104
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,330
l got her a beautiful present.

105
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,580
Why the hell are you even talking to her?
You're screwing things up!

106
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,420
l'm tired of the awkwardness,
and l'm trying to be nice.

107
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,220
And l don't know
what kind of world you live in,

108
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,210
-but l am the good person here.
-You're not good,

109
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,840
because you didn't listen to me
and you really upset her.

110
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,220
Everything you do is for her.

111
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,190
l'm your wife.

112
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,270
And guess what?
l live here and l get to do what l want to do,

113
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,440
so stop trying to tell me
that you know better.

114
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,830
-You'd better not have locked that door.
-Go away!

115
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,700
Or what? You'll commit suicide?

116
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,090
-Peter, what are you doing home?
-l got fired.

117
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,220
What happened?

118
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:09,060
Lane told me Kenny is senior something
of something accounts and l'm not.

119
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,160
l'm account something.

120
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,490
l couldn't even hear him.
All l saw was his frog-like mouth flapping.

121
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,330
-So, did he ask you to leave?
-No.

122
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,370
l have to ask this,
but did you lose your temper?

123
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,090
No, l didn't.

124
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,630
That's good. That's very good.

125
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,930
Do you remember if he said anything
about how much they want you to stay?

126
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,390
-No.
-That's good, too. So it didn't come up.

127
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,510
Trudy, stop it with the Ellery Queen.

128
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,280
-l'm going to call Duck.
-No, you're not.

129
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,070
They would have fired you
if they wanted to fire you.

130
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,790
You need to wait and see how it goes.

131
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,780
He basically said l care too much
about my clients and they notice it.

132
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,130
How could that be bad?

133
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,880
Peter, you hold all the cards.

134
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,350
lt's going to be fine.

135
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,610
l thought you'd left.

136
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,450
-l'm here.
-l see.

137
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,950
-Well, thank you.
-l've done it before.

138
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,210
Go back to bed.

139
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,350
-Do you want anything?
-No. l'll be in, in a bit.

140
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,030
-lt's got to be 1 00 degrees in here.
-You ask the building for heat, you get heat.

141
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,490
Mr. Herman on line one.

142
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,240
-Hello? Can you give me a minute?
-No.

143
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,080
l'm right around the corner
at the Elysée, room 531 .

144
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,340
-l'm in the middle of something.
-Pee wee, sweetheart, it's been three weeks.

145
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,420
You can get room service. l think they have
a Monte Cristo sandwich. You love that.

146
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
l'm having lunch with Kurt and Smitty.

147
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,550
They're a couple of homos.
Tell them you have plans.

148
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,480
-lt's kind of short notice.
-Come on, Creative, be creative.

149
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,450
l have to go to the printer.

150
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,210
-l know a nooner when l hear one.
-You're disgusting.

151
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,460
No, Bob did.

152
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,510
Bob?

153
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,000
l was hoping to catch you
on your way to lunch.

154
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,390
Too late.

155
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,510
-I must say I'm surprised.
-Frankly, I was a little suspicious...

156
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,310
l found out yesterday that head of accounts
is going to Kenny and his haircut.

157
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,520
-l heard.
-This is the first time he's invited her here...

158
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,180
-Can you turn that off?
-Not really.

159
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,200
Did you ask him why he invited her?

160
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,700
He said something about not wanting her
to actually have to get involved.

161
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,750
-Were you consulted?
-After the fact.

162
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,620
-What does it mean?
-lt's not good.

163
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,160
l know it's not good.
There's no future for me here.

164
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,640
-How did you do it? You made yourjob up.
-l didn't.

165
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,090
l looked at other agencies
and saw that they had TV departments

166
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,390
and wondered why we didn't.

167
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,630
Well, there's no such thing
in the accounts field.

168
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,720
-There's marketing.
-That's a research job.

169
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,610
-ls this official?
-Yes.

170
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,240
l'm afraid we can't hire Mr. Charcot.

171
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,530
Well, at least you had the guts
to send me a memo.

172
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,900
-He's far too expensive.
-Salvatore Romano is gone.

173
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,110
There is no one in charge
of the art department.

174
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,740
l haven't heard a complaint
from any of the clients.

175
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,250
-Jesus! lt's hotter in here than in my office.
-That's because you're overexcited.

176
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,540
Do you want me to walk you through
a delivery schedule?

177
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,630
This is walter Cronkite in our newsroom,

178
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,130
and there has been an attempt,
as perhaps you know now,

179
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,760
on the life of President Kennedy.

180
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,440
He was wounded in an automobile driving
from Dallas Airport into downtown Dallas

181
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,610
along with Governor Connally of Texas.

182
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,940
They've been taken
to Parkland Hospital there,

183
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,480
where their condition is as yet...

184
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,460
My God, how much
have you been smoking in here?

185
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,170
Sorry about that.

186
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,710
-l'm glad you ran over.
-Me too.

187
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,130
l don't understand. l can't run
my department without an art director.

188
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,560
-You want to call Saint John?
-Bert Cooper still has a say around here.

189
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,570
Hello. What?

190
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,910
lf they wanted to fire you,
they would've fired you.

191
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,740
l'm gonna die at this desk, unnoticed.

192
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,200
Do you have any idea
what l've done for this company?

193
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
-What are you doing?
-Christ!

194
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,740
-Somebody shot the president.
-Turn on the TV.

195
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,960
What?

196
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,840
...top of the president's car was down.

197
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,130
They drew their pistols,
but the damage was done.

198
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,830
-Oh, my God. Unbelievable.
-The president was slumped over

199
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,040
in the backseat of the car, face down,

200
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,090
then Governor Connally,
after slumping to the left for a moment,

201
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,430
lay on the floor of the rear seats.

202
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,010
-Oh, my God.
-Dear God.

203
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,440
ls he dead?

204
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,190
What the hell is going on?

205
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,540
Every person listening at this moment
has flashed back to that day in April, 1945,

206
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,970
when Franklin Delano Roosevelt...

207
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,010
Excuse me, Chet, here is a flash
from the Associated Press, dateline Dallas.

208
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,380
Two priests
who were with President Kennedy

209
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,810
say he is dead of bullet wounds.

210
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,970
There is no further confirmation,
but this is what we have on a flash basis...

211
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,110
-ls he okay?
-They just said he died.

212
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,150
Two priests in Dallas
who were with President Kennedy

213
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,560
say he is dead of bullet wounds.

214
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,690
-Oh, lord.
-There is no further confirmation.

215
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,830
This is the only word we have indicating
the president may, in fact, have lost his life.

216
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,410
It has just moved
on the Associated Press wires from Dallas.

217
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,910
The two priests were called to the hospital
to administer the last rites...

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,540
-Oh, my goodness.
-...of the Roman Catholic Church,

219
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,040
-and it is from them we get the word...
-l know.

220
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,630
...that the president has died,

221
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,710
that the bullet wounds inflicted on him
as he rode in a motorcade

222
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,350
through downtown Dallas have been fatal.

223
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,520
We would remind you there is no official
confirmation of this from any source as yet.

224
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,590
Bill, just moments before
you brought the flash,

225
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,800
I had word from the hospital

226
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,430
that the vice president, Lyndon Johnson,
and his wife had just left the hospital,

227
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,220
been rushed away into a...

228
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Did you give me a hickey?

229
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,700
-l don't think so.
-l told you l don't like that.

230
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,740
l get questions from my mother.

231
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,290
Listen, there was a news story
that was on right before you came in.

232
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,300
-lt's been distracting me.
-You didn't seem distracted.

233
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,340
-l just want to see what's going on.
-What's going on?

234
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,400
Because it was only on October the 24th
that our ambassador to the United Nations,

235
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,570
Adlai Stevenson, was assaulted in Dallas
leaving a dinner meeting there.

236
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,900
From Dallas, Texas,
the flash, apparently official,

237
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,290
President Kennedy died at 1 :00 p.m.
Central Standard Time,

238
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,330
2:00 Eastern Standard Time...

239
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,660
-Jesus.
-Oh, my God.

240
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,460
-...some 38 minutes ago.
-What happened?

241
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,890
Vice President Lyndon Johnson
has left the hospital in Dallas.

242
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,430
-l've gotta call my kids.
-We do not know

243
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,560
to where he has proceeded.

244
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,430
Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly

245
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,430
and become
the 36th President of the United...

246
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,900
President Johnson is under heavy guard
and was whisked away from the hospital...

247
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,020
lt's ruined.

248
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,870
-President Kennedy, we are now informed...
-lt's all ruined.

249
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,610
lt's gonna be ruined.

250
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,210
...five-year-old boy and myself

251
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,710
were by ourselves on the grass there
on Palmer Street,

252
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,210
-and I asked Joe to wave to him...
-Betts?

253
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,200
...and Joe waved and I waved,
and the man...

254
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,420
That's all right, sir. Go ahead and tell it.

255
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,220
As he was waving back, he was...
The shot rang out, and he slumped down...

256
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,300
-Where's your mother?
-She's not feeling well.

257
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,560
He was slumping down and the second
shot went off and just knocked him down.

258
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,950
-l can't stop crying.
-No, sir, I did not see the man who did it.

259
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,080
All I did was look in the man's face
when he was shot there...

260
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,500
Why are the kids watching this?

261
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,920
What am l supposed to do, Don?
Am l supposed to keep it from them?

262
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,920
...that it hit him and he went
all the way down in the car.

263
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,460
Take a pill and lie down.
l can handle the kids.

264
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,210
...fell on him in hopes
that there wasn't a maniac around.

265
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,130
I'm sorry, I can't help you more,
but I won't forget it.

266
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,840
-Turn this off. l'll make us some dinner.
-A Polaroid picture

267
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,760
taken by another witness,
Mary Moorman of Dallas,

268
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,850
showing the president
slumped over in the car.

269
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,270
Just as Mary started to take the picture,
the president came right even with us,

270
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,070
-two shots... We looked at him...
-You two, look at me.

271
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,080
Two shots rang out
and he grabbed his chest.

272
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,610
Everything's gonna be okay.

273
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,780
...on his face and fell across,
towards Jackie...

274
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,490
-We have a new president...
-And she...

275
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,880
-...and we're all gonna be sad for a little bit.
-...fell over on him

276
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,290
and said, "My God, he's shot!"

277
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,800
And then on Monday
there's gonna be a funeral.

278
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,460
Are we going to the funeral?

279
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,680
...more shots rang out, but by that time
the motorcade had sped away.

280
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,880
What prompted you to take the picture
at that particular instance?

281
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,470
Well, that's the only chance I had.

282
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,390
For the nation and the world,

283
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,310
Mrs. Rockefeller and I
join with all New Yorkers

284
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,560
and every American in extending heartfelt...

285
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,270
...chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba,
a pro-Castro organization,

286
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,350
where he had been arrested
on disturbance of the peace charges.

287
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,110
He denied he was a communist,
said he was a Marxist,

288
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,770
and claimed there was quite a difference
between the two.

289
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,620
Police in Dallas have just announced...

290
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,530
-You should get ready. lt's almost 2:00.
-Really, Don?

291
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,380
...has gunpowder traces on both hands,
indicating he'd recently used a rifle,

292
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,460
the type of weapon
that killed Mr. Kennedy yesterday.

293
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,500
As we told you a short time ago,
Oswald has refused...

294
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,260
He's 24 years old.

295
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,050
In Washington,
the body of the late president

296
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,560
lies in the East Room of the White House...

297
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,480
-Come on, Betts.
-...as official Washington and members of...

298
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,360
Are you sure they haven't canceled it?
lt said in The Times they were doing that.

299
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,030
l'm not gonna call Roger to find out.

300
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,610
lf we go in and it's off,
we'll grab dinner or something.

301
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,230
...third-floor living quarters
of the White House...

302
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,570
-l can't sit in front of the TV all day.
-Fine.

303
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,280
...ailing Mr. Kennedy stricken by a stroke
two years ago...

304
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,620
Just stay here until Carla comes.

305
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,260
...greatly, increasingly failing health
for the last...

306
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,830
After the terrible news had reached us,

307
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,060
-60,000 Berliners...
-Can you see bags?

308
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,100
-l don't understand this. Here we are.
-...gathered with torches in their hands.

309
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,300
Lyndon Johnson, more of the same.

310
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,180
Nobody voted for him. lt felt for a second
like everything was about to change.

311
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,370
You should get your coat and your scarf.
l know it's far, but l really feel like walking.

312
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,190
Why are we going?

313
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,570
Because it's your boss's
daughter's wedding.

314
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,540
lt's business, Pete, and there's a system.
You always say that.

315
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,040
lt's one thing to go to this wedding
and act like l don't hate them.

316
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,550
lt's another thing to go and act
like the president hasn't been murdered.

317
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,850
Maybe they'll cancel it,
but we have to show.

318
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,270
...in the White House today and tomorrow.

319
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,430
Though it is known
that they have lost their best...

320
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,980
-Have you been drinking?
-The whole country's drinking,

321
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,400
and not to celebrate
some spoiled brat's wedding.

322
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,230
We are mourning together with his widow...

323
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,190
-They'll never cancel. You know why?
-...with his children,

324
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,990
-his parents, brothers and sisters.
-Because they're happy.

325
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,000
You should've heard some of the things
people said yesterday.

326
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,290
Like what? What did they say?

327
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,180
"The man made a lot of enemies,"
things like that.

328
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,390
That's awful. l don't care
what your politics are, this is America.

329
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,470
You don't just shoot the president.

330
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,550
Edwin Walker, who...

331
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,860
Chet Huntley was talking about Jackie
and those kids

332
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,470
and how she'd just lost that baby,

333
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,230
and Harry Crane
was looking at his paperwork,

334
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,910
calculating how many commercials
weren't going to be aired.

335
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,650
...this prepared statement
be handed to newsmen...

336
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,240
l'm not going.

337
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,580
You can go and say l'm sick,
if you think it's that important.

338
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,420
"...demonstrates the internal threat
that can never be underestimated."

339
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,790
No, you're right.

340
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,040
"Our sympathy for the Kennedy family
is no less than it is

341
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,010
"for the millions of people
who have sustained equal losses

342
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,350
"in the fight for freedom."
Then General Walker's statement went on...

343
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,010
l got a call from Leona, this girl
l used to work with at the phone company.

344
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,560
My friend Francine called me.
Don couldn't get through.

345
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,190
Well, the system
was completely overloaded.

346
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,850
lt's annoying that people think
the operators were watching TV.

347
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,350
They were as frustrated as anyone.

348
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,330
The maitre d' has reorganized the seating.

349
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,110
If you are at an even-numbered table,
take these first six.

350
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,410
If you are at an odd-numbered table,
the left side of the room.

351
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,630
Maestro, do you mind? Thank you.

352
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,750
Look, everybody, grab your plate
and come on up to the front here.

353
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,470
Sit wherever you feel like,

354
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,640
and please feel free to have
the prime rib and the fillet of sole.

355
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,010
Help yourself.
I mean that. There are no waiters.

356
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,360
Three months after Roosevelt died,
we bombed Hiroshima.

357
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,350
That's how we got over it.

358
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,280
l say we hang Lee Oswald, and then we
take care of Texas. Hell, the whole South.

359
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,370
What did everyone think
of the sweetbreads?

360
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,360
You were right, Mommy. Okay?

361
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,370
-Problem solved.
-Hardly.

362
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,630
-They just told me the cake's not coming.
-Shit.

363
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,390
Of course.

364
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,860
l have to say, on some level,
Harry has a point.

365
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,660
l think he wanted attention.
He obviously didn't fit in.

366
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,130
Congratulations.

367
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,590
You are so beautiful,
like Natalie Wood or something.

368
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,930
Daddy, l really wish
you could've gotten to see the ceremony.

369
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,180
lt's okay. We understand.
We're honored you're here.

370
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,880
-l heard the church was packed.
-Those weren't our guests.

371
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,940
Have a seat.

372
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,930
Just sit anywhere.

373
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,640
l'm so happy for you.

374
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,790
I would like some legal representation,

375
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,490
but these police officers
have not allowed me to have any.

376
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,290
I don't know what this is all about.

377
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,200
-Did you kill the president?
-No, sir, I didn't.

378
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,000
-People keep asking me that. Sir?
-Did you shoot the president?

379
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,080
How would you know
that's what a monster looks like?

380
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,920
Naturally, if I work in that building, yes, sir.

381
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,430
Did you see The Times? He lived in Russia.

382
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,470
-l thought he just visited.
-Would you visit?

383
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,300
-I'm just a patsy.
-Did you shoot the president?

384
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,150
-There you are. What are you doing here?
-They're about to interview Oswald.

385
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,060
Hey, somebody go buy a cake.

386
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,530
-Let's keep it quiet and we'll all get it!
-Hold it down.

387
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,770
Has the gentleman been identified?

388
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,940
Yes, sir, he's been identified
for killing the officer.

389
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,820
l need you out there.
l'm about to give my toast.

390
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,790
l've heard your toast a million times.
The president is dead.

391
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,590
And l'll tell you something else,
our table has no one at it.

392
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,670
l consolidated the tables.

393
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,510
-Would you keep an eye on her?
-Absolutely.

394
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,550
We better get back in there.

395
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,440
-We want to say this...
-Jane.

396
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,680
...that this investigation
has been carried on jointly by...

397
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,110
This toast is going to be much shorter
than it was supposed to be.

398
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,020
Obviously, we're all in a different mood.

399
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,530
Can someone please
get my wife out of the kitchen?

400
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,860
I have something very nice to say about her.
But while we're alone...

401
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
I want to say something nice
about my ex-wife.

402
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,010
Mona, you're a lioness.

403
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,920
And thank you for resisting
the urge to eat your cub.

404
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,460
This could've been an awful day,

405
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,060
but here we are, not watching TV,
but together watching the two of you.

406
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,970
To Margaret and Brooks Hargrove.

407
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,810
The adults,
we all wanted to be strong for you,

408
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,610
but your spirit, your love,
your hope is giving us strength.

409
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,450
And I promise you now,
if you can make it through a day like today,

410
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,420
marriage is a cakewalk.

411
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,950
To many years of happiness.

412
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,660
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

413
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,090
We invite the father of the bride
and the bride to share the dance floor.

414
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,790
Sorry about that.

415
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,510
Now, if there are any other
fathers and daughters...

416
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,730
You know what?
Everyone, please join them.

417
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:24,610
-Do you want to dance?
-l don't know.

418
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,550
-Want me to teach him how to dance?
-He's a great dancer.

419
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,960
She's happy.

420
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,020
That's because she doesn't know
his net worth just dropped by half.

421
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,640
Stop it, Daddy.

422
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,360
Hey.

423
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,500
Everything's gonna be fine.

424
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,040
How do you know that?

425
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,940
You'll see.

426
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,900
Why do you keep looking at that woman?

427
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,250
What are you talking about?

428
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,770
-Are you ready?
-Did Jennifer fall in?

429
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,860
-She'll be right out.
-See you Tuesday.

430
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,800
He was so handsome,
and now l'll never get to vote for him.

431
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,810
Hey.

432
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,020
You want me to cut you out of that dress?

433
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,120
l'm making a phone call.

434
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,720
-Hello?
-So what's new?

435
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,180
-lt's incredible, isn't it?
-Yes.

436
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,470
Margaret got married today.

437
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,490
That's right, l forgot. Poor thing.

438
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,620
Joanie, l wish you could've seen it.
Oh, my God, what a disaster.

439
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,150
l'm sorry.

440
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,620
She pulled through.
They pulled through. l pulled through.

441
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,290
l can't believe how quiet it is out there.

442
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,890
Not everywhere. Greg just called.
He's working the night shift at the ER.

443
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,340
People are still getting sick.

444
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,350
Car accidents are happening.
Babies are being born.

445
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,110
Well, l'm glad he's not home.
l had to talk to you.

446
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,980
Nobody else is saying
the right thing about this.

447
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,320
My God, you're really upset.

448
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,120
What's that about?

449
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,330
Because there's nothing funny about this.

450
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,220
Well, hang in there, red.

451
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,210
You too.

452
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,890
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye.

453
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,060
Put him on a standby
of indeterminate length, will you?

454
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,700
Let me have it. I want it.

455
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,520
Being led out by Captain Fritz.

456
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,540
There is the prisoner. There is Lee Oswald.

457
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,990
He's been shot.

458
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,990
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-What happened?

459
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,200
Lee Oswald has been shot.

460
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,500
They shot him. The police were walking him
through the building

461
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,340
-and some man ran up and shot him.
-What?

462
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,680
Detectives have their guns drawn.

463
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,520
-What is going on?
-Oswald has been shot.

464
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,020
There is no question about it.
Oswald has been shot.

465
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,860
-Please, leave me alone.
-Betts?

466
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,890
...here in the basement
of Dallas police headquarters.

467
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,480
What happened?

468
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,860
-Do you know where he is at present?
-No, sir, I don't.

469
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,230
-Can you give us some indication...
-Nothing. Go upstairs.

470
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,740
The family, incidentally,
asked that there be no flowers,

471
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,700
but there have, nevertheless, been flowers.

472
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,910
People either didn't hear
or chose to ignore it,

473
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,430
and one room or two rooms
in the White House have had to be set aside

474
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,180
to hold them. The casket, incidentally,

475
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,400
will remain closed at all times
during all ceremonies...

476
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,980
l'm going out.

477
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,240
-Where?
-For a drive.

478
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,530
Let me drive. l'll get the kids.
We'll all go somewhere. That's a good idea.

479
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,830
No. l need to clear my head.

480
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,910
...airports, four of them around town...

481
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,120
-l'm so glad you could see me.
-Where does your husband think you are?

482
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,870
l don't care. He's been lying to me for years.
l couldn't be in that house.

483
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,420
Then l saw you yesterday.
l didn't know you were going to be there.

484
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,550
l hoped you would be there.

485
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:44,000
Derby day, it seems like 1 00 years ago.

486
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,220
And then this morning,
seeing that man shot to death...

487
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,280
What is going on?

488
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,020
lt will be okay. We've lost a lot of presidents
and we're still standing.

489
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,400
l wish l could believe you.
l can't believe anything right now.

490
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,240
Have you thought that
there are other ways to live?

491
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,290
Listen. l'm not in love
with the tragedy of this thing.

492
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,370
It's not Romeo and Juliet.
l want it to happen.

493
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,680
l have three children.

494
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,730
l'll know more when the primaries
start to shake out in spring,

495
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,090
-but l can leave the campaign right now.
-l don't want you to do that.

496
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,870
You don't have to answer me now,

497
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,950
but l want to marry you.

498
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,990
-l don't know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything.

499
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,450
l told you.

500
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:01,460
But if you search your heart,
you'll know that l can make you happy.

501
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,200
l should go.

502
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,580
l wish l could take you
to the movies right now,

503
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,570
that some theater was playing
your favorite movie.

504
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,250
Singin' in the Rain.

505
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,410
Well, just think about that.

506
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,700
This is made possible by special equipment,
and it will move at one-fourth speed.

507
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,650
So we would like to show you
the slow motion of the shooting

508
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,740
of Lee Harvey Oswald now.

509
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,330
They just stood there.

510
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,380
No security.
The most wanted man in America.

511
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,670
Why even have a trial?
Just throw him over to the mob.

512
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,430
Now you can see the two detectives,
one in a light suit, one in a dark,

513
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,130
bringing Oswald out.

514
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,550
The camera changes its lens
for a close-up of Oswald.

515
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,640
The shot has been fired. You cannot hear it
in this version of the tape.

516
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,650
Oswald falls.
The man with the hat moves in on him.

517
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,100
He's grabbed by the man in light.

518
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,370
-You're not going into work tomorrow?
-No, of course not.

519
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,860
-lt's a national day of mourning.
-You're going to go in Tuesday.

520
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,580
There's another happy thought.

521
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,760
Those people don't care about you.
And honestly, what's the difference?

522
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,750
What are you saying?

523
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,590
You did everything they asked you to do,
but you don't owe them anything.

524
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,060
...minutes past 2:00 Eastern Standard Time,
we were advised

525
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,770
that Lee Harvey Oswald was dead.
Now Ruby is under arrest...

526
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,930
You should start gathering your clients.
They'll follow you wherever you go.

527
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,940
...is the operator of two nightclubs
in Dallas...

528
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,080
The only other president buried there
is William Howard Taft,

529
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,580
though, of course, there are many
other heroes of perhaps lesser renown.

530
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,380
That is the Lee... Robert E. Lee Mansion.

531
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,460
Its name, Arlington, has been given
to the cemetery and, in fact, to the county.

532
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,220
-Francine has the kids.
-The president's brother, Robert Kennedy,

533
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,010
and the Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara...

534
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,210
-l don't know where to begin.
-What?

535
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:04,680
l want to scream at you
for ruining all of this.

536
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,320
But then you try to fix it
and there's no point.

537
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,580
There's no point, Don.

538
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,840
You're very upset. l understand.

539
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,180
l know it's painful, but it's going to pass.

540
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,220
-l don't love you.
-Betts, don't.

541
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,760
-You're distraught.
-That's true,

542
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,390
but l don't love you anymore.

543
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,980
-l know that.
-Stop it.

544
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,280
-l kissed you yesterday.
-Kennedy's remains...

545
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,230
l didn't feel a thing.

546
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,530
...the public allowed to pass through
and pay its respects.

547
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,920
There will be a little roped...

548
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,710
You'll feel better tomorrow. You'll see.

549
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,450
You can't even hear me right now.

550
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,540
You're right.

551
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,930
...on Monday it will be taken

552
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:20,730
to the St. Matthew's Cathedral, which is on
Rhode Island Avenue in Washington,

553
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,020
for the funeral.

554
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,860
This, I think, is the largest
Catholic cathedral in town.

555
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,450
It is, as you see, draped in black.

556
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,530
It's been open all day.
Great numbers of people have stopped...

557
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,470
-Morning.
-Morning, Daddy.

558
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,000
Good morning.

559
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,260
-Where are you going?
-l have to go to work. l'm sorry.

560
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,270
-lt's cold outside.
-l'm fine.

561
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,630
Peggy.

562
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,350
What are you doing here?

563
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,190
l don't know. Aqua Net.

564
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,120
lt doesn't shoot till after Thanksgiving.

565
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,200
We'll be okay.

566
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,590
What do you have?

567
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,760
-What are you doing here?
-The bars are closed.

568
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,920
My roommate invited over half the building
so they could watch TV

569
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,720
and write condolence letters to Jackie.

570
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,770
Then l went to my sister's
and my mother was crying

571
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,600
and praying so hard.

572
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,740
There wasn't room
for anyone else to feel anything.

573
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,820
The funeral's already started.

574
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,910
l was going to watch in Cooper's office.
ls that okay?

575
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,250
Yes.

576
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,830
Are you coming?
