1
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,080
Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,240
That's okay. l was occupied.
How are you today, Don?

3
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,130
l'm well, Connie. Thank you. How are you?

4
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,170
l'm afraid l have some serious business
to discuss. Have a seat.

5
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,510
l was at McCann Erickson yesterday,
and they let me know

6
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,430
that effective January 1
they're buying Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

7
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,140
What?

8
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
l'm sorry, but that means
l'm going to have to move

9
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,270
-my New York properties elsewhere.
-Why?

10
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,450
Because P.P.L. owns Sterling Cooper.
You're all gonna be part of McCann.

11
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,450
-So we're all gone.
-Sterling... l don't know.

12
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,130
Cooper will definitely be put on an ice floe.

13
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,710
But you're a prize pig.
You'll make more money, pick up stock.

14
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,210
You won't have to live and die
with every account.

15
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,630
Bullshit. lt's a sausage factory.
l turned them down three years ago.

16
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,690
This happens all the time, Don.
lt's business.

17
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,440
l'd ask them to put you
on the Caribbean hotels,

18
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,240
but l don't think
l'm gonna stay there much longer.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,690
-You come and go as you please.
-Yes, l do.

20
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,790
And you don't give a crap that my future
is tied up in this mess because of you?

21
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,580
You wanted my account,
and you were lucky to get it.

22
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,450
And you wanted to play with me.

23
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,500
Kick me around, knock me down to size
while you called me "son."

24
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,060
l get it now, Connie. lt's business.

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,730
You know,

26
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,820
l got everything l have on my own.

27
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,450
lt's made me immune to those
who complain and cry because they can't.

28
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,540
l didn't take you for one of them, Don.

29
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,500
Are you?

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,600
-Some other time we'll try again.
-Yes.

31
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,720
Have a nice holiday.

32
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,910
Sixty-nine cents a bushel.

33
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,090
-That's half last year.
-We ain't gonna make it.

34
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,370
lt's as fair a shake as we could get,

35
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,540
considering that Allotment Act
made no allotment for wheat.

36
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,460
You were supposed to get us a good deal.

37
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,630
There's a surplus.
What the hell's he supposed to do?

38
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,930
-Well, l ain't selling at that.
-You've got no choice.

39
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,860
Sure l do. l've got a silo.
Store it till winter when the price goes up.

40
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,390
-How you gonna pay your mortgage?
-That's none of your concern.

41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,020
-Settle down. We're all in this together.
-No, we ain't, thanks to you.

42
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,830
-l take care of mine. You take care of yours.
-Damn it, Whitman, this is a cooperative.

43
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,110
No more.

44
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,260
Now get out of my kitchen.

45
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,720
What's so urgent that you had to wake me?

46
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,860
Conrad Hilton told me P.P.L.
is being sold and us along with it.

47
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,110
-So you knew about this?
-No, but it makes sense.

48
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,780
-All that short-term thinking.
-So what do we do?

49
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,130
There's nothing to do. l have a contract.
You have a contract. Roger has a contract.

50
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,830
So that's it?

51
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,210
You're losing your business
and you don't care?

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,010
-l lost my business last year.
-Well, do something about it.

53
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,770
lf Sterling Cooper is for sale,
why don't we buy it from P.P.L.?

54
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,260
We could put everything back
the way it was.

55
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,440
Young men love risk because
they can't imagine the consequences.

56
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,850
And you old men love
building golden tombs

57
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,070
and sealing the rest of us in with you.
You're done. You know that, right?

58
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,980
So l should just throw away my fortune?

59
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,190
l don't have the rest of my life
to earn it back.

60
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,240
-l understand. l'll let you get back to sleep.
-Why do you care?

61
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,330
Because l'm sick of being batted around
like a ping-pong ball.

62
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,800
Who the hell is in charge? A bunch of
accountants trying to make $1 into $1 .1 0?

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,840
l want to work.
l want to build something of my own.

64
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,920
How do you not understand that?
You did it yourself 40 years ago.

65
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,060
That's true.

66
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,220
But l'm not sure you have a stomach
for the realities.

67
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,020
Try me.

68
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,730
Well, we're gonna need accounts.

69
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,650
American Tobacco, that's most
of Sterling Cooper, but that's Roger.

70
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,480
l understand that.

71
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,070
Did Hilton tell you when this blessed event
is supposed to take place?

72
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,740
New Year's Day.

73
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,090
-We have to talk to Roger now.
-You talk to him.

74
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you want to do this or not?

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,970
Honey...

76
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,390
Honey, he probably feels bad about
the president getting shot on his watch.

77
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,350
Now, stop reading the paper.
She's obsessed.

78
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,650
lt's the most interest that girl's ever had
in a book depository.

79
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,100
McCann is buying P.P.L.,

80
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,030
and is absorbing Sterling Cooper
along with it.

81
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,120
-What?
-Conrad Hilton told me this morning.

82
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,450
Christ. From one john's bed to the next.
What a joke.

83
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,410
Don and l have been discussing the idea
that we buy the company back.

84
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,680
-Really? Why?
-Because we don't want to go to McCann.

85
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,600
And now you're sniffing around
because l have a golden pork chop

86
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,550
dangling from my neck.

87
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,650
lt's more than that.
You know Bert's done for.

88
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,060
Now it's about Bert, huh?

89
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,910
l want to see what you look like
with your tail between your legs.

90
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,810
You sold your birthright
so you could marry that trollop.

91
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,150
Here we go. This is your pitch?
Well, move along.

92
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,210
l'm not gonna throw it all away because
he doesn't want to work at McCann.

93
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,830
You want to work there?

94
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,410
You don't value what l do
any more than they do.

95
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,920
l was wrong. l learned that with Hilton.
l can sell ideas, but l'm not an account man.

96
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,800
You're not good at relationships,
because you don't value them.

97
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,550
-l value my relationship with you.
-You do now.

98
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,720
l do.

99
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,680
l'm sorry. l've got points, stock.

100
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,400
lf l'm useless, so be it.

101
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,690
There's a deck chair somewhere
with my name on it.

102
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,200
You're right, Roger. lf you've lost
your appetite, you should retire.

103
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,490
Of course, l've seen that before.
So have you. Men my age, even younger,

104
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,340
they play golf, go on vacation,
lose their appetite.

105
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,220
ln three years...

106
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,130
Join or die?
Jesus, Bert, he was doing better.

107
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,840
-You know it's true.
-You're still gonna outlive me.

108
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,020
We have to try.

109
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,320
So you do want to be
in advertising after all.

110
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,740
Go upstairs.

111
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,000
-Daddy just got home.
-l'll be up.

112
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,580
-Do you want me to go, too?
-Please sit down.

113
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,520
l made an appointment
with a divorce attorney,

114
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,850
and l suggest you do the same.

115
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,280
Come on, Betts.
What are you doing seeing a lawyer?

116
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,750
l want to be civilized about this.
Please don't act surprised.

117
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,820
You haven't been yourself.

118
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,370
Maybe you need to see a doctor.
A good one this time.

119
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,590
Because l'd have to be sick
to want out of this?

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,420
You've had a tough couple of weeks.
We all have.

121
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,130
l've had a tough year.

122
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,390
l felt l should tell you rather
than just let you get a phone call at work.

123
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,650
Well, forget it.
l'm not gonna let you break up this family.

124
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,990
l didn't break up this family.

125
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,580
Lane, please shut the door and have a seat.

126
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,000
Certainly.

127
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
We know McCann Erickson bought P.P.L.,

128
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,930
and we know that makes
Sterling Cooper chattel.

129
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,280
Who told you that?

130
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,100
Someone outside of this building
who knows.

131
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,520
Well, they're wrong.

132
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,780
Lane, we've worked next to each other
for a year.

133
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,900
Don't act like a stranger. We've got tea.

134
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,160
Well, l suppose
you'll find out soon enough,

135
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,830
but your information
isn't completely correct.

136
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,720
Only Sterling Cooper is being sold.
P.P.L., well, will remain P.P.L.

137
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,640
That doesn't change our plans.
We want to buy back the company.

138
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,350
We're willing to offer
the purchase price plus 1 2%.

139
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,510
-lt's worth more than that now.
-What did you get?

140
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,970
l'm not going to say, but more than that.

141
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,640
l apologize you had to find out this way.
Believe me, it wasn't my decision.

142
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,080
l've quite enjoyed it here.

143
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,170
Well, they've only got me for a year.
You for what? Three?

144
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,460
We'll make another run at it.

145
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,930
The only grounds for divorce in this state
are absence of a spouse,

146
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,220
incurable insanity,
life imprisonment or adultery.

147
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,510
Well, he hasn't been faithful.

148
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Do you have any witnesses
or corroboration?

149
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,970
Not really.

150
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,470
lt wouldn't matter anyway,
with both parties at fault.

151
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,820
-No. We haven't... We aren't...
-Ken. Ken, what are you doing?

152
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,490
You think the governor needs
another scandal on the ticket?

153
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,160
l am sorry for presuming, Mrs. Draper.
That was wrong.

154
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,880
-So what do l do?
-l know it's hard to understand,

155
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,050
but the state of New York
doesn't want anyone to get divorced.

156
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,090
That's why people go to Reno. lt's painless.

157
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,770
l met my second wife. You stay there
for six weeks to establish residency.

158
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,480
Mr. Draper doesn't even need to go,
just consent.

159
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,020
l see.

160
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,640
We need to discuss what you want
in terms of settlement.

161
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,900
-Whatever l'm entitled to.
-Give us a second.

162
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,500
-You don't need what he can provide.
-Henry, l have three children.

163
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,830
l'll take care of them,
and l'll take care of you.

164
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,010
l don't want you owing him anything.

165
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,250
We want to get this done
as soon as possible.

166
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,590
-Saint John, l'm glad l caught you.
-What is it?

167
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,230
Mr. Sterling, Cooper and Draper
have learned of the sale.

168
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,720
-What do they know?
-It was a mixture of truth and half truth.

169
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,890
They knew about McCann,
but they were under the belief

170
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,350
that P.P.L. was being sold as well.

171
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,690
-And what did you tell them?
-That they were wrong.

172
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,240
They even wanted to bid
for Sterling Cooper.

173
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,360
1 2% above our purchase price.

174
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,290
Listen, l apologize, Lane.
Obviously the news is getting out.

175
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,200
-What news?
-P.P.L. is being sold as well.

176
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,880
What? Why wasn't l told?

177
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,020
Didn't seem pertinent. Trying to keep
our company calm as well as theirs.

178
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,770
-Well, where's my place in this?
-With McCann, I suppose.

179
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,360
There, there, Lane. They know
you're essential to the transition.

180
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,440
-And then what?
-You'll prove yourself irreplaceable.

181
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,240
You always do.

182
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,070
Lane.

183
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,900
-Yes?
-Don't be disheartened.

184
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,200
-l'll put in a good word for you.
-Thank you.

185
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,780
No, thank you.

186
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,170
We've got a month till winter,
then we'll be set.

187
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,460
This is what l showed the man
from the bank today.

188
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,210
What are they gonna do? Sell this place?

189
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,470
The bank's gonna get their payday
right after me.

190
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,480
We got nothing,
and we're about to have less.

191
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,190
Fine! l'll sell.

192
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,020
l'll sell my crop for nothing. Dick.

193
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,190
-What are you doing?
-l'll drive it to Chicago tonight.

194
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,100
You're drunk.

195
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,330
Go. He can barely stand.

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,330
Calm down.

197
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,660
Whoa! Here.

198
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,510
Calm down.

199
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,300
lt ain't gonna rain.

200
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,020
Pa! Daddy! Daddy!

201
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Your guests have arrived.

202
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,770
Close the door. Have a seat.

203
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,410
-What's he doing here?
-You're gonna read us your will?

204
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,200
-l want the Cadillac.
-l couldn't sleep.

205
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,340
And l thought,
why don't we go to McCann directly?

206
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,710
-Because you can't. lt's done.
-You're not even gonna ask?

207
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,410
l did, yesterday.

208
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,460
And you were right. P.P.L. is being sold,
so it seems we're all going to McCann.

209
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,970
They cut you loose.

210
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,730
l want you to find out
what the price was and give us a shot.

211
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,860
Enough. l should fire you for even trying
to involve me in this conspiracy.

212
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,900
Go ahead.
lt's the only thing you did well here.

213
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,140
-Don, let it go.
-l did a great many things here.

214
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,980
Have another. lt's 9:30, for God's sake.

215
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,530
Jesus, that's right.

216
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,670
You have absolute authority to fire anyone.

217
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
Fire us.

218
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,840
Fire us. Sever our contracts. Let us go.

219
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,300
-Can you do that?
-Why would l?

220
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,230
Because once this sale goes through,

221
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,730
you'll be thrown overboard, and you'll be
a corpse knocking against their hull.

222
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,020
Nothing good ever came
from seeking revenge.

223
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,640
Nonsense. We'll make you a partner.

224
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,990
l should think this is worth more than that.

225
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,070
So we're negotiating.

226
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,250
-We'll put your name on the door.
-l don't know.

227
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,340
-Do you know how to do what he does?
-l don't.

228
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,770
lt could be done, but getting you, us,
out of here isn't the difficult part.

229
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,010
-We need accounts.
-Let's say we have Lucky Strike.

230
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,230
And although that's, let's see,
$23 million in billings...

231
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,680
Twenty-four.

232
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,740
-We'd still need another third for cash flow.
-Well, l can't take anyone else

233
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,950
or Lee Garner, Sr. won't think
that he's special. What about Hilton?

234
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,040
-No.
-Can we get any of our other accounts?

235
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,030
We'll get them.

236
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,800
lf l were to send a telex in at noon today
that you've all been sacked,

237
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,450
it's after close of business in London.

238
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,000
lt would remain unnoticed
until Monday morning there, 2:00 a.m. here.

239
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,170
That gives us today and the weekend
to first gather accounts

240
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,480
and then a skeleton staff to service them.
And of course we would have to obtain

241
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,940
all the materials required
for continuity of service.

242
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,930
Obtain? We have to steal everything.

243
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,950
Anyone approached must be a certainty.

244
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,660
lf news spreads, they'll lock us out.

245
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
Do we vote or something?

246
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,290
Well, gentlemen, l suppose you're fired.

247
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,220
We'll, it's official.
Friday, December 1 3th, 1 963.

248
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,090
Four guys shot their own legs off.

249
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,690
Allison, Mr. Pryce has requested
an office-wide memo.

250
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,190
"The office is closed this weekend.
All work suspended. Carpet cleaning."

251
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,410
-Can you get me Mr. Campbell?
-He didn't come in today. He's sick.

252
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,660
Call his house. lt's important.
Peggy, my office.

253
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,990
What do l bring?

254
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,040
Shut the door. Sit down.

255
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,000
l know we have to roll out Western Union
by New Year's.

256
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,340
-l don't have art. There's no one there.
-They're selling the company.

257
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,480
-Again?
-l'm starting a new agency.

258
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,970
l need you here Sunday evening
to get your things

259
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,100
and to help us collect
whatever accounts we end up taking.

260
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,640
-Really?
-Yes.

261
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,320
-Who else is going?
-Why do you need to know that?

262
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,610
-Because it's important.
-l can't tell you.

263
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,610
Peggy, we are being bought my McCann.
Do you know what that means?

264
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,490
You just assume l'll do whatever you say.

265
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,050
Just follow you like some nervous poodle.

266
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,170
-l'm not gonna beg you.
-Beg me? You didn't even ask me.

267
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,300
Fine, l'm asking you.

268
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,260
l've had other offers, you know,

269
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,110
that came with a sales pitch
about opportunity.

270
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,810
Everyone thinks you do all my work.

271
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,700
Even you.

272
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,200
l don't want to make a career out of being
there so you can kick me when you fail.

273
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,370
-l guess l'll have to talk to Kurt and Smitty.
-l guess so.

274
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,390
-Where the hell are my pajamas?
-Will you please relax?

275
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,480
Trudy, l called in sick today
because l had my interview with Ogilvy.

276
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,770
-l have to look sick.
-You do.

277
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,700
-What a pleasant surprise.
-Sorry to drop in.

278
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,740
-How are you?
-Better than my husband.

279
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,830
And how are you?
We've been calling all day.

280
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,430
-May l take your coats?
-We're fine.

281
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,510
l'm going to change the sheets.

282
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,030
-ls everything okay?
-McCann bought P.P.L., and us.

283
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,440
-What? Again?
-We need to talk to you. lt's serious.

284
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,000
We're not firing you.

285
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,420
Am l getting a few more adjectives
added to my title?

286
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,700
-Don't bother. l have other plans.
-Peter, may l speak to you for a moment?

287
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,470
Pete, we're starting a new agency.
We're here to talk to you about joining us.

288
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,020
Wait a minute. They're letting you go?

289
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,560
Keep it to yourself,
but l'm taking American Tobacco.

290
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,810
We need another 7-1 0 million in billings
for cash flow or something.

291
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,890
What do you have
in your saddlebag so far?

292
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,980
l don't have a saddlebag.
l don't know what you're talking about.

293
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,910
Pete, l don't blame you for bailing out,
the way you've been treated.

294
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,460
-So Kenny turned you down?
-We haven't spoken to Ken yet.

295
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,920
And yes, we want your accounts,
but we also want your talent.

296
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,330
Really? And what are my talents?

297
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,090
-You'll do what it takes.
-No.

298
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,420
l want to hear it from him.

299
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,430
lt's not hard for me to say, Pete.
You saw this coming. We didn't.

300
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,200
ln fact, you've been ahead
on a lot of things.

301
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,370
Aeronautics, teenagers, the negro market...

302
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,780
We need you to keep us looking forward.

303
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,870
l do, anyway.

304
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,370
l want to be a partner,
and l want my name in the lobby.

305
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,090
There's not gonna be a lobby.

306
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,680
North American Aviation, Secor Laxatives,
Gillette, jai alai, maybe Pampers.

307
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,810
That's close to 8 million already.
l don't think you get conditions.

308
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,570
We'll make you a partner
if you can deliver by Sunday.

309
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,860
Sunday?

310
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,080
We'll leave the name and the title as a goal.
Like it or not, that works with you.

311
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,040
l'd like to say l'll think about it,
but l don't think that's an option, is it?

312
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,750
l'm not really sick.

313
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,930
Welcome aboard.

314
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,230
-Good night, Trudy.
-Good night, gentlemen.

315
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,320
-What if l come up short?
-That's not an option.

316
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,360
Good night.

317
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,030
l want you to call Hubert Adams at Secor.
His number's in my Rolodex.

318
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,990
l threw it under the bed. Try him at home.

319
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,970
Tell him l'll meet him at the St. Regis at 7:30
and sound like a secretary.

320
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,970
l have to get dressed.

321
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,480
-l can't believe he was gonna leave.
-That little shit.

322
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Look, they still have a picture
of Kennedy up.

323
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:15,230
Although, what are they gonna do?
Take it down and put up Lyndon Johnson?

324
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,990
Not in this place.

325
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,650
l've acted like l've started a business
my whole life, but l inherited it.

326
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,450
l need an attorney.

327
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,420
-Divorce.
-So it's true, huh?

328
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,130
-What are you talking about?
-Henry Francis.

329
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,300
-Who?
-Jesus.

330
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,060
-Right when things were almost normal.
-l need you to tell me what you know.

331
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,350
Margaret's friends with his daughter.

332
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,860
-Are they sleeping together?
-l don't know.

333
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,750
lt came from his daughter.
He talks about her.

334
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,670
lt sounds like it's serious.
l was gonna tell you. No, l wasn't.

335
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,040
l thought you knew.

336
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,930
l'm sorry l told you. Believe me.

337
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,610
l am sorry about that.

338
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,530
Wake up.

339
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,360
-He's sleeping.
-l don't care.

340
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,700
Who the hell is Henry Francis?

341
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,290
No one.

342
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,430
-Stop it. Stop it!
-Who the hell is he?

343
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,210
-Why do you care?
-Because you're good,

344
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,630
and everyone else in the world is bad.

345
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,930
-You're drunk.
-You're so hurt.

346
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,060
So brave with your little white nose
in the air.

347
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,600
-All along you've been building a life raft.
-Get out.

348
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,100
-You never forgave me.
-Forgave what?

349
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,780
-That l've never been enough?
-You got everything you ever wanted.

350
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,860
Everything! And you loved it.

351
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,620
And now l'm not good enough
for some spoiled mainline brat?

352
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,160
That's right!

353
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,950
You won't get a nickel.

354
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,120
And l'll take the kids.
God knows they'll be better off.

355
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,080
l'm going to Reno,

356
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,670
and you're going to consent,
and that's the end of this.

357
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,310
Don't threaten me. l know all about you.

358
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,470
You're a whore.

359
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,640
You know that?

360
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,380
l want you out of the house.

361
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,260
Hold the elevator.

362
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,680
-They called you in, too?
-Yes, they did.

363
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,700
-l'll admit it. l'm a little scared.
-Of what?

364
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,500
-Why are you here?
-l don't know. Cooper called me.

365
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,630
First they're cleaning the carpets,
now they're not. Why are you here?

366
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,590
Work.

367
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,640
Hey, everybody, Harry Crane is here.

368
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,510
Relax, Pete, we're expecting him.

369
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,190
-What's going on?
-Why are you here?

370
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,650
l'm sorry, what's going on?

371
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,400
P.P.L. has been sold to McCann.
We're starting a new agency.

372
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,690
We'd like you to join us
as our new head of media.

373
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,080
-Are you kidding?
-Yes. Yes, we are. Happy birthday.

374
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,280
We need your answer.

375
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,330
-l should really call my wife.
-Mr. Crane... Harry.

376
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:47,000
This matter is secret and time-sensitive.
lf you turned us down and elect to be

377
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,760
a mid-level cog at McCann Erickson,

378
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,220
we'll have to lock you in the storeroom
until morning.

379
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,980
l'm sure you understand.

380
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,140
Pete.

381
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,640
We were hoping
you could decipher these job sheets.

382
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,440
-Where exactly are these materials?
-l never look at these.

383
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,250
Can't we just take everything?

384
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,620
That's good thinking,
but we don't know where anything is.

385
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,830
No one knows how this works?

386
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,420
Let me make a phone call.
l'll take care of this.

387
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,460
-No. No more conspirators.
-l'll be discreet.

388
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,140
Where's Don?

389
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,970
What did we do?

390
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,480
-Nothing.
-Then why are we in the living room?

391
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,740
We want to tell you something, because...

392
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,620
Well, it's going to be a little bit of a change.
Your father is going to be moving out.

393
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,830
Now, we'll still be living here,
and he'll come to visit.

394
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,210
-Then why is he going?
-Because...

395
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,850
lt'll just be temporary.

396
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,020
-Like when you lived in the hotel?
-Yes.

397
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,270
lt'll be different.

398
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,440
-ls it because l lost your cufflinks?
-No, it has nothing to do with you.

399
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,200
That's not what l mean.

400
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:42,490
-l love you both. You know that.
-Then why are you going?

401
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,830
l'm not going.

402
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,760
l'm just living elsewhere.

403
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,040
That's going.
You say things and you don't mean them,

404
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,300
-and you can't just do that.
-Sally, sweetheart.

405
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
-Go away.
-Sally, stop it.

406
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,400
You said you'd always come home.

407
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,930
l will.

408
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,240
lt's just a different home.

409
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,500
Will you be here for Christmas?

410
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,610
-You'll get to have two Christmases.
-l only want one.

411
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,030
Did you make him leave?

412
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,580
No. We both decided it.

413
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,550
You made him sleep in Gene's room,
and it's scary in there.

414
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,680
Listen to me, both of you.

415
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,970
l will be here. You can call me,
and l will answer and l will be here.

416
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,840
-Sally. Sally.
-Let her go.

417
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:46,470
Please don't go. l don't want you to.

418
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,200
Nobody wants to do this.

419
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,610
But l need you to be a big boy.

420
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,730
-You look awful.
-Can l come in?

421
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,410
Do you want anything?

422
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,990
Yes, l do.

423
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,620
You were right.

424
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,000
l've taken you for granted
and l've been hard on you,

425
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,060
but only because l think l see you
as an extension of myself.

426
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,980
And you're not.

427
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,020
-Well, thank you for stopping by.
-Please. Sit down.

428
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,910
Do you know why
l don't want to go to McCann?

429
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,710
Because you can't work for anyone else.

430
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,580
No.

431
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,770
Because there are people out there
who buy things, people like you and me,

432
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,940
and something happened.

433
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,770
Something terrible.

434
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,650
And the way that they saw themselves

435
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,570


is gone.

436
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,570
And nobody understands that.

437
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,370
But you do.

438
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,600
And that's very valuable.

439
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,350
ls it?

440
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,230
With you or without you, l'm moving on.

441
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,200
And l don't know if l can do it alone.

442
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,330
Will you help me?

443
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,950
What if l say no?

444
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,970
You'll never speak to me again.

445
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,920
No.

446
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,440
l will spend the rest of my life
trying to hire you.

447
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,730
Mrs. Harris, what a pleasure to see you.

448
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,660
-What is she doing here?
-l said l'd be discreet.

449
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,460
-Tell them what to do.
-l made a list and l called some movers.

450
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,920
Can you read these?
Do you know where this stuff is?

451
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,130
Yes. Of course you'll need the job bags
on all these accounts.

452
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,170
We'll also need logo files,
all the film we can find

453
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,420
-and negatives which aren't actually here.
-There you go.

454
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,720
Very good. Now l can pack.

455
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,380
-Sorry l'm late.
-Hi.

456
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,100
Joan. What a good idea.
Well, you're here. Who did you bring?

457
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,320
North American Aviation, Secor,
jai alai, Samsonite.

458
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,370
-Clearasil.
-Really?

459
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,540
-l made it.
-Where do we start?

460
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,790
-Well, l'd start in the art department.
-lt's locked.

461
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,370
Great.

462
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,720
l'll start in my office.

463
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,020
Joanie, l can't read your writing.

464
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,730
lt's perfectly clear. "Correspondence."

465
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,160
l'm tired.
Peggy, can you get me some coffee?

466
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,280
No.

467
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,870
Did you wash your hands?

468
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,240
Hold the elevator.

469
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,660
Greg is gonna kill me.

470
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,430
l'm at the Roosevelt,
but l'll need you to find me an apartment.

471
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,800
-Furnished?
-For the time being.

472
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,520
l'm sorry. Good night.

473
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,720
Go ahead, fellows.

474
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,790
How long do you think it'll take us
to be in a place like this again?

475
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,370
l never saw myself working
in a place like this.

476
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,260
Don't bother.

477
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,950
We've been robbed!

478
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,590
He's waiting on the line.
lt's his third attempt.

479
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,680
Saint John, how are you?

480
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,630
What in God's name
is going on over there?

481
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,590
l think at this point it should be very clear.

482
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,970
You're fired. You're fired for costing
this company millions of pounds.

483
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,520
You're fired for insubordination!
You're fired for lack of character!

484
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:53,520
Very good. Happy Christmas. Mr. Hooker.

485
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,450
l've been sacked. Please have my office
and things put in storage at this address.

486
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,280
-What's happened?
-You're a sharp boy. You'll figure it out.

487
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,580
So let's see.
l have Peggy and Pete sharing the desk.

488
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,930
Don, we'll replace one of these couches
with a table for you,

489
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,140
and we're adding
two additional phone lines.

490
