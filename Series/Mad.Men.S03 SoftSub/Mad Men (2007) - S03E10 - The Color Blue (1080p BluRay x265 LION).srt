1
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,480
-Butter.
-And the apples are good now,

2
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,850
but not from the market.

3
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,150
l can go to Rodney Farms on Sunday.
lt's near church.

4
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,980
-Can't we go to Rodney Farms?
-We'll see.

5
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,440
-Why don't we go to church?
-We go to church.

6
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,330
On Christmas. Carla goes every Sunday.

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,380
We don't need to go every week.

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,460
Anything else?

9
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,470
-lt's early. Do you want a drink?
-Yes.

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,970
-How was school today?
-Good.

11
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,090
How come you never ask me?

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,390
l do. lt's just your answer is always longer,
so l thought l would start with Sally.

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,720
When's Halloween?

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,470
Before Thanksgiving.
Francine and Carlton have invited us,

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,020
but l think if we're going to be
selling Daddy's house,

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,950
l don't know, it might be nice
to have it there one last time.

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,780
Are you going to sleep here tonight?

18
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,450
No.

19
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,340
You're working too much.

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,380
-Betts, l don't have a choice.
-No, that's not what l mean. l just...

21
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,710
l see how hard you're working.

22
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,670
Hello.

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
lnside.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,480
-Were you grading papers?
-Why?

25
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,790
l don't know if you're hungry,
but l made date nut bread.

26
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,330
Actually, l made three. Bake sale.

27
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,620
Your service called.
Mr. Hilton was looking for you,

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,590
but he's probably in the air right now.

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,180
Thanks, Miss Farrell. That's good to know.

30
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,810
l thought so.

31
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,890
l want you to spend the whole night.

32
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,180
You couldn't possibly be asleep already.

33
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,940
This eight-year-old, Charlie,

34
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,050
looked up at me during art today and said,

35
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,700
"How do l know if what l see as blue
is the same as it is to you?"

36
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,730
What did you say?

37
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,950
The truth. l don't know.

38
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,250
l never have,

39
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,290
but l love that he made me
think about that again.

40
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,090
What would you have said?

41
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,930
l would have told Charlie

42
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,420
that my job is about

43
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,550
boiling down communication
to its essentials,

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,770
and that l know that there is a blue

45
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,530
that at least 45% of the population
sees as the same.

46
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,480
Maybe half those people think
they're looking at yellow.

47
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,400
Maybe, but the truth is,
people may see things differently,

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,290
but they don't really want to.

49
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,420
Do you feel bad about what you do?

50
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,470
Nobody feels as good about what they do
as you do.

51
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,010
That's sweet.

52
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,350
l wish l could've known you at eight.
l bet you were serious.

53
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,690
And l would've liked you.

54
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,240
Long curly hair.

55
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,830
No one has it anymore.

56
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,260
-Why don't you take her?
-Because l said no.

57
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,390
-You'd rather not go than go with me?
-What do you think Mr. Draper would say

58
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,260
if you showed up at the Sterling Cooper
40th with his secretary?

59
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,550
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,180
-Coffee?
-Morning, Don.

61
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,070
Morning, fellas. Yes.

62
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,810
-Aqua Net, 9:00.
-Get Peggy.

63
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,450
Don, if you could stand over there.

64
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,030
lt's Paul Kinsey theater.

65
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,450
This was my thought.

66
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,830
Aqua Net is about hold,
but it's also about beauty.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,050
So, we're driving. Two couples.
l call it "Double Date."

68
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,970
The woman in the back's scarf blows off
and her hair starts blowing.

69
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,890
-Her hairdo falls apart.
-Oh, no!

70
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,310
And then the woman in front
takes off her scarf

71
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,600
and hands it back to the woman in the back.

72
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,850
-Take mine.
-And he says, "Are you sure, Marcia?"

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Marcia's hair is perfect.

74
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,150
And then her date gives her
a knowing smile of admiration

75
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,110
on her confident smile.

76
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,360
"Aqua Net. Arrive in style."

77
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,860
Too much story.
Every time l hear, "And then,"

78
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,870
there's another chance
for the ladies at home to misunderstand.

79
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,880
What if it's just the two couples,
the wind is blowing,

80
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,090
the woman in the back
has to put on her kerchief

81
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,590
and she just looks longingly
at Miss Perfect in front?

82
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,600
-Okay.
-"Arrive in style" still works.

83
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,260
And at the end,
you could see the can with a kerchief,

84
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,850
like a see-through one over it

85
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,010
and the wind blows it off
to reveal the Aqua Net.

86
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,850
A kerchief in a can?

87
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,200
Don't use that, but very nice.

88
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,060
Well, great, then.

89
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,950
-What do you have for Western Union?
-We don't meet until next week.

90
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,860
Hilton takes precedence,

91
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,030
so l need you two to be ready for me
at a moment's notice.

92
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,700
And it has to be TV
to compete with the phone company.

93
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,880
l love getting telegrams,
but l never send them.

94
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,590
How is that supposed to help?

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,140
l've got it.

96
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,550
My goodness. This is where everyone is.

97
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,760
Allison, my dear, do you mind?

98
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,900
All the paperwork is through
on your contract.

99
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,690
lt is my pleasure
to deliver your signing bonus personally.

100
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,990
You see, l don't just fire people.

101
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,750
So we finally have an answer
to the question,

102
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,490
"What makes Don Draper smile?"
$5,000 seems to be the number.

103
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,090
l don't know why it took two months.

104
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,580
Will your amigo Connie Hilton
be attending the anniversary party Friday?

105
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,170
-ln his dressiest Stetson.
-Splendid.

106
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,760
You will be speaking last.
lt's prime time. Please prepare.

107
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,090
l'm sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Pryce, your wife is here

108
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,180
and has requested
your attention immediately.

109
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,020
-Where?
-Your office.

110
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,560
-What's going on?
-l'll find out.

111
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,150
No, it's okay.

112
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,040
-Mr. Kinsey to see you.
-What was that?

113
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,370
Thank you, Olive. What?

114
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,570
l don't need you to put your little swirl
on top of my idea.

115
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,870
-No one's keeping score.
-l am.

116
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,300
And every time we work together,
it looks like you carried the load

117
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,300
because you're spontaneous,
and you're a girl,

118
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,800
and you're his favorite
and you use Aqua Net.

119
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,380
-Are you nuts? He hates me.
-That's rich.

120
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,600
Wearing a dress isn't gonna help you
with Western Union.

121
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,730
You do your work. l'll do mine.
Let the chips fall where they may.

122
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,360
Mrs. Pryce, your water.

123
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,200
-Thank you ever so much, John.
-Will there be anything else?

124
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,990
-He's such a toad.
-He is. He is. Darling, please, sit down.

125
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,710
No. l'm not going to let you force me
to do anything anymore.

126
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,000
Am l to entertain
your ballad of dissatisfaction,

127
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,010
or has something actually happened?
Because l am at work, dear.

128
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,890
l'm so sorry.

129
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,470
l went to pick up my gown.

130
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,020
The queue for the taxi was 1 0 long
with those fat ladies in their furs.

131
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,190
Finally l think l'm en route,
but l see the park,

132
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,850
and l insist it's the wrong direction,

133
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,650
and he's obviously running up my fare,
which he was.

134
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,950
-l'm so sorry, darling.
-l had to stop here

135
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,690
because l'd already taken
a $2.25 tour of Harlem

136
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,820
-and that was all the money l had.
-We'll get you home right away.

137
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,880
Do you have enough cash
to get me to London?

138
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,090
Because this is not my home.

139
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,580
-These things take time.
-Not for you.

140
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,560
lf a superior demands that you be happy,
you say, "Yes, sir. Right away, sir."

141
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,140
Go on. Let's have it all, shall we?

142
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,480
You like it here.

143
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,560
The smells and the noise
and the criminals at every level.

144
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,150
l have made the best of this.

145
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,980
My salary is good.
The company is flourishing.

146
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,280
My wife has a beautiful gown.

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,830
May l see it?

148
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,360
lt's not London.

149
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,420
-lt's not even England.
-That's true.

150
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,750
l've been here 1 0 months
and no one's ever asked me

151
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,700
where l went to school.

152
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,090
-l want to scream.
-Don't.

153
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,960
Roll over.

154
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,480
-Just a minute!
-Why did you answer?

155
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,500
l had to see you.

156
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,360
l called you from the bus station
in New Haven

157
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,030
before l started hitching.
You never answered.

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,370
l'm so sorry. Can you give me a minute?

159
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,300
-lt's my brother.
-Get rid of him for 1 5 minutes. l'll run out.

160
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,220
No, it's okay, Don. Come outside.

161
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,400
No. So there's a man in here.
He doesn't need to know it's me.

162
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,900
l want you to meet him.

163
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,810
l don't want to ruin this.

164
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,950
lt's okay.

165
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,580
l promise.

166
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,970
Danny, l'd like you to meet my friend Don.

167
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,930
-Sorry to interrupt.
-Danny, be polite.

168
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,100
l really am sorry.

169
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,720
-What happened there?
-ls it bad under there? Are you hungry?

170
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,270
-No.
-Well, l should be going.

171
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,770
Listen, l know what it looks like,
but l'm not a junkie.

172
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,780
Although apparently l'm too dangerous
to push a cart in a public library.

173
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,620
-He has fits.
-l'm sorry.

174
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,790
l interrupted you. lt's a nice night.

175
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,800
-l'll see you in the morning, Suzy.
-Stop it.

176
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
-l wish you the best.
-You don't even know me.

177
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,440
-l'll call you.
-Tomorrow.

178
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,990
He could've just stayed
inside your bedroom.

179
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,340
l wanted you two to meet.
You're my baby brother.

180
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,840
Well, he knows how to leave a room.
Reminds me of Mom.

181
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,600
-He's just very private.
-He's arrogant. His plans were interrupted.

182
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,390
You don't know him.

183
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,060
l'm going to get you anotherjob.
Someplace safe.

184
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,180
Safe.

185
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,850
Other people are the problem.
Name such a place.

186
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,370
People are ignorant.

187
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,540
They're scared of things
they don't understand.

188
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,750
l'm really hungry.

189
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,390
1 923. We were giddy.

190
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,430
We didn't know the soup
was gonna hit the fan,

191
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,190
-but we made it through.
-All these guys are dead.

192
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,760
Except you, of course.

193
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,020
And Doug Thompson, but l wish he were.
He let me eat a whole roll of Bolls Laxatives.

194
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,120
l thought they were candies.
l want him to show up and keel over.

195
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,150
Damn it.
l don't want to go to another funeral.

196
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,320
Well, l'm not really gonna kill him.
l just would like to, that's all.

197
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,030
Fortieth anniversary.
Forty would be an insignificant year

198
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,830
were it not the average lifespan
of a man in this business.

199
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,750
l don't think it's a bad idea to have a chance
to out-drink your clientele.

200
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,520
Who am l kidding?
l don't want to go either.

201
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,220
Have to watch Don Draper
accept an award for his humanity?

202
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,430
-Don is important.
-You know, l found that guy

203
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,770
working in a fur company, night school.

204
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,060
And that girl, Betty.

205
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,740
l remember Mona said they looked like
they were on top of our wedding cake.

206
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,790
-Screw him.
-Have the party without me. l can't do it.

207
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,950
l won't.

208
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,130
Okay. Okay.

209
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,510
lt's just a party. lf you don't want to go,
you don't have to go.

210
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,590
lt's not like
it's our company anymore anyway.

211
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,310
My God. Remember her?

212
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,220
It's 100,000 bucks...

213
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,820
-Can l?
-lf you do it right.

214
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,740
Hello, Draper residence.

215
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,540
Hello?

216
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,670
There's nobody there. They hanged up.

217
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,240
Hang it up.

218
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,720
Why'd they hang up?

219
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Probably a wrong number.
People do it all the time.

220
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,050
But l could hear somebody
and they heard me.

221
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,310
My goodness, Sally Draper,
try not to take everything so personally.

222
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,510
Jeez Louise.

223
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,370
The phone is cheap.
lt's everyday, and you can't trust it.

224
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,310
The telegraph is honest and solid and clear.
lt's old, but it's good.

225
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,980
Traditional.

226
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,810
Sorry about that, Olive.

227
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,850
Peggy.

228
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,350
-Peggy!
-Hello?

229
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,980
-Did you see a girl come through here?
-No, sir.

230
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,540
-l'm Paul, by the way.
-l'm Achilles.

231
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,870
Achilles. Well, hello, Achilles.

232
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,830
-Are you okay?
-Are you Greek?

233
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,680
-l'm an American citizen.
-No, of course.

234
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,010
lt's just, that's a mighty big name.

235
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,010
-How did that happen?
-Well, it's been in my family for generations.

236
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,720
When we have a party
and someone says, "Achilles,"

237
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,020
all the men turn their heads.

238
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,490
-ln fact, one Christmas...
-Hush.

239
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,370
l've got it.

240
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,690
You've got what?

241
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,610
Achilles, l have thought of something
very, very good.

242
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,950
-Glad to hear it.
-lt's truly great news.

243
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,880
-Yeah, your whole face changed.
-Did it?

244
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,050
Well, l think l shall sleep
very soundly tonight. l wish you the same.

245
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,430
ls that taken?

246
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,760
Hey.

247
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,850
l'll only stay for a stop.
l tried to catch you on the platform.

248
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,430
-What are you doing here?
-l needed to talk to you.

249
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,520
Did you call my house last night?

250
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,540
No, l didn't.

251
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,450
-This was a mistake.
-Sit down.

252
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,660
l'm sorry.

253
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,210
You said you'd call me.

254
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,560
Your brother is there.

255
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,780
l don't care about your marriage
or your work or any of that,

256
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,820
as long as l know you're with me.

257
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,030
l'm sorry.

258
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,050
l got him a job
at the VA Hospital in Bedford.

259
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,350
He'll be pushing a broom,
but it has nice grounds.

260
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,300
You can come by tonight. He'll be gone.

261
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,690
-Are you sure?
-Stop it.

262
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:23,980
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!

263
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,280
lt was nice meeting you.

264
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,720
Mr. Kinsey.

265
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,900
Paul!

266
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,860
Sorry to wake you. lt's 9:00 a.m.

267
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,730
-Good morning, Lois.
-Good morning.

268
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,320
l need you to type something for me.

269
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,010
-Were you in here before?
-No.

270
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,090
-So you haven't touched anything?
-No.

271
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,020
You do that sometimes.

272
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,270
-What was it?
-Does it look like l know?

273
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,700
l wrote it down.

274
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,490
l know l wrote it down.

275
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,110
Did you find it?
lt's always the last place you look.

276
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,880
My mother always said
to retrace your steps if you lost something.

277
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,090
Good God, would you shut up?

278
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,210
"ln conclusion,
with the help of Sterling Cooper,

279
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,470
"its ingenuity and influence,

280
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,670
"America is teaching business
to the world."

281
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,150
Very rousing, sir.

282
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,850
Churchill rousing or Hitler rousing?

283
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,650
Mr. Pryce's office.

284
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,740
Just a moment, please.

285
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,830
London calling. Mr. Ford.

286
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,800
-Harold.
-Just calling for a status report

287
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,420
on our little party.

288
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,540
All is well, although as of late,
Bert Cooper will be in absentia.

289
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,960
Well, that won't do.

290
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,390
We're flying across the pond.
We expect all the flowers in the vase.

291
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,480
-What does that mean?
-Look, Lane,

292
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,050
we've had interest in the company
for some months

293
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,720
and this party is essential
to attracting a second suitor.

294
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,520
For what purpose?

295
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,520
Did we reach you at a bad time?
You seem foggy.

296
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,980
-Saint John here.
-Hello.

297
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,150
Lane, Sterling Cooper is for sale.

298
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,870
But why?

299
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,700
We've reduced the staff
and increased the revenue by 22%.

300
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,710
l think you've answered your own question.
We need this party to encourage interest.

301
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,550
-Do your best, lad.
-Yes, of course.

302
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,150
-Are you quite all right, sir?
-Yes. That'll be all.

303
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,920
Henry Francis, please. lt's Betty Draper.

304
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,460
How are you? What a nice surprise.

305
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,340
l was wondering
if you called my home last night.

306
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,270
No. No, l didn't.

307
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,980
Well, we had a hang-up.
l thought it might be you.

308
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,890
Really?

309
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
l'm terribly embarrassed.

310
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,370
Do you want me to call you?

311
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,030
-No.
-But you thought it was me.

312
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,920
What are you laughing at?

313
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,210
l didn't call you and l'm not going to,
but if you're gonna call me, call me.

314
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,830
Don't make up excuses.

315
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,090
l'm not playing a game here.

316
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,520
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Betty.

317
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,480
Try to look at this
from Monica's point of view.

318
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,140
-Do you mind? This is rather serious.
-Go ahead.

319
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,520
Monica wants to get married
with or without Jimmy...

320
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,980
lt has come to my attention

321
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,500
that you're not attending
the Sterling Cooper 40th anniversary.

322
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,580
l wouldn't have told Roger
if l planned on it remaining a secret.

323
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,040
ln Great Britain

324
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,260
we have a good deal of testimonials,

325
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,550
and the senior members
are all equally unenthused.

326
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,300
lt marks the passage of time.
lt's painful, l imagine.

327
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,180
l didn't get to where l am
by dwelling on the past.

328
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,440
So think of the future,
all of our clients, all of our staff,

329
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,030
the press, newspapers
and trade publications.

330
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,240
Enjoy the fruit of your longevity.

331
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,700
You really pour the honey on,
then you lick it off.

332
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,160
Well, if you care about
Sterling Cooper at all,

333
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,220
remember that your absence
will make everyone think you are ill.

334
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,060
Who told you l was vain?

335
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,440
Please.

336
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,270
lt's obvious.

337
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,220
l want to show Mommy. Mommy!

338
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,710
-Maybe she's not here.
-Carla.

339
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,350
-Are you feeling all right?
-l'm fine.

340
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,140
l want you to take the children to the park.
Don't come home...

341
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,360
Just... Dinnertime would be perfect.
Take them to the library.

342
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,410
Hello.

343
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,380
l'm glad to see you.

344
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,550
Sorry again.

345
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:47,260
We were gonna leave after school
and l am still here, obviously.

346
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:52,060
You want to wait here for me?
He has to report tomorrow.

347
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,010
Let me do it. Let me drive him.

348
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,400
-Where are you going again?
-Bedford, Mass.

349
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,270
-lt's a long drive, Don.
-And you'll have to come back alone.

350
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,690
Let me do this for you.

351
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,900
l don't want to say goodbye up there.
lt's gonna come out ungrateful.

352
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,550
There's $375 there, okay?

353
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,090
How many times have you done this?

354
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Don't you need to gas up?

355
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,400
-No, we're fine.
-So you're not gonna stop?

356
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,830
Do you need to stop?

357
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,800
l have some movie in my head
where l give you the slip,

358
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,340
but l might as well tell you.
l'm not going to Bedford.

359
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,670
Well, l am, so l guess you kind of have to.

360
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,020
Why do you care?
You're just gonna go back and screw her.

361
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,850
l don't know
if you're capable of understanding,

362
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,620
-but that job is important.
-Did you get me the job?

363
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,830
-No.
-So shut up.

364
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,540
l'm not retarded.
Julius Caesar had epilepsy. He ran Rome.

365
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,780
Things didn't turn out so well for him.

366
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,910
l know what's waiting for me at that place.
l'm 25 years old, Don.

367
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,800
l don't want to be cleaning toilets
until l die.

368
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,220
Just pull over.

369
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,810
-Hold on.
-What?

370
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,910
l'm older than you,

371
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,870
and l'm telling you it seems bad now,
but you can still change things.

372
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:27,280
-Pull myself up by the bootstraps?
-Does that just sound stupid to you?

373
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,970
How do l explain this?

374
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,300
l can't do anything that you can do.

375
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:42,050
Everyone knows, sooner or later,
that there's something wrong with me.

376
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,190
They're kind and they try,

377
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,480
but then when l come to
with piss in my pants,

378
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,560
they stare at me
like l'm from another planet.

379
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
l am afflicted, okay?

380
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,360
lt's not a question of will.
l can't change that.

381
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,120
-Do you need money?
-Always.

382
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,790
l swore to myself
l would try to do this right once.

383
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,290
Do what?

384
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,810
l want you to call me if you ever need to.

385
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,220
And l want you to remember,

386
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,190
if something happens to you,
your sister will never forgive herself.

387
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,320
You're not gonna tell her, are you?

388
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,700
That l let you out
20 miles outside of Framingham?

389
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,160
Take care.

390
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,090
l know he thought l was passing him off,
but he means the world to me.

391
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,970
He knows that.

392
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,070
What was the place like?

393
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,610
-Nice.
-Bullshit.

394
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,030
He'll be as good as he can be.

395
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,930
Don, l don't want to.

396
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,670
l don't.

397
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,270
lt's okay.

398
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,790
-Coffee?
-No.

399
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,750
Can you get my wife on the phone?

400
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,930
-Betty.
-Where were you last night?

401
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,090
-l told you, l was with Hilton.
-Well, l must have forgotten.

402
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,390
Well, did you remember
to pick up my tuxedo?

403
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,550
Yesterday. lt's in the closet.

404
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,100
I'll get home at 5:30.
We should leave within the hour.

405
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,570
l don't know.
l don't know if l'm going to go.

406
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,020
-What's wrong?
-"What's wrong?"

407
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,190
"What's wrong?"

408
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,500
l don't feel well.

409
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,830
Get into bed and grab a hot water bottle.
You have seven hours.

410
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,370
It's all the clients and all the partners,
and they're all expecting me to show up

411
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,750
with the glamorous, elegant,
stunning Betty Draper.

412
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,930
l want to show you off, Betts.

413
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,430
Okay.

414
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,030
You ready? Don's expecting us.

415
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,820
l've got nothing.

416
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,730
-What a relief. Mine's garbage, too.
-No, l had something,

417
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,120
something incredible, but l lost it.

418
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,370
l didn't write it down.

419
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,710
-l hate that.
-lt might've been the best idea l ever had.

420
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,500
l did everything. l talked to Achilles.

421
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,170
l spent last night recreating
every detail of the evening,

422
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,300
hoping it would come back.

423
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,600
You know how it is.
There was nothing and then there was it,

424
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,100
-and now it's nothing again.
-l'm so sorry.

425
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:28,160
-How do you talk to Achilles?
-He's a janitor with a very bad memory.

426
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,450
You know what the Chinese say?

427
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,710
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory."

428
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,330
Come on. We've failed before.

429
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,630
Okay, we really looked for advantages.

430
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,060
One of them is,
phone calls happen every day.

431
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,560
A telegram's a big deal.
Something like, "She's getting married.

432
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,400
"Are you really just going
to give her a call?"

433
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,320
Sounds like you're talking to her parents.
They should really be at that wedding.

434
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,570
Also, old people love them.

435
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,670
-"When you care, send one there."
-That's a slogan, not an idea. Paul?

436
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,250
-Mine aren't any better.
-Damn it, Kinsey. What's your excuse?

437
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,130
-Don't yell at him.
-Excuse me?

438
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,210
Tell him what happened.

439
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,010
No.

440
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,690
The dog ate my homework.
l had a great idea and l lost it.

441
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,400
l didn't write it down.

442
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,690
l hate when that happens.

443
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,570
l keep thinking about that Chinese thing
you said. What was it?

444
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,870
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory."

445
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:04,540
lt just makes me think...
You call someone on the phone,

446
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,250
"Hello, l'm getting married"
or, "Congratulations on the baby,"

447
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,380
and then you hang up. lt's gone.

448
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:19,090
lt's different if you send a telegram.
A telegram is permanent.

449
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,010
Something like, "A telegram is forever."

450
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,810
"You can't frame a phone call."

451
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,240
My God.

452
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,900
That's the way to go.
You two keep working on that.

453
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,000
When do you want it?

454
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,240
The party's tonight. Monday.

455
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,550
See? lt all works out.

456
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,440
Betts, are you ready?

457
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,560
-The car's downstairs.
-The driver's Chinese.

458
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,690
Ready, Betts?

459
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,280
Look how pretty Mommy is.

460
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,210
-Where are we going?
-The WaldorfAstoria, Mummy.

461
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,010
Well, then we passed it.
lt's on Fifth Avenue.

462
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,300
lt's on Park. Moved years ago.

463
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,710
That's right. That's right.
When did they ever do that?

464
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,760
Enjoy the world as it is, Margaret.

465
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,110
They'll change it
and never give you a reason.

466
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,930
Mummy, she's not Margaret, she's Jane.
She's my wife.

467
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,780
-Does Mona know?
-Yes, she knows.

468
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,050
You seem surprised that there's traffic.
There's always traffic.

469
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,170
Calm yourself. We'll arrive when we arrive.

470
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,250
-They're selling the company.
-What?

471
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,560
They're selling Sterling Cooper.

472
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:29,150
-When?
-l have no idea.

473
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,640
-What happens to the Americans?
-They'll go to the highest bidder.

474
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,770
l know you hate uncertainty,

475
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:44,620
but take comfort in the fact
that we'll return to England.

476
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,680
I'm gonna keep going on
and make Don Draper wait,

477
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,250
because God knows
we've all waited for him.

478
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,230
As if being decorated
for his service in Korea weren't enough,

479
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,400
his career has yielded even more awards.

480
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:16,600
The American Association ofAdvertising
Agencies' Arthur Kudner Award,

481
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,900
Printers' Ink magazine's
advertising gold medal,

482
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:24,980
the Advertising Writers Association
of New York... l'm not reading all of these.

483
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,670
He's loyal, charming, quiet but not modest.
Why should he be?

484
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,880
We have to thank his beautiful wife, Betty,

485
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,090
and his three children,
for sharing him with us,

486
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,060
because as we all know, sometimes
Sterling Cooper has gotten the lion's share.

487
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,270
Bert Cooper and my father,
Roger Sterling Sr.,

488
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,350
bravely set this in motion 40 years ago.

489
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,610
And now let me introduce the man

490
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,690
who will stand alongside me
for the next 40 years,

491
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:02,850
our creative director, partner,
father, husband

492
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,120
and friend, Donald Draper.

493
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,300
Please. Please.

494
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,890
Please.

495
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,480
l'm very honored.
