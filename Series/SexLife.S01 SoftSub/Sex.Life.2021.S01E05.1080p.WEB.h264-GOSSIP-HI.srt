00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,350
Okay. Fine.

174
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,561
- Let's do it.
- Okay, great.

175
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,229
- Great.
- Great.

176
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,320
- No fucking way.
- Please, Sash.

177
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,156
You want me to lie to Cooper,
nicest guy on the planet?

178
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,617
He doesn't trust me.
He's obsessing over Brad.

179
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,079
- Oh, he's obsessing?
- He thinks we're having an affair.

180
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,664
- Are you?
- [scoffs]

181
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,915
No.

182
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,127
But Cooper doesn't believe me,
so he needs to hear it from you.

183
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,672
What? That my ex-fuck-buddy
is actually my dream come true.

184
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,006
Prince Fucking Charming.

185
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,510
If he thinks you guys are dating,
that Brad is off the market...

186
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,304
So you plan to earn back
your husband's trust

187
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,806
by having us lie to him?

188
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,518
Nah. That doesn't seem crazy at all.

189
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,980
You promised this would stop, B.

190
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,608
It will, I swear. I...

191
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,444
This will make it stop.

192
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,988
You know how you sound, right?

193
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:26,328
Let's say for one second that I buy
into the batshittiness of your logic.

194
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,876
Are you sure putting Cooper and Brad
in the same room together is a good idea?

195
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,881
He doesn't know everything that went down
with you guys, how intense things got.

196
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:41,802
- Well, what he read was pretty intense.
- I'm not just talking about the sex.

197
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,139
So much happened between you two.

198
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,349
Real history.

199
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,268
I know.

200
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,105
And what about you?

201
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,485
Are you gonna be okay
being in the same room as him?

202
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,196
I... I have to be.

203
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:07,870
Fine.

204
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,957
I'll get Brad to do it,
but just remember what he did to you.

205
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,458
Remind yourself.

206
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,837
Wear it like a suit of armor
'cause this guy is your kryptonite.

207
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,762
Nanogenics is the future
of modern cancer therapy,

208
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,016
improving the probability of survival
while delivering returns

209
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,727
the VC world has not seen
since the WhatsApp acquisition.

210
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,979
Now, this is a unique opportunity

211
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,316
to make a real difference
in millions of people's lives.

212
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,486
And we're hoping you see it that way too.

213
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,823
Hmm?

214
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,616
That's impressive.

215
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,617
Yeah?

216
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,620
I don't know, maybe I could
cut out a little sooner, or...

217
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,330
No, no. It's perfect as is.

218
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,498
Really?

219
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,919
You've got principles, Connelly.

220
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,587
They shine right through.

221
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,340
- I don't know about that.
- I do.

222
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,554
Last year I closed the UniBank merger

223
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,348
and got the highest bonus
of any woman at Goldman.

224
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,352
And everyone told me that was my moment,
and I believed them.

225
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,687
That sounds incredible.

226
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:21,068
But then, I saw this article
about a start-up 3D bio-printing company

227
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:25,573
that could make organ replacement
affordable all over the world,

228
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:32,162
and I realized
my moment of success was a total fail.

229
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,789
What are you talking about?

230
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:42,499
I started in this business with a dream
that I could change the world with money.

231
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,303
Instead, the money changed me.

232
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,847
And I let that dream go.

233
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,058
But the guy in that article?

234
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,270
He still had that dream.

235
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,148
And he was making it real.

236
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,153
That was my first interview.
Might be my last.

237
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,739
- That company still hasn't made a dime.
- Oh, they will.

238
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,825
At least, they better.
I bought a thousand shares.

239
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,327
[tender music playing]

240
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:17,124
You're the reason I quit my job
and came here to do this kind of work.

241
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,294
So... thanks.

242
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,545
Yeah.

243
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:27,426
I'll tee the partners up at dinner,
and tomorrow you seal the deal.

244
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,344
[Cooper] Mmm.

245
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,512
- They're gonna love you.
- Well, we'll see.

246
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,221
Come on.

247
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,684
What's not to love about Cooper Connelly?

248
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,281
[keyboard clacking]

249
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,369
[Billie] <i>A suit of armor?
Made up of all the bad stuff Brad did?</i>

250
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,163
<i>That should be easy.</i>

251
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,751
[speaking indistinctly]

252
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>Some people hold grudges.</i>

253
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,259
<i>It's a survival mechanism,
the only benefit to bad experience.</i>

254
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,223
<i>But me? I forget all the bad stuff.</i>

255
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,309
<i>Until I don't.</i>

256
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,153
- [elevator dings]
- [doors open]

257
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Hey.

258
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,334
There you are.

259
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,418
What's wrong?

260
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,381
I'm late.

261
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,844
For what?

262
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,401
Well, have you taken it yet?

263
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,072
I was too scared.

264
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,409
Well, if you are...

265
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,374
What are you gonna do about it?

266
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,214
Oh, my God.

267
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,174
Of course.

268
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,678
- Of course.
- Of course, what?

269
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,437
It's not just me, okay? It's us.

270
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,066
What are we gonna do about it?

271
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,193
Billie, come on.

272
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,571
We don't want this.

273
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,618
You've got at least two years left
on your PhD. You don't want this.

274
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,495
[dramatic music playing]

275
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,578
Okay.

276
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,125
But what if I...? What if I do?

277
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,045
Billie...

278
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,549
No.

279
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,973
If you didn't,
maybe you should have been more careful.

280
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,058
Oh.

281
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,604
- But you're never careful, about anything.
- What did you expect?

282
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,732
You know about my family, all right?

283
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,111
What makes you think I know
the first thing about being a father?

284
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,989
- Of course I don't want it.
- Of course. Of course. Of course.

285
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,783
- Billie, wait.
- Yeah. No.

286
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,663
You know, you are doing exactly
what your stepdad said you would do.

287
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,082
What you said
that you didn't wanna do with me.

288
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,543
You are running
at the first sign of trouble.

289
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,962
- I'm not running!
- Yes, you fucking are!

290
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,339
[Cooper] <i>Billie!</i>

291
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,934
Hi.

292
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,736
We need to leave in ten minutes.

293
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,072
Okay, sure.

294
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,996
[indistinct chatter]

295
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,708
Good evening.
Would you like to order drinks?

296
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,421
Uh, no, thanks.
We're still waiting on our guests here.

297
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,591
- Maybe just some water, please.
- Of course.

298
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,185
Hudson's been doing so well at drop-off.

299
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,688
I think he's really starting
to like school.

300
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,441
Thank you.

301
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,193
And, um...

302
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,656
Miss Brenda said that he shared
his snack with Hannah today.

303
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,283
[chuckles] He... Thank you.

304
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,745
He might have a little crush on her.
At least he's got good taste in girls.

305
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,080
Billie, please. Just stop.

306
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,166
[clears throat] You're trying
to make this normal,

307
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,210
and nothing about this is normal.

308
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,420
[cell phone buzzing]

309
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,221
Francesca, hey.
Listen, how's it going with the partners?

310
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:27,559
Hey, where are you?
Can you get back into the city, like, now?

311
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,937
- Um...
- [clears throat]

312
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:35,525
I'm just at a dinner right now.
What's going on? I can come in afterwards.

313
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,402
I've been talking you up all night,

314
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,156
and now everyone wants
to hear from the genius himself.

315
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,824
[chuckles] You're kidding me.

316
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,870
I'm doing my best, but I can't rattle off
the impressive details like you can.

317
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,955
Oh, well...

318
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,167
Plus, face time with the brass
could be great exposure for you.

319
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,251
What do you say?

320
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,089
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

321
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,092
<i>- Great. See you soon.</i>
- All right? See you.

322
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,263
[clears throat]

323
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,058
You're going into the city? Tonight?

324
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,893
They're here.

00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,503
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hi.

328
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,090
- You good?
- Yeah. Yes, I'm good.

329
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,009
- Coop!
- My God, Billie.

330
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,052
So great to see you again.

331
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,525
- Um, this is my husband.
- Yeah, we've met.

332
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,862
- Oh, right. That's right, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

333
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,240
Okay. Um... Let's sit.

334
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,491
- Yes?
- Yeah.

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,459
Coop. I missed you, man.

336
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,087
Me too, Sash. It's been way too long.

337
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,089
Did you guys find your way okay?

338
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,758
- Oh, yeah.
- [Brad] Super easy.

339
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:27,054
We were on my bike,
so we just slipped in and out of traffic.

340
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,851
Sasha's always had a thing
for motorcycles.

341
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,103
You know me. I love danger.

342
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,482
We appreciate
you guys making the trip out.

343
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,610
It's funny,
I never pictured you in the suburbs...

344
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,862
but seeing it now...

345
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,243
I really do love it here.

346
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,164
Yeah, it was actually Billie's idea
to move out here full-time.

347
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,749
[Billie] Yeah, it's just so...

348
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,958
green.

349
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,212
I missed that.

350
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,006
And peaceful.

351
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,635
It's definitely much simpler
than the city.

352
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,929
Spoken like someone
who's only ever lived there.

353
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,852
Anyway, I was telling Cooper
how you two met up in Paris last year.

354
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:20,107
Yes. It was quite a coincidence, actually.
I was at a conference.

355
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,360
Brad happened to be touring
with one of his bands?

356
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,739
We bumped into each other at Arpege,
which led to drinks at Bisou.

357
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,703
Next thing I knew,
we were dancing till 5 a.m. at Chez Moune.

358
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:38,375
One thing led to another, and here we are.

359
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,963
I was at a stopover with Kicking Fire.
You remember them, Billie?

360
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,049
Mm. Not really.

361
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,133
What?

362
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,095
You loved those guys.

363
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,265
Said they were White Stripes
with a bit of Bowie.

364
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,891
Mmm. I didn't wanna sign them,

365
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,436
but Billie convinced me
they're the real deal.

366
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,979
You know your wife.

367
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,732
When she wants something,
she can be very persuasive.

368
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:09,823
So you two, you've been together
for over a year, then?

369
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,906
- Mm.
- Mm.

370
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,535
That doesn't feel awkward to you?

371
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:18,874
I mean, you dated my wife, and then...
Now you're dating her best friend.

372
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,585
Cooper, I told you, I'm fine with it.

373
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:25,172
I mean, I've dated everyone else
in New York, why not Brad?

374
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,175
Yeah, and besides,
there's a lot of history between us.

375
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,136
We're all really connected.

376
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,472
You're not that connected. You're not.

377
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:38,101
I mean, maybe you and Sasha.
Certainly Billie and Sasha.

378
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,106
- Billie never even mentioned you.
- Maybe there's a reason for that.

379
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,068
Uh, maybe we should get some drinks.

380
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,154
Yes! Alcohol. Please.

381
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,072
Hi. Hi. Hi.

382
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,826
Um, can we order some drinks, like, now?

383
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,705
- Certainly. What can I get you?
- A very strong vodka martini.

384
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,666
Uh, Manhattan for me. Obviously.

385
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,211
[Cooper] A Macallan, straight.

386
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,214
And she'll have
a glass of the Opus One cab.

387
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,091
No more Jack and Coke?

388
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,261
Not much of a whiskey drinker anymore.

389
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,306
Yeah, she's classed it up a bit
in the last eight years.

390
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,393
So, uh, Cooper,
I understand you're a banker.

391
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,146
Mm. Sounds fun.

392
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,986
Yes. Yes, Cooper is making
a lot of headway in the VC world.

393
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,114
Honey, um, you should tell them
about the energy deal

394
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,158
you've been working on in San Francisco.

395
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,995
Oh, babe, that deal closed six months ago.

396
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,874
[Billie] Oh. [chuckles]

397
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,793
Right. Okay.

398
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,422
You know, there's just so many deals,
it's hard to keep up.

399
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,091
[Cooper] And Billie's been so busy.

400
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,678
I mean, the baby, you know, our second,

401
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,139
and all the changes at work
with the expansion.

402
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,892
Yeah, Billie was telling me about that.
How's it all going?

403
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,896
Great. I have a pitch tomorrow.
We're trying to buy Nanogenics.

404
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,608
It's a revolutionary development
in the way we treat cancer,

405
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,945
so I'll be asking the partners
to invest $70 million

406
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,614
so that we can save countless lives.

407
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,701
Coop, that's amazing.

408
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:22,497
Thank you. I mean, it might not be
as fun as running a record label,

409
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:27,377
but, uh, I don't know,
some people seem to think it's important.

410
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,132
Absolutely. Thank God for guys like you.

411
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,135
Amen.

412
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,803
- [waiter] Here we are.
- [Billie] Oh!

413
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,683
- And, uh, ahem, what about you, Billie?
- Yes!

414
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,350
How's work?

415
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,480
I guess it's, uh, Dr. Billie now, huh?

416
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:53,111
Actually, ahem, Sasha didn't tell you?

417
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,782
I, um... I stopped out of my PhD program.

418
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,534
Temporarily.

419
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,120
Are you serious?

420
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,041
But that program was everything to you.

421
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,546
My priorities changed when I got pregnant.
I wanted to stay closer to home,

422
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,800
so I started working
as a school psychologist instead.

423
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,887
Billie's changed
so many of the students' lives.

424
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,764
- They love her there.
- I'm sure they do.

425
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,141
And you love it too, Billie?

426
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,310
I do. Yes.

427
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:31,191
But I'm taking a little time off
from everything right now.

428
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,068
Just to be with my kids.

429
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,444
So you're a full-time mom.

430
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,988
- Brad.
- It's the most important job in the world.

431
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,032
I'm planning on getting back to it.

432
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,618
To all of it.

433
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:45,121
Well, hold on. Only if you want to, babe.

434
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,957
Billie is such an amazing mother.
The kids are thriving...

435
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,586
I'll bet. I just know
how important your work was to you.

436
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,133
You always said you wanted a big life.
That's the whole reason you left Georgia.

437
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,760
Well, this isn't Georgia.

438
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,013
- Trust me.
- [Brad] Of course not.

439
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,349
As long as you're happy, B.

440
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,145
That's all I want. Truly.

441
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,272
I am.

442
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,276
I am...

443
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,031
really, really happy.

444
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,534
Good. I'm glad.

445
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,371
[dramatic music playing]

446
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:35,505
I guess I'm just trying to wrap
my head around this whole new you.

447
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:39,676
I mean, you're the girl
who used to start her night at 2 a.m.

448
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:46,349
Dance on the bar at Tortilla Flats,
run wild around the beaches of Costa Rica.

449
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,811
Okay. Okay.
What the hell are you doing, man?

450
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,188
Billie and I spent a week in Tamarindo.

451
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,942
Living off papayas and tequila,
swimming in the ocean,

452
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,487
feeling the sting of the surf on our skin,

453
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,324
that warm Caribbean breeze
through our hair.

454
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,752
It was so hot, 102 in the shade.

455
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:19,215
I don't think we bothered getting dressed
the whole time we were there. Did we?

456
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,179
["Skeleton Key" playing]

457
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,775
We pretended we were marooned
on an atoll in the South Pacific,

458
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,444
waiting for someone to rescue us.

459
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,036
But we didn't wanna be found.
We never wanted to come home.

463
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,516
All right, that's enough!
Who do you think you are?

464
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,851
I'm sorry. I need to use the restroom.

465
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,774
Hey, don't think for one second
that you are fooling anyone.

466
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,152
- I don't know what you mean.
- No, fuck you. I know your type.

467
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,030
You're the type of guy
women screw in their 20s.

468
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:28,993
You're wild, dangerous. You're fun.
Till they get you out of their system.

469
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,205
You're a placeholder, really,
till someone like me comes along.

470
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,915
Someone real.

471
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,876
I'm not sure
they all get it out of their system.

472
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,757
Excuse me. I gotta take a leak too.

473
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,310
What are you doing?

474
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,271
Get out of here.

475
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,480
[lock clicks]

476
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,942
- Billie...
- Don't. Don't touch me.

477
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,612
- You have to stop.
- I'm not giving up on you. On us.

478
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,739
- There is no us.
- Yes, there is.

479
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,908
- Always was and always will be.
- Oh, my God.

480
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,911
If I thought you were truly happy,
I'd leave you alone.

481
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,331
I am. I am happy.

482
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,002
But you're not, I can tell.
I know you, Billie.

483
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,085
No, you don't.

484
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,381
Not anymore.

485
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,010
I spent the last eight years
hating myself for hurting you.

486
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,556
Thinking I would never get the chance
to tell you how sorry I am.

487
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,769
And now that I have it,
I'm not letting it go.

488
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,522
And I don't think you want me to either.

489
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,943
Just tell me one thing.

490
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,988
Are they fucking?

491
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,948
Oh, come on, Sash.

492
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,868
I know he's not your boyfriend, okay?
I'm not an idiot.

493
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,995
- Cooper...
- No, stop.

494
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,457
Why are you doing this?
Why are you protecting her?

495
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,751
Billie is going through something.

496
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,923
Sure, it's not a red Porsche
or a bimbo half her age,

497
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:11,804
but it is her own postpartum, exhausted,
mother-of-two version of a midlife crisis.

498
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,598
Listen.

499
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:21,397
Billie loves you, okay?
She's just... confused.

500
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,112
Please. Don't give up on her, Coop.

501
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,324
What the hell do you think
I'm doing here? Huh?

502
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,620
You cannot do this. I'm married.

503
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,750
You want me to be happy?

504
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,380
You had your chance,
and you broke my heart.

505
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,591
You destroyed me.

506
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,258
I know.

507
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,638
And it kills me.

508
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,975
But I am not the same person I was.

509
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,979
- Right.
- I'm serious. I've changed.

510
