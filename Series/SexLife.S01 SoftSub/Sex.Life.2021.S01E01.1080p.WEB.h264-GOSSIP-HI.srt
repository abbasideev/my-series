You can't keep him like that, sweetheart.
You have to let him go.

But she can't breathe in there.

I was gonna get dressed
at some point, I swear. I just...

Ah, it's no biggie.

81
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,947
All right. I'm gonna hurry up
and mow the lawn before the game starts.

Oh, God, Billie,
things have been so crazy at work.

You have no idea.

- Really?
- Yeah.

I mean, we're talking like,
it's, like, post-merger madness, you know?

95
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,405
Everybody's just angling for a position

96
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,784
and they're all trying to show off
for the new boss.

97
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,370
And she's great, though, you know? She's...

98
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,539
She wants to expand internationally.

99
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,916
She wants to do all those things
I've wanted to do,

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,045

What?

105
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,434
Nothing.

106
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
I just miss you.

107
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,774
- [cell phone ringing]
- Excuse me.

108
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,904
Okay, and that's her.

109
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,656
My new boss.

110
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,700
Come on.
Have you listened to a word I said?

111
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,619
- Right.
- Francesca, hey!

112
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,245
How are you? [laughs]

[Billie] <i>The problem is
Cooper Connelly is married to me.</i>

We'll just talk tomorrow and set a time,
then we'll discuss.

123
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,413
All right, great. Thanks.
We'll see you then. Bye.

<i>So why go marry someone so straight-laced?</i>

00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,640
<i>Honestly, because of them.</i>

128
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,934
I didn't call you back for a reason!

129
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,144

<i>I'll never forget the first time
he brought me to this house.</i>

"Land of the long tidal river."

143
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,183
I always loved that.

For us.</i>

It's nice to finally meet you.

156
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,054
I've heard so much about the both of you.
I'm a big fan of your daughter's. Clearly.

- Us too.
- Most days, anyway.

Well, you'll see.

But Cooper sucked me in
with his "change the world" hoo-ha.

00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,977
And the dental plan's not that bad either.

This stupid band hasn't even gone on yet,

and I'm too obsessed to give up,
go home, get a decent night's sleep,

285
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,645
like any grown-ass woman

and go to work would.

Why are you still up?

Maybe we should get married.

297
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,177
He could choke me

Uh-uh. For seven to ten years.
Let's not go crazy.

- You are different.
<i>- No, I mean, like,</i>

306

<i>I don't feel like myself.
I feel like, uh...</i>

307
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:30,210
Like a watered-down,
wife-mom version of me. And...

308
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,588
I'm, uh...

309
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,593
I'm just not sure
that this is who I'm supposed to be.

Oh, God. You need to go back to work.

311
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,391
You clearly have
too much time on your hands.

312
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,475
I can't.

313
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,563
Cooper and I agreed that I would
take this time to be with the kids.

314
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,816
- Please. Where do I even start?
<i>- I wanted this time, you know?</i>

I thought I would love it. And I do but...

316
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,490
It's not enough. It's okay.
You can say it.

<i>I just... I don't know.</i>

318
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,789
I've been thinking a lot, about...

[dramatic music playing]

320
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,958
...him.

- Who?
- Oh, come on, Sash.

322
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,965
Are you kidding me?

323
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,637
Do not fuck up your gorgeous family.

324
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,181
- I'm not.
- Cooper is such a good guy.

325
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,849
I know that.

326
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,102
<i>Then appreciate it for a second,
how lucky you are to have found him.</i>

327
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,522
How many millions of women
would kill for what you have.

328
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,191
<i>Look, I know. Right?</i>

329
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:38,320
But I just... I can't stop thinking
about how things used to be.

[dance music playing over speakers]

331
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,532
- With Brad?
- With me.

332
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,243
I was different.

333
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,371
<i>- I don't know what happened.</i>
- Girl!

334
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,833
You said yes,
moved to the burbs, had kids.

335
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,337
This is what you wanted, B.
It was your choice.

336
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,463
<i>I know.</i>

337
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,382
<i>And I know Cooper's exhausted, you know?</i>

338
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,968
I'm exhausted too, but I just...

339
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,844
I need to...

340
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,223
To feel it again.

341
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,599
What?

342
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,603
Some small piece of that magical...

344
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,528
You know? It was just...
It was such a high!

345
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,283
- How's it going?
- Hey.

346
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,744
Sash, are you...?
Are you even listening to me?

347
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,208
Yes. Now you listen to me, all right?

348
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,964
Brad was one sexy motherfucker.

349
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,882
But that kind of love is a fickle bitch.

350
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:45,304
It hurts, betrays
and is ultimately unsustainable.

351
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,598
<i>What you have with Cooper
will go the distance.</i>

352
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,186
I know. I know it in my cells,
I know it in my fucking soul.
