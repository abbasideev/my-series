- Oh, it's so chic.

178
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,570

- You could totally wear that.

And, yes, Billie and I have hit
a few bumps recently, but...

512
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,093
I mean, this is like ten steps too far.

513
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,637
Oh.

514
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,056
Okay.

515
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,767
Fuck. I'm sorry.

516
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,269
No, it's not a problem.

517
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,523
She really is a lucky girl.

518
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,404
So here's what's gonna happen.

519
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,032
I'm gonna go powder my nose,
catch up with my girlfriends,

520
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,868
and make sure that this blowout
and dress don't go to waste.

521
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,494
Sounds like a plan.

522
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,711
Motherfucker!

523
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,632
I am blinded by the light of that BDE.
I gotta look away.

524
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,509
- Boom! Up top!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

525
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,847
Okay, this isn't about Emily.
She is a sweetheart. She's not Billie.

526
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,268
I love my wife. I have since the second
I laid eyes on her. You know?

527
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,522
She's formidable.
And she made me feel that way too.

528
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,569
Fine. You want formidable?

529
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
There you go.

530
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,951
- That's what's up.
- No, Devon...

531
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,912
- Cooper.
- Hey.

532
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,580
You've come out to play.

533
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,583
Yeah, I felt like I had
to blow some steam off, I guess.

534
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,920
It was really nice to see you.

535
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,129
Yeah, you too, Em.

536
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,839
Bye, Cooper.

537
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,926
We'll see ya.

538
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,976
Well, okay, then.
Pretty sure that wasn't your wife.

539
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,020
It's, uh, ex-girlfriend.

540
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,649
Um, the past has been sneaking up
on me lately.

541
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,110
Seemed pretty present to me.

542
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,906
So you like tequila?

543
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,663
- [Judy] Come on, just finish the bottle.
- [Caroline] Okay, check this out.

544
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,874
Billie, we know you had a rough day.

545
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,461
So we got you something!

546
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,008
Oh, my God.

547
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,551
You guys!

548
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,262
I can't.

549
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,640
It's fake.
Don't tell anyone, we all got one.

550
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:42,186
Canal Street. Can you believe it?
It looks so real.

551
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,985
I am just so sorry for today.

552
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,404
For losing it like that.

553
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,699
I'm going through some things, clearly.

554
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:58,536
- [chuckles] I don't know. I...
- Honey. We get it.

555
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,746
[Judy] I had a guy.

556
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,416
An ex I couldn't stop thinking about.

557
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,418
Really?

558
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,296
He was a musician too.

560
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,259

562
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,637
He had a guru.

563
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,640
We lived together on an ashram in Goa.

564
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,642
Can you imagine me there?

565
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,771
Oh, my God. I can't. Like, at all.

566
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,274
I only ate chickpeas and rice
for about six months, but...

567
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,570
I was so in love.

568
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,823
I would have done anything.

569
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:42,830
Of course, that never lasts. Heh.
The breakup was nuclear.

570
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:50,797
I didn't think about him for years, then
one day couldn't get him out of my head.

571
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,673
Same as you.

572
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,927
So I looked him up. Found him on Facebook.

573
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,307
Turns out he works
in the concrete business now.

574
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,061
He's fat, he's bald, just like his dad.

Believe me, I got real real fast
about how good I have it...

577
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,488
and how much I love my husband.

578

I promise,
it'll be the end of the fantasy.

581
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,917
Yeah.

582

Sometime let's do that.

No. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
You're going completely out of order here.

Come on. Live on the edge, Connelly.

- Wow. So the tie does come off.
- Whew!

00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,497
Oh, it does. It does.

589
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,501
I figured since we were breaking
the rules, that would be okay.

590
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,628
Oh, it's very okay.

591
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,801
You know, there is a great whiskey joint
on Perry Street, all the way west.

592
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,556
It's right by my place.
Why don't we get a nightcap?

593
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,479
Actually...

594
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,274
I should probably go home.

You're right.

596
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,779
That's probably a good idea.

597
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,284
That's a good idea. I should go home.

a fake Chanel bag can't fix everything.

Real Chanel maybe.

607
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,460
Marriages can fall into a rut.

I get it. Believe me, I do.

609
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:43,469
But the way out of that rut is not
through your old boyfriend.

610

Forget him.

611
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,392
You need to spice things up
