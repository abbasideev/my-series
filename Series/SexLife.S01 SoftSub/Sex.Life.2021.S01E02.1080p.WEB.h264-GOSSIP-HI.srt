Don't worry, you're significantly
less douchey than I thought.

178

Good. Look, it's been a long day.

179

- Make it a Jack and Coke and I'm in.

Really? A Georgia Peach?

182
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,758
Why is that so hard to believe?

183
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,638
Well, because I just, I can't picture you
as like this tiara-wearing debutante,

184
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,348
captain of the cheerleading squad.

185
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,266
Well, that's because I wasn't, okay?

186
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,519
Tiaras are for princesses.
I was homecoming queen.

187
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,229
I wore a crown.

188
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,525
And, yes, my forward roll is the stuff
of cheerleading legend in Cobb County.

189
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,820
- Thank you very much.
- Gonna make you show me one of these days.

190
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,572
Okay, we'll see about that.

191
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,575
So it sounds like you, uh...
You had it made.

192
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,578
- Must have been hard to leave.
- Not as hard as people think.

193
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,747
I mean, I did have a hope chest.

194
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,291
But it was filled with a lot more
than just embroidery

195
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,545
and pictures of wedding dresses clipped
out of <i>Modern Bride</i> and <i>Vogue.</i>

196
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:17,134
I mean, I had plenty of those too,
but I don't know, I just, I wanted more.

197
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:21,597
That wasn't enough. More than all
the other girls. Ever since I was little.

198
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,432
Big appetite.

199
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,352
I needed a big city to try and fill it.

200
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,146
Doesn't get bigger than New York.

201
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,358
I wanted adventure.
I wanted crazy nights on the town.

202
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,822
How's that working out for you?

203
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,031
I don't know.

[Billie chuckles]

205
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,454
Georgia wasn't enough...

206
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,792
but New York might be a little too much.

207
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,336
I know exactly what you mean.

208
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:58,175
So I've got a house, um,
out in the country, Connecticut.

209
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,636
Wow, nice.

210
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,513
So I spend weekends out there.

211
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,933
But lately I've been getting this itch,

212
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,978
you know, maybe I need
to move out there full-time.

213
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,524
It's hard to start a family
in the city. So...

- Yes!

- You're a lucky girl.

anyone know about it.</i>

- Okay. Yeah.

Yes, we dated for a while.
But she's married now to a great guy.
