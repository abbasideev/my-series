00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,025
Cooper, I wanna fix things.

176
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,571
Cooper, please.

177
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,864
I know...

178
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,576
I keep saying it,

179
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,954
and then I only do things
to make it worse.

180
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,958
But that's done.

181
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,627
Last night...

182
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,254
when I came home...

183
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,298
and the house was empty,

184
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,677
and I thought that you had taken
the kids and left me...

185
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,345
Like, for real.

186
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,559
It... It felt like my soul dropped out
of my body.

187
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,606
You and the kids, you're my life.
You're my world, Cooper.

188
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,441
Nothing else. No one...

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,071
No one else matters.

190
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,575
And see what you only
just realized last night?

191
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,037
I've known since the second I met you.

192
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,123
I didn't just realize last night.

193
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,041
Of course I've always known it.

194
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,792
Look.

195
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,550
I was never unhappy with you.

196
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,387
Except... for the sex.

197
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,931
And I know I should have been honest
about who I was

198
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,809
and what I needed,
but I just... I didn't... I...

199
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,227
I didn't wanna hurt you.

200
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,188
- You're right. Because this was better.
- Okay.

201
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,899
Look, do you think this is easy for me?

202
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,450
Look, I'm sorry you felt
you couldn't tell me.

203
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,829
I mean, I don't know if that's on me or...

204
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,498
What girls have been taught
our whole lives?

205
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,669
Look.

206
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,463
I get it now.

207
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,924
I had gotten complacent.

208
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,386
And we had little kids and I just thought:

209
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,721
"Okay, this is a...

210
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,807
It's a season of sacrifice."

211
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,186
But I understand now
what you were missing.

212
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:55,441
And why you were fantasizing
about him because...

213
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,193
Honestly?

214
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,407
A big part of me came back to life
when I was with Francesca.

215
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,370
[stammers]

216
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,081
I thought you said nothing happened.

217
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,374
You know, it didn't.

218
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,252
But I'd forgotten how the possibility...

219
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,923
of something new... feels, you know?

220
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,010
That thrill of "What if?"
Like in your journal.

221
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,222
The rush, the danger, the excitement.

222
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,849
And that made me want more too.

223
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:42,238
Look, I never had all of
the wild experiences that you did, okay?

224
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,531
Maybe I should have.

225
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,032
But the truth is,

226
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,578
I don't wanna have those
with Francesca, with anybody else.

227
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,164
I wanna have them with you.

228
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,543
I wanna have them with you too.

229
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,255
But...

230
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,631
But what?

231
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,555
Do you think it's possible
for the same person

232
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,432
who gives you love, safety, security,

233
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,602
a beautiful home and family...

234
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,229
To give you that rush too.

235
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,316
I'd rather have you than the rush.

236
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,820
And I would rather have it all.

237
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,948
And I think you would too.

238
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,659
So what...?

239
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,161
What do we do?

240
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,790
I don't know.

241
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,502
[Trina] Hello! Anyone home?

242
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,380
Oh, shit. I invited them over
to celebrate.

243
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,632
- The promotion you didn't know about?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,468
- Hi!
- Congratulations, Cooper.

245
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,846
- Thank you.
- We brought bubbly.

246
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,431
Put her there, partner.

247
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,724
Thanks, buddy.

248
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,310
And Trina made her famous seven-layer dip,

249
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,896
and there are a lot of things
that I love about this woman,

250
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,440
but this dip is why I put a ring on it.

251
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,775
This is it.

252
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,860
[Trina] Aww.

253
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,527
Stop.

254
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,240
[kids laughing]

255
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,036
So?

256
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,330
How are you doing?

257
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,542
And, uh, how is it going with the sexy ex?

258
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,130
When you called me looking for Cooper,
you sounded so distraught, I wondered if...

259
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,050
Um, no, that was a misunderstanding.

260
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,509
And the, um...

261
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,097
stuff with the ex is, um, ancient history.

262
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,974
And Cooper and I...

263
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,894
are really focused on each other now.

264
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,437
[speaking indistinctly]

265
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,862
Yeah. You guys look deliriously happy.

266
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,076
Listen, what...

267
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,205
exactly did you mean
the other day about, um...

268
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,084
you know, marriages falling into a rut

269
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:06,090
and needing to spice things up,
but then doing it together?

270
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,216
Oh, girl.

271
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,972
Do you really think you're ready for this?

272
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,434
At this point, I think we're ready
for just about anything.

273
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,940
- Can you get a sitter for tonight?
- I could call Sasha.

274
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,276
'Cause Devon and I are gonna
blow your mind.

275
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,029
[Devon] Burgers are ready!

276
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,659
- [Trina] Wow.
- [Devon] Let's get a beer.

277
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,663
[pop music playing over speakers]

278
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,875
- Sorry I'm late. I got hung up. Ahem.
- [music stops]

279
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,335
- I'm Kyla.
- Hey, I'm Brad.

280
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,963
Oh, I know. Been dying to work with you

281
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,632
ever since I heard what you did
on Willow McKenna's album.

282
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,718
She said the whole experience was...

283
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,636
transformative.

284
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,639
You're friends.

285
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,559
Well, friendly enough that she warned me
not to sleep with you.

286
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,103
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.
- Not what I heard.

287
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,023
- Let's get to work, okay?
- Yeah.

288
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,690
Let's do it.

289
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,653
- Hey.
- Yeah.

290
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,327
[cello playing classical music]

291
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,404
[Billie] <i>Dad.</i>

292
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,493
[Billie] Hi, hi.

294
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,369
- Mom. Hi.
- Hi.

295
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,498
Um, this is Brad.

296
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,792
Brad, these are my parents. Vivi...

297
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,377
You can just call us "Mom" and "Dad."

298
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,924
Oh, I am so happy to finally meet you.

299
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,346
Daddy and I were so sorry
to hear about the baby.

300
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,183
But, please, don't let this keep you
from trying again.

301
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,268
- Mom.
- You know Melanie Bennett.

302
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,980
She had three miscarriages
until she got little Jasper.

303
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,817
And just look at that sweet boy.

304
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,443
He's delicious, huh?

305
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,654
Yeah, he really is.

306
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,783
Don't mind your mother.
You know how she gets ahead of herself.

307
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,160
Well, I just don't want you
to give up is all.

308
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,162
And, well, although...

309
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,623
This will be the last time I'll say it,

310
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,001
it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world to get married first.

311
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,419
Mom, enough.

312
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,756
The ceremony's about to start.
Uh, we should go get seats.

313
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,967
So glad you came, honey.

314
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,468
Yeah, me too.

315
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,558
I'm so sorry.

316
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,936
Can we just erase the last five minutes?

317
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,981
- You didn't oversell her, that's for sure.
- Yeah.

318
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,374
- [rock music playing over speakers]
- [indistinct chatter]

319
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,175
Having a good time?

320
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,426
Oh, yeah.

321
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,095
A blast.

322
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,537
[Billie] Are you fucking kidding me?

323
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,082
[dramatic music playing]

324
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,834
I am so done with you.

325
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,048
Billie, wait.

326
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,842
No. You've been freaking out
ever since we lost the baby,

327
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,095
which makes no sense because
you never wanted it in the first place.

328
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,972
- That's not true!
- You said so!

329
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,601
Okay, maybe it was true at the start,
but then I was all in. Hey!

330
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,854
You don't even know how all-in I was.

331
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,483
If your idea of all-in is making out
with some random chick

332
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,693
at my cousin's wedding, I don't need it.

333
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,446
Oh, we're going through
some dark shit right now, okay?

334
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,281
- I've had too much to drink.
- Bullshit!

335
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,575
You knew exactly what you were doing.

336
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,286
You wanted me to catch you,
so you could walk out on me

337
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,413
the same way
that your dad walked out on you.

338
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,416
This is what you do, Brad.

339
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,336
You said so yourself,
and for far too long now,

340
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,129
it is what I have let you do.

341
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm not gonna let you anymore.

342
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,806
Billie, please...

343
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,270
It's my fault we lost the baby.

344
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,028
What are you talking about?

345
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,908
I'm not worthy of being a father.

346
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,330
Even the fucking universe agrees.

347
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,959
Is that what you think?

348
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,923
I don't wanna lose you, B.

349
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,264
