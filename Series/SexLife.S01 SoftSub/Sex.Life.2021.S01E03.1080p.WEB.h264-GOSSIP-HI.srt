00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,828
You know, if you could dance to Elvis...

353
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,998
- [Elise] Elvis?
- Yeah. You could dance to anything.

354
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,917
- Come on. Up you get.
- I'm not that old.

355
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,168
- [Billie] Yes!
- Up you get.

356
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,169
Yes!

357
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,048
Oh, still got it, have we?

358
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,551
Oh, Mum.

359
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,971
I love you, Mum.

360
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,645
- Dance with us, love.
- Oh, no, no, no.

361
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,022
- It's fine.
- No, it's not fine. Up you get.

362
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,607
Come on. Up, up, up.

363
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,859
- Okay.
- All of us. Yep.

364
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,194
All right.

365
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,239
- I'll show you some moves.
- Yes. Please.

366
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,865
- Okay, and go this way!
- Right?

367
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,034
- And... Oh, twirl.
- Okay.

368
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,329
- [Elise] Here we go. Ready?
- This is so great!

369
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,629
I love her.

370
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,131
[man] A dance party?

371
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,174
How decadent.

372
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,468
[dramatic music playing]

373
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,552
[Billie] Hi.

374
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,556
[pop music stops]

375
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,475
You told me he wasn't gonna be here.

376
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,936
Because I knew you wouldn't come.

377
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,523
- You got that right.
- Darling. Let him be a part of your life.

378
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,693
I really don't.
We're leaving now. Let's go.

379
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,196
- What?
- At least introduce me to your friend.

380
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,949
- I don't think so.
- You've already forgotten her name?

381
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,744
- Hey.
- Yeah, he's got quite a track record.

382
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,039
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What are you, drunk?

383
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,541
- [Elise] Jonathan...
- Brad loves the chase.

384
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,418
He comes on like a whirlwind.

385
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,961
All hot and heavy.

386
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,547
Even bringing them home
to meet dear old Mum.

387
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,151
- Billie, get your purse.
- [Jonathan] The second you get close,

388
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:19,721
the second you get just a little too real,
what does Mr. Fancy record producer do?

389
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,183
- He moves on to a new act.
- You have no idea what I do.

390
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,393
Hump them and dump them,
isn't that right, son?

391
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,103
Don't call me that!

392
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,482
- You're not my father.
- Well, at least I stuck around.

393
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,611
Which is a lot more than you can say
for that scumbag you call "Dad."

394
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,613
[shouts]

395
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,203
Are you gonna stand there
and let him act like this?

396
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,705
I'm gonna make it easy on both of you.

397
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,540
We never should have come.

398
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,522
I'll get you a cab.

399
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,110
- What is going on?
- You're the shrink, you tell me.

400
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,905
Fine. Then stop acting
like the asshole Jonathan says you are.

401
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,366
What do you want me to say?
That my dad took off?

402
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,911
That I got dragged 10,000 miles away
to be raised by a dickhead stepfather

403
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,831
that looks for new ways to tell me
I'm a piece of shit everyday

404
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,791
and that my mom lets him? Yeah. Yo!

405
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,751
- Yes. If that's the truth. Yes.
- Come on.

406
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,589
- It's yours, get in.
- No. Just talk to me.

407
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,092
Why? So you can swoop in and fix me?

408
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:45,390
Hmm? Yeah. You know, you're so curious
about everyone else, but what about you?

409
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,601
Running away from redneck Mom
and Dad down in Georgia?

410
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,103
Stop it. Stop!

411
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,273
- You don't know anything about them.
- Yeah.

412
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,276
Maybe if Daddy gave you
a little more attention...

413
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,029
you wouldn't fuck a stranger
on the first night you met him.

414
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,991
You...

415
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:09,038
[sobbing] You are dead wrong
about my dad. And don't do this.

416
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,791
I know what you're doing.
Don't push me away.

417
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,586
You think you're so special, don't you?

418
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,421
Guess what, Billie?

419
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,964
You're not.

420
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,801
You're not special.

421
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,387
And you're not my fucking girlfriend.

422
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,347
[crying]

423
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,397
[Hudson] Mommy, look.

424
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,441
Look what I made.

425
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Hudson.

426
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,575
Honey, this is...

427
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,787
This is perfect.

428
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,163
It's our family.

429
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,247
Who...? Okay.

430
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,750
- Who is this?
- Mommy.

431
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,461
- Yes. And who is that?
- Ellary.

432
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,630
Yes. And who's that?

433
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,131
- Daddy.
- That's Daddy.

434
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,217
- And who's this guy?
- Me.

435
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,802
That's you.

436
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,137
Your bath is ready, <i>niño.</i>

437
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,056
Time to come upstairs.

438
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,474
Olga, look.

439
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,688
- That's fantastic.
- It's our first family portrait.

440
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,905
[tender music playing]

441
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,828
Hey, Olga. Um...

442
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,916
Is there any chance
that you could stay a little bit longer?

443
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,461
- Uh, sure. Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

444
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,796
There is, um...

445
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,799
There's just something that I need to do.

446
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,476
[Billie] <i>Cooper's a sweetheart.</i>

447
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,897
<i>He would never even dream
of treating me the way Brad treated me.</i>

448
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,610
<i>So how come Brad's
the one I can't stop thinking about?</i>

449
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,947
<i>He always managed to find a way back in.</i>

450
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,532
[Billie sobbing] <i>Oh, my God, Sash.</i>

451
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,868
What he said about me, he said it...

452
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,953
[folk music playing over speakers]

453
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,498
He said it so calmly.

454
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,294
He said it so matter-of-fact.

455
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,838
He wasn't just making stuff up.

456
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,715
He believed it.

457
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,134
He'd thought about it.

458
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,760
Just remember.

459
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,890
- He's the piece of shit. Not you.
- Ugh.

460
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,187
You should have seen him.
It's like, when he threw that glass...

461
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,108
he was so scary.

462
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,946
He was like a completely different person.

463
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,073
He's a psycho.

464
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,826
Better to find out now.

465
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,371
Oh, please. Brad's never getting married
or even having a honeymoon.

466
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,790
I'm an idiot.

467
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,044
[intercom buzzing]

468
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,170
Don't answer it.

469
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,048
[cell phone buzzing]

470
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,595
- Ignore him. He will go away.
- [can thuds on window]

471
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,388
- [Brad] Billie!
- What the hell?

472
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm sorry, Billie! Just talk to me.

473
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:20,355
B, B, I know what you're thinking,
and don't do it.

474
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,191
- [Brad] Please!
- [man] Hey, asshole! Shut the hell up!

475
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,401
[woman] Get lost or I'm calling the cops!

476
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,365
Billie!

477
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,868
Is he out of his mind?

478
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,745
- Okay...
- I'm gonna handle this.

479
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,333
Sash. If I don't go down there myself,
he'll never stop.

480
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,417
You know it.

481
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,837
I'll spot you.

482
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,225
Billie! Billie, I know you're up there.

483
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,608
- What do you want?
- Look, I screwed up, okay?

484
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,611
- This is all on me.
- Yeah, I already knew that, okay?

485
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,862
You're wasting your time.

486
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,948
[dramatic music playing]

487
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,367
Just... Just go.

488
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,867
Please.

489
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,581
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You already have!

490
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,128
I didn't... I didn't mean what I said.

491
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,717
And I hate myself for saying it, okay?

492
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,885
Just give me five minutes.

493
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,930
Please.

494
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,268
[sobbing]

495
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,979
Maybe Jonathan's right.

496
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,566
This is what I always do.

497
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,573
But I don't wanna do it with you.

498
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,998
Just let me explain.

499
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,799
You get rid of that freak show?

500
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,098
Oh, for fuck's sake.

501
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,308
I'll be in my room.

502
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,548
Look, you said you wanted
to hear the truth.

503
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,179
That I should tell you
more about my family, so...

504
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,226
My real dad left when I was 8.

505
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,770
I never saw him again.

506
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,357
Never even sent a birthday card.

507
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,361
But he would send me records.

508
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,824
Miles Davis.

509
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,035
Leonard Cohen. Velvet Underground.

510
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,289
Nirvana. Dre. The Legends.

511
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,583
He turned me on to them all.

512
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,255
So when I started my company...

513
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,508
Yeah, I did it... I did it for the music.

514
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,677
But also, I thought...

515
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,765
I thought if I got big enough...

516
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,520
that he'd just show up.

517
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,274
[chuckles] Probably just to ask
for a loan.

518
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,903
But I'm still waiting.

519
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,325
And I guess I always will be.

520
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,832
But do you know what's messed up?

521
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,045
Twenty-four years,
no birthday cards later.

522
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,141
I still miss him.

523
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,894
