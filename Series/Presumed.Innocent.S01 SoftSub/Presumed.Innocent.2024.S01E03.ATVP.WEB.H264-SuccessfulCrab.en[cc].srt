00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:24,985
Who is this? Are you gonna answer me?

4
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:27,362
- Who the fuck is this? Fuck.

5
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,615

Rusty, who was that?

[Rusty sighs]

00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:50,719
Saw you where?

[sighs]

11
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:05,233
I'm assuming that they mean
Carolyn's house...

12
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:08,945
the night of...

13
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,461

[Carolyn exhales shakily]
Rusty, this is not you.

[breathes shakily]

21
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,385
- Rusty, this is not you.
- You don't fucking know me.

22
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,678
- [Carolyn gasps]
- You don't know me.

23
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:15,971
And you don't know what's in me!

24
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,055
- [gasps]
- [Rusty grunting]

25
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,434

[Lorraine] <i>You think he's guilty.</i>

32
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,841
- [stammers] It was a dream, Lo.
- Okay.

33
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,634
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

34
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,721
You dreamt he's guilty,
which can mean something.

35
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:01,266
Dreams often point to the truth.

36
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:04,519
Hey. You know,
you being on my side would be nice.

37
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,062
- Maybe we can try that?
- [scoffs]

38
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,315
You think I am not on your side?

39
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:11,359
Raymond, I am worried about you.

40
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,571
The glare that comes
with this kind of case, the pressure.

41
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,826
Listen, I understand
your thirst for relevance,

42
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:25,165
your need to get out of bed in the morning
and have something to do to stave off...

43
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,708
[sighs] What is it you call it?

44
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,959
My decomposing rot.

45
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,253
Yes, your decomposing rot.

46
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,967
- [sighing]
- Ooh.

47
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,847
With your best friend as the defendant.

48
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,434
Honey...

49
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,523
should you lose,
a good chance from what I see and read,

50
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:54,236
Rusty spends the rest of his natural life
in prison,

51
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:56,404
which you will very much take to heart.

52
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,825
Maybe you can live with it just fine,

53
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:04,329
but I doubt it. [slurps]

54
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,290
Then, there's the alternative.

55
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,670
You win.

56
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,966
Rusty didn't do this.

- Don't they have actual news to report?

Mmm, people love true crime.

[Raymond] <i>So you have no idea who sent it?</i>

66

It could very easily be a trick,

00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,109
semi-clever reporter.

68
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:21,072
So this individual knew
that you were there the night of?

00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,286
'Cause I didn't.

71
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,625
I went there after work.

72
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,754
So the two of you weren't quite as over
as you led me and others to believe.

73
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:37,380
No... [stammers] We were over.

74
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,716
I-I went over there
to try and change that.

75
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,384
- [sighs] And did you?
- [footsteps approaching]

76
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,469
No.

77
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,848
Lorraine, hi...

78
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:51,811
I think you should just hand it over
to the police.

79
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,813
Hold on. Don't you wanna know
what this is about?

80
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:56,316
- [sighing]
- Who?

81
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,402
It could also just blow up in our face.

82
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,325
- What about Rigo? Can't she take it?
- No, no, no.

83
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:08,078
I've asked her to do too much already.
I can't ask her.

84
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:09,621
If you do this,

85
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,415
you have to assume that
the person you're meeting

86
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,000
is gonna be wearing a wire.

87
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:18,713
So whatever you say,
I strongly suggest that you...

00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,423
[sighs]

89
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,969
You keep it simple, clean.
Watch your words.

90
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,722
Definitely don't say that you hit Carolyn
on the head with a poker.

91
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,767
[inhales deeply]
I'm gonna take on an associate,

92
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,936
someone who's done defense before.

93
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:35,480
She's young. Her name is Mya Winslow.

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,190
- How do I know her?
- Yale.

95
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,192
She's good. She was at Sandy Stern's.

96
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:42,529
More importantly, she's a woman,
which we need on this.

97
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,951
She's gonna run point on forensics,
so we also need to assemble that. [sighs]

98
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:51,705
Listen, let's talk strategy
for a minute, okay?

99
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:52,789
Mm-hmm.

100
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,126
[Raymond] If we're gonna go alibi on this,
we need to file on that. Give notice.

101
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,837
So, you think we might go alibi?

102
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,550
- [stammers]
- Okay.

103
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,470
And I mean, we don't know
what time of the night she was murdered.

104
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,015
I mean, maybe we could say
that she was killed when I went to the...

105
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,141
Stop.

106
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:16,229
Let's just wait
for all the facts to come in...

107
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,150
before you start crafting responses.

108
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:42,297
Mrs. Sabich. Barbara,
did your husband commit this murder?

109
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:45,258
Do you hate Carolyn Polhemus
for sleeping with your husband?

110
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:48,720

we wanna know how you're fee...

the fire marshal for Marty's thing, right?

116
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,699
I need you to take a step back.

117
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,872
[sighs] What does that mean?

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,293

Kate. It'll blow over.

00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:27,050
We live in Chicago. There's, like,
a new dead body every 18 seconds.

121
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,635
You haven't been well.

122
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:33,557
I sold a piece two weeks ago, Kate.

123
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:36,101
No. You sold a piece five weeks ago,

124
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:39,020
and Aminata's pieces sell themselves.

125
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,358
- Take some time.
- Are you really doing this?

126
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,151
I-I'm not firing you, so don't get heavy.

127
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,236
I'm saying...

128
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,573
take a break... [sighs]

129
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:52,450
...and take care of yourself.

130
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:57,247
- And keep my distance, huh?
- Yeah. [chuckles] And that, yeah.

131
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:05,005
Kate, I really need this job.

132
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,175
I need every distraction
I can get right now.

133
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,637
It's a distraction
that doesn't work for us.

134
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,057
Take some time.

135
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,770
Word of advice?

136
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:24,566
- Why not.
- Differentiate.

137
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,403
You're not "we." You're not "him."

138

Always cutting lemons.

144

You're probably too young
to remember <i>Cheers</i>.

145
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,389
I know <i>Cheers</i>. I love Cheers. Ted Danson.

- You okay?
- Not really. I just lost my job.

150

[bartender] Shit. Sorry to hear that.

151
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:15,283
And my husband's on trial for murder.

Oh, shit. Yeah.

Um, what's his fucking name...
Ronnie? Ricky?

Rusty. Wow.
Yeah, you're going through a lot.

00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:36,513
Yes, I am.

158
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:42,185
Did he? Kill his mistress?

159
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,355
Jesus.
You don't have to answer that. I'm...

160
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:48,441
- That was out of line. Sorry.
- [chuckles] Not really.

161
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,902
It's the question everyone's asking.

162
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,280
Mm-hmm. What's your answer?

163
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,409
He did not do it.

164
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:03,832

tend to have a lot of enemies.

He is handsome, yes.

175
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:51,838
But... [sighs]
...I don't know, I like talking to him.

176
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,967
Mm-hmm. He made you smile.

177
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,599
Maybe you should have a little adventure.

178
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:05,352
[scoffs] Please.

179
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:08,521
And-And with the media
following my every move?

180
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,773
They're stalking me.

181
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:12,317
- Oh, honey, they've already moved on.
- [chuckles]

182
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:14,653
They've got their footage,
and they're on to the next dead thing.

183
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,821
- It's a perk of living in Chicago.
- [sighs]

184
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,323
I don't know.

185
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,325
It's good to see you smile.

186
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:25,497
You're young, you're beautiful.
You should feel that way every day.

187
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:28,792
You are under so much pressure.

188
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:34,130
Are you seriously suggesting
I engage in a little...

189
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,761
extramarital revenge sex
with a bartender I just met?

190
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:43,723
I am suggesting that you tend to yourself.

191
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:48,061
An escape hatch of some sort
to help you get to the other side of this.

192
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,815
I mean, not now.
I get it, with everything going on.

193
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:53,400
But at some point.

194
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:56,486
I admire your fight,

195
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,659
your commitment to be in love,
to stay in love with the man you married.

196
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,415
Rusty isn't the man you married.

197
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:10,083
Let's face that.

198
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,670
[thunder rumbling]

199
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,384
[Tommy] I directly told you
to stand down, Detective.

200
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:20,719
- And I have.
- Bullshit.

201
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,679
You and Rusty went to visit
Liam Reynolds in prison.

202
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,931
Oh. That was on my own personal time.

203
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,391
You think this is funny?

204
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:28,810
Why would I waste funny
on somebody with no sense of humor?

205
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:30,937
- You know what is funny?
- What?

206
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,230
Fucking hilarious, actually,

207
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,774
is that you're not looking
at Reynolds for this.

208
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:37,611
Carolyn was tied up like Bunny Davis,
details not in the public domain...

209
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:39,279
Liam Reynolds is incarcerated.

210
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,823
So the fuck what? He threatened her.
He had a motive,

211
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:43,366
and you won't give it
so much as a look-see.

212
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,619
- Listen, Detective...
- Or, what? You'll fire me?

213
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:47,370
Two weeks into your new job? I think not.

214
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,289
Have the whole union up your ass.

215
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,791
Or maybe not.
I keep forgetting that you're popular.

216
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,754
Detective Rodriguez,
I'll walk you out. [clears throat]

217
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,302
If I may, you are off this case.

218
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,387
You will not impede it,
you will not obstruct it.

219
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:07,390
And I play poker with your union boss,
by the way.

220
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,934
Terrible fucking poker player. [chuckles]

221
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:11,311
You guys just want it to be Rusty so bad,
don't you?

222
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:14,314
Our only pursuit is justice.

223
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:17,609
Just be sure you do not
stand in that path.

224
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,904
Thank you.

225
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,559
Hey. Can you do me a favor?

226
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,603
I need you to go down to the ME's office,

227
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:55,730
pull all the files
on the Bunny Davis case.

228
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,941
Yeah.

229
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:10,745
[sighs]

230
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:13,957
[groans]

231
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,136
[keys jingle]

232
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:28,430
[rain pattering]

233
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:39,190
[thunder rumbling]

234
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:08,762
[metal clangs]

235
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:18,104
[building creaking, groaning]

236
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,957
[creaking continues]

237
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:44,589
Michael?

238
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:51,221
Michael, you asked me to come here.
What do you want?

239
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,684
Why did you kill her?

240
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:00,230
I didn't kill her.

241
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,024
I had a relationship with her,

242
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:06,361
and I will tell you anything
that you wanna know about that.

243
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:11,366
Michael, I wanna find out who killed her
just as much as you do.

244
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:14,077
Yeah, well, that's funny.
'Cause I have pictures of you.

245
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,037
You have what?

246
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:22,334
I have pictures and videos of you
on the night she died.

247
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,213
- Where?
- Her house!

248
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:28,091
Michael,
you have photographs of her that night?

249
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:30,969
Answer me.

250
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:33,013
You have photographs of that night?

251
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:36,474
You have photographs of other people
going in and out of her house?

252
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,978
You were literally the only one there.

253
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:46,359
Well, I guess, uh,
seems like you were there that night too.

254
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,611
Shut up!

255
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,487
Did you think this through?

256
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:52,365
Were you there other nights?

257
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,535
- [sighs]
- [Rusty] If you have photographs,

258
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:59,039
you need to make sure
that you give them to me,

259
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,999
or you give them to the police.

260
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:04,336
I already gave them to the police.
I met with the district attorney.

261
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:07,631
Then why are we here, Michael?

262
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,760
I wanted to see your face.

263
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,557
See your face? Why?
I don't buy it. [scoffs]

264
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:20,310
I don't know.
It was a very strange conversation,

265
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,854
and the kid is very clearly troubled
like you said, but...

266
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,983
but look, at least we now have evidence
that I wasn't the only one there.

267
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:30,487
- [Raymond] Are you sure he wasn't wired?
- If he was, I was careful.

268
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,280
Mya Winslow, Rusty Sabich.

269
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,198
Hi.

270
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:35,867
I asked Mya to join us
for the status conference.

271
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:38,203
- We gotta get your appearance filed.
- Already done.

272
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,538
- [Raymond] Excellent.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

273
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,874
Though not under these circumstances.

274
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:44,834
You can just observe on this one,
nothing to say.

275
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,546
- You, keep your mouth shut. Not a peep.
- [stammers]

276
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:49,798
This is my show. Don't fuck it up.

277
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,804
[Carolyn] <i>You're fucking it all up.</i>

278
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,016
- [sighs] You're fucking it all up.
- Why?

279
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:05,522
That falling-in-love part.

280
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:08,066
That we promised not to.

281
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,862
I don't think that you can control that.

282
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:15,323
Some things you can control.

283
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:21,288
And I have to be the one to-to...
to control it.

284
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,210
[Tommy] Tab one. Evidentiary exhibits.

285
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:31,882
Uh, path and lab reports
you'll find behind that in tab two.

286
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:35,260
That section is still incomplete
but is being updated daily.

287
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,138
- To be completed when?
- Uh, we're hoping ten days, Your Honor.

288
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,683
Photography and video exhibits
follow in tab three,

289
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:42,893
also to be completed forthwith.

290
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:45,896
We're still gathering,
including street and city cams.

291
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:48,815
Medical findings in tab four,

292
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:52,819
- and scientific exhibits and analysis...
- [stammers, sighs]

293
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:54,529
...behind it in tabs five and six.
What's the problem?

294
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,239
Just hold on a second.

295
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,074
- You've got me down as a witness.
- [Tommy] We do.

296
00:19:58,074 --> 00:20:00,994
One of the charges
is obstruction of justice, Raymond,

297
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:03,663
and Mr. Sabich impeded this investigation.

298
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:06,875
In fact, he compromised it,
and you have information about that.

299
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,669
- This is a stunt.
- [Nico] No. Sorry. Just very quickly,

300
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:11,254
you took this post as counsel

301
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:14,216
while in possession of information
that's material to the charges.

302
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:16,426
- You should've known better.
- Mr. Delay Guardia.

303
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:20,055
Y-You've also got down Dr. Rush,
my client's psychiatrist.

304
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:21,848
[Tommy] We anticipate that
some of the subject matter

305
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:23,266
might qualify as privileged,

306
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,977
and Dr. Rush would be free to claim
that exemption should it apply.

307
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:27,854
- It will be.
- What do you mean, "should it apply"?

308
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,898
You're gonna ask her to come in,
she's gonna assert privilege,

309
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:31,608
and then he's gonna paint it
like we're hiding information.

310
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,818
- We will honor privileged information.
- Withholding evidence.

311
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:37,489
[Laryn] Gentlemen, we're not getting off
on a good bunion here.

312
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:40,283
We have a case to present. I would submit
Your Honor will let us do so.

313
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:45,497
When I took this job years ago,
I had a mentor.

314
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:49,876
He told me,
"Every trial is a bit like a hemorrhoid."

315
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,629
Hemorrhoids don't typically bother me.

316
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:55,590
I can even enjoy them
when properly managed.

317
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,803
I'm not enjoying myself now.

318
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:03,890
This trial will be about evidence and law.

319
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,644
What it won't be about is gamesmanship.
Do I make myself perfectly clear?

320
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:09,437
- [Raymond] Clear.
- Well said. Thank you.

321
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,400
May I also remind the court

322
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,195
that the prosecution has a duty
to turn over all exculpatory evidence.

323
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,447
- [Tommy] We've done so.
- [Raymond] You have?

324
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,491
[Tommy] We've turned over
all exculpatory evidence

325
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,118
per our duty as officers of the court.

326
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:24,202
So if you had evidence, say,

327
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:26,705
that someone else might have motive
to commit this crime...

328
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:27,789
There's no such evidence.

329
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:31,251
...or you may have evidence, say,
that someone else was there that night,

330
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:38,925
maybe someone with a camera
taking pictures and videos.

331
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:44,556
- Mr. Molto?
- Mmm.

332
00:21:44,556 --> 00:21:47,017
- Yeah. I-I got it. I got it.
- [Raymond] Is that...

333
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:48,685
[Tommy]
We just received photographic evidence

334
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:51,062
that we're still in the process
of authenticating.

335
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:53,064
Once that authentication process
is complete,

336
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,274
we will share it with counsel.

337
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:57,652
Who proffered this photographic evidence?

338
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,322
The victim's son.

339
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:03,491
[Raymond] May I ask when it was proffered?

340
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,035
[Tommy]
We are in the process of analyzing it.

341
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:07,537
- And any disclosure would be premature.
- Oh, I see. I see. Hey.

342
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:10,749
You are gonna turn over
that evidence today,

343
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,292
to defense counsel and to me,

344
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:15,462
so we can all
properly analyze it together. Sound good?

345
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:19,049
And, Mr. Molto,

346
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,717
we are ten weeks from trial.

347
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,721
If you choose to hide anything else
from either defense counsel or this court,

348
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,640
I suggest that you not
stick it up your ass

349
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,017
'cause that's the first place
I'm gonna come looking.

350
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:32,145
[Rusty] Raymond was in his element.
You know, he was on fire.

351
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:35,482
And Tommy was in his element.

352
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:37,192
- [Jaden] Mmm.
- [Barbara] Bet he was.

353
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:39,986
The judge granted our motion
to access the scene,

354
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:43,114
and that's not something
that the defense usually gets.

355
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:45,408
- [Jaden] So a good day then?
- [Rusty] It's a good start.

356
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:48,245
That's good. Maybe we'll win,

357
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:51,081
and it'll be so great
that reporters will say,

358
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:54,542
"Rusty Sabich, you just won
the Super Bowl of murder trials.

359
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,003
What are you gonna do now?" [sighs]

360
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,214
And you'll say,
"We're going to Disneyland."

361
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,015
I would like to know
what evidence they have against you.

362
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:10,809
Jaden, not at the table.

363
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:13,186
- [Jaden] Yes, Mom. It's everywhere.
- [Barbara] Not at dinner.

364
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,397
- [Jaden] It's on the news, at school.
- [Barbara] Not at...

365
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:17,691
I just wanna know what is what.

366
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,485
What exactly do they have?

367
00:23:23,863 --> 00:23:25,490
Mmm. Thank you.

368
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,453
[Rusty] Um... [clears throat]

369
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:34,332
...it's circumstantial.

370
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,043
Nobody's gonna be called to the stand
to say they saw me kill her

371
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,170
because I did not kill her.

372
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,300
But I was there that night,
and my DNA is all over her apartment,

373
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,719
and her DNA is all over my car.

374
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,973
And they're gonna say
that I was obsessed with her

375
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:53,560
because there are many, many,
many texts between me and her.

376
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,397
Mostly from me in those last few weeks.

377
00:23:57,397 --> 00:24:00,233
And obviously, there's the evidence
that she was pregnant with...

378
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:08,158
And the fact that she was tied up like a...
[stammers] a prior victim.

379
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:12,412
The killer must have had information
that wasn't available to the public.

380
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,833
Carolyn and I were the only two
most privy to that information,

381
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,085
so they're gonna make the argument

382
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:24,382
that I was in a unique position
to make it look like somebody else did it.

383
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,263
It's circumstantial,
and in a lot of ways it's a stretch,

384
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:32,349
but it's-it's damaging.

385
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,267
And all the evidence,
no matter how circumstantial,

386
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:35,352
points to me.

387
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:41,608
[inhales sharply]

388
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:43,693
And a plea?

389
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:48,531
- I mean, have you thought about that?
- A what?

390
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,242
- [Kyle] A plea.
- Kyle.

391
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:52,410
A guilty plea? Why...
What, do you think I did this, Kyle?

392
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,370
Honey.

393
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,747
I'm just saying,
if they offered manslaughter...

394
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:58,667
Why would I take a plea
for something that I did not do?

395
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,834
[Barbara] Rusty.

396
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:03,255
To avoid a life sentence.
Manslaughter's eight years.

397
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:04,589
Oh, honey.

398
00:25:18,562 --> 00:25:20,564
[breathing heavily]

399
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:27,487
[no audible dialogue]

400
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:31,992
[no audible dialogue]

401
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,077
[heavy breathing continues]

402
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:48,383
[knocks on door]

403
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:51,928
[Barbara sighs]

404
00:25:57,434 --> 00:26:00,478
- He thinks that I did it.
- Rusty, he does not think you did it.

405
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,355
Then why would he ask me
to plead guilty for something

406
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:04,357
- he thinks that I didn't do?
- Because he's scared.

407
00:26:04,357 --> 00:26:06,192
The kid is terrified.

408
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:10,238
That they could put you away forever.
[sighs]

409
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,491
[sighing]

410
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:17,954
Do you think that I... that I should?

411
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,042
Does Jaden?

412
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,421
Do you think that I should
accept a plea bargain?

413
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:29,799
Rusty, no one in this family thinks
you should accept a plea bargain.

414
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:33,136
Kyle was just...

415
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,890
Honey, he was just thinking aloud.

416
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:42,437
He was thinking that I should
plead guilty for murder.

417
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,734
[sighs]

418
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:54,950
Honey, everyone is scared.

419
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,497
[breathes shakily]

420
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:05,835
Kate asked me to "step back"
from the gallery.

421
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:07,003
What? Why?

422
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,048
Bad for business, I guess.

423
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:13,134
- I'm sorry.
- [Kyle] Dad?

424
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,311
Hey.

425
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,022
I didn't mean to say
that I thought you did it.

426
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:27,732
I'm sorry, I just...

427
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:33,196
The way you made it sound
with the evidence and the...

428
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:34,281
I understand.

429
00:27:35,699 --> 00:27:36,700
I'm sorry.

430
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,953
Please don't go. Please don't... [stammers]

431
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:42,205
I'm sorry. [whimpers]

432
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:44,416
[sniffles]

433
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,972
["Obstacle 1" playing]

434
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:06,396
I think we should drop
the obstruction charge.

435
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:07,355
[Tommy] Why?

436
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:12,193
We can make Rusty out to be a bad actor,
but our burden is on homicide...

437
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,278
- Mmm.
- ...all right?

438
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:15,238
It's-It's a bigger hill to climb.

439
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:18,074
The jury are gonna want to get him, sure,

440
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:20,201
but the obstruction charge
allows them to do that

441
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,662
without finding him guilty of murder.

442
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:24,497
I just think
we just put one thing on the menu.

443
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:26,166
Right, but the abusive process charge

444
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,001
speaks to his attempts
to impede the investigation,

445
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,502
- which goes to his guilt.
- Think about it.

446
00:28:29,502 --> 00:28:31,922
That's all I'm gonna say. Right?

447
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:37,677
Are you up to this?
Trying this particular case?

448
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:40,013
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, I am.

449
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:43,558
See? It's that.
That response right there makes me nervous

450
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:48,104
because it speaks to a certain zeal
that Raymond is gonna exploit.

451
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:49,022
[chuckles]

452
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,026
- Tommy, listen to me.
- [sniffs]

453
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:59,741
The words that shall attach
to this prosecution are "methodical,

454
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:01,284
exhaustive, and fair."

455
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:06,081
Words that shall not be associated
are "vindictive, maniacal, and vicious."

456
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:09,876
I understand, Nico.
Just don't talk to me like I'm a monkey.

457
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,216
Do you remember the first thing you said
when I made you chief deputy prosecutor?

458
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:18,426
- I believe I expressed my gratitude.
- [chuckles]

459
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:23,098
No. The first thing you said was,
"The girls are sure gonna like me now."

460
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,225
Turned out to be true.

461
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:28,144
I mean, there's just a part of you,
may-maybe it's your essence,

462
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:31,064
which just needs this validation, this...

463
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:33,441
- You know, to impress somebody.
- Oh.

464
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:37,112
And I know smart people
with a persecution complex,

465
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:41,575
and-and some with a narcissistic complex.

466
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:44,494
Somehow you have both. It's like a duplex.

467
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:48,039
Sounds expensive to fix.

468
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:53,003
- You hate Rusty. That's clear.
- No, no.

469
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:58,425
No, I don't hate Rusty.
I... This is incredibly difficult for me.

470
00:29:58,425 --> 00:29:59,593
This is not difficult.

471
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:03,763
It's-It's because all the-the slights
and the digs and the nicks

472
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:06,474
and the... and the cuts,
it... it eats at you.

473
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:09,144
You want another drink?

474
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:10,729
Okay.

475
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:12,480
We need some hard evidence for murder.

476
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:15,692
That's coming.

477
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:24,868
So the site visit at Carolyn's
is later today.

478
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:27,287
You feel up to that?

479
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:29,122
Yes. I will be there.

480
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:30,040
Good.

481
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:32,584
- [Rusty] This fucking indictment.
- What are you doing?

482
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:35,045
"Trespass with force and arms."
It's just... It's...

483
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,214
I mean,
I've dictated this a million times,

484
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:38,465
but to read it about me is...

485
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:43,053
So I've called, uh,
our friend Mr. Molto twice,

486
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:44,846
and I've left messages for him.

487
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:47,140
Well, if he doesn't call you back,
he's gonna be in contempt.

488
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,143
I left the car open. I'll be right back.

489
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:52,187
[door opens, closes]

490
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:53,730
[sighs]

491
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:16,836
Did you love her?

492
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:21,049
- Did I what?
- Carolyn.

493
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,093
Did you love her?

494
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,471
Um...

495
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:31,851
I'm actually not really sure
why that's relevant. [scoffs]

496
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:35,230
Raymond has tasked me with
building your narrative for trial

497
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:37,691
- in case you should have to testify.
- Uh-huh.

498
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:39,651
So he wants me to testify?

499
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:40,735
Well, just in case.

500
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:48,076
[clears throat]

501
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:53,248
Well, was it about lust?

502
00:31:54,457 --> 00:31:56,960
- Love? Both?
- [sighs]

503
00:31:57,544 --> 00:31:58,795
Okay, um...

504
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,716
[chuckles] ...both.

505
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,679
[breathes deeply]

506
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:12,142
Do you remember when you first felt
an emotional attachment?

507
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,853
Not when you first
wanted to have sex, but...

508
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:16,146
- Yeah. No, I understand.
- Okay.

509
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:18,690
Yeah.

510
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:23,320
We had a...

511
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,827
We had a case. Um, sexual assault.

512
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:33,622
The victim was a little girl.

513
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:35,290
These are twins. This is...

514
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,919
[Rusty] <i>We're not trained in kindness
as prosecutors.</i>

515
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,004
- <i>It's not a prerequisite.</i> [chuckles]
- Can you tell me...

516
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:43,215
[Rusty] <i>In fact,
sometimes I think it's trained out of us,</i>

517
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:45,592
but not Carolyn.

518
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:46,676
[girl] <i>I don't know.</i>

519
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:47,761
[Rusty] <i>And that day,</i>

520
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:52,641
there was something about the tenderness
that she showed that fragile little girl.

521
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:56,728
- This is Dell.
- [Carolyn] Dell.

522
00:32:56,728 --> 00:33:00,649
- This is Perla.
- [Carolyn] That's a lot of people.

523
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:02,817
- Yeah.
- Are they friends?

524
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:04,611
- They're family.
- They're family?

525
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:11,201
So it might get a little scary in there,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

526
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,040
But, um, I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.

527
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:23,296
And then if you get too scared,
then you can raise your hand like this.

528
00:33:25,882 --> 00:33:28,385
[chuckles] Good. [sniffles]

529
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,804
And I can come over,
and I can hold your hand.

530
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:33,473
We can stop whenever you want. [sniffles]

531
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:34,558
I can hold you,

532
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:38,603
and I can ask the judge
if we can go for a walk.

533
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:41,815
And I'll make sure
that you're always safe.

534
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:46,736
Do you think you can trust me with that?
[sniffles] To keep you safe?

535
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:48,572
- [chuckles, sniffles] Yeah?
- Yeah.

536
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:50,282
You're doing so good.

537
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,743
- [Rusty] <i>That was it.</i>
- [chuckles]

538
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,329
I guess that was the moment.

539
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:03,044
When you crossed over the great
I'm-gonna-fuck-up-my-life-forever divide.

540
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,797
Love isn't what people tell you
that it is, Mya.

541
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:07,507
I'm sure that I don't
have to tell you that.

542
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:08,842
But in my experience,

543
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,595
it's just something that grows
until one day...

544
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,140
you just find yourself needing someone.

545
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,476
That's how it was with Carolyn.

546
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,146
So, yeah.

547
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:26,192
Fucked up my life forever... [sighs]

548
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:28,945
...but I did not cross the other divide.

549
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,407
I would never have hurt her.

550
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,702
Somebody else did that,

551
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:40,289
and whoever that person is
is having a good fucking laugh

552
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,459
while everyone comes after me.

553
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,713
[players, spectators clamoring]

554
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,257
[umpire] Full count, 3-2.

555
00:34:57,515 --> 00:34:59,184
- [grunts]
- [umpire] Strike three!

556
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:00,393
- He's out!
- [cheers]

557
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:35,512
[chuckles] This is beautiful.

558
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,559
You're desperate.

559
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:52,279
[investigators chattering]

560
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,973
[laughs]

561
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:24,436
[laughs]

562
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:27,689
[Raymond] So we just got the big dump
from Delay's office.

563
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:29,482
Expect them to start burying us...

564
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:30,609
Do you want another one?

565
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:32,360
<i>...with discovery tonnage:
documents, evidence, whatever,</i>

566
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,695
so we gotta keep pace.

567
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:36,072
Did they turn over the labs?

568
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:38,450
[Raymond] Not yet.

569
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:43,163
Well, it might be in this latest dump.
You never know.

570
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:46,583
- [both moaning]
- The forensics team is standing by.

571
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:49,794
It's a little needle in the haystack
at this point, you know?

572
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:52,756
But who knows?
We may find something they didn't.

573
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:55,050
My DNA must be all over this place.

574
00:36:57,886 --> 00:36:59,930
Rusty, we stipulated that you were here.

575
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:04,476
The two of you were having an affair.
It does not mean that you killed her.

576
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:09,272
Unless they find her blood in your car,
which they won't, right?

577
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:17,280
[breathing heavily] I know.

578
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:19,783
I keep seeing it too.

579
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,454
[sighs]

580
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,791
[Raymond] Listen. Talk to me for a second.

581
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:34,297
Rigo tells me
that you're trying to run down

582
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:38,093
the contaminated semen specimen
in the Bunny Davis case.

583
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:39,052
Yeah.

584
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:43,223
- If we offer the idea of another suspect...
- Ray.

585
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:46,101
...we can pretty much assume
the obligation to deliver one.

586
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,978
- And if we fail...
- Ray.

587
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:51,064
The prosecution is gonna show
the most brutal photographs of Carolyn

588
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:53,400
- on that night. It's gonna be horrific.
- [breathes heavily]

589
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,151
And then the jury's
gonna want someone to blame,

590
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:57,862
and if we don't have an alternative,
it's gonna be me.

591
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:01,283
- Let it go.
- No.

592
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:04,494
[Rigo] <i>Evidence number 13,
voicemail number four...</i>

593
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:06,496
- [sighs]
- <i>...victim's message on defendant's phone.</i>

594
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:09,249
[Carolyn] <i>What do you want, Rusty,
out of this?</i>

595
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:10,959
- <i>I don't have much else to give.</i>
- [sighs]

596
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,461
[Rusty] <i>I understand
wanting distance for a while</i>

597
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,047
<i>but that-that's partly
what has been so difficult for me.</i>

598
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:17,591
- [grunts]
- [Carolyn] <i>I would be open</i>

599
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,343
<i>to having another conversation
if you think that it will be helpful.</i>

600
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:22,178
[Rusty] <i>No, I hate pretending
that you're not there.</i>

601
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:24,347
<i>I don't understand
why you're just not picking up.</i>

602
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:26,558
[Carolyn] <i>I don't think you understand
my perspective on things.</i>

603
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:27,934
- [exhales]
- <i>I need you to stop</i>

604
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,895
<i>calling me like this, Rusty.
This isn't fair.</i>

605
00:38:29,895 --> 00:38:31,980
[Rusty] <i>I've never disagreed
with anything more.</i>

606
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,398
<i>All the evidence I have
tells me you love me.</i>

607
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:34,900
We'll present to you physical, scientific,

608
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,110
forensic evidence that will lead you
to make your own con...

609
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,195
That will lead you to form
your own conclusions.

610
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:42,574
Think! [mumbles] Facts!

611
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:46,328
[dog barking]

612
00:38:48,872 --> 00:38:49,873
[phone beeps]

613
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:05,138
[sighs] Fuck. [groans]

614
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,807
All right. [breathing heavily]

615
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,930
[sighs]
