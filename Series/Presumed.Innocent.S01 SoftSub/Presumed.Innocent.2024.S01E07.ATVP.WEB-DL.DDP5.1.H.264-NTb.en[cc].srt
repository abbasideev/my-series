- [paramedic] IV started in the right arm.

00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:18,478
[doctor] Okay. Let's make sure his O2 is
at eight liters.

8
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:22,857
He's gonna need a 12-lead EKG,
a full blood panel, CBC and cross.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,324
He's going into V-tach, check his pulse.

10

there's no rule.</i>

27
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,650
<i>It's up to the judge.</i>

28

31
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:54,991
It seems so.

Hey, you want something to drink?

36
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,381
You want some water
or something like that?

37
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:11,591
Yeah.

38
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,676
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah?

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,394
Lorraine, I just want to say I'm so sorry.

40
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:23,979
And, uh, if there's any way I can help...

41
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:28,066
I know that rings hollow...
but, um, whatever I can do...

42
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,652
Um...

43
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,114
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:35,949
- Okay.
- [Lorraine] Thanks.

45
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,158
- [doctor] Mrs. Horgan?
- Yeah?

46
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,202
- Mrs... Mrs. Horgan?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,538
He's gonna be okay. Improved, even.

48
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,164
- Really?
- [doctor] It wasn't a coronary.

49
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,583
- It was a bradycardia.
- [Lorraine] Oh, my...

50
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,794
It's an... an electrical issue that
slowed his heart rate down to a near stop.

51
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,338
We gave him a pacemaker.
There's no neurological damage.

52
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:54,384
- He'll walk out improved.
- Thank you, Doctor. [chuckles]

53
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,219
S... So he's gonna be okay?

54
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,721
- He's gonna be all right, fine.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,973
Better. He's in recovery right now.

56
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:02,684
He'll be in his room in a few hours
and you'll be able to see him then.

57
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,352
Oh, my God. [cries, sniffles]

58
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,396
- Thank you. Thank you.
- [doctor] Yeah. You're welcome.

59
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,190
- Yeah? [chuckles]
- [cries]

60
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,035
[Nico] We got a problem.

61
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:23,038
Yeah, we got a problem.

62
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:28,084
[sighs] Uh, the jury just saw Rusty
go all hero an...

63
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,837
We need to move for a mistrial.

64
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,797
- What?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,341
- We... We...
- We're winning.

66
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:37,636
- [chuckling] I'm not so sure of that.
- A mistrial and he walks.

67
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:40,180
- No. We don't know that.
- [Tommy] Yes, we do. Come on.

68
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,890
Second time through,
he's gonna know our hand.

69
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,435
Think about this. As-As lying,
cheating psychopaths go,

70
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,354
- he's a pretty charming guy, right?
- It doesn't...

71
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:50,607
And he just saved a human life
in front of the jury.

72
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:53,652
It can also be argued that
the jury just saw him act impulsively,

73
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,195
physically in a way
that they saw him snap.

74
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,821
But you have to just trust the jury.

75
00:03:57,781 --> 00:04:00,450
Know that they're more equipped
to visualize what happened that night

76
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,910
than either of us.

[reporters clamoring]

84
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,207
[Laryn] So what are we thinking?

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,501
Are we thinking?

86
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,586
[inhales sharply]

87
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:56,339
Mr. Delay Guardia,
you certainly seem cognitively overdue.

88
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:00,468
Mmm. I'm just weighing
the principles of judicial economics

89
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,095
versus those of fairness, you know?

90
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,806
We recognize, as agents of the court,
that we have a duty

91
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,434
to ensure proceedings are free
of prejudice and undue bias.

92
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:08,727
What the fuck are you talking about?

93
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,395
We left law school years ago.

94
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,480
- What are you talking about?
- [Nico] I'm saying that

95
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,316
we think a mistrial is justified.

96
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,192
- Well, that's all you had to say.
- We oppose.

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,613
[Laryn scoffs]

98
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:21,072
You wanna keep going?

99
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:23,533
I'm prepared to take over.

100
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,202
- Immediately?
- You're gonna take over?

101
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,789
Tomorrow. I'd like a day.

102
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,875
Mr. Delay Guardia?

103
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,879
Uh... [chuckles] S-S-Sorry.

104
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,049
Yeah. Yeah.
The prosecution stands ready to proceed.

105
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,385
I'd like to represent myself.

106
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:48,475
I'm sorry?

107
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:52,062
I'd like to take over as lead counsel.
My appearance is already on record

108
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:53,980
and Ms. Winslow's experience
is more limited than my own.

109
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,233
- No, a person cannot stand as a witness...
- [Rusty] She can serve as second chair.

110
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,817
...and an advocate in the same proceeding.

111
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,986
I will not stand as a witness.
I'll stipulate that right now.

112
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,530
You will be a witness. You're gonna be
the most clever witness of all time

113
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,950
'cause you'll get to put your point
of view and your demeanor to the jury...

114
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,285
- My lead counsel is incapacitated.
- ...without facing cross-examination.

115
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,371
I will not offer
anything evidentiary or testimonial.

116
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:12,207
And may I remind the court
that it is my right.

117
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,876
Then the court will remind you,
Mr. Sabich,

118
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,753
if you even hint at
giving your version of events,

119
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:20,382
I will allow prosecution
to put you into that witness chair,

120
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:23,552
where you will be subject
to full cross-examination.

121
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:25,512
And should you blow a hole in your foot,

122
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:28,098
you will not be granted appeal
on Sixth Amendment grounds

123
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:30,433
of having a fool for an attorney.

124
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,893
You're gonna go <i>pro per</i>?

125
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,521
[Laryn] So long as he doesn't give
testimony, there's no bar to it.

126
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,190
I understand, Your Honor.

127
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,233
[scoffs]

128
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,401
Bad idea.

129
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,571
But you're free to indulge it.

130
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,368
I'll instruct the jury,
and we shall resume tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

131
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,957
You might wanna rethink.

132
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:01,256
How-How can this be?
You promised me that you would shield him.

133
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,675
- We'll do our best.
- [Caldwell] You'll do your best?

134

You'll do your best?

135
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,805
Is no one watching out for my son?

136
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:12,225
He will now be cross-examined
by the very man who murdered his mother.

137
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:14,811

to be a part of.

167
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:03,748
Yes.

168
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,918
Did she ever tell you why she didn't want
you to be a part of her life?

169
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:09,629
No.

170
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,425
Did your father ever tell you
why she didn't want to?

171
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:16,845
No.

172
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:19,681
Well, that must have made you
pretty angry.

173
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:21,933
Is that a fair statement?

174
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:23,852
Not enough to kill her.

175
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:24,936
Careful.

176
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:27,772
- Raymond.
- I'm just watching. [chuckles]

177
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:30,859
That's interesting, Michael,
'cause in the last few weeks of her life,

178
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:35,322
you had a number of text exchanges
with your mother.

179
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,952
Did you write her,
"It would be easier if you were dead"?

180
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:42,037
Did you text her that?

181
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,080
She didn't just hurt me.

182
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,290
She hurt my father.

183
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,002
{\an8}"Just really fucking mad at you.
You ruined my life."

184
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,588
Did you text her that?

185
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:54,799
You wished for her death.

186
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,887
No, I said it would be easier.

187
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,056
People move on from death.

188
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,515
Divorce is harder.

189
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,017
That's what I meant.

190
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:07,812
Okay. Leave it there. Just... That's good.

191
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,189
[Rusty] <i>You took this video of me</i>

192
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:11,024
entering your mother's house
on the night that she died,

193
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,610
and you testified that
you had seen me go there before.

194
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,820
So you were aware
that your mother and I were lovers.

195
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,325
Yes.

196
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:23,745
[Rusty] The idea that
she didn't want you in her life,

197
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:27,832
but that she would have affection for me,
that didn't make you hate me at all?

198
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,252
I hate you because you killed her.

199
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,505
Go easy, Rusty.

200
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,050
[spectators murmuring]

201
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,805
So after you took this video,
what did you do?

202
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:42,973
[Michael] I left.

203
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,476
And how long after you saw me
enter her house did you leave?

204
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,478
- Pretty much right away.
- And where did you go?

205
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:49,646
I went home.

206
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:51,648
Who was at home?

207
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:52,816
My father.

208
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,152
Just-Just the two of you?

209
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:57,904
[Michael] Yeah.

210
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:59,072
[Rusty] Anybody else?

211
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,032
No, it was just us.

212
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:04,452
So nobody to vouch for you but him.

213
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:07,706
And nobody to vouch for him but you.

214
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:09,332
- Objection.
- Overruled.

215
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,711
Did you tell your father that you saw
your mother's lover go into her house?

216
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:17,257
[Laryn]
Please answer the question, Michael.

217
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,678
I don't remember if I told him anything.

218
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:23,930
So it is possible...

219
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,018
it is possible that you told your father

220
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:30,937
that you saw your mother's lover
go into her house

221
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,230
the night that she was killed?

222
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,193
I don't remember telling him anything.

223
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,779
There are a number of
documents that were confiscated

224
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,574
by the police department on your computer.

225
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:46,119
And it showed that you had a very keen
interest in your mother's past cases.

226
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:49,122
You went on some true crime websites
and you were digging for information

227
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,999
that wasn't available
in the mainstream media,

228
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,585
including Bunny Davis.

229
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:56,296
- Objection.
- Sustained. Ask questions, counsel.

230
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:57,505
He's got to be careful.

231
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:58,840
- Did you kill your mother?
- Objection!

232
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,342
How about your father?
Did he kill your mother?

233
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,594
- Wow.
- Tell me you have a good faith basis.

234
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:06,014
I have grounds to accuse
neither the witness or his father.

235
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:06,973
How could I possibly?

236
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,351
After the briefest and most negligent...

237
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:11,269
- [clamoring]
- ...of investigations by the police,

238
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,313
they were both dismissed
by the state attorney's office...

239
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:14,522
- He's out of control...
- [Tommy] Your Honor!

240
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,399
For the record, did you kill your mother?

241
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,109
Hey! You sick fuck!

242
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:19,694
Dad!

243
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:22,656
- That's enough! Enough!
- Mr. Caldwell, step back.

244
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:23,949
Are you fucking serious?

245
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:26,284
- [bailiff 1] Move.
- Step back, Mr. Caldwell.

246
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,869
You're supposed to be watching him.

247
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,747
[spectators chattering]

248
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:39,422
[reporter 1] Mr. Sabich, were you scared
when Dalton Caldwell came after you?

249
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,675
[reporter 2] Can the prosecution recover
from such a misstep?

250
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,468
[reporter 1]
Were the Caldwells in this together?

251
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:45,971
[reporter 3] Why do you think so many
loose ends weren't investigated?

252
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:08,577
[Nico] You know, Raymond used to have
this saying when a case went south.

253
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:13,915
He'd say there's medium-rare fucked,
there's medium-plus, there's well-done.

254
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:16,001
I think we might be well-done fucked.

255
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:17,085
[Tommy] He came off as desperate.

256
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,129
He's pointing the finger
at everyone but himself.

257
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:20,797
[Nico] All right. [sighs]

258
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:22,340
All right. All right. Shh.

259
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,887
So they established that somebody
with hatred toward Carolyn Polhemus was

260
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:30,807
at the scene who may have known
details of the Bunny Davis case.

261
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,767
They pinged Liam Reynolds

262
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:37,105
and then the father,
who went fucking psycho.

263
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,067
So we... we... Rigo.

264
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,485
- We call fucking Rigo.
- Rigo?

265
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,446
- No, Rigo is firmly in Rusty's camp.
- Yeah.

266
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,406
So was Eugenia.
It's all about asking the right questions.

267
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,825
- Rigo hates me.
- She doesn't hate me. I can take her.

268
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,660
- No.
- Yeah.

269
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,828
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No.

270
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,246
No, I'll tell you why.

271
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:54,414
'Cause if we don't,

272
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:57,709
we're well-done
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt fucked.

273
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,840
- [Rusty] What is Rigo going to say?
- [Eugenia] I don't know.

274
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,842
No, come on. Bullshit.
You two are friends.

275
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:08,011
- Just tell me what she's go...
- No, you two are friends.

276
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:11,056
[stammers] She is gonna testify to what?

277
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,102
Probably as to what I saw, Rusty,
and what I'm fucking seeing right now.

278
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,062
What does that mean?

279
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:20,523
You're fucking going rogue,
like you are right here, right now.

280
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:22,275
- [Rusty] Wh...
- [sighs]

281
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:25,695
You know I didn't want to testify, right?

282
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,531
I know that you know that.

283
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,450
[sighs] Oh, my God.

284
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:34,746
Did I get this whole thing wrong?

285
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:38,375
- Did I get...
- What do...

286
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,627
Carolyn was a drug.

287
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,588
You had an addiction.
Addictions destroy lives.

288
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:48,009
God. It's one thing to destroy you,

289
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,179
but you weren't about
to let her destroy your family.

290
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:56,351
[cries] Oh, my God.

291
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:58,061
I think she told you that night...

292
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,524
that she was gonna keep the baby,
didn't she?

293
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:09,030
Did she tell you that she was gonna keep
the baby that night?

294
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:11,741
She was gonna keep that kid.

295
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,119
- Your kid.
- Get out of my car.

296
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,000
Get out of my car.

297
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:35,432
[door closes]

298
00:17:57,704 --> 00:18:00,165
[Nico] <i>Liam Reynolds was not involved
in Carolyn Polhemus's murder,</i>

299
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:02,834
and yet the two of you went back to prison
to see Liam Reynolds.

300
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,545
- Is that right?
- We did.

301
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:07,464
Why?

302
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:10,383
[stammers] We'll let Rusty tell us.

303
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,263
[Rusty]
<i>Even if you did have Carolyn killed,</i>

304
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,516
<i>it could work in your favor.</i>

305
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:24,814
<i>You'd have to have an accomplice,
which means you'd have something to trade.</i>

306
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:27,025
<i>Okay, so just imagine,</i>

307
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:32,113
<i>right now, you're serving
a life sentence for killing Bunny Davis.</i>

308
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,698
<i>But by pointing us to Carolyn,</i>

309
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,409
<i>you could possibly see
the street again, you know?</i>

310
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,371
<i>Or even if you had a hand
in the murder too.</i>

311
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,748
Now that... that is perversity.

312
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:47,379
So... So, uh, just to be clear, uh,
you're telling me incriminating myself...

313
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:49,130
- If you had an accomplice.
- ...in a prosecutor's murder,

314
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,299
- could lead to my freedom?
- [Rusty] Yes.

315
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,471
What's certain is that you are currently
serving a life sentence without parole.

316
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:59,641
And I am offering you an
opportunity to change that.

317
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,729
Oh, God. [chuckles]

318
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,275
<i>This is beautiful.</i>

319
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,861
No! God Almighty.

320
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,118
I just... I had no fucking idea.

321
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:20,203
[Reynolds] <i>You're desperate.</i>

322
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:25,500
[Nico] A reduced sentence in return for
confessing to Carolyn Polhemus's murder.

323
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:28,879
I wasn't present.
I didn't know he was gonna do that.

324
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:30,297
Did you take issue
with this attempted bribe?

325
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:31,339
Objection!

326
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:32,382
- Sustained.
- [Nico] I apologize.

327
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:35,427
Did you take issue with this approach?

328
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:40,515
I did. When he told me what happened,
I said I thought he way crossed the line.

329
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,600
Yeah.

330
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,895
And did he respond?

331
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:49,858
Yeah, he said something to the effect of...

332
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:53,069
It's my life on the line.
I'll do whatever I have to.

333
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:54,571
What a hero.

334
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:56,865
When you were first assigned this case
by the defendant,

335
00:19:56,865 --> 00:20:00,869
were you given any particular directives
as to the collection of evidence?

336
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:06,583
All evidence, forensics and otherwise,
was to go straight to him and only him.

337
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,627
And were you given
any particular directives

338
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,420
as to whom the evidence

339
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,924
and the forensics and otherwise
should be particularly shielded from?

340
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:16,176
Mr. Molto and you.

341
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,054
[Nico] That's disappointing.

342
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:25,352
Your witness.

343
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:28,605
[clears throat]

344
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:35,987
Here we go.

345
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:40,867
I was desperate to prove my innocence,
at all times,

346
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,119
of charges that I felt wrongly accused of.

347
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,329
Is that a fair statement?

348
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,122
Okay.

349
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:48,708
And I steadfastly maintained my innocence

350
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,545
in the death of Carolyn Polhemus
at all times.

351
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:54,172
- Did I not?
- You did.

352
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:59,678
And in your experience, Detective,
is it unusual for a prosecutor to ask you

353
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:01,680
to keep information
between the two of them?

354
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,182
In my experience, no, it's not.

355
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:11,314
And you're aware that I asked you
to keep the evidence between the two of us

356
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:13,400
precisely because I did not trust

357
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,820
that Mr. Molto or Mr. Della Guardia
would conduct a fair investigation.

358
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,780
Is that also a fair statement?

359
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:21,199
Yes.

360
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:25,912
Thank you.

361
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:05,994
[panting]

362
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:11,833
- [Barbara] Hi.
- Hey.

363
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:14,878
[Barbara sighs]

364
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,261
How are you doing?

365
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:28,391
[panting] Yeah, you know...
[stammers] ...they...

366
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:30,977
they pulled up two witnesses
to assert my...

367
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:35,899
And I was a little too zealous
in my assertion of my innocence.

368
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,568
You know, whatever.
So what? Case is still good. We're good.

369
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,695
- [pants]
- You went back to using these?

370
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:43,031
[panting]

371
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:44,991
[Barbara] Hmm?

372
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:48,787
I mean, I need to focus.

373
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:54,542
How am I supposed to do that, huh?

374
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:58,338
Mmm.

375
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:08,431
[sighs] You just should've told me, Rusty.

376
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:14,104
[sighs, panting]

377
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:43,258
[all cheering, chuckling]

378
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:46,511
- So good. So good. [chuckles] Yeah.
- [chuckles] Oh, yeah. Thank you.

379
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:00,567
All rise.

380
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:03,403
The court is now in session.

381
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,156
The honorable Judge Lyttle presiding.

382
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:08,158
Be seated.

383
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,204
Okay then, Mr. Molto.

384
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:14,789
Does the State have anything else?

385
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:15,999
[Tommy] Yes, Your Honor.

386
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:21,504
The People call Rusty Sabich.

387
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,006
[people gasping, murmuring]

388
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,091
[gavel raps]

389
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:30,805
What the fuck was that?

390
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:35,227
Well, since Mr. Sabich insisted
on testifying through Detective Rodriguez,

391
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:37,354
it's only fair that he be sworn in
and subjected to cross.

392
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:38,813
I didn't hear an objection.

393
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:41,399
I didn't feel the need to,
as the court made it very clear

394
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:43,151
if the defendant even hinted
at his version...

395
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:44,277
[stammers] No, I did not testify.

396
00:24:44,277 --> 00:24:45,987
I cross-examined a witness
that you called.

397
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,906
But you went beyond the scope
of our direct.

398
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:49,282
You asserted your innocence.

399
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:50,617
[Rusty] You called the witness

400
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:53,870
and you called the detective
to establish my guilt and my dishonesty,

401
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,747
and my cross went
to my truthfulness and innocence,

402
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:58,124
well within my scope of direct.

403
00:24:58,792 --> 00:24:59,960
You gave your version.

404
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:05,006
I warned you, should you even introduce
even a morsel

405
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,883
of something that's not in evidence...

406
00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:09,135
You did exactly that.

407
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:14,683
All right, you got two choices.

408
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:16,393
You want a mistrial, I'll give you one.

409
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,228
No questions asked.

410
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:22,190
I won't force you to go on.
But if we do go on, you get in that chair.

411
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:25,360
You opened the door on this.

412
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,115
Take the mistrial, Rusty.

413
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:44,921
I'll testify.

414
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,931
- Mya. Mya, they wanted a mistrial.
- The fuck was that?

415
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:56,433
- [stammers] No.
- They know they're losing.

416
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,351
- That's why they called me!
- Maybe, maybe.

417
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:00,145
Or maybe they wanted to get you
on the stand,

418
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,605
where you'll be an easy fucking target.

419
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,189
Fine, put me in the witness chair.

420
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:05,775
Fine. Let's have Molto's narcissism

421
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:07,193
- on full display.
- Why? [sighs]

422
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:08,236
And yours won't?

423
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:10,113
What is that supposed to mean?

424
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,282
Did you... Did you do it on purpose?

425
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:14,951
[breathes shakily] What?

426
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:16,202
Open the door.

427
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:18,038
- What do you think...
- You introduced testimony.

428
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,623
- Did you do it on purpose?
- No...

429
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:21,333
[stammers] Why would I do that?

430
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,920
'Cause you're Rusty Sabich,
and you can do whatever you want, right?

431
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,048
Mya, maybe... just maybe...

432
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:31,384
I did it because I know
what the fuck I'm doing. [scoffs]

433
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:33,929
I don't think so.

434
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,225
I'm done.

435
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,561
[sighs]

436
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:52,280
{\an8}<i>So, Rusty Sabich is expected to
take the stand in his own defense,</i>

437
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,826
{\an8}<i>which means that he'll not only be
a defendant, he'll be an advocate.</i>

438
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:58,536
<i>He's also gonna be a witness as well.</i>

439
00:26:58,536 --> 00:26:59,621
What?

[Rae] <i>He is not going to be
having a second chair,</i>

441
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:04,251
<i>which means
that he is going to be flying solo.</i>

442
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,420
{\an8}<i>A lot resting
on his shoulders in this trial.</i>

443
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:11,925
[anchor] <i>It feels like Sabich has really
found himself backed into a corner.</i>

444
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:13,677
<i>And I don't know if anything short
of a miracle...</i>

445
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:14,719
Oh, God, Rusty.

446
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,930
<i>...is going to be able to get him out of it.</i>

447

<i>In other news...</i>

448
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:19,516
[Jaden] Pills. What kind of pills?

449
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:21,893
- [Kyle] He's taking Ritalin.
- Are you serious?

450
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:25,730
Yeah, I heard Mom on the phone
with her therapist,

451
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,275
and I guess he's taken it
before for big trials.

452
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,944
Makes him sharper.

453
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:32,988
Yeah.

454
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:37,492
And he's taking it now
before he testifies tomorrow?

455
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:39,578
Yeah, it's fucking stupid.

456
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:54,134
Is it possible to, um,

457
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:59,723
have some of that Rusty Sabich,
um, fairy dust?

458
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:05,520
I-I don't know if it's...
if it's something I can, uh, give you.

459
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:07,522
[chuckles]

460
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:27,042
...of course I wanted to talk to her,
but I swear nothing happened...

461
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:42,766
I needed to see her
and tell her that it was...

462
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:43,850
that it was over.

463
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:51,233
I needed her to know that...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

464
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,327
Please tell me you didn't
spend the whole night here.

465
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:04,496
No, I came in early.

466
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,250
All right. You, uh... You ready?

467
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,752
Yeah, I'm ready.

468
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,837
[chuckles] Great.

469
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:14,839
So, big day.

470
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:19,052
I was just thinking about law school
and how hard we worked.

471
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:23,223
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, just give me one day, Nico.

472
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:25,475
One day,
when I can just say it was all worth it.

473
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:28,270
Today is that day, Tommy.

00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:32,644
Are you sure that it's safe
to be in the courtroom?

507
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:35,855
Really. Doctors, they say I'm good. You?

508
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:42,279
Yeah.

509
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:46,741
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

510
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,618
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

511
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:50,036
- I do.
- Have a seat.

512
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:03,216
[Tommy sniffs]

513
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,805
Mr. Sabich...

514
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:13,143
you stated that
you maintained your innocence

515
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:15,186
at all times with Detective Rodriguez.

516
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:17,480
- Correct.
- And that was truthful?

517
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:18,982
It was.

518
00:32:18,982 --> 00:32:20,734
You were truthful with her
about everything?

519
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:23,612
I did not disclose
my relationship with the victim.

520
00:32:24,195 --> 00:32:25,238
Did you disclose to her

521
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:27,490
that you were present
at the victim's house on the night of?

522
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,785
- Eventually.
- Eventually?

523
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:33,455
So when you first assigned this case
to Detective Rodriguez

524
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:36,833
in your capacity
as Chief Deputy Prosecutor,

525
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:41,171
did you tell her that you were present
at the scene of the crime on the night of?

526
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:42,255
I did not.

527
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:45,634
Did you tell anyone
that was connected to the case?

528
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:46,760
I did not kill her.

529
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,930
Are the first 48 hours the most important
in any investigation?

530
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,057
And would it have been helpful
for the police

531
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,726
and the investigatory team
to just know that you were there?

532
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:55,852
You made your point, Tommy.

533
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:57,812
I did not disclose my presence.

534
00:32:57,812 --> 00:33:00,482
- Were you in love with her?
- I fell in love with her.

535
00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:03,777
[Tommy] Is it fair to say
you were obsessed with her?

536
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:06,613
I was in love with her.
As to what qualifies as obsession...

537
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:09,407
Sending 30 texts or emails
on or near the day of her death.

538
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,201
- Would that qualify?
- I was in love with her.

539
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:14,955
On the night of her death, you went there
hoping that she would take you back?

540
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:16,915
I did.

541
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:20,377
Did you send these texts
in the hours before her death?

542
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,379
[Tommy] "This is not right.
You can't do this.

543
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:25,507
I'll not let you treat me this way.
Answer my fucking calls."

544
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:26,841
- You sent those?
- I did.

545
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,260
And how about this one?

546
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:31,137
"I want to spend
the rest of my life with you."

547
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:35,475
Did you send Carolyn that text?

548
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:37,519
Did you tell her you wanted to
spend the rest of your life with her?

549
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,478
I was in love with her.

550
00:33:38,478 --> 00:33:40,939
- Were you angry with her?
- I was frustrated.

551
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:42,857
Mmm. Frustrated, like this text?

552
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,652
[Tommy] "Answer my fucking calls.

553
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:47,904
{\an8}Who the fuck do you think you are,
treating me this way?"

554
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:50,073
Is that frustration
or would that qualify as anger?

555
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:52,033
It would qualify as passion.

556
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,494
And passion can blind a person.

557
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,706
And I certainly lost sight of the things
that were most important in my life.

558
00:33:57,706 --> 00:33:59,749
My... My wife and my children.

559
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:03,336
Passion is a dangerous drug.

560
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:05,589
One that you're not immune to yourself,
Tommy.

561
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:09,175
So consumed with trying to take me down

562
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:13,054
that you have lost sight of the fact
that you have no real evidence.

563
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:14,972
Yes, I was in love with her.

564
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,729
Yes, I did not disclose my presence,
but I did not kill her.

565
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:25,191
- Did you strike her with a fire poker?
- I never hit her.

566
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,526
I am not a violent person.

567
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:31,030
[Tommy] Mr. Ratzer,
could you please stand?

568
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:36,870
Have you ever encountered
this person before?

569
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,413
There is a context to that.

570
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:41,666
This is footage
from the adjacent house to yours.

571
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,585
The two of you, correct?

572
00:34:48,006 --> 00:34:50,675
[Tommy] Does that fairly
and accurately capture the context?

573
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,844
Your Honor, this is unfair surprise.

574
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,054
Offer to impeach.

575
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:57,182
The witness just testified
that he's not violent.

576
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,267
I'll allow it.

577
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:04,856
He came to my house uninvited.

578
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,318
He trespassed and he intimidated me.

579
00:35:09,945 --> 00:35:11,029
So you beat him up?

580
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:14,115
I am guilty of acting out of desperation.

581
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,452
It caused me to hide
my relationship with Carolyn Polhemus.

582
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:19,746
It caused me to zealously pursue

583
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:21,790
an admission from Liam Reynolds
in her death.

584
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,667
It caused me to lash out at Brian Ratzer.

585
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,126
By the way, when he came to my house

586
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:28,421
and he violently banged on my door
when my daughter answered.

587
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:31,591
Am I volatile? Yes. Yes, I'm volatile.

588
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:35,136
A person I loved was brutally murdered.
And I have been charged with that crime.

589
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:37,639
And circumstances like that
can bring out, uh,

590
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:42,644
many things in a person,
desperation being one of them.

591
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:45,814
Uh, weakness, emotional instability.

592
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:48,525
And I apologize for all of those things.

593
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:51,486
I am guilty of all of those things.

594
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:55,282
But what I am not guilty of
is killing Carolyn Polhemus.

595
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,741
I did not take her life.

596
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:02,414
Yeah. What about Dr. Kumagai?

597
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,169
Did you ever try to strangle
our chief medical examiner?

598
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:12,674
[sighs]

599
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:20,348
- You want me to repeat the question?
- No, I heard the question.

600
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:26,187
It was brought to my attention that
he had concealed evidence in another case.

601
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:29,357
Uh, I mean, or at least
improperly failed to make me aware of it.

602
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:33,904
And so things got heated
between the two of us and, um...

603
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,700
I regretfully got phys... physical.

604
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,368
You regretfully tried to choke him.

605
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:41,703
No, I did not choke him.

606
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:42,787
Okay, when tempers flared

607
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:44,623
- and you grabbed him by the throat...
- By the lapel.

608
00:36:44,623 --> 00:36:47,250
Okay, when tempers flared
and you grabbed him by the lapel,

609
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,669
did you decide to do that
or did you just snap?

610
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:53,006
I'm not sure what the question is.

611
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:55,634
Did you decide to do that
or did you just snap?

612
00:36:56,843 --> 00:37:00,138
How about Mr. Ratzer, when you repeatedly
punched him as we saw in the video?

613
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:02,265
Did you decide to do that
or did you just snap?

614
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:04,184
He would not leave.

615
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:07,854
What would you do? What would you do?

616
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:12,442
So you snapped.

617
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:24,829
[reporters clamoring] Tommy, over here!

618
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:31,294
[Nico] Hey, look at me. Look at me.

619
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:33,964
That was extraordinary.

620
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:48,436
[Rusty] <i>This is torture.</i>

621
00:37:49,813 --> 00:37:51,648
It's fucking torture.

622
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:55,318
I just spend all my days
lying to my family.

623
00:37:59,197 --> 00:38:02,242
When I'm... When I'm with them,
all I wanna do is be with you.

624
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:07,914
[footsteps approach]

625
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:21,887
[inhales heavily]
The rest of your life, huh?

626
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,143
I don't remember writing that.

627
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:29,477
Just a line?

628
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,360
Dare I ask, what now?

629
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,605
[rustling]

630
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:00,443
[meows]

631
00:40:10,328 --> 00:40:13,498
- [meows]
- [shushes] Hey.
