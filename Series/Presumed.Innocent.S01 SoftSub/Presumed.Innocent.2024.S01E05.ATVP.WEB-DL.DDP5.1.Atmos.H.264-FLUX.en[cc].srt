1
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,514
[panting]

2
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:18,061
[Jaden] Dad!

3
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,313
- [Rusty] Get out of my fucking house.
- [Barbara] Rusty, stop!

4
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:21,731
Get out!

5
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,108
- Get inside!
- [Jaden] Okay, okay!

6
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:24,943
- Babe, babe, babe. Look at me.
- [crying]

7
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:28,071
[Raymond]
<i>Rusty? What the hell is going on?</i>

8
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,407
- [Barbara] Honey, baby, look, he's gone.
- [Raymond] <i>Rusty, talk to me.</i>

9
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:32,366
- [Barbara] Breathe, breathe, breathe.
- [Raymond] <i>Rusty?</i>

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,410
[breathing heavily]

11
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,836
[Barbara]
So you thought he had information,

12
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,213
and you went to his house.

13
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,175
Then he comes h-here for... For what?

14
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,344
To intimidate you?

15
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,639
Rusty, you could have killed him.

16
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:01,354
What if he goes to the police?

17
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:02,439
[Rusty] He won't.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
How do you know?

19
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,485
He won't.

20
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,074
[breathes shakily]

21
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,911
[punching keys]

22
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,469
[punching keys]

23
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,282
[knocks on door]

24
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,450
- Tommy?
- [Tommy] Yeah? Mmm.

25
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,994
I'm being told I'm the first witness,
or one of the first.

26
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,204
I would like to know why.

27
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:01,831
The defense will be arguing
prosecutorial bias,

28
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,792
and you can puncture that
straight out of the gate.

29
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,211
If you expect me to say I think
Rusty committed murder, I'm not doing it.

30
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:09,046
[stammers] No.
I don't expect for you to say anything.

31
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:13,677
I just expect for you to tell the truth.
You have a problem with that?

32
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:18,557
What is it with you two?

33
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,560
You have some kind of thing with him?

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,727
[stammers] With Rusty?

35
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:23,812
- [Tommy] Yeah.
- Mmm.

36
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:26,064
[Tommy] If there were,
I would need to know about it.

37
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,317
You ever kiss him?

38
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:32,153
Inappropriate.

39
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,572
Irrelevant.

40
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,240
Go fuck yourself.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,117
You're being called as a witness

42
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:39,202
to attest to the relationship
between Carolyn and Rusty,

43
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,037
and I need to know
you have professional objectivity.

44
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:44,165
If professional
objectivity is really a concern,

45
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,251
perhaps you should recuse yourself.

46
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,335
Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,966
You know, there's been a lot
of restructuring going on around here,

48
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:57,971
and I want you to know that Nico and I
value loyalty above all else.

49
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:05,687
[door opens]

50
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:12,319

- [coffee pours]

00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,364

[groans, breathes deeply]

57
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,180
[slurping]

58
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,850
[groans]

59
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,270
- [breathing heavily]
- [heartbeat thumping]

60
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:51,316
- [exhales sharply]
- [high-pitched ringing]

- [water running]
- [grunts]

- [breathes heavily]
- [Lorraine] <i>It just exploded?</i>

65
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,634
Yeah. Went everywhere.

66
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,471
All over the office.

67
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,434
[sighs] Raymond, all these nightmares,

68
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,271
they're all telling you the same thing,

69
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:31,565
which is what the evidence...

70
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:32,941
- Can we not?
- ...is telling you.

71
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:38,947
Is there any evidence, even a scintilla,
that points to somebody else?

72
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:43,368
Lo, it's not a question
of evidence pointing to somebody else.

73
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,452
It's the lack of evidence...

74
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,954
- Pointing to him.
- ...that points to Rusty.

75
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,789
I know. The burden.

76
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,042
Shall we talk about the burden
you'll be bearing?

77
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,294
Can we not?

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,005
He didn't do it.

79
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,758
Hmm. Doesn't matter.

80
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:02,554
You argue for the defense now, anyway.

81
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,935
[Rusty panting]

82
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,103
[treadmill beeps]

83
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,156
[treadmill beeps]

84
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,164
[grunts]

85
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:41,885
[hip-hop playing in the distance]

86
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,430
[Brian] Let's go, Laura. Hurry it up.

87
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:51,144
[engine starts]

88
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,669
[chattering]

89
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,036
- [dog barking]
- Fuck!

90
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,000
[barking continues]

91
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:08,388
[barking continues]

92
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:15,812
- Hey! Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey.

93
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,731
[breathes heavily] Hey, I just wanna talk.

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,441
I'm calling the cops.

95
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,568
You're gonna call
the cops after the other night?

96
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,361
Fine. Oh, why don't I drive you there?

97
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,946
We can fill out the report together.

98
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,364
The hell is wrong with you?

99
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,325
I just... I just wanna talk to you.

100
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,618
Okay?

101
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:31,786
Just... Just...
Just have a conversation with me.

102
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,247
[breathing heavily]

103
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,374
You assaulted. You trespassed.

104
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:39,085
- He can claim that you're extorting him.
- I-I assaulted him? I trespassed?

105
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,880
- Hardly believe that he would come...
- Best way for him to get ahead of that,

106
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,050
- right, is to go to the police.
- [stammers]

107
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,219
If he can curry favor with the cops

108
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,639
by characterizing you
as a fucking sociopathic nutjob,

109
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,391
which, from where I stand, Rusty,

110
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,270
it's the direction of the spiral
that you're in, I'm... [stammers]

111
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,106
Mya.

112
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,025
She's a fresh mind.

113
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,109
She's objective.

114
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,237
Listen to this theory of Rusty's.

115
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,073
Liam Reynolds is our best suspect.

116
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,532
He had a motive.

117
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,117
- Getting fucked over!
- [people clamoring]

118
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,286
[Rusty] <i>And despite being in prison,
he had the means.</i>

119
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:14,955
He knew people on the outside.

120
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:19,960
And according to Rigo, who has been
talking to some of the inmates,

121
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,962
<i>Reynolds has intimated that he killed her.</i>

122
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:23,922
She was about notches on her belt.

123
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:27,008
Even if Reynolds were involved...

124
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,135
I would gladly crater her skull.

125
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:32,514
[groans] What I'm saying...
Carolyn buried the evidence.

126
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:36,476
- [Raymond] Which was inconclusive.
- No, Carolyn buried the evidence, Ray.

127
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:37,894
[phone ringing]

128
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,438
- [Carolyn] Hey.
- Did you get the results back?

129
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,360
Um, nothing unexpected from the prelim.

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,155
And Ratzer,
his semen was at the homicide scene.

131
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:52,701
So it's not the fucking reach
that you're making it out to be.

132
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:01,376
Okay. But that's not our case.

133
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,503
- [Raymond] She's right.
- [sighs]

134
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:08,174
Hey, there are two things I've learned
in my professional experience.

135
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:11,094
One is that prison informants,

136
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:14,472
they will say or fabricate anything
to improve their plight.

137
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:18,935
Two, those who commit murder,
they tend to threaten, to boast,

138
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,645
to fuck other inmates up the ass.

139
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,816
What they do not tend to do
is walk around intimating.

140
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:26,860
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,070
And even if Reynolds was involved...

142
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,115
[sighs] ...I still don't see
how this Ratzer guy helps us now.

143
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,743
What I'm saying is the two of them
could be connected, Raymond.

144
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,953
Maybe they know each other.

145
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:39,998
This is my fucking life.

146
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:41,082
Yeah.

147
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,294
I know, and I would like to save it

148
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:48,381
because you came to me
to defend your life, your freedom.

149
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,718
But Rusty, whatever our strategy...

150
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,804
[chuckling] ...it's not going to be,

151
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:58,642
"Hey, there's this guy who knows
this other guy who's in prison,

152
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:00,477
both of whom had spermatozoa

153
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:04,064
at the same apartment
of some dead prostitute."

154
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:07,442
Who was tied up exactly like Carolyn was.

155
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:08,526
Not exactly.

156
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,071
Similarly.

157
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:14,407
[groans] My God. Fine.
Well, you know what?

158
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,493
You can ask Ratzer yourself.
He's gonna be here tomorrow.

159
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:17,661
What?

160
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:23,833
Yeah.

161
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,426
He's on the treadmill.

162
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,513
Oh, yeah. My suggestion.

163
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:39,099
He attacked a man last night.

164
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,518
Better the treadmill.

165
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,606
Mom, did he do this?

166
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,488
No. No, honey.

167
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,324
<i>Your dad has a lot of rage inside him...</i>

168
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:00,036
but not this.

169
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,792
[Rusty] Ratzer, I think it could be him.

170
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,921
You sure it's not your bias?

171
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,262
Could be that.

172
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:19,347
What does Mr. Horgan think?

173
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,391
Ray thinks it's a dead end,

174
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:24,019
and he thinks that
I'm becoming a loose cannon.

175
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,478
[Jaden] Is he right?

176
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,563
[Rusty] Maybe.

177
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:30,442
I mean, you do kind of seem like
you've jumped the tracks a little.

178
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:31,860
What is that supposed to mean?

179
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,862
I mean, you beat a man up.

180
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:36,907
Jay, he came to our house.

181
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,702
He threatened you. He threatened Mom.

182
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,121
What was I supposed to do?

183
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:46,708
I don't know.

184
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,461
I'm scared for you.

185
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:50,712
Oh, honey.

186
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:55,926
[sighs]

187
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:58,678
It's okay.

188
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:03,892
[sighs]

189
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:10,023
[groans]

190
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,695
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hey, Carolyn.

191
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:18,281
- You're stalking me?
- [Tommy chuckles] I am stalking...

192
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:24,329
Okay, listen. It's come to my attention
you don't wanna work with me, and, um...

193
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:27,290
Who said that?

194
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,876
Oh, God. [chuckles]
Never mind who said it.

195
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,753
Is it true that you
don't wanna work with me?

196
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:34,839
- [Carolyn] <i>I...</i>
- [Tommy] <i>Just tell me.</i>

197
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,049
- [Carolyn] <i>I said...</i>
- [sighs]

198
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:40,011
...I-I prefer to... [clears throat]
...first chair my own cases.

199
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:43,765
And if I were to second chair,
then I'd rather it be with Rusty,

200
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,935
since he's chief deputy prosecutor,
and career-wise, you know...

201
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:49,396
- Yeah, I know. It makes s-sense.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:52,482
It just came back that you
specifically didn't wanna work with me.

203
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:54,943
I didn't say that.

204
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,404
I... Maybe I was misconstrued.

205
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,281
[knocks on door]

206
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:05,537
- [Nico] Working late.
- [groans] Yeah.

207
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,210
Listen, this Liam Reynolds,
the one who killed Bunny Davis?

208
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,671
[Tommy] What about him?

209
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:17,382
[Nico] That's exactly it.
You know, I've been hearing things.

210
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,009
That he made
credible threats against Carolyn.

211
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,468
- [Tommy] He's in prison.
- [Nico] And...

212
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:23,346
yeah.

213
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:25,932
But you checked him out?

214
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:30,061
We did, and if the investigators turn up
anything new, we'll look into it.

215
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,231
But you don't think
there's any there there, do you?

216
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,820
- He's in prison.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,697
Liam Reynolds is a dead end.

218
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,617
Right now,
our focus is Rusty Sabich, isn't it?

219
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:45,785
Yeah.

220
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,747
[train horn honks]

221
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:59,841
- [patrons chattering]
- ["Guilt" playing on speakers]

222
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,263
[whispers] Barbara.

223
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:24,324
[line ringing]

224
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:29,412
[clears throat] Clifton,
it's, uh... it's Barbara Sabich.

225
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:33,041
[Clifton] <i>Yeah. Oh, um,
I was hoping you'd call.</i>

226
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,753
[no audible dialogue]

227
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,927
I'm sorry. Th-This was a mistake.

228
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,345
This was a bad idea.

229
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:52,435
[Clifton] <i>Um, who... who was it who said,
"We regret the ones we don't make"?</i>

230
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,377
[clears throat]

231
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,629
["Risk It All" playing on speakers]

232
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:28,907
Makes me feel safe.

233
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:31,326
Oof.

234
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,039
Isn't that bad in the art world?

235
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,542
[chuckles]

236
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,627
[Barbara] Not for me.

237
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:45,757
And honestly, safe has been
a little elusive for me lately.

238
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,350
Lewis Carroll.

239
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:57,477
What?

240
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:02,649
"In the end, the only choices
we regret are the ones we didn't take."

241
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,193
Thought it was Oscar Wilde.

242
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:11,992
Now I feel a little less safe.

243
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,330
I really don't want to be the one
to make the first move.

244
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:21,167
I don't want you to do anything
you don't want to.

245
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,835
Oh, I want.

246
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:24,713
[Clifton] Mmm.

247
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,009
I just shouldn't.

248
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,260
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.

249
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:34,097
But I want.

250
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,268
[inhaling deeply]

251
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:55,911
I had no involvement with that.

252
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,998
But you had an involvement with her,
Mr. Ratzer.

253
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:05,253
Your semen secretions
were found in her apartment.

254
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:06,630
But I wasn't there that night.

255
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,133
Oh, so you do have
memory of her after all?

256
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,053
You had sex with this woman?

257
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,181
Yeah, it's possible.

258
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,390
Possible?

259
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:26,066
Look, I had relations with prostitutes, okay?

260
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:29,361
You know, and, uh, she looks familiar,
all right?

261
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:30,445
[Brian sighs]

262
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:32,364
But look, hey... [stammers]

263
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:34,783
...I love my wife, okay? [stammers]

264
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:41,122
But after... [stammers] ...four children,
she had little to no interest in sex.

265
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:44,459
So, sometimes, yeah. Not often.

266
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,919
And this man?

267
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,801
Nah, I don't know him.
I've never seen him before.

268
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:54,511
[Mya] Are you sure?

269
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:58,223
[Brian scoffs] Yeah, I'm sure.

270
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,642
Why would I lie?

271
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:02,727
[Mya] Are you worried about
being implicated in her death,

272
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:08,525
{\an8}which maybe you already are,
since your DNA was found at the scene?

273
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:09,818
[Brian scoffs]

274
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:13,405
[sighs]

275
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,997
We know Liam Reynolds did this.

276
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:26,918
{\an8}If you do know this man,
now would be the time to tell us.

277
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:30,297
We're gonna have to pursue this further.

278
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:32,757
[chuckles] Look, I-I don't know this man,
all right?

279
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,009
We know you were there.

280
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,096
I've never seen him before and...
and I... I had nothing to do with that.

281
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:55,238
[breathes heavily]

282
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:58,909
[chattering]

283
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:03,330
[officer 1] Arms out.

284
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,292
- [officer 2] Next.
- [officer 3] Turn around for me.

285
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:09,085
- [officer 1] That's good. In line.
- [officer 2] Morning.

286
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,170
[officer 1] You're all good.

287
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:13,590
[reporters clamoring]

288
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,759
[reporter] Mr. Molto,
can I get a quick comment on the record?

289
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,345
We understand that
there's been the tender of a plea.

290
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,014
This office will not be entertaining
any plea.

291
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:22,349
The defendant is accused of murder

292
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,309
and no lesser charge
will be so much as considered.

293
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,019
Beyond that,
we look forward to a fair trial

294
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,979
where we can exact
the appropriate measure of justice.

295
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,064
I'm sorry, that's all I got.

296
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:31,816
A-And what would
the appropriate measure of justice be?

297
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,902
[chattering]

298
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,655
[shutters clicking]

299
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:43,745
Actually...

300
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:48,124
I will say this.

301
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:52,629
There has been a grotesque
and systematic lack of accountability

302
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:55,549
that's been going on
for too long in this city.

303
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:57,133
Actually, I would say in this country.

304
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:01,638
Wall Street criminally plunged
innocent people into poverty

305
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:04,683
with their mortgage schemes,
and not one banker went to prison.

306
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:07,644
Pharmaceutical companies
prioritized profits

307
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:09,604
over patients' lives with their opioids.

308
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:11,356
No one from that industry went to prison.

309
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:15,610
So, the message has been sent
and received in America,

310
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,903
that if you're high enough,

311
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:19,155
you can do and get away
with just about anything.

312
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:21,658
Well, not anymore. No, sir.

313
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,743
[reporters clamoring]

314
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:32,669
Tommy, can... can you tell me
how that was helpful to us?

315
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:35,922
Tommy.

316
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,885
- Tommy, I'm asking you a question.
- Just give me a second.

317
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:47,809
Okay.

318
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,561
[inhales sharply]

319
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:51,438
Uh...

320
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:57,152
I really appreciate the appointment.

321
00:21:58,737 --> 00:21:59,738
[sighs]

322
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:04,951
I'm really... [exhales heavily]

323
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,870
I'm grateful for the appointment, really.

324
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,750
What I don't appreciate, and I won't
tolerate, is this low-grade distrust.

325
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,335
I'm... I'm good at what I do.

326
00:22:13,335 --> 00:22:17,255
Do... Do you think I would
give you this case if I didn't think that?

327
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,801
Well, I know a lot of people
around here that have...

328
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:24,137
[chuckling]
...like, some kind of a problem with me.

329
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:26,765
And the reason is...

330
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,143
they're picking up on cues,

331
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:32,687
and not just from Raymond and Rusty,
but from you.

332
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:40,070
[Nico stammers] Tommy.

333
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,321
[sighs]

334
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:43,907
W-What's happened to you...

335
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,408
- [Tommy] For the record...
- ...in the last month?

336
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:46,493
For the record...

337
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:49,371
[smacks lips]

338
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,456
To have the best shot at conviction,

339
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:57,963
I need to cultivate respect
and goodwill from the jury pool, right?

340
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:00,590
That's why I made the statement.

341
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,343
I'm the good guy in all this.

342
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:06,429
Potential jurors, they need to know it
and better yet, they need to feel it.

343
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:09,724
They need to understand
that something is so

344
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:12,894
because Tommy Molto says it's so.

345
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:19,150
[shower running]

346
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,831
[reporter speaks
indistinctly through device]

347
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:35,625
- [Rusty] Jaden, it's 7:30, honey.
- Honey, is your bag ready?

348
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,127
I mean, it's right there.

349
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:39,462
[clears throat] Hey.

350
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:43,216
No murder trials at breakfast,
especially mine.

351
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:44,301
Turn it off.

352
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:47,304
I have a gigantic zit on my face.
Can you please tell me if it's cancerous?

353
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:48,555
- It is not.
- It's huge.

354
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,098
- It's probably stress.
- [Jaden] Are you sure?

355
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:51,683
Let me see. Let me look.

356
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:53,977
- You look nice. You have an interview?
- [Barbara] Thank you.

357
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:56,646
- Uh, therapy, actually.
- That's gotta be a brain tumor.

358
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:58,231
You're dressed like that
for your therapist?

359
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,316
I am.

360
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:01,651
- She likes me to look pretty.
- Where is my phone?

361
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:04,195
I swea... Can somebody call my phone?

362
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,489
- Will you ring your father's phone?
- [chuckles] I'll call it.

363
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,992
[Rusty] I swear to God that it's here.

364
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,327
- Ringing.
- [Kyle] There.

365
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:12,537
- [phone ringing]
- [utensil clinking]

366
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:13,705
[Jaden] Must be near.

367
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:17,500
Who is this?

368
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,585
This is Jaden.

369
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:20,629
[Rusty] What are you thinking?

370
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:22,255
Nothing.

371
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:23,423
I don't believe you.

372
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,595
[chuckles] This is nice.

373
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:29,679
That's it.

374
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:32,933
It is nice.

375
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:35,393
Can you tell your mom
she looks beautiful for me?

376
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:37,062
[chuckles] I can.

377
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:38,271
[chuckles]

378
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:40,398
- [Rusty] Okay. Bye, you guys.
- [Kyle] Bye.

379
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:41,691
[Barbara, Jaden] Bye.

380
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:51,952
[car alarm sounds]

381
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:04,714
- Stop touching. You're making it worse.
- [Jaden] I'm not touching it.

382
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:07,551
What... W-Why is...
Why is Kyle's bike in the trash?

383
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:12,013
I don't know.
I-I-I didn't put it there, honey.

384
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:18,144
It is trash.

385
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:25,110
I mean, the gears are shot and the,
you know... the chain keeps coming loose.

386
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,194
So I just...

387
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:35,078
Okay.

388
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,091
[grunts]

389
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:53,722
[keys jingling]

390
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:59,394
[breathing heavily]

391
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:06,526
[Dr. Rush] And this was when?

392
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:08,320
[Barbara] A week or so ago.

393
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,196
And we had a session last Monday.

394
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,658
Dr. Rush, can we please
not make this about untruths?

395
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,952
- I just can't...
- [Dr. Rush] No, no, I've... No, I'm...

396
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:20,498
Oh, and... and... and clearly, you've...

397
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:25,170
[stammers] ...you've been considering having
an affair with him far longer than that.

398
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,425
An aff... [chuckles] It was just a kiss.

399
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:34,596
That wasn't...

400
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,474
just a kiss.

401
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:43,730
It sounds like it was a...
like it was a romance.

402
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,440
[chuckles]

403
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:50,779
Yeah.

404
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:53,615
Well, it was romantic.

405
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:56,451
- [Dr. Rush chuckles]
- [Barbara] <i>Deeply romantic.</i>

406
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:00,247
[sighs]

407
00:27:00,914 --> 00:27:02,249
Maybe that is why...

408
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:05,377
you didn't tell me.

409
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:08,129
I don't know why I didn't tell you.
I... [sighs]

410
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,554
I'm not ashamed.

411
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:18,223
I'm not.

412
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:21,643
[stammers, breathes heavily]

413
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:23,937
[sighs]

414
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:25,605
Knowing I could.

415
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:29,609
Knowing I was...

416
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:34,906
wanted.

417
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:43,456
Yeah.

418
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:49,629
Desired. I felt relieved.

419
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:57,679
You know...

420
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:03,768
when I was, um, at Clifton's place,

421
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:08,273
I was walking up the stairs,
and I remember thinking...

422
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:13,445
Jaden would be so proud of me.

423
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,615
- [chuckles]
- [Dr. Rush] Jaden?

424
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,619
I feel her...

425
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,665
[crying] I feel her judgment.

426
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:28,418
[sniffles]

427
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:33,506
And I... [sniffles]

428
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:37,594
I mean, I could be projecting
because I judge myself...

429
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:38,803
[cries]

430
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:41,056
...for staying with him.

431
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:45,644
[cries] For forgiving him.

432
00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:46,728
[sniffles]

433
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,608
For loving him. [sniffles]

434
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:59,366
Yeah, I could have fucked Clifton...
[sniffles] ...but I didn't.

435
00:29:03,328 --> 00:29:05,038
[exhales heavily, sniffles]

436
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,750
So you tell me... [sniffles]

437
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:16,216
...is that something I should be proud of?

438
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,208
[Raymond] Hey.

439
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:53,545
Hey.

440
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:02,846
Listen, I'm...
I'm not saying it's unwinnable.

441
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:06,141
I can win this case, Rusty.

442
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,852
But you need to let me.

443
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:14,900
Can we allude to the son
or Liam Reynolds? Sure.

444
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,569
But our case is not somebody else did it,

445
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,821
or at least,
not somebody else specifically.

446
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:22,782
Our defense is that
they cannot prove you did it.

447
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:26,369
We need to establish
a credible alternative to me.

448
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,705
Otherwise it... it's...

449
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:31,124
I disagree.

450
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,884
Does Barbara think you're guilty?

451
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:44,721
Of course not. What are you getting at?

452
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:46,139
Are you sure?

453
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:47,224
Yes, I'm sure.

454
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:56,316
Lorraine is 100% convinced
that you did it.

455
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:59,277
Well, it's obviously not coming from me,

456
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:05,242
and she's not one to readily
believe what's reported in the news.

457
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:07,327
She and Barbara are close.

458
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,251
Barbara knows that I am innocent.

459
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:17,796
I hope so, 'cause this case,
it may come down to her.

460
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:20,006
How so? She can't establish an alibi.

461
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:21,967
[Raymond] She, as your wife,

462
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,760
- can attest to your demeanor...
- No, no...

463
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,887
- ...later that night. How you acted...
- ...no, no.

464
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:28,306
- behaved, whether you were agitated...
- We are not putting her on the stand.

465
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:29,474
...distracted.

466
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:30,809
- She could testify...
- No, Ray.

467
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:35,021
...from her very unique perspective
that you could not possibly have committed

468
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:38,108
- a murder in the hours before.
- [sighs]

469
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:43,530
That sends a message to everyone
watching that she believes in you.

470
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,448
She believes in your innocence.

471
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:49,160
That counts for something.

472
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,079
I know that much.

473
00:31:57,794 --> 00:32:02,382
Also, it goes without saying,
but I'm gonna offer it all the same.

474
00:32:02,382 --> 00:32:03,884
Between now and the trial,

475
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,012
let's not be beating anybody else up.

476
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:13,977
[reporter] <i>We're finally here.</i>

477
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:17,105
<i>Tomorrow, the trial that has not
only grabbed the attention of Chicago,</i>

478
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,149
<i>but the whole country, is set to begin.</i>

479
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:22,110
<i>Rusty Sabich will be brought
before a jury of his peers</i>

480
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,822
{\an8}<i>to face charges for the murder of
his former colleague, Carolyn Polhemus.</i>

481
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:05,654
[shutters clicking]

482
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,409
- [thunder rumbles]
- [no audible dialogue]

483
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:21,044
[shutters clicking]

484
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,466
- [no audible dialogue]
- [shutters clicking]

485
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:32,264
[siren wailing]

486
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:52,659
[no audible dialogue]

487
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:04,022
All right.

488
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:06,858
Mr. Molto.

489
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:14,699
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
we already met during voir dire,

490
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,618
but allow me to introduce myself again.

491
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:17,869
My name is Tommasino Molto,

492
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:20,789
but I'm from Chicago like you,
so it's Tommy.

493
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:25,877
I'll be prosecuting the case along with
Mr. Nico Della Guardia, who you also met.

494
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:27,504
We represent the State.

495
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:30,090
We'll present to you evidence of a crime.

496
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,092
You will weigh this evidence,
you'll deliberate upon it

497
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:34,970
and, ultimately, you'll decide
if it proves the defendant's guilt.

498
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,806
This man is accused
in the murder of Carolyn Polhemus.

499
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:41,059
And we will present to you testimonial,
physical, scientific and forensic evidence

500
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:44,145
that will lead you to form a conclusion.

501
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,649
One word about the victim.

502
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:53,780
{\an8}I knew her.

503
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:55,949
{\an8}And we all knew her.

504
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,703
Um, she was a colleague
in the district attorney's office.

505
00:36:00,704 --> 00:36:01,788
Loved by all.

506
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,960
From an evidence standpoint,
it shouldn't matter that I knew her.

507
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,587
Admired her. That I miss her.

508
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:10,505
That has no evidentiary meaning or value,

509
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,591
but I won't pretend
that it doesn't matter.

510
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,763
So if I show my feelings,
let me apologize for that right now.

511
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:24,144
Prosecutors are expected
to be tough, right?

512
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:25,228
Unfeeling.

513
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:27,105
Just functionary.

514
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:31,401
Well, we are functionaries
of the only universally accepted system

515
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:32,944
for distinguishing wrong from right.

516
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:34,279
We're bureaucrats.

517
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:38,909
I suppose you imagine that,
after years of making charges

518
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:42,495
and trying cases and seeing defendants
come and go, that we'd become inured.

519
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:44,748
It was all just a kind of blur.

520
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,710
Well, not today, because I did know her.

521
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:53,673
Today, you... all of you...

522
00:36:53,673 --> 00:36:57,594
have taken on one of the most solemn
obligations of citizenship,

523
00:36:57,594 --> 00:37:01,264
and your job is simply to find the truth.
The facts.

524
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:03,391
And it's not an easy task, as we all know.

525
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:08,146
As memories fail,
recollections become shaded

526
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:10,690
and evidence points
in different directions,

527
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,692
you might be forced to decide
about something

528
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:16,780
that no one seems to know
or be willing to say.

529
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,620
And the evidence, in this case,
the details are unspeakably gruesome.

530
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:28,917
I'm gonna show you an image.
It's quite violent.

531
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,211
[jury gasps]

532
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:35,590
Right. So if you were watching this
at home, you would turn it off,

533
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,301
not watch, not listen, not see this.

534
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:40,845
No one should have
to watch it or listen to it.

535
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:42,514
But here, you must.

536
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:46,017
You have to, right?

537
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,562
It's a real crime. It's a real victim.

538
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:50,730
Carolyn Polhemus.

539
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:54,526
And she had a son,

540
00:37:55,944 --> 00:37:57,028
Michael.

541
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:00,031
So there's real pain.

542
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:06,580
In the end, you don't have to try
to figure out why it happened.

543
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,374
A person's motives, after all,
may be forever locked away inside them.

544
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:13,712
But you do have to try
to determine what occurred.

545
00:38:13,712 --> 00:38:18,466
Otherwise, we won't know whether or not
this man deserves to be freed or punished.

546
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:23,054
And if we can't find the truth,
what is the hope of justice?

547
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:26,600
That's why Carolyn
got into this line of work.

548
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,769
That is why we all got
into this line of work.

549
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,479
Hope for justice.

550
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:37,861
So, in the end, I... I won't be asking
you to cry for Carolyn, though you might.

551
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:42,115
And I won't be asking you
to feel for her family and her son.

552
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:43,283
Of course you will.

553
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:51,041
I simply implore you to be true.
To be faithful to the truth.

554
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:55,378
Which, Carolyn,
that's all she would have asked.

555
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:58,548
Just be faithful to the truth.

556
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:02,135
Thank you.

557
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:13,730
[sighs]

558
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:16,358
Fuck.
