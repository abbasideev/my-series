1
00:00:01,545 --> 00:00:03,296
["The Dream" playing on headphones]

2
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:12,806
[knocking]

3
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:13,890
Yeah?

4
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:20,105
Kyle, can we talk to you for a second?

5
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,483
Your mother's here with me too.

6
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:24,651
Hi, honey.

7
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:29,990
[Rusty exhales sharply]

8
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,035
Um...

9
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,750
[breathes shakily]
Kyle, there's a picture of your bike

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,296
at Carolyn's house
on the night of May 18th.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,047
Why were you there?

12
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,051
I have no idea what you're talking about.

13
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,140
[Barbara] Honey...

14
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,978
I wasn't. I must've just been riding by.
That's all I...

15
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,689
- [Barbara] Baby.
- Okay. Kyle, there was a photograph of...

16
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:06,026
of you at Carolyn Polhemus's house
the night of May 18th.

17
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,277
Why were you there?

18
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:11,823
Honey, we got these images
from the police,

19
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,201
so they have this evidence too.

20
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,954
You gotta be honest. It's important now.

21
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:22,959
Oh, my God. For God's sake, Kyle,
why were you there?

22
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,381
I guess I wanted to
get a sense of the there.

23
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:32,969
[Rusty] The what?

24
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,888
[Kyle] Where you were going.

25
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:37,265
So, you knew about
your father and Carolyn?

26
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,142
I heard you two fighting about it.

27
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,311
[Barbara sighs] Okay.

28
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,897
Does your sister know? Does Jaden...
Does... Does she know?

29
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,150
I didn't tell her. I don't know.

30
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,236
[Rusty] When did you
first find out about it?

31
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:50,403
[Kyle] Does that matter?

32
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:51,988
Well, I wouldn't ask you
if it didn't matter.

33
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,991
I don't remember.

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,118
A few months ago maybe.

35
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,582
Okay, so that I'm clear, you went there
to see what she looked like.

36
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,378
You know how to use Google,
so you could find a picture of her,

37
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:09,631
but you wanted to see where she lived.

38
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,968
- Were you casing out her house?
- Rusty.

39
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,136
[Rusty] Were you
casing out her house, Kyle?

40
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:19,599
I... I just don't understand the reasoning
behind why you were going there.

41
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,810
Maybe I was trying to
figure out your reason.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,610
- I wanna talk to Mom about this.
- No! I am your father...

43
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,279
- Rusty.
- ...and you're gonna answer...

44
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,738
Rusty, please.

45
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:35,448
It's okay.

46
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,534
[breathing heavily] Fine.

47
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,537
[door opens, closes]

48
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,938
[Carolyn] Bunny Davis was a daughter.

49
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:13,987
Bunny Davis was a sister,
a friend, cousin.

50
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:18,283
Bunny Davis was 26 years old

51
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:23,705
when she found herself alone
in a dirty motel room with a monster,

52
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,875
and she's praying... pleading...

53
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,045
that this is the kind of man
who will just let her go.

54
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,465
[clicks tongue] But no.

55
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:38,011
This man, Liam Reynolds,

56
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,515
is the kind of person who does this...

57
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,395
and this...

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,358
and this.

59
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:02,744
What do you think?

60
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,373
I think you're amazing, Carolyn.

61
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,652
- [objects clattering]
- This thing's a fucking mess. [sighs]

62
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,074
Hey.

63
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,828
Hey. The front porch light is out.

64
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:49,040
So, he rode... [sighs]
...by her house a few times,

65
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,002
and he saw you going in once.

66
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,134
Obviously, we need to get him
into therapy as soon as possible.

67
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,218
Why?

68
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,429
Rusty, he's been carrying this around
for months.

69
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:05,015
We have no idea of the impact.

70
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,976
Okay, sure, but you and I can talk to him
about this together.

71
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:08,894
Oh, right.

72
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,104
- Like you just talked to him right now?
- We don't have to have...

73
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,564
[Rusty] What is that supposed to mean?

74
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,107
You interrogated the kid.

75
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,525
[Rusty] I interrogated him?

76
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:16,776
[Barbara] Yeah.

77
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,029
I... I... [stammers]
I was asking him questions.

78
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,741
- "Why were you casing out her house?"
- He was there, of course I was asking.

79
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,659
Asking like a prosecutor, Rusty.

80
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,703
- Are you kidding me?
- He's 15!

81
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,540
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

82
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,337
- You caused this, Rusty. You did.
- Of course. It's me.

83
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,131
Yes, I am the fuck-up-in-chief.

84
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,591
- [scoffs]
- But guess what.

85
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,301
You played a part in it too.

86
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:45,847
And you will, at some point,
need to take some fucking responsibility.

87
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,058
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

88
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,268
- [Rusty] I j-just...
- Done!

89
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,993
[inhales sharply] In my medical opinion,

90
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,371
the cause of death
was cranial blunt force trauma.

91
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,124
So, the judge has been already told
that you're an expert,

92
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,251
so you don't need to qualify.

93
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,710
You don't need to say, "In my opinion."

94
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,170
- You can sit up straight.
- Okay.

95
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,922
- Just sit up straight.
- You don't gotta...

96
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:21,550
- Don't tell me how to s... Oh.
- You're gonna give the jury

97
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,719
- your findings, right? Your expertise.
- [scoffs] Don't... Just... Okay, I...

98
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,055
- Wow.
- And you're not gonna make it about you.

99
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:29,391
What an... No. Don't...
Don't do that. Don't do that.

100
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,184
You know,
I'm doing this bullshit exercise for you,

101
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,311
- that you got me up in the morning for...
- Which I appreciate.

102
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,981
I... I am a medical doctor.
You're gonna respect me.

103
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,358
- [Tommy] I respect you as a doctor.
- [clears throat]

104
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:41,820
As a witness, however,
you are known to shit the bed.

105
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,947
[chuckles] You fucking prick.

106
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,198
[Tommy] Forget it.

107
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:49,202
[Kumagai] This is what you got me up
out of bed for? [laughs]

108
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,540
I'll get that file to you
by the way, scumbag.

109
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,838
[reporter 1] <i>The details of this case
are being kept close to the vest.</i>

110
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:01,423
[reporter 2]
<i>There's not been a single leak.</i>

111
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,592
[reporter 1] <i>I mean,
how strong can this case be?</i>

112
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:04,676
<i>They don't even have a murder weapon.</i>

113
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,845
[reporter 2] <i>Yeah, I don't see
how they've cleared the bar</i>

114
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,179
<i>of going beyond a shadow of a doubt.</i>

115
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,390
[reporter 1] <i>Hard to believe
this is even going to trial.</i>

116
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,435
[reporter 2] <i>You know, former colleagues
now at each other's throats...</i>

117
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:15,270
[reporter 3] <i>Sabich has two children...</i>

118
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,855
- [Raymond] <i>But Kyle was there.</i>
- [Rusty] <i>No.</i>

119
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:19,107
<i>He just... He rode by, like I said.</i>

120
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:22,402
It was just... just a few times. [sighs]

121
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,696
- We're sure he didn't kill her?
- You know, you're not funny.

122
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:26,156
That's not fucking funny.

123
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:27,908
I wasn't intending to be.

124
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,538
So, Michael Caldwell at Carolyn's house
the night of the murder.

125
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:36,374
Footage of Kyle there, a few weeks prior?

126
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:37,584
Jesus Christ.

127
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,212
I'm gonna have to think about this.

128
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,047
[Rusty groans] I do not have it.

129
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:45,967
- [sighs] Fucking...
- Is there something else?

130
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,720
I just didn't get any sleep last night,
okay, Ray?

131
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,889
Is that it?

132
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:54,559
What is it?

133
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:59,481
[stammers] Barbara and I got into it,
you know, and she said that she was done.

134
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,692
"Done" as in, "I'm gonna leave you"?

135
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:07,364
Come on. If she was gonna leave you,
she would've already done it.

136
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:09,574
- I don't need this right now.
- What would she be waiting for?

137
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,201
Good excuse?

138
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,123
- You betrayed her.
- [sighs]

139
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,833
[Raymond] You betrayed your children.

140
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,086
In fact, knowing Barbara,

141
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:24,464
the betrayal of the children
is the deeper of the two offenses.

142
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:27,884
[sighs] Ray, it's just... it's complicated.

143
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,970
- Yeah. Tell me. Come on.
- It's... It...

144
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,014
Depression, compulsion, narcissism.

145
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,265
I'll take any of that.

146
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,976
Let's send you to a doctor
and get a fucking diagnosis. [stammers]

147
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:40,563
But my fear is
that it'll just come back "pig."

148
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,065
[scoffs]

149
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,277
Your dick got hard for Carolyn,
you fucked her,

150
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,070
and now you wanna feel less bad about it.

151
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,240
[stammers] It's what men
who cheat do, Rusty.

152
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:54,661
They wanna have their cake, eat it,
and then chalk it up to complexity.

153
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,747
Jury will find it pretty simple.

154
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,167
On the plus side,
they'll also find it unoriginal.

155
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,337
It won't shock their conscience.

156
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:08,341
But for what it's worth, it shocked me.

157
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:12,053
It shocked Lorraine,
and I'm sure it shocked Barbara.

158
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,807
But she's still with you.

159
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,935
That tells me she means to hang in.

160
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,815
You know what? Hold on a second.

161
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,817
You know what? I...

162
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:28,111
How dare you say
that I don't take responsibility,

163
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,742
that I don't feel shame,
and that I am not consumed with guilt?

164
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:36,745
Fuck you.

165
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:46,004
You know, in 40 years, I have seen
a lot of guilt and shame in this business.

166
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:48,673
Shame is something
that you put on yourself.

167
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:51,092
It's self-absorbed, self-centered.

168
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:56,014
Guilt is more about owning and feeling
the pain that you cause others.

169
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,725
I don't doubt that you feel shame.

170
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,242
[Eugenia] Tommy...

171
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,745
Tommy, why am I on the witness list?

172
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:20,038
'Cause I think you have information

173
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:22,415
about the relationship
between Carolyn and Rusty.

174
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,545
[Eugenia] I have no information
about what happened that night.

175
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:31,216
But you might have a little information
about what happened all the other nights.

176
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:33,510
Right?

177
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:39,182
Seems to me that this is something
that really should've been reported to HR,

178
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:42,602
so maybe you're just wrestling
with your own culpability here.

179
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:45,730
Wow, you are really a miserable prick,
aren't you?

180
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,940
Hey, listen to me.

181
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,194
We're doing it for Carolyn, all right?
Just think about it. For her.

182
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,033
Hello, gentlemen.

183
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,369
Thanks for coming in.

184
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,746
How you doing? Get you anything?

185
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,331
You good?

186
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:06,835
Um, I'm not...
I'm not really comfortable with all this.

187
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:08,420
I completely understand. It's awful.

188
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,464
But as we're building this case
against Mr. Sabich,

189
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,592
every detail becomes enormously important,

190
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:15,844
and the defense is gonna come at you
with all these questions.

191
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:18,138
And I just wanna make sure
that we have everything exactly right.

192
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,640
Shouldn't we have a lawyer with us?

193
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,143
That's entirely up to you,

194
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:26,021
but I'm just confirming information
that we already discussed.

195
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,525
This is a photo you took of Mr. Sabich

196
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,402
entering your mother's house
the night she was killed.

197
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:35,322
It's June 16th, 9:49 p.m. Is that correct?

198
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:36,406
Yes.

199
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,366
And all these other photos
you took on the same night?

200
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,284
Yes.

201
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:43,121
Why didn't you take pictures
of him leaving the house?

202
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:44,456
I left after he went in.

203
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,167
Why were you there?

204
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:49,920
Sometimes I would just go.

205
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:53,548
Why?

206
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,467
He, uh... He already answered that.

207
00:11:55,467 --> 00:12:00,555
Okay. It's... We... This is... This is
extremely important for us to iron out,

208
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:03,433
because they're gonna ask
the same questions, okay? The defense.

209
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:05,727
Because she was my mother.

210
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:08,146
Sometimes I'd go look at the house.

211
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:11,107
You ever see anyone else
entering the house?

212
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:13,401
He was the only one there that night.

213
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:18,156
How did Mr. Sabich seem
as he entered the house?

214
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,616
What was his demeanor?

215
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:22,494
I don't know.

216
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:26,831
And during this meeting
that you had with him, how did he seem?

217
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,419
You said that during this meeting,
you accused him of killing your mother.

218
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,504
Is that right?

219
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:35,715
I mean, he denied it, but he was lying.

220
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:38,468
Why do you say that? How do you know that?

221
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:41,012
I could s-see it in his eyes.

222
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:43,390
Mm-hmm.

223
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,352
Also, once, she told me
she was becoming afraid of him.

224
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,897
But I thought you didn't... When did you
have contact with your mother?

225
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:55,110
I had convinced her to meet me for lunch.

226
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:57,946
She seemed stressed,

227
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,782
and I got pissed off
because I thought it was me.

228
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:02,701
And then I asked her what was wrong,

229
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:08,498
and she said that there's a man at work
that's beginning to scare her.

230
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,627
- Did she say who this man was?
- Nah.

231
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,715
She said that she had cases with him,

232
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,801
which is why she couldn't shake him.

233
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,358
- Hey.
- Hi.

234
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,110
What can I get you?

235
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,282
Uh. Um, I think...

236
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:45,911
Uh, Belvedere martini.
No olives, no juice.

237
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,621
[chuckles]

238
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,123
- Hi.
- Hi.

239
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,086
I've been talking about you all week.

240
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,049
Nah, that's...
that's not how it sounds like.

241
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,634
[chuckles] Okay.

242
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,010
Shift drink, Clif?

243
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,471
Uh, I wasn't, but I will now.

244
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:09,059
I got these bartender hands.

245
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,019
It's messed up all the time.

246
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,648
How's the drama?

247
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,526
- Same old.
- Yeah? I bet. Mind if I join you?

248
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:21,696
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?

249
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:24,699
Clifton.

250
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:27,953
- Barbara.
- Barbara.

251
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:29,663
Nice to officially meet you.

252
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,414
[sniffs]

253
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,708
What is that stuff, that cream?

254
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,170
- Yes. This stuff. Jeanine makes it.
- Oh.

255
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,714
Yeah, it's cocoa butter infused with weed.

256
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,424
- Ah.
- Don't put your fingers in your mouth.

257
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:42,801
- You will get very high.
- Okay.

258
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:46,221
- [chuckles] Thank you for the heads-up.
- Of course. Indeed.

259
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,391
That is so generous. Thank you.

260
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,978
So tell me about your, um, tattoos.

261
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:57,107
[gasps] I ask, realizing it's very cliché
to ask about someone's tattoos.

262
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,192
Yeah. [chuckles] I get it.

263
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:02,529
Uh, this. I'm somewhat of an artist too.

264
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:07,242
Uh, mainly projection art, but I designed
this during my youthful idiocy.

265
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,744
- It's the <i>Yijing</i>.
- Oh.

266
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:10,954
You... You know about that?

267
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,874
- Mmm. I know about John Cage...
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:18,795
...Brian Eno, and the random
creative operation of things.

269
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,047
Right. [chuckles]

270
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm also very familiar
with youthful idiocy.

271
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:30,891
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

272
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,936
[phone buzzing]

273
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:40,901
Rigo.

274
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,068
[Rigo] <i>Guess what I got.</i>

275
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:45,739
A hit on the second sample
in the Bunny Davis case.

276
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:48,074
What? How did you do that?

277
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:50,243
I didn't find any matches
in the whole system.

278
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:53,538
Yeah. This fool gave his DNA
to Ancestry.com.

279
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:54,664
Brian Ratzer.

280
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:58,418
[Rusty] Ratzer. Address?

281
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:06,009
Do we know anything about him?

282
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,222
[Rigo] Not really, other than he left
a sperm sample at a homicide scene

283
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,681
involving a dead prostitute.

284
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:15,602
Look, thank you for doing this.

285
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,437
I know you're putting your ass
out on the line.

286
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:20,232
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for Carolyn.

287
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,525
Rusty, I'm gonna need you to chill
in there, okay?

288
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:24,069
Do not say anything.

289
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:32,702
[knocking]

290
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,580
[door opens]

291
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,998
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

292
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:39,292
[Rigo] Sorry to disturb you.
We're with CPD.

293
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:42,045
We're looking for Brian Ratzer.
Is he home?

294
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,214
[stutters] Uh, hon!

295
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:47,050
Um, he's down the basement.

296
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,970
Would you like to come inside
and I'll go get him?

297
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,054
[Rigo] Sure.

298
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:53,390
Hon.

299
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,648
- Hon?
- [power tool whirring]

300
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:04,191
- [Brian] Yeah.
- The police are here.

301
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,112
Please, have a seat. He'll be right up.

302
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:08,988
- [Rigo] Great. Thanks.
- [wife] Coffee?

303
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,073
Sure.

304
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,493
[clears throat]

305
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,040
[baby fussing]

306
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:28,758
[Brian] Hey.

307
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,386
- [Rigo] Hi.
- What can I do for you?

308
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,931
We're looking into some incidents
that happened in this area,

309
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,892
June 16th, 2019.

310
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,686
The night of. We're just canvassing.

311
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,314
What incident are you looking into?

312
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:43,899
Uh, some break-ins.

313
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:47,277
Not on this street.
A few miles east, on Robertson.

314
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,821
It was a Thursday night.
I know it's a while to think back, but...

315
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:53,491
I don't need to think back.
I don't know the street.

316
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:57,454
If it happened at night,
um... I-I work nights.

317
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,165
Where do you work?

318
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,501
Hey, can I see your badge?

319
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,586
[Rigo] Sure.

320
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:07,756
It's just that, um,

321
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:10,342
- a sex worker was found murdered, so...
- [wife] Here we go.

322
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:13,220
[sighs] Yeah. Not... Not now, babe, okay?

323
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:15,430
[stammers] I said not now.

324
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:17,390
[wife] Okay.

325
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,602
[baby crying]

326
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:24,940
What is this about exactly?

327
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:26,733
[Rigo] I just told you.

328
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:28,693
Where do you work, Mr. Ratzer?

329
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,612
Did you answer the question?

330
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:31,947
I don't need to answer any questions.

331
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:34,491
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to answer the questions.

332
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:38,536
I mean, you're gonna have to have
the conversation at some point.

333
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:44,584
Don't I know you from someplace?

334
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,757
Here's my card.

335
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,385
You give me a call
when you're ready to talk.

336
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:55,136
And if I don't?

337
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,763
[Rusty] I think you're gonna have to.

338
00:18:57,806 --> 00:18:59,266
And I think you know why.

339
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,769
Or maybe we should ask your wife.

340
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,564
- Hey, Laura.
- Hey. Hey.

341
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:06,856
[Laura] Yeah?

342
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:08,608
- [Brian] It... It's okay, babe.
- [Laura] Yeah?

343
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,155
[Laura] What's going on?
Do you need something?

344
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:17,367
Just wanted to say thank you
for the coffee.

345
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,996
[Laura] Oh. You're welcome.
Is everything okay?

346
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,247
Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:25,333
[Laura] Okay.

348
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,885
Get the fuck out of here.

349
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,014
[Rigo] I told you not to agitate him.

350
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:41,057
[Rusty] I just asked him one question.

351
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:44,477
You are un-fucking-believable.

352
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:55,697
[breathing heavily]

353
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:01,286
Why do you look so scared?

354
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,880
<i>Why do you look so scared?</i>

355
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,425
[gasps, exhales sharply, sighs]

356
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:23,475
B?

357
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:34,819
- [water splashing]
- [scrubbing]

358
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,175
B, what are you doing?

359
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,553
[Barbara] Not taking any chances.

360
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:01,638
He was riding by her house.

361
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:05,350
Who's to say he didn't
walk through her garden,

362
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,563
look through her window,
stand on her doormat...

363
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:11,773
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- ...ring her doorbell?

364
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,567
Come on. Come on.

365
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:16,903
I don't think that Kyle is a suspect.

366
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:20,282
[sighs] Rusty.

367
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,452
[breathes shakily]

368
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:31,751
Sometimes I think you forget
our son is Black.

369
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,262
[sniffles]

370
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:52,856
[Dr. Rush] How did it make you feel
to see your dad go in her house?

371
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,276
You wanna talk about it?

372
00:21:58,445 --> 00:21:59,446
No.

373
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:04,367
- You must have feelings.
- But I don't wanna talk about them.

374
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:08,747
Kyle.

375
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:17,005
A lot worse shit has happened
since I saw him go in her house.

376
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:24,262
You kidding?

377
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:31,811
This is ridiculous.

378
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:37,192
[Dr. Rush] I made zero progress,
not that we often do right off.

379
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:39,903
Early sessions can be more
about establishing trust,

380
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:43,323
and I think I failed there too.

381
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,368
Look, speaking to the...

382
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:51,957
the bigger issue,
I think we need to redraw some lines.

383
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,668
Okay. What do... What do you mean?

384
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:58,296
This thing has become
way too layered and loaded

385
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:03,843
for me to treat you, Rusty, Rusty and you,
and now Kyle in the midst of...

386
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:06,429
It... It really should be
one therapist per.

387
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:09,182
[Barbara] Per?
Like we have that kind of money.

388
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:11,726
I think I should take you, and only you.

389
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:14,646
I know.

390
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:17,607
Can you s... [stammers]

391
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:25,073
I... I think it's possible
that you do wanna forgive Rusty

392
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:26,658
and stay married to him.

393
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:28,618
I also think it's possible...

394
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:32,372
I suspect even more likely...
that your... your limbic system is just...

395
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:35,083
it's going full-bore.

396
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:39,004
You are in self-defense mode, trying
to save your marriage for your kids,

397
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:43,842
doing whatever you consciously
or unconsciously deem necessary.

398
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:46,803
You have always been
about preservation of family.

399
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,892
But I also think it's possible that when
the kids are grown or off to college,

400
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:56,021
this compulsion to forgive

401
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,940
could metastasize into something else,

402
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:04,279
like anger or hatred even.

403
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,365
Could be it's already happening.

404
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,035
[sighs]

405
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:15,248
Look, your, uh... your husband
fell in love with another woman.

406
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:17,876
He's now facing trial for killing her.

407
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,921
You need your own therapist.

408
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:32,349
[Nico] <i>So,
Eugenia came by my office earlier.</i>

409
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,476
[Tommy] <i>What did she say?
Why? What did she say?</i>

410
00:24:34,476 --> 00:24:35,393
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

411
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:37,812
I got no issue with you calling her
as a witness, all right?

412
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:40,232
It's just...
If she's gonna be your witness,

413
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:41,983
it might help for her to be in your camp.

414
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:43,068
Tell me what she said.

415
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:45,946
[stammers] She said that, uh...

416
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,697
She said that you're an asshole,
all right?

417
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,366
But we know you can be a little...

418
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:52,827
Okay. Listen, I'm my best
prosecutorial-self when I'm angry.

419
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:53,745
You know that.

420
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:58,124
Yeah, but if your plan is to rely on
hostile witnesses to make your case...

421
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:01,545
Eugenia will bend over
any which way she can to help Rusty.

422
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:05,131
I think she's a little in love with him.

423
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,342
I need to tell her to toe the line.

424
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:12,013
No. No, no. The line you need to toe
is one of hard evidence, all right?

425
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:14,182
Character assassination
is not gonna get it done.

426
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:16,351
I'll give you hard evidence. Don't worry.

427
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:19,896
I-I am worried. I'm worried.

428
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,482
Raymond's asked for a meeting.

429
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:24,693
Why? What about?

430
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:28,905
Well, I can only imagine it's because
he thinks he's got a play on a plea.

431
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:32,450
And if he thinks that, he must feel
that he's got us by the balls.

432
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,995
He hasn't got my balls, Tommy.

433
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:37,163
Has he got yours?

434
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:40,917
There's no chance of any plea.

435
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:48,383
[Rusty] No. Plus, we need to find out
if there are other sex workers in the area

436
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:50,343
and if they can recognize Ratzer.

437
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:52,846
I mean, the guy fucking knows something.
I'm sure of it.

438
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:54,431
- [Rigo] <i>Of course.</i>
- You ready?

439
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:56,683
- Yeah. Look, I'll call you back.
- [Rigo] <i>Sure.</i>

440
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:01,855
[Mya] Can you take me
through that night again?

441
00:26:01,855 --> 00:26:04,441
You said you were
at the office that night.

442
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:08,194
Um, yes.

443
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,906
A few of us were working late
on Raymond's campaign,

444
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:14,034
ostensibly working on
Raymond's campaign. [chuckles]

445
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,037
Ostensibly?

446
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:19,706
[clears throat]
Well, I was mostly texting.

447
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:26,379
And, um... And getting no messages back...

448
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,592
which I wasn't really handling very well.

449
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:36,848
<i>And she was basically ghosting me,
so I needed somewhere to go.</i>

450
00:26:38,892 --> 00:26:40,644
[sighs]

451
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:44,022
And what time did you leave the office?

452
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:45,690
[Rusty] A little after 8:30.

453
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,236
So I'd sometimes eat out because I just...

454
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:52,614
I wasn't in any state to go home.

455
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:55,075
[chattering]

456
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:03,375
[patrons distorted laughter]

457
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:06,294
I don't really remember much from the bar.

458
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:09,965
[patrons chattering]

459
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,970
Guess I had a few things to drink.

460
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:18,139
Maybe I ordered another. I don't know.

461
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:28,275
- [phone beeps]
- <i>And then she texted back,</i>

462
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:31,319
{\an8}<i>and I was off to the races.</i>

463
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:37,742
So the text from her comes in at 9:24 p.m.

464
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:42,831
Michael Caldwell's photos
show you arriving at 9:49.

465
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:46,626
What happened?

466
00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:51,840
Uh, I mean,
I don't know how much detail you...

467
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,635
- you want here, but, um...
- [doorbell rings]

468
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:57,846
Hey.

469
00:27:57,846 --> 00:27:59,556
[both breathing heavily]

470
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:01,975
What happened, um...

471
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:05,604
- What?
- I just...

472
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,981
What happened?

473
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:09,524
I don't know why you're so angry.

474
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,611
- What happened?
- [Carolyn moans]

475
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:16,197
[Rusty] Miss you so much.
Miss you so much.

476
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:18,742
[Rusty speaks indistinctly]

477
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:24,831
Well, mostly, we argued.

478
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,000
You argued?

479
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,377
I wanted to get back together,
and she didn't,

480
00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:31,463
- and, I mean, that was pretty much it.
- [Carolyn] <i>Stop.</i>

481
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:33,423
- [Rusty] Hey.
- Leave! [echoes]

482
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:43,058
[clicks tongue] Cell metadata has you
arriving home at 11:00 on the nose.

483
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:50,482
It's a 20-minute drive from her house
to yours, which means you left at 10:40.

484
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:54,361
You were at her house for 51 minutes.

485
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:57,864
Long argument.

486
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:06,122
Get the fuck out of here.

487
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,962
And then you just left after that?

488
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:16,132
Then we kissed goodbye.

489
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:18,802
You kissed?

490
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:22,055
Yes, and then I went home.

491
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:29,396
<i>When she kissed me,
she knew that it would give me hope.</i>

492
00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:39,948
<i>I mean, the kiss got me to the car.</i>

493
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:41,700
<i>It got me to go home.</i>

494
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,787
But when I got home, I realized that, uh...

495
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:48,623
that hope had just turned into cruelty.

496
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,335
She knew what she was doing.

497
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:56,923
She was fucking cruel.

498
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,935
So, what's your take so far?

499
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,023
Well, on the case,
I kind of like where we're at.

500
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:15,650
They'll have a hard time
making their burden.

501
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,570
At the same time, 51 minutes.

502
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,239
They'll argue it's long enough
to have tied her, cleaned the scene.

503
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:24,910
Or had sex, or argued,
or had a fight and made up.

504
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:27,454
What about Rusty?

505
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:29,706
Thoughts about putting him on the stand?

506
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,209
There is no way we let that man
anywhere near the witness chair.

507
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:37,255
[sighs] Agreed.

508
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:40,300
[Rusty] What'd we find out about Ratzer?

509
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,676
There's gotta be something there.

510
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:43,094
He got an alibi?

511
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:44,638
Right, no prior arrests?

512
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:47,807
<i>We use CPD in Illinois State?</i>

513
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:51,019
<i>We got nothing. All right.
Well, he was with Reynolds, right?</i>

514
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,355
<i>Well, he was there with Reynolds,
with Bunny Davis.</i>

515
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:55,607
We just have to fucking prove it.

516
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,484
Yeah, just keep... just...
just... just keep at it.

517
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:58,610
Just keep pushing.

518
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:01,112
Fuck.

519
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:03,198
[people chattering]

520
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:09,454
[Kumagai] Hey, Molto.

521
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:23,885
Okay. Thank you.

522
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:28,139
[elevator bell dings]

523
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:57,711
[line ringing]

524
00:31:58,837 --> 00:32:00,005
[Barbara] <i>Yeah?</i>

525
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,965
[Rusty] <i>Hey, um...</i> [sighs]

526
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:07,137
I know that we said a lot to each other
the other night.

527
00:32:07,137 --> 00:32:08,263
And, um...

528
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:14,227
I just want... I just want you to know
that I heard... I... I heard you.

529
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,649
Rusty, can we talk about this
when I get home?

530
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:22,986
I'm... I'm just about
to step into the market.

531
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:27,866
- [Rusty sighs] Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- <i>Okay?</i>

532
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:28,950
[Rusty] Mm-hmm.

533
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:32,120
I love you.

534
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,206
[patrons chattering]

535
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:36,291
Love you.

536
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:45,884
<i>You know, I'm really starting
to understand the allure of day drinking.</i>

537
00:32:45,884 --> 00:32:47,052
[Clifton] <i>You ever night drink?</i>

538
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:49,512
[Barbara] I have appearances to uphold.

539
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:50,764
Ooh. Like what?

540
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,643
Mom. Wife.

541
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:57,020
All the shit you probably
don't wanna hear about.

542
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,897
[inhales sharply] Oh, on the contrary.

543
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,442
Yeah, I'm deeply curious
on what it's like to be you right now.

544
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,236
[Barbara] Honestly...

545
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:07,322
I don't know.

546
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:19,125
Well, if you ever want to talk
and should I not be here...

547
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:22,963
[sighs]

548
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:27,092
Thank you.

549
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,183
[Barbara moaning, panting]

550
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:15,347
[people chattering]

551
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:21,104
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Raymond.

552
00:34:21,104 --> 00:34:22,355
- Helen.
- Hey.

553
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,233
[Raymond] Eugenia.

554
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,693
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- [Raymond laughs]

555
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:29,905
Hi. Raymond. Oh, my God. How are you?

556
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:31,239
I'm hanging in. You?

557
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,490
[sighs] I'm on the witness list.

558
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,327
- I saw that.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

559
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:38,079
I, uh... I knew about the two of 'em.

560
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,539
Well, I wouldn't lose any sleep.

561
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,083
We're not denying the relationship.

562
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,418
Okay.

563
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:44,961
Well, do me a favor, will you?

564
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:50,008
Tell Rusty I have no intent
of giving testimony against him, okay?

565
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,177
- I'll do that.
- Thank you.

566
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:58,183
- Hi, guys.
- Raymond.

567
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:00,101
It's good to see you, as always.

568
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:02,812
Yes.

569
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:05,690
Okay, let's get right to it.

570
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:09,986
You two have a really fucking lousy case,
and I think you both know it.

571
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,489
I mean,
it's not a complete nothing burger.

572
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:14,199
He was there, last seen with her.

573
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,368
That's something,
but it's shitty all the same.

574
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:17,285
We disagree.

575
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:21,665
Not a drop of her blood found
in Rusty's car, none of her DNA at all.

576
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:24,000
Blood and guts everywhere at her home,

577
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,836
not so much as a microscopic drop
in his car.

578
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:28,755
- [Nico] He cleaned it.
- Or on his clothing.

579
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:30,340
- Cleaned it also.
- No murder weapon.

580
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,258
Disposed of it.

581
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:33,343
You're not gonna be able
to settle on a theory, you know?

582
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:37,305
Being tied up like that,
that speaks to premeditation.

583
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:40,642
Death by fire poker? Heat of passion.

584
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:43,228
Right from the get-go,
your case is a fucking mess.

585
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:44,563
Well, we love a challenge.

586
00:35:44,563 --> 00:35:46,231
[Raymond] I know that there is a reason

587
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,900
you brought
the lesser charge of obstruction,

588
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,360
and I would've done the same thing,

589
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,780
so you could get him on something.
'Cause walking away with nothing...

590
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,240
What is your point?

591
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,910
I can see that someone's
been directed not to speak.

592
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:03,999
- Smart.
- A... All right, great. Please, just...

593
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:08,169
Rusty cannot risk spending
the rest of his natural life in prison,

594
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:10,255
and you cannot chance an acquittal

595
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:13,717
and the obliteration
of all of your political capital.

596
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:16,386
We'll cop to the obstruction, three years.

597
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:24,102
Ray, you seriously think we'll
plead it out on an obstruction charge?

598
00:36:24,102 --> 00:36:25,937
Nico, you know you moved too fast.

599
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:28,440
Tommy, he was dying for a suspect.

600
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,984
The idea that it could
possibly have been Rusty, well...

601
00:36:30,984 --> 00:36:33,194
- [laughs]
- Oh. Is that right? [chuckles] Fuck you.

602
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:36,740
Let's talk about your bigger problem
sitting right here.

603
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,993
You've got a shitty, circumstantial case,

604
00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:44,915
first-chaired by a fucking
nickel-and-dimer, going against me.

605
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:46,583
You're not stupid, Nico.

606
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,460
I'm giving you a conviction.

607
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,754
And with Judge Lyttle,

608
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:54,674
I've got a very good shot
at a required finding of not guilty.

609
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:57,177
That is a political death knell.

610
00:36:58,011 --> 00:37:00,180
I'm offering you an escape hatch.

611
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:04,434
[grunts]

612
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:07,479
- What's this?
- Just have a read. Just check it out.

613
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:15,028
[papers rustling]

614
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:20,700
Why am I just seeing this now?

615
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:23,745
We just got it ourselves.

616
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,093
[Rusty chuckling]

617
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,136
[Barbara chuckles]

618
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,807
That wasn't the kind of sex we have.

619
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:46,643
Well, not for a long time, anyway.

620
00:37:50,063 --> 00:37:52,232
Was it the kind of sex you had with her?

621
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:57,529
No.

622
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:01,908
She isn't you.

623
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,120
She wasn't.

624
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:11,543
I think what I find hard to understand is...

625
00:38:14,504 --> 00:38:16,423
did you ask yourself...

626
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,594
what you were willing to lose?

627
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:29,686
[Rusty] We were so far apart, you and me.

628
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:33,273
I feel like, at the time,
we couldn't even have a conversation.

629
00:38:35,275 --> 00:38:37,736
But she woke something up inside me,
you know?

630
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:38,820
Something...

631
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:41,865
that I thought was dead.

632
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:49,664
When you said I needed
to take responsibility...

633
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,833
Oh, B... [stammers]
...I don't think I meant it the way you...

634
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:54,461
[Barbara] I don't think you were wrong,
Rusty.

635
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,714
I think we allowed ourselves...

636
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:02,886
to drift apart.

637
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:10,560
Even the sex we just had now, it felt like
we were trying to prove something.

638
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,649
That what we had is still there.

639
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:20,028
Is it?

640
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,448
[phone buzzing]

641
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,620
Fucking Raymond.

642
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,996
[Barbara sighs]

643
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:32,874
I'm gonna take it. [sighs]

644
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:36,419
Hey.

645
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:37,837
[door closes]

646
00:39:37,837 --> 00:39:39,506
- [Raymond] <i>Rusty.</i>
- Yeah.

647
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:43,343
[sighs] Our case just took a turn.

648
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:46,137
[sighs]

649
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,391
Your skin was found
under Carolyn's fingernails.

650
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:52,060
What? That's... Wait. That's impossible.

651
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,437
It's in the report.
I just learned about it.

652
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:57,649
No. It's... I...
Ray, she never scratched me.

653
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:59,943
Like... [stammers] It's...
It's... It's a fucking lie.

654
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:01,903
DNA is DNA, Rusty.

655
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:04,364
No, it's a lie. I... [stammers] Oh, my God.

656
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:07,784
[breathes shakily] I can't believe
that they're going ahead and doing this.

657
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,077
Who?

658
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:12,539
Fucking Molto and... and... and Delay,
and... and Kumagai, all of them.

659
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:13,832
- Oh, come on.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

660
00:40:13,832 --> 00:40:15,500
I... [stammers] She never scratched me.

661
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,378
It's... It's... It's fucking planted.
They don't have a case.

662
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:21,631
They have no case,
so they're fucking trying to frame me.

663
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:23,049
- [Jaden] Dad! Dad!
- [banging]

664
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,885
[man] Come on! Open it up!
I know you're in there!

665
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:26,845
- Fuck. What?
- <i>There's gotta be a reason for this.</i>

666
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:27,929
- [Jaden] Dad!
- No, I...

667
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:29,973
- What is it? What's going on?
- There's someone at the door!

668
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:32,058
- Raymond, hold on. What's wrong?
- [man shouts indistinctly]

669
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,894
- I don't know.
- [Rusty] Hey, calm down.

670
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:35,520
- I was just watching TV and...
- Okay.

671
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,938
Honey, honey, calm down. It's okay.

672
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:39,399
- Hey! Hey! Stop banging at my door!
- [shouting continues]

673
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,192
- Who is it? [stammers]
- I don't know!

674
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:42,527
[Barbara] Rusty. Jaden!

675
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,613
- [man] You come and fuck with my family!
- Dad, who is that?

676
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,364
- Hold on! Just stop!
- [Barbara] I'm gonna call the cops.

677
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:48,700
No! Do not call the police, Barbara.
Just let me think.

678
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,826
[man] Open this door up.
