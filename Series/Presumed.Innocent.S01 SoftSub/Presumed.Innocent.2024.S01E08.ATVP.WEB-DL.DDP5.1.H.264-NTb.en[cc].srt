00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,303
[chattering on radio]

2
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:28,530
He must've put it there. Who else?

3
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:32,116
You think Rusty put it there?

4
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,160
Well, who else would be desperate enough?

5
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:40,083
Are you... Are you okay, Tommy?

6
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,549
No.

7
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:49,676
[meows]

8
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:52,262
She's freaking out,
but I'm gonna take her upstairs.

9
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,381
[phone vibrating]

10
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:33,762
Hey, what's up?

11
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:37,891
What?

12
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,478
[Laryn] It's been to the lab, tested?

13
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,189
[Tommy] Yeah. No DNA or fingerprints.
Looks like it's been scrubbed.

14
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,485
And how do we know that
this is actually Carolyn's fire poker?

15
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,487
We don't. Perhaps you do.

16
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:53,448
- Fuck you.
- And then there's this.

17
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:54,866
[Raymond] This proves nothing, Tommy.

18
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,620
[Tommy] It's probative of someone trying
to intimidate me or incriminate me.

19
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,748
Somebody's contempt for me.

20
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:03,250
It's evidence of someone's desperation.

21
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,876
[Laryn] Are you saying
you wanna introduce it?

22
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:09,463
How can I? There's no chain of custody,
uh, it doesn't exculpate,

23
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,467
it can only be authenticated
as being "a" fire poker, not "the."

24
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,386
- [Laryn] Mmm.
- Well, what about the housekeeper?

25
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:15,512
Can she identify it?

26
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,681
Well, we brought her in.
She says it looks the same,

27
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,100
it's from the same set,
but that's all she can confirm.

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,310
[Laryn] And you said
your place was fully processed?

29
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,188
Yeah. No DNA or prints. It's meticulous.

30
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,273
[Raymond] Forced entry?

31
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:29,067
No, I leave the side door open.
I have a cat.

32
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,485
Sometimes if I'm working late,

33
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,279
I have the neighbor come over
and check on her.

34
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,655
You have a cat?

35
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:36,408
- Yeah.
- All right. All right. Let me think.

36
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:42,539
I'm happy to call it off. Again.
Declare a mistrial.

37
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,253
Anybody have a thought?

38
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:54,968
The prosecution is fine to proceed.

39
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,138
We just think the jury should
be kept abreast of the situation.

40
00:02:58,138 --> 00:03:01,641
We can let them know that
it should not be considered as evidence.

41
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,059
What about Caldwell?

42
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:06,104
Why would Caldwell want
to frame Tommy? [stammers]

43
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,190
- [Rusty] Because you pissed him off...
- [Nico] To get you off the hot seat.

44
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,776
[Raymond] Your Honor, I'm going to need
a moment with my client. Thank you.

45
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,029
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- [Nico] It's a stupid question. Sure.

46
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:16,072
Did you question him? That's all I ask.

47
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,118
Rusty, calm down. Rusty...

48
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,953
[stammers] It's just... [sighs]

49
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:23,705
Calm down.

50
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:27,709
We do not want this in,
not so much as even mentioned.

51
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,128
With or without instructions.

52
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,838
But it could plant some doubt.

53
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:35,842
Why would Tommy come forward with this
if he wasn't being truthful?

54
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:41,139
It's not like him being in possession
of the poker exactly helps his case.

55
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,684
And with a note, "Go fuck yourself"?
This feels like a plant.

56
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:47,479
When was the last time
you as a prosecutor said,

57
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,774
"Hey, I found the murder weapon
in my kitchen."

58
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:52,275
[Mya] Yeah, I agree. This doesn't help.

59
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:56,112
Plus which, if we wanna maintain
Liam Reynolds as a... as a possibility,

60
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:58,490
- this skews that narrative. You would...
- Okay, so now y...

61
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,116
now you want to maintain Liam Reynolds?

62
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,911
- He would have no motive to frame Tommy.
- We should at least question Caldwell.

63
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,955
- Why would he target Molto?
- I would...

64
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,166
Who knows? Who cares?

65
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,460
It's-It's not about the truth.

66
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,255
It's just about
establishing reasonable doubt.

67
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:15,382
Listen to me.

68
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:21,346
If this jury thinks that it was planted...
which they probably will...

69
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:25,183
they're not gonna think Caldwell,
they're gonna think you.

70
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:34,317
So they plan on making no mention
of it whatsoever?

71
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:38,530
I mean, it's not admissible evidence,
you know, which may be just as well.

72
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:41,575
Could look bad for me,
since I would have motive.

73
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:44,035
But what if it leaks to the media?

74
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,538
- I mean...
- [sighs]

75
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:48,873
...you know,
if it's beneficial to the prosecution,

76
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,667
then why wouldn't Tommy leak it?

77
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,211
Look, if it gets out,
we're probably back to a mistrial,

78
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,630
which I don't think he wants, you know.
I mean, he thinks he's winning.

79
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,508
And you're saying they don't even know
if it's the actual poker.

80
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:00,927
It is.

81
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:06,224
There's, like, a chip in the handle.
I recognized it.

82
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,352
- Did you tell them that?
- No.

83
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,230
I actually used it there once
to make a fire.

84
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,441
Thank God my prints weren't on it. [sighs]

85
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,487
- [Kyle] Hey.
- Hey.

86
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:22,741
What's wrong?

87
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:25,118
Can you take this out? I'll be right out.

88
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,202
Yeah.

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,713
[pathologist] <i>If a person ate and died,
say, within 20 minutes,</i>

90
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,924
<i>most of the food would still be
in their stomach.</i>

91
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:42,844
Some could move to the duodenum,
the gateway to the lower intestine.

92
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:47,140
And was there any food
in Carolyn Polhemus's stomach

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,226
- when she died?
- There was not.

94
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:51,978
And how long does it take
for the human stomach to empty?

95
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:55,649
For fluids and semifluids,
they leave the stomach rather quickly,

96
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:59,319
under two hours.
For proteins and fats, about 2.5 hours.

97
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,862
Rice and beans, about three.

98
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:07,494
The receipt, stamped 8:27 p.m.,

99
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:11,706
shows the kung pao chicken
and crab rangoon

100
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:16,628
was delivered to Ms. Polhemus's address
at 8:55 p.m.

101
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,964
- Yes.
- And at time of death,

102
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:22,676
- her stomach was completely empty?
- It was.

103
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:27,973
And yet Dr. Kumagai found that
she died around 10 p.m.

104
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:32,310
He's wrong. I would put the time of death
between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.

105
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,438
How could he have missed by that much?

106
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,524
[sighs] No idea.
For her stomach to be empty,

107
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:40,151
it would need to be
at least four hours after she ate.

108
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,785
[Tommy clears throat]

109
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,543
What if she never consumed the rangoon?

110
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,213
She ordered it, it arrived.

111
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:03,758
Well, can you rule out that someone else
didn't arrive at around the same time

112
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,552
and kill her
before she had an opportunity to eat?

113
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:08,179
There was a half-filled container
of Chinese food in the kitchen, so...

114
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:11,016
Did you find any evidence
of Chinese food in her duodenum?

115
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,143
There was evidence of some food
in her duodenum.

116
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:14,686
Could it have been her lunch?

117
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,313
[pathologist]
I suppose anything is possible.

118
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:20,859
Can you state to a medical certainty
that the victim consumed Chinese food?

119
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,320
No.

120
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,404
Thank you.

121
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:28,742
So, just to be clear,

122
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:35,999
you work exclusively now
as an expert witness for defense teams?

123
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,337
You're given a report,
you give an opinion,

124
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:43,506
and after that, defense lawyers decide
whether to engage you or not,

125
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:46,843
and should you not give
a pro-defense opinion,

126
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,845
- you don't get hired?
- I am a professional.

127
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,431
You are a professional defense witness
who only gets paid

128
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:52,974
if you give pro-defense opinions,

129
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:56,895
and your opinion today goes to
a time of death based off stomach contents

130
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:00,565
which your opinion assumes
the victim ate Chinese food at 10 p.m.

131
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:06,363
But you can't state to a medical certainty
or even likelihood that she did.

132
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,282
I have that right? Thank you.

133
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,996
[Raymond] Okay. Let's assume
that we were successful today

134
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,707
in getting the jury to believe,
or at least consider,

135
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,877
that Carolyn was murdered at midnight,
or sometime after.

136
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:25,048
We need to establish that you were home
at that time. Can we do that?

137
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,884
I can do that. I can vouch for him.

138
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,308
We cannot call her.

139
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,644
Why not?

140
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,984
Because you're biased,
and because you offer an easy opportunity

141
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:46,319
for them to repaint your husband
in a negative light.

142
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,071
"Isn't it true, Mrs. Sabich,

143
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,574
that you didn't know
that he was sleeping with the victim?"

144
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:52,033
"Isn't it true, Mrs. Sabich,

145
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:55,161
that even after he said
the affair was over, it started up again?"

146
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:58,123
"Isn't it true that he failed
to share with you

147
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:00,500
that he was there
the night she was murdered?

148
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,793
That he got her pregnant?"

149
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,588
"Did you have an open relationship,
Mrs. Sabich?"

150
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:06,548
"Does he know everything about you?"

151
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,758
"We all have secrets.

152
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,970
Does he know about Clifton,
friendly neighborhood bartender?"

153
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,139
[Rusty] What the fuck?

154
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:17,893
Have you been following me?

155
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:22,606
We sometimes hire private investigators
on the theory that the truth can help us.

156
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:25,108
Sometimes it does.

157
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:30,947
We rest.

158
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,034
We have reasonable doubt. Why risk it?

159
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:35,827
I think I agree.

160
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:37,746
And I'll close.

161
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:41,124
Oh, no.

162
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,753
No. On... On that, I take issue.

163
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:47,422
- It's my life. I will close.
- [Raymond] Rusty,

164
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:50,884
you have absolutely no credibility
with that jury.

165
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:53,470
Why would they believe
a word that you have to say at this point?

166
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,096
I mean, Jesus Christ.

167
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,307
In Maine, where I'm from,
if you went out to feed pigs,

168
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,684
you'd have to get somebody else
to call them. Jesus Christ.

169
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:04,814
I will close. And let me just say this.
Doubt from a jury, that works for me.

170
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:08,360
But doubt from my lawyers,
that doesn't work.

171
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,196
And from my best friend,
that doesn't work either.

172
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,582
[sighs]

173
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:25,335
[Lorraine] <i>You should withdraw.</i>

174
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:26,836
That's not possible.

175
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:27,921
Hmm.

176
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:32,259
Of course it's possible.
If he refuses to follow your counsel...

177
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:34,803
Judge Lyttle would never let me out
at this point.

178
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:37,180
It would be deemed prejudicial.

179
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:43,019
He's not well.

180
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:50,110
Well or not, innocent or not,
he'll be ready.

181
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,033
Honey, this trial
already almost killed you once.

182
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,369
[chuckles]

183
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:04,207
After this, I retire. I promise.

184
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:07,252
- I'll go for walks, mow the lawn...
- [scoffs, chuckles]

185
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:08,628
...I'll drink ice tea with you,

186
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:13,091
I will go full Thornton Wilder
and embrace the ordinary...

187
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:19,097
but we are a long way from that right now.

188
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:28,732
There's no physical, or forensic
or testimonial evidence.

189
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:31,818
Nico Della Guardia... [stammers]

190
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:33,486
And there's also Liam Reynolds...

191
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:40,285
Caldwell, other uninvestigated...

192
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:43,330
...me from... from the beginning...

193
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,957
...victim. Well, so did I.

194
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,376
[stammers] It's exactly what...

195
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:53,256
Never in my 15 years of being a prosecutor
for this great city would I ever, ever...

196
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:55,342
...mistrial, and he told you
that he had feelings for the victim.

197
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:59,679
Well, so did I. I loved her very much.

198
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,808
I-I-I-I miss her very much,
and I wanna know who did this,

199
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:06,144
like many people do. And I understand...

200
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,188
Hey.

201
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:09,689
Hey.

202
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,152
I'm just practicing my closing.

203
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:17,197
Hmm. I can see that.

204
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:20,033
Do you need any help?

205
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,245
I took AP astronomy,

206
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,872
so I could probably tell
if something's coming from another planet.

207
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,457
[both chuckling]

208
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:30,710
<i>Et tu</i>, daughter?

209
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:35,465
[chuckles]
He was kind of mad in the end, you know.

210
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:41,054
Well, you know,
getting stabbed by all your friends...

211
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,557
Can get under a man's skin.

212
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:50,397
Dad, for real?

213
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:53,483
The summation?

214
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:00,240
Your mom tell you to come in here? [sighs]

215
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,126
I'm my best chance, Jay.

216
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:31,396
[Jaden breathes shakily]

217
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:32,772
I've done this before.

218
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,568
I got this.

219
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,531
Okay.

220
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:47,787
Okay.

221
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,051
- [grunts]
- [ball thuds]

222
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:03,803
[grunts]

223
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:20,153
[thudding continues]

224
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:32,791
[Raymond] Just the elements.

225
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,587
Don't be going off
on how Tommy's the real killer...

226
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:40,549
- [breathing heavily]
- <i>...or Liam Reynolds, or the ex-husband.</i>

227
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:50,517
<i>You hear me?</i>

228
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:53,186
Rusty?

229
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:55,772
Yeah, I hear you.

230
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:58,984
[Raymond breathes deeply]

231
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,118
[Laryn] All right.

232
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:54,372
We'll hear from the defense.

233
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,275
My name, as you already know,
is Rusty Sabich.

234
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,112
I am the accused.

235
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,532
Accused of murder.

236
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,955
The pain of having to say that
in this room...

237
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:40,460
[grunts]
...in front of my wife and my children...

238
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:52,222
What the evidence did prove is
I betrayed my family,

239
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:54,599
the people I love most.

240
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,729
I will never be able to undo
the anguish that I caused my wife,

241
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:05,026
and I will never most likely be able
to earn the respect back from my children.

242
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:11,074
But what the evidence did not prove
is that I killed Carolyn Polhemus,

243
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:13,034
because I did not kill her.

244
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:18,957
I had an affair with Carolyn,
one that I kept secret.

245
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:23,879
I got her pregnant, and that was something
I only learned after her passing.

246
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,632
And I was there that night,
as I was on other nights,

247
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:30,302
but that is all the evidence could
or did prove.

248
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:33,471
There were no eyewitnesses,
there-there was no blood

249
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:38,476
or forensic evidence on my... on my person
and on my clothes, in my car, in my home.

250
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:42,480
[stammers] My fingerprints are
in her apartment,

251
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,442
because I was there that night
and on other nights,

252
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:49,112
but that is all the evidence could prove.

253
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,867
Now, Tommy Molto, he stood here
at the beginning of the trial,

254
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:57,454
and he told you
that he had feelings for the victim.

255
00:17:58,038 --> 00:17:59,247
Well, so did I.

256
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,128
I cared for her so much.

257
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:08,965
I-I-I loved her so much.

258
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,384
And I miss her so much.

259
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:15,513
And I, like many people,
want to know who did this.

260
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,766
I want to get who did this.

261
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:22,187
As do the police, as does
the district attorney, Tommy Molto.

262
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:25,440
So much so, that despite having certitude,

263
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,151
he will settle for the next best thing,
namely me.

264
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,195
And boy, do I fit the bill.

265
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:35,283
Circumstances point to me.
I'll-I'll admit that.

266
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:38,078
But not only me.

267
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:42,249
There were other people
who had fixations on Carolyn.

268
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,001
There is Michael Caldwell,
the victim's son,

269
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,753
who was also there that night.

270
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:49,714
Who was also very, very angry
at his mother.

271
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:52,842
And who had access
to the Bunny Davis file.

272
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:57,847
Now, his clothes, his person, his home
were never investigated.

273
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,976
There was no warrant issued
for his father, Dalton Caldwell,

274
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,311
who was very angry at the victim as well,

275
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:05,772
and who could have possibly had access
to the Bunny Davis files.

276
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:08,525
Now, is any of that evidence
to prove that Michael Caldwell

277
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,527
or Dalton Caldwell
killed Carolyn Polhemus?

278
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:13,280
Of course not,
but it certainly makes you wonder.

279
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:17,867
Now, I'm on trial. I'm biased.

280
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:21,288
But I will tell you that in the 15 years
that I have been a prosecutor

281
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,998
for this great city, I will tell you,

282
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:24,958
I would never
bring charges against someone

283
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,502
without the burden of proof
being possibly satisfied,

284
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:29,629
and that is exactly what
the prosecution has done here.

285
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,840
They have charged me with a crime,

286
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,093
and they have no evidence
that they can remotely prove.

287
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:39,055
There is no physical, testimonial,
forensic evidence.

288
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,473
There is no murder weapon.

289
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:43,476
There are other
possible uninvestigated suspects.

290
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:47,731
And let's add Liam Reynolds,
who threatened the victim on record.

291
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:54,070
Also, there is no actual time of death.
So reasonable doubt exists in abundance.

292
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:56,072
Which begs the question...

293
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:00,368
why are we even here?

294
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:08,919
In high-profile cases,
the burden on the prosecutors...

295
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,465
who are politicians, by the way...
is to satisfy the public.

296
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:18,011
They need to hold somebody accountable.
They need to find somebody accountable.

297
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:21,097
Anybody. And in this case,
I am their best shot.

298
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,725
I am Tommy Molto's best shot.

299
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:25,977
And he has wanted to get me
from the beginning.

300
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:29,481
His resentment, his contempt,
it has been on full display.

301
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:31,107
He is on a mission.

302
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:46,873
This... This case. [sighs, stammers]
It's not about Tommy Molto,

303
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,628
it's not about me,
it's not even about Carolyn...

304
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:56,258
at least not the application of justice...
it's about you.

305
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:59,636
You took an oath. You swore to a duty,

306
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:05,058
that to convict you must find proof
without a reasonable doubt.

307
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:13,692
I accept your contempt.

308
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:20,949
I deserve your contempt. [clears throat]

309
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:26,538
As a... As a husband...

310
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:33,253
As a... As a father...

311
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:38,466
And as a man.

312
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:48,435
But I did not kill Carolyn Polhemus,

313
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,230
which is why
there is no evidence that I did.

314
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:57,569
I am not honorable.

315
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:06,036
[chuckles] But the irony is,
I-I-I hope that you are.

316
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,041
Thank you.

317
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,069
[sniffs]

318
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:57,963
The defendant spoke
of his love for the victim,

319
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:00,715
but I think
what came out during the trial,

320
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:04,553
and Mr. Sabich admitted to,
is it... it wasn't... it wasn't just love.

321
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:06,471
It was an obsession.

322
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:10,850
He said that he wanted to get the person
who did this.

323
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,438
Well, as chief deputy prosecutor,
he had a unique opportunity to do so.

324
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:17,399
In fact, he headed the investigation.

325
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:20,318
Let me tell you, the first 48 hours
following any homicide

326
00:23:20,318 --> 00:23:22,028
are crucial to solving it.

327
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:23,863
And what did he do
during that critical time?

328
00:23:23,863 --> 00:23:26,616
He withheld information, he obstructed,

329
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:30,287
he told our lead detective to share
evidentiary materials with him alone.

330
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:32,872
Specifically not with me.

331
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:35,250
And he failed to disclose

332
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,253
that he was embroiled
in a sexual relationship with the victim,

333
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:40,797
that he was in the throes
of a volatile breakup,

334
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:44,426
that he was at her house
the night that she was murdered.

335
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,011
He sat on all of that.

336
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:48,054
That's not the behavior
of an innocent man,

337
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,058
certainly not one vested with
the responsibility of catching her killer.

338
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,894
He lied.

339
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:56,897
Concealed.

340
00:23:56,897 --> 00:24:00,233
And he sought to bribe and extort others
into giving false confessions.

341
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:04,029
He physically attacked
our chief medical examiner,

342
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,031
and he beat up a potential witness.

343
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:11,411
That is not consistent with innocence,
nor is it consistent with non-violence,

344
00:24:11,912 --> 00:24:14,456
which the defendant
represented himself to be.

345
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:18,585
Now, his own very good friend,
Eugenia Milk,

346
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:21,755
said that he was acting outside himself

347
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:24,883
in these days leading up to the murder,
losing himself to Carolyn.

348
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:29,054
He sent 30 texts
on the day that she was murdered,

349
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:33,350
including this one,
"Who the fuck do you think you are?"

350
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,894
"Who the fuck do you think you are?"

351
00:24:35,894 --> 00:24:38,230
He was there, he was seen there,

352
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,148
his DNA and fingerprints are there,

353
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:41,858
and then he says to you
with a straight face,

354
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:45,070
with this very charming face, right...

355
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,156
He says to you,
"There's no real evidence."

356
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:50,617
Really?

357
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:55,455
Well, the defendant is a very,
very good liar.

358
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:57,707
And a murderer.

359
00:24:58,291 --> 00:24:59,542
Look what was done to her.

360
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,753
On the day he went there,

361
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,964
on the day he texted her,
on the day she rejected him,

362
00:25:03,964 --> 00:25:07,384
and on the night
that he was last seen with her,

363
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:08,468
look what was done.

364
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,805
And he gets up here, and he says,

365
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:15,934
"Hey, it could've been Liam Reynolds,
or it could've been her ex-husband."

366
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,603
Or I think he alluded to
that it could've been me.

367
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,106
It could've been me. [chuckles] Okay.

368
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:27,571
That's all just
garden-variety desperation.

369
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:28,530
It's normal.

370
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:34,286
What is not normal is him alluding to
or accusing her son

371
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:36,329
in all of this.

372
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:38,623
It's... It's diabolical.

373
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:39,958
It's sociopathic.

374
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:43,044
Look, the defendant,
as chief deputy prosecutor,

375
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:47,299
had an opportunity to catch the person
who killed Carolyn Polhemus.

376
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:48,633
And what did he do?

377
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:49,676
He concealed.

378
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:51,386
He obstructed.

379
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:52,512
Why?

380
00:25:52,512 --> 00:25:56,725
Because he knew that
the killer wasn't out there somewhere.

381
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:58,935
The killer was right here.

382
00:26:05,817 --> 00:26:11,323
There is an opportunity for justice
that is alive today, and it falls to you.

383
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:13,658
All right?

384
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:16,328
He's put my... What did he call it?

385
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:18,038
My-My contempt!

386
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,417
My contempt, my demeanor at issue.

387
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,920
Fine. He's-He's begging you to look at me.

388
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,589
Look at me. Take a good, hard look at me.

389
00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:31,885
But then...

390
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,223
take a good, hard look at this man.

391
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,342
[Carolyn] <i>This is the worst part.</i>

392
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:17,347
<i>The waiting. Or second worst.
I guess losing would be even worse.</i>

393
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:18,431
[Rusty] <i>I wouldn't know.</i>

394
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:20,934
[Carolyn chuckles]

395
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:23,520
Right. Because you're too special to lose.

396
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,939
- Well, that's what I assume.
- [chuckles]

397
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:28,900
[sighs]

398
00:27:30,193 --> 00:27:32,779
<i>Seriously, what are we gonna make of it?
The wait.</i>

399
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:36,491
The longer the jury deliberates,
you know, the more it favors the defense.

400
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:40,453
[breathes deeply]

401
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,273
Hey.

402
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,819
We might as well go home. [sighs]

403
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:14,696
You know, they could be out a while.

404
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:18,116
Besides, I do worry about the cat.

405
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,954
- You think that's funny?
- It's a joke, Tommy. Come on.

406
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:24,372
- I'm just saying, it's like...
- I know.

407
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:25,707
...waiting for a pot to boil here.

408
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,918
Let's go get a drink or something.

409
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:30,045
See, I think it was his insurance policy.

410
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:31,296
Like, all along.

411
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:33,548
- Huh?
- The poker?

412
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,842
Okay... If-If he l-loses,

413
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:40,764
then he has something to exploit
for a new trial or... Somehow.

414
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:45,477
All right, yeah. You think
that Rusty left the poker in your house?

415
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:48,146
God, what the fuck
did she ever see in him?

416
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:51,608
[inhales sharply]

417
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:56,947
Can I ask you a-a personal question?

418
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,370
How much did you love her?

419
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:05,830
Really.

420
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,415
- [groans]
- [knocks]

421
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:09,668
Guys, verdict.

422
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:02,113
All right.

423
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,992
Go ahead and stand, Mr. Sabich.

424
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,710
Madam Clerk, if you'll read the verdict.

425
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,962
Yes, Your Honor.

426
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:23,969
"Superior Court of Illinois, Cook County,
in the matter of

427
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:27,639
<i>the People of the State of Illinois
v. Rozat K. Sabich,</i>

428
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:31,560
case number 6710098,

429
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,398
we the jury in the above entitled action
find the defendant Rozat K. Sabich"...

430
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:39,526
[breathes softly]

431
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:43,196
- ..."not guilty of the crime of murder"...
- [spectators exclaiming, cheering]

432
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:48,827
..."in violation
of penal code section 609.195,

433
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:53,373
a felony, upon Carolyn Polhemus,
a human being,

434
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:56,376
as charged in the count one
of the information."

435
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:23,987
[no audible dialogue]

436
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:05,820
It almost doesn't feel real.

437
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,282
[Jaden] It's over, right?

438
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:12,118
They can't appeal or go for another trial?

439
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:15,205
Yeah, prosecution won't appeal.
It's-It's over.

440
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:20,252
But the sooner they hear from me,
the sooner they'll clear out.

441
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:28,760
[sighs]

442
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:36,685
I mean, obviously
I'm gratified here by the verdict. Um...

443
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:39,980
legal justice was done.

444
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,941
As well as moral justice...

445
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:47,028
<i>in that I'm an innocent man,
and I did not commit this crime.</i>

446
00:33:49,406 --> 00:33:51,700
<i>But justice by no means is complete here.</i>

447
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,661
<i>Justice has not been realized
for Carolyn Polhemus.</i>

448
00:33:54,661 --> 00:33:57,706
<i>Her killer is still out there,
and her murder is still unsolved.</i>

449
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:00,458
<i>The justice system,
especially the prosecutor's office,</i>

450
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,043
<i>has failed Carolyn Polhemus.</i>

451
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:04,004
<i>She deserved better. Much better.</i>

452
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:06,006
<i>And the reason that she didn't get better</i>

453
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:08,842
<i>was because those entrusted
with serving justice were compromised</i>

454
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,595
<i>by ambition, and I suspect, um, emotion.</i>

455
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,141
<i>Tommy Molto.</i>

456
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,394
<i>He put the blinders on from day one.</i>

457
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:22,480
<i>He lost the plot.
It was a ready, fire, aim process,</i>

458
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,901
<i>and the district attorney's office,
they failed miserably here.</i>

459
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:28,320
<i>They prioritized a vendetta
over the truth,</i>

460
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,530
<i>and they most failed Carolyn Polhemus.</i>

461
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:11,529
[inhales deeply]

462
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,408
[grunts, sighs]

463
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,833
Tommy... Tommy,
you tried a magnificent case.

464
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:25,335
You did.

465
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,759
We had a circumstantial set of facts,
and you tried your best.

466
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,053
He beat me.

467
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:38,306
- [clears throat]
- I let her down.

468
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:42,185
Her death will go unavenged
'cause I wasn't good enough.

469
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:45,772
[stammers] No. No. Tommy, listen.

470
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,818
You need to move on, all right?

471
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,571
This is Chicago.

472
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:56,449
There are so many wonderfully
heinous people for you to go after.

473
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:59,536
We need to move on and do our job,
all right?

474
00:36:00,036 --> 00:36:04,457
And... And personally,
you need to move on from Rusty Sabich.

475
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:07,127
You do.

476
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,715
There is work to be done.
Let's get on with it.

477
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:14,611
[machine whirring]

478
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,977
I guess we can take that vacation now.
I see you're all packed.

479
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:48,937
[machine stops]

480
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:51,273
[panting]

481
00:37:54,317 --> 00:37:55,318
Yeah.

482
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,536
It was Dr. Rush's advice...

483
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,418
should there be a next time.

484
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:15,505
A next time?

485
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:18,341
Yeah. [breathes heavily]

486
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:20,677
[chuckles]

487
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:26,892
Should you ever again
impulsively strike to destroy this family.

488
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,062
A next time?

489
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:37,611
[scoffs]

490
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:46,328
I actually knew from the beginning,
and then I didn't know.

491
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,498
And then I knew again for sure.

492
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,044
Rusty, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

493
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:56,963
All that was going
through my head was just,

494
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:59,799
"This was my doing. This was my fault.
This was my doing."

495
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:03,720
And I had to do what I had to do
to protect my family, to protect you,

496
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,804
so I did.

497
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,435
[groaning] No.

498
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:15,023
But what didn't compute was that you just
seemed so utterly normal the next day.

499
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:17,567
Just disaffected.

500
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,362
I didn't know that you could kill somebody
and not even wobble.

501
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:30,497
You think I killed Carolyn?

502
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:37,963
No, it was somebody else,
but somebody in your body,

503
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:41,007
like it was probably somebody else
in my body who tied her up.

504
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:46,555
What do you mean you-you tied her up?

505
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:49,683
To cover for you.

506
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:54,062
What?

507
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,650
I went back there that night.

508
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:01,820
[breathes shakily]

509
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,947
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

510
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:06,199
Carolyn? Carolyn!

511
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:08,118
No, no, no, no! Carolyn?

512
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,912
What... [whimpers, panting]

513
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:13,290
<i>And I first went for my phone to call 911</i>

514
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,417
in case, by some chance,
she was still alive,

515
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:21,006
though clearly she... wasn't.

516
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:25,468
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck! [panting]

517
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:27,012
<i>And then it hit me.</i>

518
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,140
<i>There was only one person
who could've done this.</i>

519
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,769
So I didn't call 911,
to protect that one person,

520
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:37,606
so that suspicion wouldn't fall to her.

521
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,651
[groans, stammers]

522
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:45,572
W-What about all that...
that stuff with, um...

523
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:48,658
L-Liam Reynolds?

524
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:53,538
[Rusty] <i>False confessions are easy
to extract. We do it all the time.</i>

525
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:55,332
We... I offered him less jail,

526
00:40:55,332 --> 00:40:57,125
- which is usually enough.
- [gasps]

527
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,960
[Rusty] <i>It was worth a shot.</i>

528
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,425
- Rusty, you're s... you're sick.
- But then I start to think,

529
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:07,219
"You know, my God,
I must have this wrong."

530
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:09,971
But then Jaden, she was telling me
about disassociation,

531
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:12,265
how a person can be severed from the self,

532
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:15,477
that they can compartmentalize off an act
from the person.

533
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:18,063
And I just started to realize,
that's exactly what happened.

534
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:21,483
You just snapped with Carolyn,
and then the next day,

535
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,194
i-it became as if somebody else
had committed the act.

536
00:41:24,694 --> 00:41:26,112
You're insane.

537
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:31,034
And you're wrong!

538
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,246
[chuckling] I'm not wrong.

539
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:38,041
After your thing with the bartender,
I tracked your car, B.

540
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:41,503
What?

541
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:48,385
I know that it was you who went to
Tommy Molto's house to plant that poker.

542
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:54,474
I mean, I'm assuming
to ostensibly help me, but you went there.

543
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,520
[gasps]

544
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,813
[Jaden] No, she didn't.

545
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:08,780
I did.

546
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:11,241
What?

547
00:42:12,701 --> 00:42:14,244
I... [breathes heavily]

548
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:19,416
I thought you were going
to be convicted after your testimony.

549
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:22,586
It was the only thing I could think to do.

550
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:25,422
[Rusty stammers] Wait. [sighs]

551
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:27,215
What...

552
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:30,677
I drove there in Mom's car.

553
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,473
[breathes shakily]

554
00:42:36,308 --> 00:42:37,309
What?

555
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:41,897
I put the poker in his kitchen.

556
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:46,276
Jay. Jay?

557
00:42:46,276 --> 00:42:48,361
No. [whimpering] No, no.

558
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:50,196
[Rusty] How did you have the fire poker?

559
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:53,116
[knocking]

560
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:57,829
I just went there to confront her, and...

561
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:02,083
Hey.

562
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:05,170
[sobs] No.

563
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:07,130
[breathes shakily]

564
00:43:13,053 --> 00:43:14,721
[Carolyn] You sure you don't want any tea?

565
00:43:15,597 --> 00:43:16,640
No.

566
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:21,770
- ...tell her to stay away from you.
- [breathes shakily]

567
00:43:22,354 --> 00:43:24,564
Stay away from our family.
[inhales sharply]

568
00:43:24,564 --> 00:43:26,650
[sobbing]

569
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:35,659
It's not me, it's your father.

570
00:43:36,576 --> 00:43:38,119
He won't leave me alone.

571
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,204
That isn't true.

572
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:44,000
You need to quit your job
and stay away from my family forever.

573
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:47,420
Stay the fuck away.

574
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,424
I will stay away from him.

575
00:43:53,218 --> 00:43:55,720
But our lives
are going to be intertwined a little.

576
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:58,098
'Cause I'm pregnant...

577
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,434
with his child.

578
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,194
[whimpering, breathing shakily]

579
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:21,621
[pants]

580
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:23,582
[grunting]

581
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:27,544
[sniffles, whimpering]

582
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,882
[exhales shakily]

583
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:38,138
And then I was driving home,

584
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:42,726
<i>and I thought it was just a dream.</i>

585
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:46,146
[crying, sniffling]

586
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:47,230
<i>And it wasn't.</i>

587
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:52,777
And when you guys went to breakfast,
I said I wasn't feeling well,

588
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,738
and I cleaned the car,

589
00:44:56,364 --> 00:45:00,243
<i>and I buried the poker.</i>

590
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,715
[breathes shakily]

591
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,100
Okay, listen to me.

592
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:28,063
We will never speak of this.

593
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:30,565
Listen really carefully, Jay.

594
00:45:31,483 --> 00:45:33,401
This is something that came out of you

595
00:45:34,486 --> 00:45:36,238
in a form of self-defense...

596
00:45:37,197 --> 00:45:38,114
[crying]

597
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:39,783
...in defense of this family.

598
00:45:43,995 --> 00:45:47,374
And it was put into motion by me.

599
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:51,086
This is my doing.

600
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:57,717
We will survive as a family.

601
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,221
Okay?

602
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:05,058
We love each other.

603
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:15,902
[Jaden sniffles, cries]

604
00:46:20,031 --> 00:46:21,825
We're a family, and we love each other.

605
00:46:55,483 --> 00:46:58,737
[speaks indistinctly]

606
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:28,558
Yeah!

607
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:30,894
Yes!

608
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,658
[Jaden] So perfect.

609
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:51,873
Anyone want gravy?

610
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,626
Thank you.

611
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:06,805
[all chattering]
