1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:04,170
How am I supposed to walk into
that meeting with no presentation?

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,615
How the hell did
you screw this up?

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,714
It wasn't me.

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,800
She's lying. No. We agreed...

5
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,343
Her team had
all the financials.

6
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,011
And we were swamped
modeling them,

7
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,472
that's why we agreed that
you would do the slides.

8
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,677
Well, one of you screwed up.

9
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,350
So please try to figure it out,

10
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
'cause when
the client dumps me,

11
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,019
I need to know who to fire.

12
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:23,106
I confirmed in the e-mail.
Hold on. Here.

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,363
She did tell you
about it, Russ.

14
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,745
I never got this.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,832
Russ, are you okay?

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,918
Are you drunk?

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,545
I'm not drunk.

18
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,469
I'm not drunk. I'm...

19
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,268
I had no idea
he was drinking again.

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,437
Well, you should have.

21
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,230
Give me five minutes, I'll
go to the business center

22
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,940
and print the graphs directly
from the spreadsheets.

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,651
Run. And bring me
some paper towels.

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,906
What?

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,034
Oh, it hurts.

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,453
Don't tell me
you were drinking, too.

27
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,954
No.

28
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,457
My ears. Oh, my God.

29
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:01,662
Twenty-seven-year-old female, intense
intermittent ear pain, saw six doctors...

30
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,623
Tell her to stop
lurking in the front row.

31
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,166
If she wants to
hit on musicians,

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,002
that's what tour buses
are for. Next.

33
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,879
If I ask why we're
in Wilson's office,

34
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,131
is there any chance
I'll get a straight answer?

35
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,633
Try it, try it.

36
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,428
Fourteen-year-old boy, joint
pain and excess hair growth.

37
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,515
Tell him to masturbate no
more than three times daily.

38
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,433
With meals. Next.

39
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:26,562
Did I mention that the 27-year-old
female is really hot?

40
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,898
And her husband is really not.

41
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,650
Wild guess. He's rich.

42
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:35,238
Not unless social workers have begun
pulling in the big money recently.

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,824
Give me.

44
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,325
You're taking the case
because she's hot?

45
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,744
No, that would be
an accident of genetics.

46
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,413
It's because she's hot
and her husband is ugly.

47
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,166
That's a fascinating window into
the mysteries of human psychology.

48
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,085
Also, she's "really" hot.

49
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,712
Or she, you know,
loves her husband.

50
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,839
She loves something about him.

51
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,424
Vitamin deficiency. She changed
her diet a few months ago.

52
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,636
To a healthier diet.
Raw foods, lots of nuts.

53
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,889
It's not the ear,
it's the heart.

54
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,226
Her protein was cheese,
which can raise cholesterol.

55
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,354
Hers was already elevated,
gave her arterial blockages.

56
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,483
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting as ear pain.
Very rare. Cool.

57
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,695
So Beauty and the Beast.
Who wants to go see?

58
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:39,468
Let's see. Dr. Taub,
Foreman, Chase and Hadley.

59
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,761
Four for four.

60
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,430
Wow, I can't believe
I get all these doctors.

61
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,890
And such
good-looking ones, too.

62
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,434
Yeah, it's almost like we
don't all need to be here.

63
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,854
Your case presented a very
interesting diagnostic challenge.

64
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,022
Oh.

65
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,866
You can't sleep
in your own office?

66
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,075
Or bedroom, for that matter?

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,912
Got to avoid my
natural habitat.

68
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:10,082
Some idiot I went to med school
with keeps leaving messages,

69
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,626
wants to drop by for lunch.

70
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,252
So tell him "no."

71
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,420
It's complicated.

72
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,422
It's too complicated for you
to tell someone

73
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,716
you don't like to screw off?

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,885
That's practically your hobby.

75
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,765
A few months ago, he was
sort of part of my therapy.

76
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,895
My shrink told me write a letter
of apology to someone I hurt.

77
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,980
And how did you hurt him?

78
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,316
We were in a seminar
on flatworm genetics.

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,234
I switched my final paper
with his.

80
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,195
You plagiarized?
Doesn't sound like you.

81
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,571
I was testing a theory.

82
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,574
I thought that our professor
was biased against me.

83
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,460
I assumed he'd get a high
grade with my paper,

84
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,079
and I'd get
a low grade with his.

85
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,791
Interestingly, I was wrong.
I got an A.

86
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,196
So you're in this
mental hospital,

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,127
delving into your subconscious,

88
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,296
and this is who you choose
to apologize to?

89
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,465
Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.

90
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,269
Of all the people in the
world you've hurt...

91
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,595
Not everyone has a name that's so
easy to find in the White Pages.

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,514
I'm in there. And so is Cuddy.

93
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,308
Yeah. Yet I picked him.
It's funny, isn't it?

94
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,518
Yes, it's hilarious.

95
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,854
Great to see what a
success your therapy was.

96
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,275
We said we'd never
to go to sleep angry!

97
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,821
We did find an arrhythmia, but it's not
from your arteries, they're clean.

98
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,072
Will the pain come back?

99
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,116
We'll start her on cardiac
meds, that should help.

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,910
But we still need to figure out
what's causing the arrhythmia.

101
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,495
Hey, Valerie.

102
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,747
Russ.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,292
It's so nice of you to stop by.

104
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,003
I got lots of free time now.

105
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,963
You don't blame me, do you?

106
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,881
You were drunk
in front of Norris.

107
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:45,052
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm drunk now.

108
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:50,933
Then, it was like someone
poisoned me or something.

109
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,521
Maybe you should
come back later.

110
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,356
Okay.

111
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,319
I just wanna say goodbye.

112
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,115
Okay, Russ.
Thank you for coming by.

113
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,953
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

114
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,664
You poor son of a bitch.

115
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,590
She doesn't love you any
more than she loved me.

116
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,376
Okay, you need
to leave right now.

117
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,545
You're pretending you had
an affair with my wife?

118
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,798
Yeah, we're all pretending. You
got nothing to worry about.

119
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,843
Tell them where you were
six months ago, Russ.

120
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,640
I had a breakdown. I had some
paranoid tendencies, as they say.

121
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,269
But it turns out, I had
a right to be paranoid.

122
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,896
You need help.

123
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,191
Get him out of here.

124
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,901
Okay. Okay.

125
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,493
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,915
Are you okay? You okay?

127
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,249
Yeah, I'm okay.

128
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,878
We'll keep an eye out. He's not
getting back in the hospital.

129
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,589
He's making all that up.
You know that, right?

130
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,382
Yeah, of course.

131
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,265
Where are you?

132
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,600
Undisclosed location.

133
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,726
Who are you hiding from?

134
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,852
Wilson.

135
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,604
And the lunch date
that Wilson is,

136
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,815
no doubt, right now,
trying to sic on me.

137
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,901
But in the great game of chess
that is our relationship,

138
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,863
Wilson sees only one move
ahead, I see dozens.

139
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,616
That is why he will
never mate me.

140
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,160
That's a chess term.

141
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,122
That's great. A co-worker
confronted our patient.

142
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,792
Altered mental status. Basically
accused her of poisoning him.

143
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,957
We think he was projecting.

144
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,461
So he's poisoning her.

145
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,706
What could he get his hands on

146
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,673
to cause supraventricular
tachycardia?

147
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,634
Does he have dry skin,
thin eyebrows?

148
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,889
If you're sharing an amazed
look, please do it louder.

149
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,724
He might have.
How did you know that?

150
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,685
He has hypothyroidism,

151
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,049
he dumped his meds
in her coffee,

152
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,730
that would make her heart
go boom, in a bad way.

153
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,857
We'll treat with beta blockers.

154
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,733
I'm sorry,
but I totally disagree.

155
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,527
- With what?
- With everything.

156
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,737
Why are we assuming he's lying
and she's telling the truth?

157
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,532
Because she's a successful,
happily married consultant,

158
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,950
and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo

159
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,285
who we just tossed
out of the hospital.

160
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,536
And she's hot.

161
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,204
Maybe she picked him
because he's vulnerable.

162
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,665
There's something off
about her, I can feel it.

163
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,000
If you had any evidence...

164
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,335
Why didn't she tell us a
co-worker puked on her shoes

165
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,503
right before she collapsed?

166
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,714
Because it's medically irrelevant.
He was drunk, she was sick.

167
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,882
You don't think it's suspicious

168
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,216
she didn't mention
it to her husband?

169
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,469
Yeah, Foreman, why did you
break up with Thirteen?

170
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,265
Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual
thing she was saying, why that?

171
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,516
This is about the case,

172
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,686
not some imaginary issue that
you think Foreman and I have.

173
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,439
Great. Start her
on beta blockers.

174
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,613
You'll do it?

175
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,600
I don't think
he was talking to me.

176
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,658
Well, I am.

177
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,577
I'm the only one who
thinks you're wrong.

178
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,830
Maybe that's why
I'm asking you to do it.

179
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,392
Greg? Lorenzo Wibberly.

180
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,814
Dr. Wilson said you'd be here.
How you been?

181
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,234
Check and mate.

182
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,824
Look,

183
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,828
I'm sorry this is
awkward or whatever.

184
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,997
I just thought it was nice
of you to write that letter,

185
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,668
and I wanted to tell you that
you don't have to feel bad.

186
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,670
Thanks.

187
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,091
So, where you
working these days?

188
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,803
You got your own practice
or you at a hospital?

189
00:09:55,887 --> 00:10:00,057
I thought you knew. Dani's, the
organic supermarket chain.

190
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,059
As an in-house doctor?

191
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,313
I actually never got licensed.

192
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,065
I didn't graduate med school.

193
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,484
I planned on going back,
and then my father got sick

194
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,029
and I had to take care of
him, and I had some bad luck.

195
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,532
Why didn't you graduate?

196
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,658
I was one credit short.

197
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,203
And I was sort of already
on academic probation, so...

198
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,373
Which credit?

199
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,708
I got a...

200
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,464
He failed me on that paper you switched.
I thought you knew.

201
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,386
So I'm guessing you're the CEO
of this supermarket chain.

202
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,722
I bag groceries.

203
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,059
Life works out weird sometimes.

204
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,734
We were going to do it in Santa
Barbara because of his parents,

205
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,979
but then I found this beautiful
hotel in Montauk and...

206
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,323
You're testing her
for a brain tumor?

207
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,241
That's what I told her.
You can chastise me

208
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,743
after you look at the monitor.

209
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,994
Look what's lighting up.

210
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,413
Lateral frontal cortex,
Broca's area. So what?

211
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,706
I told her it was customary

212
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,000
to talk during MRis, to relax.

213
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,962
I spent the last 30 minutes asking her
about everything in life that she loves,

214
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:15,341
then hates, then feels
any emotion about at all.

215
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,217
There's nothing in the
paralimbic system, amygdala.

216
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,262
Because she's using the
language part of her brain

217
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,763
and bypassing the emotional.

218
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,474
She can understand
love and pain and empathy,

219
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,434
but she can't feel them at all.

220
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,146
She's a psychopath.

221
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,946
Why do you want to
meet her so badly?

222
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,032
Psychopaths always
fascinate me.

223
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,950
I think it's their
cultural literacy

224
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,245
and strong family values.
Or is that Jews?

225
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,370
We're not gonna be able to
get an honest read on her

226
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,333
unless we figure out a way to
get the husband out of there.

227
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,627
Hmm. I got an idea.

228
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,213
Can you get out of here?

229
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,256
Thanks.

230
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,473
It was the "thanks"
that did it.

231
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,477
Hi, I'm Dr. House. How long
have you been a psychopath?

232
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,107
Are you kidding? He's not.

233
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,776
Are you saying I'm like
Ted Bundy or something?

234
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,820
Psychopathy can get a bad rap.

235
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,780
Doesn't necessarily
mean you're violent.

236
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,573
Just that you're completely
without conscience,

237
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,991
you lack any normal emotion,

238
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,576
you manipulate
everyone around you,

239
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,413
you're promiscuous,
you lie pathologically.

240
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,623
Any of this ringing bells?

241
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,458
Is that why you were asking
me all those weird questions?

242
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,961
Yeah. Well, you have
Darwin to thank for that.

243
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,963
She got the creeps around you.

244
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,174
Which, oddly, is an actual medical
phenomenon around psychopaths,

245
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,176
probably an evolved
response to predators.

246
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,431
I'm sorry. You're really freaking me out.
I have no idea what...

247
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,183
Relax. We have a duty
of confidentiality.

248
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,269
And you have an
undiagnosed heart problem

249
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,937
that could kill you
at any moment.

250
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,440
We believe that
your mental abnormality

251
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,983
is related to
your physical one.

252
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,777
So if you want to
keep on "predating"...

253
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,037
What do you want to know?

254
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,715
Your co-worker's story was true.
You poisoned him.

255
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,344
No. I gave him a little
Valium and an emetic.

256
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,638
You sure you understand
what the word "no" means?

257
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,182
I've had them both before,
why can't he?

258
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,600
So you were just
helping him out?

259
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,437
I assume he was cool with the whole
seducing and firing part, too.

260
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,314
Russ knew what
he was getting into.

261
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,483
He got sex every
Thursday night,

262
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,568
and I got to take credit
for his best ideas.

263
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,570
And what are you getting
out of your marriage?

264
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,447
Same thing you get
out of your job.

265
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,951
Bill has a trust fund, and I have a
prenup his parents made me sign.

266
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,580
Told you he was rich.
She's not that weird.

267
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,624
I'm not so different
than anybody else.

268
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:58,170
Everyone I've ever known, my family,
my classmates, the people I work with,

269
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,755
they're all out for themselves.

270
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,882
Difference is,
I can admit it to myself.

271
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,567
She kind of reminds me
of someone I know.

272
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,010
Tell me about it.

273
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,347
Some of my co-workers will insult
people right to their faces.

274
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,766
How long have
you been this way?

275
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,353
Just how I am.

276
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,106
Are you gonna cure
my heart problems now?

277
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,362
So, psychopathy plus
cardiac arrhythmia. Go.

278
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,030
I thought you were bluffing
to get information.

279
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,782
You really think
they're connected?

280
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,534
Two rare conditions
in one patient,

281
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,118
it's a fair
assumption they are.

282
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,037
Psychopathy is
generally just genetic,

283
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,288
nothing you can do about it.

284
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,958
Something that hits 30 years after
birth isn't going to be connected.

285
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,210
There are diseases that could
lie dormant that long,

286
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,836
hit her heart, warp her brain.

287
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,547
Maybe a handful of diseases.

288
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,632
It'll be super awesome
when we find it.

289
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,602
Tertiary syphilis can
cause pseudopsychopathic

290
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,511
syndrome and cardiomyopathy.

291
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,471
Fits best.
Start her on penicillin,

292
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,877
rule out Wilson's
and Hashimoto's.

293
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,851
There's your handful.
Wasn't so hard, was it?

294
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,945
You gotta do something
about Thirteen.

295
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,739
She flouted both
my authority and yours.

296
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,200
Yes. And she got it right
and you got it wrong.

297
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,952
Which just aggravates
the problem.

298
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,205
She'll do it again. Next time,
it won't work out so well.

299
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,584
You got to punish her.

300
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,294
You're her boss,

301
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,963
in some vague, never to
be usefully defined way.

302
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,256
You punish her.

303
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,341
I'm also her ex,
which, as you know,

304
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,093
makes it a little complicated.

305
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,886
The fact that
you also fired her

306
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,180
takes it from a little
complicated to a little moronic.

307
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,265
It was the only way I...

308
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,017
It wasn't because you were
too in love with her,

309
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,269
it was because you were too
in love with your career.

310
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,842
We're almost at my floor,
so I'll summarize.

311
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,355
Your problem, not mine.

312
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,697
You cut up my only
copy of that photo.

313
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,158
That rare daguerreotype?

314
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,843
You can charge me
for the effort it takes

315
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,511
to search your hard drive
for a new copy.

316
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:58,373
Not the one of me and Lucas,
the one from Ecuador.

317
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,960
Right, I'd forgotten about your deep
emotional attachment to lemurs.

318
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,420
To my dad.

319
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,631
You got his tail.

320
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:10,093
He was holding the camera. That was
the last trip we ever took together.

321
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,596
And I don't have
a digital copy.

322
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,769
Well, I could stand here
all day apologizing,

323
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:22,230
but I'd rather expiate my
sins with good, clean work.

324
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,734
You ignoring my texts?

325
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,488
The crazy ones you sent, trying
to get me to make you feel better

326
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,325
about destroying your classmate's life?
No, I never got those.

327
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,421
Wibberly's got some agenda.

328
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,590
Probably trying to guilt me
into getting him a better job.

329
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,759
How pissed was he? Not at all.

330
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,553
That's how I know
he's got an agenda.

331
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,523
If you feel guilty, you
should do something to help.

332
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,441
You are responsible.

333
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,783
Thanks.

334
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,209
What? All I'm responsible for

335
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,129
is the foreseeable consequences
of switching papers.

336
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,799
A bad grade or a sleepless night.
Worst case, a retest.

337
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,801
There was no way to know
that one seminar paper

338
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,928
was gonna destroy
this idiot's life.

339
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,596
If there's any karma
in all this,

340
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,015
he's probably happier
than you are.

341
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,229
Good point. If he is happier,
there's no harm done.

342
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,564
I'll go find out.

343
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,941
That is absolutely
not what I said.

344
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,527
Always with the modesty,
this one.

345
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,724
You want something to eat?

346
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,975
I'm cool.

347
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,146
How's work?

348
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,815
You happy with it?

349
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,693
You know, it's a job.

350
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,989
I don't need to take any
work home with me at least.

351
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,868
Free time. Wouldn't have any
of that if you were a doctor.

352
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,828
Yeah. True.

353
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,249
You like chili?
I could reheat some.

354
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:50,045
Is that your yard? That's nice.

355
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:56,551
Yeah. That sugar maple,
100, 150 years old.

356
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,929
The most beautiful
leaves in the fall.

357
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,223
Sit underneath on the bench,

358
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,309
it's like paradise.

359
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,436
I don't have a yard, myself.

360
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,523
You got a good thing going.

361
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,942
I know.

362
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,276
So, what are the boxes for?

363
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,532
I'm moving.

364
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,741
From paradise?

365
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,284
Well, with my dad's
medical bills,

366
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,702
and me being one
of those idiots

367
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,539
that got an adjustable
mortgage, so...

368
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,541
You're losing your home.

369
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,919
Hey, could be worse, right?

370
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,880
How?

371
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,384
Even if the tests are positive,
you don't have to worry.

372
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,678
You're testing for syphilis,
not a cold.

373
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,804
Honey...

374
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,689
At this stage, it's
probably not communicable.

375
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,126
You think I'm worried
about myself?

376
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,504
I just want my wife
to get better.

377
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,018
She might have
caught it at birth,

378
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,979
so it doesn't prove
she was cheating.

379
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,146
If you were worried about that.

380
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,273
Of course not.

381
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,757
How many weeks
am I gonna have to...

382
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,651
You okay?

383
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,215
- Why is she coughing?
- I don't know.

384
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,029
You want some water?

385
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,368
Are you threatened by me?

386
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,039
Not at all.

387
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,374
Well, you should be.

388
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,750
You let him know
what I told you,

389
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,502
I will not only have
your license pulled,

390
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:15,380
I will sue you for everything
I lose in the divorce.

391
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,049
So the fun you get out of making
those snotty little comments,

392
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,093
is it worth $90 million?

393
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,387
Oh, wait.
Will you hold that look?

394
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,265
I'm really bad at showing emotions.
How's this?

395
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,228
Thanks, baby.

396
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,689
Can I have your arm, please?

397
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,656
My arm! You broke it!

398
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,248
I don't know what happened.
Neither do I.

399
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,666
But I know what happened after.

400
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,170
She called Cuddy and demanded
I kick you off the case.

401
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,672
I backed you up
because I trust you,

402
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,091
but you're gonna have to
earn that trust now.

403
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,593
Thanks.

404
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,303
Actually, he backed you up

405
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,348
because of the new BU N
creatinine numbers.

406
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,475
Brittle bones were
from kidney failure.

407
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,227
There is that.
So heart and kidneys.

408
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,354
And brain.

409
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,772
Nope. The psychopathy
is not a symptom.

410
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,898
It was yesterday.

411
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,192
In the meantime, kidney
failure ruled out syphilis,

412
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,235
and testing ruled out the other
ideas that would have fit.

413
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,446
Protein levels,
kidneys, arrhythmia.

414
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,491
- Could be paraneoplastic.
- I'd say lymphoma.

415
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,784
Get her to radiotherapy.

416
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,453
We can't start radiation without
immunoassays in her urine.

417
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,373
Great. So, you cast a spell and
magically fix her kidneys,

418
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,582
she can give us
some urine to test.

419
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,042
We have some left
from admission.

420
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,669
Not enough for a completely
accurate reading.

421
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,462
Then how about
partially accurate?

422
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,465
Those of you who haven't
slept together, you can go.

423
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,634
Everyone else, stay behind.

424
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,726
Oh, sorry,
that was our secret. Right.

425
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,068
Go have sex. No, thanks.

426
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,988
Fine, I'll cover the Viagra and the
lubricants, just get me a receipt.

427
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,739
We have zero feelings
for each other.

428
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,074
That's too bad,

429
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,493
'cause things worked much
better when you did.

430
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,661
Would it help
if I slept with her?

431
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,985
We were getting to a diagnosis.

432
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,998
No, we were already
at the diagnosis.

433
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,457
You were creating
a fake argument

434
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,903
about an irrelevant
treatment issue

435
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,585
'cause you can't stand
to be around each other.

436
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,422
So have sex, fight,
or quit, I don't care.

437
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,924
Whatever you're
doing now isn't working.

438
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,727
You okay?

439
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:34,936
Yeah.

440
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:41,234
Look, I get that you gotta
act fast, but radiation?

441
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,944
You definitely ruled out
everything else?

442
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,113
I'm sorry, but...

443
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,409
We could still check
for environmental toxins.

444
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,786
Where does she spend
most of her time?

445
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,872
Mostly at work, at home.

446
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,249
Hobbies? Recurring
activities outside the home?

447
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,043
No. Not really.

448
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,254
She took a landscaping
class at the Y.

449
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,589
When did it meet?

450
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,050
Every Thursday night
this summer.

451
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,763
You dig in soil, you can
be exposed to pesticides,

452
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,556
heavy metals,
lots of bad things.

453
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,725
Can you find out all about
her landscaping class,

454
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,643
where it was,
details like that?

455
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,520
Yeah. I'll do it now.

456
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,783
So when you watch Star Wars,
which side do you root for?

457
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:35,413
Dr. House, what are you doing?

458
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,750
Just checking in
on your radiotherapy.

459
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,337
From what I hear,
you never visit patients.

460
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,715
And now you've come
to chat with me twice.

461
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,843
I wanna know how you like being
a management consultant.

462
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm thinking of
getting into it.

463
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,889
That or psychopathy, maybe.

464
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,682
Which pays better?

465
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,936
I think you're already
into one of them.

466
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,771
Dr. Hadley made
a joke yesterday.

467
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,773
She said I sound like you.

468
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,069
You sure you understand
what "joke" means?

469
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,363
So you're not just
out for yourself?

470
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,741
For example, you would never
interrupt a sick woman's treatment

471
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,702
just because of some
personal obsession?

472
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,455
Of course I'm self-interested.

473
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,707
We all are,
we're born that way.

474
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,211
The rest of us are
born with consciences.

475
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,631
Which is something you
just sound ecstatic about.

476
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,302
I'm not saying it's logical,
I'm just saying it's human.

477
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,848
So if you know your conscience
is just an animal instinct,

478
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,100
you don't need to follow it.

479
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,937
I think you realize that.

480
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,605
That's why
you're talking to me.

481
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,086
You lied about
your landscaping class.

482
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,339
Dr. Hadley thought the soils
might be poisoned.

483
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,507
You told him that?

484
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,592
I just thought...

485
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,094
Russ said you were
having an affair.

486
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,598
Was that your cover? Every
Thursday night, you'd...

487
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,435
I'm so sorry.

488
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,021
Oh, God.

489
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,564
It's not what you think.

490
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,399
Do you remember
that telecom case

491
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,193
I said that we didn't
get last year?

492
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,612
In fact, we did.
And I was swamped.

493
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,977
Every Friday morning, we had a
conference call with London,

494
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,365
so the night before I would...

495
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,077
That's your excuse? You expect me to
believe that you were at the office?

496
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,246
What's the biggest argument
we've ever had?

497
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,874
You said I spend too much
time away from home,

498
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,668
that I don't need a job, that
you would take care of me.

499
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,629
Yeah. That's all true.

500
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,505
You yelled at me.

501
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,218
You made me feel like you didn't
value anything that I did.

502
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,510
I need this job

503
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,430
to feel like I'm accomplishing
something on my own.

504
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,766
That's why I lied to you.

505
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,726
If I call your office
tomorrow and I check...

506
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,895
Call my office,
call my secretary,

507
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,105
call my clients,
interrupt their dinner,

508
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,357
wake them up, I don't care.

509
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,484
I just want you
to know the truth.

510
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,488
You know I love you.

511
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,283
Come here.

512
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,619
Please.

513
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,920
It's okay.

514
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,722
Fire her.

515
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,433
What for? You seem to have lied
your way out of any trouble.

516
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,352
Until Bill checks up
on my cover,

517
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,437
and I have to create a whole
new one to cover that one up.

518
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,231
I've done it before,
but it's a pain,

519
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,483
and I would like Dr. Hadley
to share that pain.

520
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,943
She didn't reveal
any confidences,

521
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,486
and she had
a valid medical reason

522
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,988
to ask about your
landscaping class.

523
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,948
We can see what
a jury says about that.

524
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,825
And admit to your
husband the truth?

525
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,702
You're not going to sue us.

526
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,329
We will remove Dr. Hadley
from all patient contact.

527
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,414
What?

528
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,792
But it's for Dr. Hadley's
benefit, not yours.

529
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,878
We have no obligation
to inflict you on her.

530
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,213
Fine.

531
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,842
But just so you know, this
is not for your benefit.

532
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,178
Dr. Cuddy is furious that you
put her hospital at risk.

533
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,463
She just knows it's a bad idea

534
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,890
to admit it in front of me.

535
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,976
Think what you want.

536
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,811
By the way,
your orderly's outside.

537
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,564
But I'd wait about
another 10 minutes

538
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,857
if you really want
your husband to think

539
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,568
you're having
radiation treatments.

540
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,447
Dr. Hadley?

541
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,533
Are you, by chance, gonna cry?

542
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,120
'Cause that's the one
I just can't do.

543
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,099
Hello? This is Dr. Hadley.

544
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,563
What?

545
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,361
You called the medical board?

546
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,487
What is she talking about?

547
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,197
"Accusations
of sexual harassment."

548
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,521
You don't think
I know it's you?

549
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,574
Thirteen, come on.

550
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,369
You already got me fired from the
case, what else do you want?

551
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,497
Dr. Hadley, get out here now.

552
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,420
You're acting like an idiot.

553
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,343
She's trying to make me
lose my license!

554
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,053
She'll fail, unless
you're stupid enough

555
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,262
to go in there
and scream at her.

556
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,473
Sexual harassment accusations
are incredibly serious.

557
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,809
If she made them anonymously,
the case goes away.

558
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,229
If she used her name, we all
back you up, it goes away.

559
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,814
You're completely overreacting.

560
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,024
You'd be pissed off, too,
if you were me.

561
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,190
Or maybe not, I don't know.

562
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,794
You're just about as
emotional as she is.

563
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,237
I'm doing you a favor. I know.

564
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,408
And even when you try to do something
nice, you sound like a jerk.

565
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,035
I'm sorry.

566
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,122
For what?

567
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,291
For firing you.

568
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,221
Don't do that. That's
not what this is about.

569
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,504
Then I'll apologize anyway.

570
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,881
I did it for me, not for you.

571
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,219
I realized that
right after I fired you,

572
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,013
but I couldn't admit it.

573
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,686
I screwed everything up. I hope
that we can still work together.

574
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,944
Something's wrong
with her liver.

575
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,155
Blood flow's backing up,
spilling into her esophagus.

576
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,031
From the cancer?
This isn't lymphoma.

577
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,116
We don't know what it is.

578
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,284
We can wrap bands
around the veins,

579
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,952
but the bleed is so bad,
that might not work.

580
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,662
We want to try something
called the TIPS,

581
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,123
a shunt that makes the
blood bypass the liver.

582
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,291
That'll save her?

583
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,959
It should help preserve
her liver and heart.

584
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,712
But the liver cleans out
toxins, so bypass it too long,

585
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,357
she'll get brain damage,
eventually die.

586
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,591
But that's still probably less
dangerous than bleeding out now.

587
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,009
Probably?

588
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,804
Valerie usually
makes the decisions...

589
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:08,222
You gotta step up now.

590
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,852
Was she cheating on me?
I can't discuss...

591
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,230
Just tell me she wasn't lying.
Just tell me that.

592
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,614
I'm supposed to
make this decision?

593
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,824
I don't even know
who she is any more.

594
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,535
Either way, you gotta
do it right now.

595
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,582
Do whatever you think is right.

596
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,846
I'd give her a day,
two days at the most.

597
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:52,517
Great. You be the clock, everyone
else will be the doctors.

598
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,851
Heart, kidneys, now liver.

599
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:54,977
Amyloidosis.

600
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:58,189
No speckles on the MRI. Alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency?

601
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,398
Too much kidney failure.

602
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,776
Primary hepatic fibrosis.

603
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,447
It's our best guess.
Start her on steroids.

604
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,652
Even if we're right, the
liver's probably too scarred.

605
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
We got to list her
for a new one.

606
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,118
With an unconfirmed diagnosis?

607
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,703
Not gonna happen. How
about a family member?

608
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,205
I don't think the husband's
the right blood type.

609
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,582
Even if he was, he's not
going to give his liver now.

610
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,875
He left her, I assume?

611
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,126
Not yet.

612
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,380
He says he won't abandon
her while she's sick.

613
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,215
She have any other
family members?

614
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,140
No one's going to risk
their life to save hers.

615
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,844
Man, one false accusation
from a psychopath,

616
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,888
and you turn out
to be a real bummer.

617
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,141
I'm gonna go see if
Wilson has any liver left.

618
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,072
What are you doing?

619
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,701
Paying Wibberly's mortgage
for a few months.

620
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,579
Congratulations on another
successful round of hectoring.

621
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,623
Wait a minute. Is that
actually a check for him?

622
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:01,085
No, it's a giant novelty item
for winning the lottery,

623
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,296
you're just standing
really far away.

624
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,133
Of all the people to go the
extra mile for, why this guy?

625
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,886
I don't know, he just kind of
smells good and makes me laugh.

626
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,140
Why not Cuddy? You never apologized
after you defaced her photo.

627
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,934
Maybe because I recognize that
sending someone to the poorhouse

628
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,520
is a little more serious
than editing a snapshot.

629
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,273
No, it's because Cuddy actually
means something to you,

630
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,442
which makes it much
harder to apologize.

631
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,572
If it'll make you shut up, I will
tell her I'm sorry about the photo.

632
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,991
Forget the photo. House,
she was in love with you.

633
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,160
And all she got
in return was abuse.

634
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,704
For years, you toyed
with her emotions.

635
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,955
She wasn't in love with me.

636
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,208
The fact that you still can't
admit it just proves my point.

637
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,086
What do you want? Helping
the guy was your idea.

638
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,213
No, help the guy, whatever.

639
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:50,051
I'm just pointing out that it's
much easier to soothe your guilt

640
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,844
by throwing money at a stranger

641
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,598
than by making amends to a
person you actually care about.

642
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,017
You had me at "much easier."

643
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,770
I'm going to pretend
to go to work now.

644
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,025
Ping.

645
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,090
Sarah?

646
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,343
I'm Dr. Hadley.
I'm sorry to bother you,

647
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,147
but I was told that
you're Valerie's sister.

648
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,221
Mmm.

649
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,140
I was just surprised
you came to visit.

650
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,186
So is the rest of my family.

651
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,022
I was even more surprised
you got tested as a donor.

652
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,190
Wrong blood type.

653
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:50,152
But why? I mean,
you know what she's like.

654
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,113
She's not that bad.

655
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,739
Yes. She is.

656
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,162
Our dad was a mean drunk.

657
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,707
I was the older sister.

658
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:06,752
I was supposed to stand up for
her, not the other way around.

659
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,922
She protected you
when you were kids?

660
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,509
Yeah. And then all of a
sudden, all of his crap

661
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:18,806
and all his abuse,
it just changed her.

662
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,975
It made her cold.

663
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,728
When?

664
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,818
We were wrong. Psychopathy
is a symptom.

665
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,112
I spoke to her sister. She
wasn't always like this.

666
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,157
She changed, and right
around adolescence.

667
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:44,540
So, liver, heart, brain lie
dormant, and it starts at puberty.

668
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:56,218
The raw food diet made it go fulminant.
Nuts are high in copper.

669
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,763
It's Wilson's disease.

670
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,766
We ruled that out.
No Keyser-Fleischer rings.

671
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:07,354
There is one other sign. I know
there are lipstick lesbians.

672
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,900
Are there
nail-polish-remover bisexuals?

673
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,946
She's not supposed to be here.

674
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,239
As a doctor.

675
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,826
You didn't say anything about her
capacity as a beautician's assistant.

676
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,593
Her fingernail's blue?

677
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,803
Yep.

678
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,888
Start her on chelation.

679
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,057
What just happened?

680
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,350
You're gonna get better.

681
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,311
Your body has an inability
to process copper.

682
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,980
It caused all of your problems.

683
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,690
Even what's wrong
with your brain.

684
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,151
That's going to change, too?

685
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:57,404
It's probably rewired her
neurons permanently by now.

686
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,240
But it's possible?

687
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,076
Maybe.

688
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,911
I have to go get
the chelation equipment.

689
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,914
Bill, I need you
to sign some forms.

690
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,507
You don't see what she's doing?

691
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,176
She's laying the groundwork
to get her treatment,

692
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,012
wake up a completely
different person

693
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:26,016
so that you and all of
your money stay with her.

694
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,977
It's a lie.

695
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,270
You said there was a chance.

696
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,147
Okay, there's a teeny chance.

697
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:36,235
But even if it cures her, it's
not going to make her love you.

698
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,532
I was happy before.

699
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,621
I know, and I'm sorry,
but it wasn't real.

700
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,332
It felt real.

701
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,338
I don't know...

702
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,093
Maybe that can be enough.

703
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,773
You're really
doing this for me?

704
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,319
Tax shelter.

705
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,114
I'll take some
of that chili now.

706
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,830
I can't accept this.

707
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,707
Fine, forget the chili.

708
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,168
Bye, Wibberly.

709
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,004
I got an A plus
with your paper.

710
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:44,261
I was an orthopedic surgeon for
10 years at New York Mercy.

711
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,096
I had a gambling problem.

712
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,099
I tried to cover it by overbilling
some Medicare patients.

713
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,269
Lost my license.
That's why I'm here.

714
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,104
Not because of you.

715
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,273
Why are you
telling me this now?

716
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,540
Because I thought
you'd be the same bastard

717
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,322
you were in med school, but...

718
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,460
Keep it.

719
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,629
No. I can get another place.

720
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,298
Just take it.
I screwed you over.

721
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,800
You got me an A plus.

722
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,301
Take it. No.

723
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:28,097
Do I have to shove it down your throat?
Take the damn check!

724
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,874
Your vitals are up.

725
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,962
Treatment's working.

726
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,547
I'm not sure we can
fix your liver,

727
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,925
but we can definitely
list you for a new one.

728
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,762
When you're better, we're
gonna take a long vacation.

729
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,681
You want to go to Vietnam,
one of the beaches?

730
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,685
We're gonna get a hut, just you
and me, nothing to worry about.

731
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,441
You're pathetic.

732
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,070
What?

733
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:29,742
I mean, when you had a suspicion,
fine, but you know now.

734
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,785
How can you be this pitiful?

735
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,581
You don't mean this.
You're sick.

736
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,915
I'm not sick.

737
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,210
I almost died,
and I still might.

738
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,379
And who knows, maybe
it's focusing my mind

739
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,882
because the idea of spending the
rest of my life with you...

740
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,300
Valerie...

741
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,569
Why'd you do that?

742
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,945
Because he's pathetic.

743
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,281
He hasn't changed.

744
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:19,124
But you have. The treatment
actually worked on your brain.

745
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,449
If you were still a psychopath,

746
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,211
you would have just
kept draining him dry.

747
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,295
What do you want?

748
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,380
You're feeling something.

749
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,592
What is it? What do you feel?

750
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,057
I don't know.

751
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,269
It hurts.

752
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,529
It will.

753
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,757
Heard about the diagnosis.
Nice job.

754
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:12,010
Thanks. Why are you
here so late?

755
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:16,598
Discharge summary. Taub's
handwriting isn't helping much.

756
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,244
Apparently on the third
day of admission,

757
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,103
the patient underwent
"rabbit thumping."

758
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,402
"Radiotherapy."

759
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,903
Ah.

760
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,657
"Third day after admission,"

761
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,409
"patient underwent radiotherapy"

762
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,163
"including external
beam radiation"

763
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,879
"to treat B-cell lymphomas."

764
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,423
"First treatment was"

765
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,303
"full-mantle therapy..."
