1
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,826
Hey. Slow down, sister.

2
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,536
Actually, I need to speed up.

3
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,789
Rachel woke up
early with a fever

4
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,375
and she's been terrorizing
me all morning.

5
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,668
I'm already late.

6
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,046
Sorry, the stakeout went
longer than I thought.

7
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,332
Have you ever been to a rave?

8
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,423
Goodbye.

9
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,842
You're already late,
and Rachel's sick.

10
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,762
Neither of which can be solved by
you leaving right this second.

11
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,488
The entire hospital's depending on
a proposal I have yet to finish

12
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,891
and need to present at 8:30.

13
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,100
It's 7:30.

14
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,268
It's 7:37.

15
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,020
I'll have you on
the road in 10 minutes.

16
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,900
Come on, you don't wanna get into your
meeting all tight and stressed out, do you?

17
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,747
It's yours.

18
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,749
It's House. Ignore it.

19
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,334
It says, "Emergency page."

20
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,794
I said ignore it.

21
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,087
Sweet.

22
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,349
I'm sorry, it's hard
to pace yourself

23
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,518
when you've been thinking about
it for 10 hours straight.

24
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,728
That's great,

25
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,274
now I'm late, stressed
out and frustrated.

26
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,485
So, if you give me
a minute, I can...

27
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,611
It'll wait.

28
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,786
You can do it.

29
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,580
Do what?

30
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,290
I thought you were
coming in at 7:30.

31
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,833
Rachel woke up with a fever,

32
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,503
and then I just couldn't
get here any sooner.

33
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,172
There's a problem
in the pharmacy.

34
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,965
Hey, boss lady!

35
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,134
You don't answer
emergency pages anymore?

36
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,886
Tell them all I'll be
by as soon as I can.

37
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,306
And tell him I assumed it was
either about the wolf again

38
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,684
or the procedure I refused
to approve yesterday.

39
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,562
Turned out it wasn't
a resistant staph,

40
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,315
but I still say if it had been,
infecting him with malaria...

41
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,609
Seriously, House,
I don't have time for this.

42
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,653
You're lying. I have a
meeting in 20 minutes.

43
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,112
Not talking about your meeting.

44
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,477
I'm talking about
the phone call.

45
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,367
I didn't ask what you were talking
about because I don't care.

46
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,705
I was with your boytoy on
the stakeout last night.

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,499
You were with Lucas?

48
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,628
He needed someone who could diagnose a
soft tissue injury from across the street.

49
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,047
Apparently he doesn't
know any good doctors.

50
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,175
Or the ones he does know actually
have lives outside of work.

51
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,887
Things got a little slow,
so we made some wagers.

52
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,892
One being whether I could get
you to stop the miscegenation

53
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,561
with an emergency page.

54
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,813
What made you think we'd...

55
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,564
He said you guys
do it every morning.

56
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,024
Everybody lies, remember?

57
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,150
So you weren't actually...

58
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,360
Goodbye, House.

59
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,822
I'm gonna need a definitive answer
before any money changes hands.

60
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,491
Sorry to interrupt, but the
GRC called about the budgets,

61
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,995
the pharmacy is still waiting, and
your 8:30 just arrived on campus.

62
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,955
He should be here
in 10 minutes.

63
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,958
Figures this would be the
one day he comes early.

64
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,501
Can you proofread this for me?

65
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,961
When are you gonna find
your own assistant?

66
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,089
Not today. Thank you.
I'll be back in five.

67
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,926
Dr. Cuddy.

68
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,928
I know we're usually
fine with two CS reps,

69
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,431
but I want a few extra
hands today, just in case.

70
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,266
And have IT
recheck the network.

71
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,592
I don't want to hear later that

72
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,687
the new lines can only dial
out or the computer crashed.

73
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,230
What's going on?
Hopefully, nothing.

74
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,442
Just make sure you're ready
if people start calling.

75
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,029
You wanted to see me?

76
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,280
Hey, Dr. Cuddy, yeah.

77
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,699
I wanted to let you know there's
a problem with one of the orders

78
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,200
that came in last night.

79
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,577
Which is?

80
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,787
They sent double the
amount of meds we ordered.

81
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,913
Did you call and ask why?

82
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,438
Yeah. They insist
it's not a mistake.

83
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,833
So fax them the original PO.

84
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,296
Yeah, that's what I was planning
on doing, but I can't find it.

85
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,256
Actually, I can't
find any of them.

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,426
Oscar, I don't have time to
straighten out your paperwork.

87
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,150
Where's Stan?
He doesn't get in till 9:00.

88
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,888
And it's actually
not my paperwork,

89
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,852
it's Gail's paperwork,
and she's out sick today.

90
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,613
So put it on her desk and let her
figure it out when she comes back.

91
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,061
All right, but it's
not my problem if...

92
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,938
Oscar, not today, okay?

93
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,318
Was it the whole shipment
or just one med?

94
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,569
It's just one.

95
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,653
Vicodin?

96
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,906
No, 25-milligram
ephedrine tablets.

97
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,703
What? Call Gail.

98
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,789
Tell her I want to see
her in my office ASAP.

99
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,082
But she's sick.

100
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,327
This place is full of sick
people, just get her in here.

101
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,586
Dr. Cuddy, your 8:30 is
waiting in your office.

102
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,796
Now.

103
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,049
I gotta make
a quick trip upstairs.

104
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,706
Can you get the guy in my
office a cup of coffee?

105
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,260
I'll be right back.

106
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,721
I've gotten you coffee before.

107
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,809
What's wrong?

108
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,394
It's freezing in here. I can
hardly feel my fingers.

109
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,814
Please tell me you
didn't send a 911 page

110
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,524
to tell me the heater's broken.

111
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,733
It's not broken.

112
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,904
House bribed the physical plant to
turn on the AC so I'd hurry up.

113
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,988
So hurry up.

114
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,949
This man's abdomen
is wide open.

115
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,784
His core temp is down to 95!

116
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,661
Fine, I will deal with it.

117
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,746
You better,
or I'm gonna file...

118
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,583
I don't care what he told you.
Turn it back up, now.

119
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,212
Thought you had
an important meeting.

120
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,588
You're an idiot.

121
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,955
What are you gonna do the next time one of
your patients needs a liver transplant?

122
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,971
Go talk to Wilson about something
completely unrelated and see what happens.

123
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,306
Mystery infection guy
is now covered in boils

124
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,101
and has an abscess big
enough to put your fist in.

125
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,562
He needs to get into
an OR tout de suite.

126
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,480
Hourani will be done soon.

127
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,690
Good.

128
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,775
I'll have some hot
chocolate waiting.

129
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,238
Marina. Hey, how is she doing?

130
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,158
She vomited?

131
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,578
Give her some more ibuprofen and
put her in the bath for a bit.

132
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,538
And call me in a half hour
if it doesn't go down.

133
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,290
Sorry, Marina,
I have another call.

134
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,084
Just call me in
a half hour either way.

135
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,044
Hey, what's up?

136
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,547
Tell him I'm halfway there.

137
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,134
He's the one who insisted
on the early meeting.

138
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,595
All right, I'm coming.

139
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,106
Morning, Eli.
Sorry about the wait.

140
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,441
That's all right.

141
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,818
I hear you've got a sick kid.

142
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,104
Yeah, I know what that's like.

143
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,739
Or, I should say, my wife does.

144
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,951
So, you guys ready to give some
ground so we can make this deal?

145
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,453
Why would we do that?

146
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,205
We've been going at
this for eight months.

147
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,915
As soon as you decide
to get reasonable.

148
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,125
I'm the one
that's unreasonable?

149
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,731
You've taken weeks to respond to
every proposal I've presented.

150
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,048
AtlanticNet Insurance is the largest
healthcare provider in New Jersey,

151
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,634
and you're not the only hospital
whose contracts are up.

152
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,344
So is your team ready to
come back to the table?

153
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,763
Yeah. We're not going to.

154
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,224
This is our final offer.

155
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,892
We're willing to go with
a capitated structure,

156
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,894
but we need at
least a 12% increase

157
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,647
in reimbursements
across the board.

158
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,150
Well, good news is I can
give you a quick response.

159
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,319
Not a chance.

160
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,113
But as always,
nice talking to you.

161
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,823
Say hi to your sister for me.

162
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:43,249
If you don't accept the offer, we're
gonna terminate the contract.

163
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,752
Gonna be hard
to keep this place open

164
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,797
if all your patients
have to pay cash.

165
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,883
Princeton-Plainsboro is the smallest
hospital in our entire network.

166
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,760
We're also the best.
It doesn't matter.

167
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,971
We are responsible for
covering 13 million people.

168
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,931
We don't have enough cash
to buy them all Maseratis.

169
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,768
I know what you pay Bergen, Newark
Beth Israel, Robert Wood Johnson...

170
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,478
It's because
they have leverage.

171
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,564
You can be expensive or small,
but you can't be both.

172
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,025
I've engaged Jones/Curtto
to handle the PR

173
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,862
and I'm prepared to make the
announcement at 3:00 p. M. today.

174
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,701
First lesson every good poker player
learns is don't get emotional.

175
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,452
You don't have the cards.

176
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,578
And the sooner
you realize that,

177
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,707
the sooner a reasonable
contract will get signed.

178
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,420
You have until 3:00 p. M.
To change your mind.

179
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:34,591
I always did like your style.
Gonna be sad to see you go.

180
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,572
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

181
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,990
Thanks.

182
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,329
Take this up to the call center

183
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,372
and tell Claudia to
give one to each CS rep

184
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,624
and to start going over the
answers to each question.

185
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,792
Okay.

186
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,920
And under no circumstances is any of
this info to go outside that room.

187
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,840
The scripts are numbered, and I want a
list of every person she gives one to.

188
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,176
Got it. Anything else?

189
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,427
No.

190
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,848
If you really wanted
to make a deal,

191
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,212
you should've
ditched the push-up

192
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,934
and gone with the demi.

193
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,145
Nothing makes a guy wanna
close like highbeams.

194
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,313
What have you heard?

195
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,899
Your meeting with the weasel
lasted less than five minutes,

196
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,944
which means you either agreed to a
completely sensible 30-day extension

197
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,532
or one of you issued a
completely ridiculous ultimatum.

198
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,287
Oh, goody, you or him?

199
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,413
Me.

200
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,582
Way to go, boss.
You said it was ridiculous.

201
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,043
Ridiculous to make,
fun to watch.

202
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,087
As long as it's
not just a bluff.

203
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,411
Please tell me
it's not a bluff.

204
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,383
It's not a bluff,
and it's not ridiculous.

205
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,135
Just because
we're not some huge...

206
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,287
Mr. Pluta started hallucinating
before we could put him under.

207
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,306
His BP's plummeting, he has
an elevated heart rate.

208
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,101
Looks like
congestive heart failure.

209
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,352
Interesting.

210
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,937
I don't care
how interesting it is,

211
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,815
you are not infecting
him with malaria.

212
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,109
Since when is malaria
a cure for heart failure?

213
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:19,988
It's not. It's not congestive heart
failure, it's gotta be one of the...

214
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,162
I just got off
the phone with Hourani.

215
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,123
I'm sorry, Dave,
I don't really have time...

216
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,417
You think I had time to listen
to him go for 20 minutes

217
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,941
about the damn
temperature in the OR?

218
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,128
I took care of it.

219
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,839
It's not an "it," it's a "him"
you need to take care of.

220
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,341
You've got the entire staff
catering to House's every whim,

221
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,219
and I can't get approval to hire
a replacement for the surgeon

222
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,012
he stole from my department.

223
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,723
A doctor I only took on in the first
place because of pressure from you.

224
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,936
So you didn't want Chase, but now
you're pissed you can't have him?

225
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,187
You want to convene
a search committee

226
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,992
and start looking for a
new chief of surgery?

227
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
No, Dave.

228
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,692
Then you better stop
spending all your time

229
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,362
putting out his fires
and start doing your damn job.

230
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,830
There a problem
with Dr. Thomas?

231
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,417
No, just refereeing
a dispute about the OR.

232
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:19,214
So, we don't yet have a
contract with AtlanticNet.

233
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,052
We gave you an extra week. And you
assured us you'd have a deal by today.

234
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,055
We could have a deal, just
not the deal we deserve.

235
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,433
So, what do you want,
approval for an extension?

236
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,059
We've been at this
for eight months,

237
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,437
an extension isn't going
to change anything.

238
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,605
So what's your plan?

239
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,939
I presented a final offer.

240
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,817
I told them that we would agree
to a capitated structure

241
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,070
if they increase
reimbursements by 12%.

242
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,448
A final offer.
What does that mean?

243
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,202
If they don't accept it by
3:00, we're gonna terminate.

244
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,996
Are you out of your mind?

245
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,123
If we don't accept
AtlanticNet Insurance

246
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,250
we'll lose 80% of our patients.

247
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,585
We'd be lucky
to last three months.

248
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,796
We're not asking for
anything they can't afford.

249
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,674
Their last offer
was a 4% increase,

250
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,051
and you're demanding 12?

251
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,512
They're paying even
more at some places.

252
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,263
Units that have lower
ratings than ours.

253
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,230
In a perfect world that
would definitely matter.

254
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,100
Sanford, they're
all about growth,

255
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,896
and they know they don't get new customers
by marketing themselves as the biggest.

256
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,731
They do it by claiming
they're the best,

257
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,068
and they can't do that if their
patients can't come to us.

258
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,240
What was Morgan's reaction
when you told him?

259
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,284
He didn't give in. But he will.

260
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,663
I told him I'd make the
announcement at 3:00.

261
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,998
He'll call back before then.

262
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,126
They need us.

263
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,878
No, we need them.

264
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,755
We need each other.

265
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,635
The negotiation is
your responsibility,

266
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,638
so we can't stop you if this
is what you want to do.

267
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:54,017
But just so we're clear, if we don't
have a contract with AtlanticNet,

268
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,728
you're not gonna
have a contract with us.

269
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,645
Guess who didn't show
up for clinic duty.

270
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,522
Don't tell me,

271
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,647
the guy with all the boils
needs a liver transplant.

272
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,234
No, his doctor needs a nap.

273
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,569
You want me to try to find him?

274
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,113
You really need him?
I need someone.

275
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,700
I have cancer.

276
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,160
Why do you think
you have cancer?

277
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,580
I don't think I have cancer,
I know I have cancer.

278
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:01,001
I had surgery to remove a malignant
polyp in my colon six months ago,

279
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,170
and now it's spread to my
liver and lymph nodes.

280
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,631
So you're under
the care of an oncologist?

281
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,758
Yeah, but he won't give me
the prescription I need.

282
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,468
You need more pain killers?

283
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,720
No, I need breast milk.

284
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,641
Human breast milk?

285
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,018
Yes, it has cancer-fighting
qualities.

286
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,396
Well, in newborns it's been
shown to reduce future risk...

287
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,442
No. In adults with cancer, too.
I've read studies.

288
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,157
Look, I even know a place
where I can buy it.

289
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,745
I just need a prescription so I can get
reimbursed by my insurance company.

290
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:41,083
They said they'd reimburse the cost
of breast milk as a cancer treatment?

291
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,001
They reimburse prescriptions.

292
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,169
So, if you write
me a prescription,

293
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,653
then they have
no choice but to pay.

294
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,590
Well, actually,
they have a choice.

295
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,426
What are you, some type of shill
for the insurance company?

296
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,262
No. I've been paying
premiums for 30 years

297
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,766
and I've never been sick a day
in my life till this happened.

298
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,353
Now I can't work.
I got no money,

299
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,188
and you want to help
them screw me over.

300
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,314
I'm not screwing you over.

301
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,024
Well, then give me the script.
It won't help you.

302
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,442
Will it hurt me? No, but...

303
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,071
Okay, so it won't harm me
and it won't harm you,

304
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,281
but it's this insurance company...
This is not about insurance.

305
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,701
Then give me the damn script!

306
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,458
I'm sick.

307
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,294
I need help.

308
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,381
I need something.

309
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,384
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,974
Bitch.

311
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,151
Anyone call?

312
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,360
Yeah.

313
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:55,157
The ER. They said the vascular who's
on call doesn't have privileges.

314
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,825
Then why is he on call?

315
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,577
Dowd's at a conference
and got him to fill in.

316
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,330
Be nice if he got somebody who could
actually work here. Call Ereshefsky.

317
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,332
Ereshefsky?
She's not gonna do it.

318
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,459
She owes me a favor.

319
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,835
She's still not gonna do it.

320
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,588
All right.

321
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,242
Oh, and there's a guy in your office.
I think he's a lawyer.

322
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,341
Why is he in my office?

323
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,093
Said he didn't want to sit
around a bunch of sick people.

324
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,304
I tried to stop him.

325
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,769
Hi. I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

326
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,020
Ronald Westbrook.

327
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,066
I appreciate your taking
the time to meet with me.

328
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,191
Hard to avoid, since you're
already in my office.

329
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,693
Sorry about that, I just
got over a wicked cold.

330
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,339
I didn't want to...
How can I help you?

331
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,530
I represent Martin Acevedo.

332
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,700
He's filed a suit against
PPH and Dr. Robert Chase

333
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,036
for performing surgery
without consent.

334
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,706
Yes, I saw that. I also
saw the consent forms.

335
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,874
They were all signed.

336
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,375
Yes, but my client was assured

337
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,128
that the procedure would
just be a few minor sutures.

338
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,964
Wait, your client accidentally
cut his thumb off

339
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,466
with a table saw, right? Yes.

340
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,259
And Dr. Chase reattached it?

341
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,552
Yes.

342
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,763
You're saying he didn't
want it reattached?

343
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,724
No, he most certainly did not.

344
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:06,561
His insurance only covered
60% of inpatient expenses,

345
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,563
so he would only agree
to the cheapest option.

346
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,731
So what did you tell him?

347
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,818
I said I'd sew up the skin
over the exposed bone.

348
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,069
Then I put him under,

349
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,322
got his thumb from the
paramedics and reattached it.

350
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,907
What's he gonna do?

351
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,493
Tell a judge that I harmed him
by reattaching a vital digit?

352
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,580
Both he and the insurance company are
suing to get out of paying the bill.

353
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,165
It's over $80,000.

354
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,625
It was his thumb.

355
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,754
I couldn't just let him toss it
in the trash to save a few bucks.

356
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:40,303
The pharm tech who called in sick is here.
She's waiting in your office.

357
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,724
He barely even
looks at me anymore.

358
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,560
We haven't had sex in months.

359
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,604
You don't need
pills to lose weight.

360
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:53,400
There are healthier ways,
legal ways.

361
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,402
You don't understand
how hard it is.

362
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,573
Ever since our second child,
no matter what I do...

363
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,827
I just wanted to lose 10 more
pounds, and then I was gonna stop.

364
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,662
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,832
Forging pharmaceutical
orders, stealing...

366
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,208
Don't fire me, Dr. Cuddy.

367
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,961
Please, I'm begging you.

368
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,452
If Sam finds out, he'll
divorce me for sure.

369
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,382
And my kids...

370
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,554
I will never do it again, I swear.
Just give me a second chance.

371
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,600
I won't report
the theft to the DEA.

372
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,269
But I have to fire you.

373
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,528
Just take a few minutes
to compose yourself,

374
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,865
then go down to H R, and they'll
give you your last check.

375
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,576
I've been a perfect
employee for seven years.

376
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,329
I know, but this is too big.

377
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,623
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,856
How's it going?

379
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,609
I've got three hours to save
this place from bankruptcy,

380
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,361
I just fired one of
my best employees,

381
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,948
and the woman taking care of my sick
child isn't returning my calls.

382
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,034
Rachel's gonna be fine, I'm sure
whoever he or she is deserved it,

383
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,204
and we're not going
bankrupt. Are we?

384
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,426
Don't worry. The board will fire me
before they allow that to happen.

385
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,376
They'd never fire you.

386
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:39,714
I just told AtlanticNet Insurance I'd
terminate unless they give us a 12% bump.

387
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,716
They might fire you.

388
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,219
Marina, hey, it's me.

389
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,554
I haven't heard back from you. Can
you call me as soon as you can?

390
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,056
Thank you.

391
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,225
You try Lucas?

392
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,644
He's either sleeping
or avoiding me.

393
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,853
You in a fight?

394
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,313
Not yet, but we're gonna be.

395
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,954
What do you think I should
do about AtlanticNet?

396
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,662
You're asking a guy who paid full
sticker price for his last car.

397
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,414
You ask House?

398
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,001
He is a master manipulator who
always gets what he wants.

399
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,169
This situation is out of
control enough already.

400
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,548
House is the last person
I want to get involved.

401
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,934
Get out of my chair,
and the answer's no.

402
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,771
Have you noticed how many porn sites
have "mom" in the domain name?

403
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,025
Hot moms, hungry
moms, mature moms.

404
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,610
That ought to make you
feel pretty good.

405
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,949
What do you want?

406
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,119
Looks like boils, altered
mental status and heart failure

407
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,871
was caused by renal
cell carcinoma.

408
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,041
I need your signature to start
treating it with malaria.

409
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,459
Don't worry. I'm
giving him chemo, too.

410
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,377
What is your sudden
obsession with malaria?

411
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,130
Just trying to play my
part, cutting costs.

412
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,300
Malaria is the simplest, cheapest
method of delivering hyperthermia.

413
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,261
Right, the only money
you care about...

414
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,307
You bet someone you could use
malaria as a diagnostic tool?

415
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,808
That doesn't sound like me.

416
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,393
Forget it.

417
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,895
Okay, let me see if
I've got this straight,

418
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,981
a bet that puts one patient
at minor risk is juvenile...

419
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,608
And irresponsible
and dangerous.

420
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,819
But going all-in
against AtlanticNet...

421
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,654
Is not a bet.

422
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,574
That is a carefully considered
negotiating position.

423
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,495
I'm gonna put
this in your in-box.

424
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,913
I just hope it doesn't get lost

425
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:39,084
underneath all the other stuff
you're carefully considering.

426
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,466
Can you take a look
at these per diem schedules,

427
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,426
let me know if you see any conflicts?
Got it.

428
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:51,262
Oh, and Ereshefsky
actually did come in.

429
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,264
You catch her leaving a
sponge in a guy or something?

430
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,266
Wasn't a medical mistake.
What was it?

431
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,935
Can't tell you now.
She came in.

432
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,772
Hey, Stan, have you audited
the ephedrine orders, yet?

433
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,690
Why? You told me she confessed.
Stan!

434
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,858
All right, yeah,
I'll take care of it.

435
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,985
Today.

436
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,641
You know he's
cussing you out now.

437
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,016
I don't care, as
long as he does it.

438
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,156
What a bitch.

439
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,366
What are you doing here?

440
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,368
Sounded like you were gonna
be too busy for lunch, so...

441
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,786
My specialty. Spinach lasagna.

442
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,371
Sure you didn't come
looking for more people

443
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,790
you could brag about
our sex life to?

444
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,166
Okay, sorry.

445
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,628
From now on I've got nothing but bad
things to say about our sex life.

446
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,505
Or nothing to say.

447
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,049
And what's going on with Marina?
She hasn't called me back.

448
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,386
She was gonna call, I told her I'd
let you know everything was okay.

449
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,887
So her fever broke?

450
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,557
What exactly does that
mean, when a fever breaks?

451
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,351
Lucas, I'm very busy, does
she have a fever or not?

452
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,353
That was gonna be your lunch?

453
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,647
And you didn't have
breakfast either.

454
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,315
No, she doesn't have a fever,

455
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,860
and the rash was just like
a little diaper rash.

456
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:47,986
What rash? She has a rash?

457
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,863
A little one.

458
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,199
Lisa, don't worry,
I'm telling you.

459
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,327
Come on.

460
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,416
Oh, God. I must have grabbed
Marina's cell by mistake.

461
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:09,716
And I turned the ringer off on
the home phone so I could sleep.

462
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,135
What are you doing to me?

463
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,459
I take it your deal's not done.

464
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,013
Not yet.

465
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,391
How about I take a quick look into the
guy who's in charge of the negotiations,

466
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,476
or better yet, the CEO.

467
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,104
If I get some dirt, you
can use it as leverage.

468
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,106
There's no time.

469
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,777
How do you even
find these guys?

470
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,992
You should've
seen the guy's face.

471
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,204
I thought he was gonna have a damn
coronary right there in the tee box.

472
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,706
Excuse me,
you're Keith Tannenbaum,

473
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,917
CEO of AtlanticNet
Insurance, right?

474
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,585
That's me. How can I help you?

475
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,378
Well, actually, I think
we can help each other.

476
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:51,424
I am Dr. Lisa Cuddy, Dean of
Medicine at Princeton-Plainsboro.

477
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,885
Oh, yeah. Well, how are you?

478
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,428
Well, I'm a little unhappy.

479
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,097
You're aware that our contract
with your company is up this week.

480
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,475
Yes, and we have a negotiating
team that's working all that out.

481
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,603
Princeton-Plainsboro has the
highest rated ER in the state,

482
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,355
the most advanced ICU,

483
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:09,442
and the most innovative diagnostic
medicine department in the entire country.

484
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,527
Good to know. Now if you
don't mind, I'd like to...

485
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,155
While AtlanticNet Insurance
has a marketing budget

486
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,742
that is more than our pediatric ICU's
and transplant unit's combined.

487
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,203
Your PGA sponsorship could
pay for our walk-in clinic,

488
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,367
and the money you spend to
fuel your two private jets

489
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,959
could fund our air ambulance
service for the next three years.

490
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,085
Your point being?

491
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,753
Your growth may be good
for your bottom line,

492
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,838
but ours allows us
to save lives.

493
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,133
And I would rather not have
to announce to the press

494
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:38,471
how selective your company appears to
be when it comes to cutting costs.

495
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,395
Morgan was right.
You are one tough gal.

496
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,069
You can portray me as a rich
bastard in the press all you want,

497
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,113
just as long as I stay rich.

498
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,794
Stan is looking for you.
I'm busy.

499
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,754
He said it's urgent.

500
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,970
I don't understand how it's even possible.
I've checked it twice.

501
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,096
How much?

502
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,264
Ten cases.

503
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,141
Ten cases?

504
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,767
Going back three years.

505
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,477
What the hell have
you been doing, Stan?

506
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,396
You're supposed to be
managing this place.

507
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,856
All the paperwork
I signed was correct.

508
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,108
She must have altered
the orders afterwards.

509
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,194
Didn't you ever cross check it
with the bills that came in?

510
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,529
I delegated it.

511
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,406
To whom?

512
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,908
To Gail.

513
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,286
Well, she seemed perfectly trustworthy,
how was I supposed to know?

514
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,163
By doing your job! Sorry.

515
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,248
Have you notified the DEA?
The DEA?

516
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,042
Jeez, Stan, hello!

517
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,295
You don't steal $50,000 worth of pills
because you want to lose weight.

518
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,840
She's supplying a meth lab.
Just get her back in here.

519
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,675
All right. Now.

520
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,516
Well, you ever
want a job, trust me.

521
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,435
He'll double whatever
you're making here.

522
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,020
I take it he liked my proposal.

523
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,565
Enough to tell me to get my
ass back over here today.

524
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,818
Here. He's willing to go to 8%.

525
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,654
Eight? We were at four.

526
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,741
Your board's gonna think
you walk on water.

527
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,951
I want 12.

528
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,582
You're not gonna get 12.
There's just no way.

529
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,959
8% barely covers
our cost inflation.

530
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,046
The capitated structure should
allow you to hold down inflation.

531
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,881
And shifts all
your risk onto us,

532
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,341
which is why we deserve 12.

533
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,425
Lisa, come on.

534
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,053
The guy who mows my lawn makes
more than my kid's teacher.

535
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,389
Hell, the two guys whose lunch
you interrupted could get fired,

536
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,351
their severance would be more than most
of their employees make in a lifetime.

537
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,687
It doesn't have anything
to do with what you deserve.

538
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,482
This is it.

539
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,570
Take it or leave it.

540
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,517
What are you doing? Hey.

541
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,477
Know any good
transplant surgeons?

542
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,230
Turns out his kidneys aren't
the only thing failing.

543
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,554
And I know what
you're thinking,

544
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,401
but malaria wouldn't destroy
his liver that fast,

545
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,903
especially since
we never infected him.

546
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,572
I thought you said...
Apparently Foreman now thinks

547
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,532
that he has the authority
to overrule my orders

548
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,826
just because
the FDA wouldn't approve.

549
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,286
Don't worry,
I'll deal with him.

550
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,788
If you could just
talk to Hourani...

551
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,293
What would you do?

552
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,129
If you paged me during sex?

553
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,882
About the contract
with AtlanticNet?

554
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,553
I got them to come up to 8%,
but we should get at least 12.

555
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:10,224
It's all numbers, do the
math, and nothing else.

556
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,394
It's not about my pride,
it's about the principle.

557
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,146
They're trying to screw us
over because we're small.

558
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,272
That's what they're
supposed to do.

559
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,149
They should be pressuring
other hospitals

560
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,737
to be more like us, not trying to
make us more like them. It's stupid.

561
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,280
And putting your
job on the line

562
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,241
in an effort to stamp
out stupidity isn't?

563
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,827
You would.

564
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,871
Probably.

565
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,249
But then I also wanted to try to cure
cancer by infecting a guy with malaria

566
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,711
to win a $50 bet. You
really want to be like me?

567
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,865
As you know,
for the past eight months,

568
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,452
we've been trying to renegotiate our
contract with AtlanticNet Insurance.

569
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,789
It's been a difficult process,
but I wanted to let you all know

570
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,417
before we made the formal announcement,
that, as of 5:00 p. M. today,

571
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,379
our contract with AtlanticNet
will be terminated.

572
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,005
We've doubled the number

573
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,050
of customer service representatives
in our call center,

574
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:30,054
current patients will still be allowed
to remain in our care for 30 days,

575
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,641
but starting tomorrow we will
no longer be accepting patients

576
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,269
with AtlanticNet
health insurance.

577
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,062
Dr. Cuddy!

578
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,483
Why weren't we told
about this sooner?

579
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,867
Come on, Marina,
pick up the phone.

580
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,996
I'm busy.

581
00:31:58,709 --> 00:31:59,792
We found a liver match.

582
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,085
All right.

583
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,254
Get him prepped. I'll straighten
things out with Hourani.

584
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,756
Hourani's not the problem.
House is.

585
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,633
Now he wants Chase
to do the surgery.

586
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,468
To prove to Hourani
he doesn't need him?

587
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,555
To prove to Thomas that Chase was
his department's best surgeon.

588
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,724
And what does Chase want to do?
Chase wants to do the surgery.

589
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:15,891
And you don't want
him to do it because?

590
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,059
I don't care who does it.

591
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,144
So what's the problem?

592
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,353
In order to get our
patient into the OR,

593
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,855
we have to get him
on the surgery schedule.

594
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,979
In order to do that we need
someone to put him there

595
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,192
who neither House
nor Thomas can overrule.

596
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,627
What?

597
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,378
Would you rather
I go back on Vicodin?

598
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,796
She's not massaging your leg.

599
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,382
She will eventually.

600
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,428
Why am I the only person here who
cares what happens to this hospital?

601
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,514
Get off your ass and get your
department under control,

602
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,558
at least for the next few days.

603
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,310
It's gonna take longer
than a few days

604
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,604
for a company
the size of AtlanticNet

605
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,857
to start feeling the squeeze
of your PR campaign.

606
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,983
If they ever do.

607
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,193
And you know this how?

608
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,237
From all the time you spent researching
them and their other contracts,

609
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,739
the way they handle
their press relations?

610
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,824
I know they have a NASCAR team.

611
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,453
Despite what you may have learned at
Hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff,

612
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:21,666
sometimes the bigger they are,
the harder they kick your ass.

613
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,175
I'm not trying to be greedy.

614
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,471
But he's also not interested in being
forced into a medical bankruptcy.

615
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,849
Mr. Acevedo, I'm sorry you're
having financial difficulties,

616
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,394
but because of us
you still have a thumb.

617
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,813
I assume that's something
a carpenter might need.

618
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:48,693
And I assume you didn't ask for this
meeting so you could lecture my client.

619
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,319
You have insurance,

620
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:54,657
but by filing the suit you've caused
us to get paid nothing by them either.

621
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,783
That's not our problem.

622
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,493
Actually, it is,
since he's responsible

623
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,704
for any expense
we're not reimbursed.

624
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,914
But if you drop this suit
and make it clear

625
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,083
that Dr. Chase was acting
in your best interest

626
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,086
when he reattached your thumb, then
we'll be able to resubmit the claim.

627
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,672
And you'll cover his
deductible, attorney's fees,

628
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,465
and 50 grand for
pain and suffering.

629
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,885
Actually I was thinking more like
we'd cover half his deductible,

630
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,013
which means you'd
only owe $16,000.

631
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,266
You want him to pay you? Yes!

632
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,268
Do you have any idea
how much it costs,

633
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,147
how many years it takes to
train someone in microsurgery?

634
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,399
We gave you back your life.

635
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,944
You can still work, you can button
your own shirt, hold a fork...

636
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,821
Martin, let's go.

637
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:39,702
I'm sorry, I know I should
pay, but I just can't.

638
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:44,123
I still cannot work, I'm already
under water on my house,

639
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,625
and I have two kids
with braces.

640
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,462
You think you'd be in better
shape without a thumb?

641
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:54,759
Right now, financially?
Yeah, I would be.

642
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,971
Well, so would we,
but when you came in,

643
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,891
we didn't think about that,
we just took care of you.

644
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,435
Made sure we did whatever
you needed to get well.

645
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,603
Yeah, right.

646
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,897
All you doctors care
about is healing.

647
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,399
That's why there are all those BMWs
and Porsches in the parking lot.

648
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:11,525
Damn it.

649
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,985
Come on, we're out of here.

650
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,278
We'll see you in court.

651
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,197
You're right, you will.

652
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,324
You still have
a thumb because of us,

653
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,327
and like everyone else in this
world, we don't work for free.

654
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:25,748
We earn this money, and if we have to
take your house to get it, we will.

655
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,798
What's going on?

656
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:34,965
I think they're fighting.

657
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,344
Out of my way.
Now! Out of the way!

658
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,807
What the hell is going on?

659
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,684
I told them to use
their words, but...

660
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,905
That pharm tech is back.
She's in your office.

661
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,241
You, there. You, over there.

662
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:04,078
I don't want to hear a word out of
either one of you until I get back.

663
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,165
You lied.

664
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,835
So? What are you
gonna do about it?

665
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,381
Well, for one, notify the DEA.

666
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,591
Good, I'm sure they'll be
very interested to hear

667
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,469
how Dr. House forced me
to help him steal the meds

668
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,598
and the administrator who he's having sex
with has been helping him cover it up.

669
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,560
You really think you can
lie your way out of this?

670
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,562
Yeah, I do.

671
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,314
Anything else you
want to know, bitch?

672
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,700
The hospital board's chairman
wants to speak to you.

673
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,326
Tell him I'm busy.
I did, but he...

674
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,328
Then tell him I quit.

675
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,953
You owe Lucas the money.

676
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,540
We were having sex
when you called.

677
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,300
The breast milk guy finally found a
doctor who'd give him what he wanted.

678
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,470
If it works, that's way
better than malaria.

679
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,058
It's worth a shot.

680
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,228
Great.

681
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,815
I thought they
were the ones bluffing.

682
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:01,320
No way they'd let us terminate.

683
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:08,410
They're not gonna fire you,
and you're not gonna quit.

684
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,164
Why not?

685
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,085
Because you're an idiot.

686
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,589
This place needs you,
and that matters to you.

687
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,808
What do you think
of that pharm tech, Gail?

688
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,142
She's a sociopath.

689
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,519
You knew she was stealing meds?

690
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,606
No. But have you seen the
way she opens the mail?

691
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,110
Why didn't you ever tell me?

692
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,278
Figured it might
come in handy one day.

693
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,419
Gail, I like you.
I always have.

694
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,505
And I know you must've gotten
sucked up into a situation

695
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,132
you weren't able to control.

696
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:06,260
Really? Is that what
happened with you and House?

697
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,097
I'm not gonna back down just
because you threaten to smear me.

698
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,308
Now, if you agree
to tell the truth,

699
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:16,103
there are things
I can do to help.

700
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,606
Think about your
husband, your kids.

701
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,902
I know you're a good
person, deep down inside.

702
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:28,532
You can't completely hide everything
about yourself in seven years.

703
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,954
You're an idiot.

704
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:38,250
I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.

705
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,504
You still don't even know the
half of it, and you never will.

706
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,549
You wouldn't have even found out
about this if I hadn't gotten sick.

707
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,677
And you aren't as tough
as you think you are.

708
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:52,139
There's no way you'd let
this job get taken away.

709
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,560
And if I go down,
you're going down.

710
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:16,330
Hey, can you tell Stan to give this
to the DEA agent when he comes by?

711
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,706
A flower?

712
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:18,916
Yeah, Lucas gave it to me.

713
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,834
Thought it might come
in handy one day.

714
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,797
I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.

715
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,840
Nice.

716
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,176
Least I came out
on top once today.

717
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,636
Where you going?

718
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,222
To hand the board
my resignation.

719
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:37,309
Hopefully whoever they hire to
replace me can still get the 8%.

720
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,943
Marina, I've been trying to get
in touch with you all day.

721
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,365
It's all right. I understand.
How is Rachel?

722
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,909
And the rash?

723
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,204
Great. I'll be home early.

724
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,375
Perfect.

725
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,586
You bitch.

726
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,967
I didn't think
you'd actually do it.

727
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,260
I told you I would.

728
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,304
Call the dogs off.

729
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,184
You got your 12.

730
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,146
Congratulations.

731
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,862
Yes!

732
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,824
Yes!

733
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,674
You gonna get that?
