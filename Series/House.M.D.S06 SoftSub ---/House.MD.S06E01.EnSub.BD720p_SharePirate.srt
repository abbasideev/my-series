1
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,968
Help!

2
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,014
Help me!

3
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,245
Dry heaves are gone, so am I.

4
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,955
I'll check with the doctor.

5
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,458
No, no, no. I'm here voluntarily.
Just got to check with me.

6
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:50,753
I'm sorry. Dr. Nolan left
specific instructions.

7
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,801
She's not sick, she's scared.
So tell her to tell...

8
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,969
Wow.

9
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,097
And he's black.

10
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,518
Thought you'd be a little more
sensitive on the slavery issue.

11
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,364
You can't keep me.

12
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,448
Dr. House,
you look a lot better.

13
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,658
I am a lot better.

14
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,327
No painkillers,
no hallucinations.

15
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,037
Leg hurts, but it's manageable.

16
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,956
Great job. Gonna miss you.

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,041
Want to start missing you
as soon as possible.

18
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,920
Well, legally, you're free to go whenever
you want, but I suggest you stay.

19
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,463
I'll take it under advisement.

20
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,841
If you thought the hallucinations
were from your Vicodin problem,

21
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,010
why didn't you just check
yourself into a rehab facility?

22
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,637
I was deluded into
thinking I might be crazy.

23
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,848
But you have been
abusing Vicodin for years.

24
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,225
Never had delusions,
never had trouble sleeping,

25
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,812
never had any problems, other than
narcissism and anti-social behavior,

26
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,316
until two colleagues
died, your father died.

27
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,194
Your issues run
deeper than Vicodin.

28
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,947
That's not gonna
cheer me up, is it?

29
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,241
You need to be transferred
to our long-term ward,

30
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,118
started on medication,
talk therapy...

31
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,494
Yeah. I get it.

32
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,916
Just one thing I'm getting hung up on.
I can leave whenever I want.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,084
How about I start with that?

34
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,588
You can't go back
to practicing medicine.

35
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,552
I don't want
to practice medicine.

36
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,157
I've decided I want
to be an astronaut.

37
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,057
Well, if you want your
state astronaut's license,

38
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,643
you're gonna need
my recommendation.

39
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,855
Is that a popular
new treatment, blackmail?

40
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,524
You need to get better.

41
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,782
Welcome to Ward Six.

42
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,796
So, brass tacks.

43
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,507
What do I have to do and
how long do I have to be here?

44
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,635
Depends on you.
Process is pretty basic.

45
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,888
If you follow the schedule,
agree to take meds,

46
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,933
participate in group and individual
therapy, we can work on goals...

47
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,142
I set a goal.

48
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,310
Excellent. What is it?

49
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,272
My goal is to get your boss to write
the letter that I want him to write.

50
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,524
Now let's talk process.

51
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,276
I can smile through
gritted teeth and play nice,

52
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,654
but there are serious risks of
violence involved in that choice.

53
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,365
So I'm going with turning
this ward upside down,

54
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,493
making you and your boss' job
and life so unmanageable

55
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,663
that he'll write whatever he
has to write to get rid of me.

56
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,956
He's all set.

57
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,082
Thanks.

58
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,349
Yo, I don't need
an escort. Get off me.

59
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,685
Who are you?
You believe these guys?

60
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,688
Lecturing me on manic depression,
like I couldn't write a book or two.

61
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,252
I stopped taking my meds because
I want to stop taking my meds,

62
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,111
because nothing is wrong with me. No
reason to keep dragging me back here.

63
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,531
When I'm on them, everything slows
down, that's when the problem is.

64
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,907
Hey, nice to see you.

65
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,472
My roomie last time
couldn't stand me.

66
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,577
Really?

67
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,495
I'm Juan Alvarez.
J.A.'s my stage name,

68
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,873
but Alvie's what everybody
around here calls me.

69
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,208
Like the Woody Allen
character in Annie Hall,

70
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,378
but the Puerto Rican version
and not as neurotic.

71
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,589
So, what do I call you?

72
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,883
You're actually waiting
for an answer this time?

73
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,051
You can call me House.

74
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,472
He's a brick house.

75
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,892
Hey, wait up.

76
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,103
I've already got the whole place
wired, so I'll give you the rundown.

77
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:40,191
Yo, everybody, this is
my new roomie House, y'all.

78
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,193
Main thing you gotta know...
Is this a line?

79
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,779
Hey, Gabby, meet my
new roommate, House.

80
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,072
You can call him Hizzy.

81
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,239
No, you can't.

82
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,925
Don't worry, she won't
call you anything.

83
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,494
She hasn't talked in like
10 years or something.

84
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,039
Good you came here. You need
to know the lay of the land.

85
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,665
I need to request a new room.

86
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,084
You're funny.

87
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,888
You're also gonna come
here to get your meds.

88
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,128
I'm not on any meds.

89
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,630
You either? Good for you.

90
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,215
Tell me my mind works too fast,

91
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,884
probably tell Usain Bolt
he runs too fast.

92
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,805
Excuse me. I know you're busy ignoring
me, but my mini-bar is empty.

93
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,765
You think Bolt could
do the long jump?

94
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,930
That sport needs to evolve,

95
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,185
had the same world record
for like 20 years.

96
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,771
I think if one guy launched
himself head first

97
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,774
and right before he hits the
ground does a front flip instead,

98
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,442
get three extra feet
out of that, easy.

99
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,528
Go be that man.

100
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,033
My head!

101
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,994
My head!

102
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,374
You're not getting
any Haldol. Sorry.

103
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,017
That's Hal. His real name is Connor,
but we call him Hal because...

104
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,629
Yeah. I got it.

105
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,967
We can't play that.
They keep it locked up.

106
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,093
I wish we could,
but at the same time,

107
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,345
you can imagine
how annoying that could be.

108
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,990
Crazy people playing
on it all the time.

109
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,348
We'd never get any peace.

110
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,233
Come on, I want to introduce
you to everybody.

111
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,478
You think he's serious?

112
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,898
He's a doctor. He knows that acting out
will only reinforce our diagnosis.

113
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,650
Or it'll work.

114
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,002
You actually think this is something
we should be concerned about?

115
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,739
A patient makes a threat, you
should always be concerned.

116
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,917
There are two new additions to our ward.
You all know Alvie.

117
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,002
Thank you. Thank you.

118
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,629
Hold your applause. It's great
to be back here in Mayfield.

119
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,340
Not just for the food,
not just for the ladies...

120
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,676
Well, okay, maybe
just for the ladies.

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,512
And you should also
welcome Greg to the floor.

122
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,223
Don't worry about the name.
Just passing through.

123
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,766
I don't want to
break any hearts.

124
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,393
Can we go outside now?

125
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,603
Not now, Jay.

126
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,190
So he's claustrophobic, right?
You're claustrophobic.

127
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,275
Can I get a pen
to write this stuff down?

128
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,778
Where are you going?
Where's he going?

129
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,863
It's okay.

130
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,364
Paranoid. Check.

131
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,702
Dr. Beasley, I'm having
an issue with the food.

132
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,870
What's the problem?

133
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,788
I swear I'm eating
less and less

134
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,499
and I just keep getting
bigger and bigger.

135
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,709
A crayon, anybody?

136
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,628
We'll talk about it
another time.

137
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,547
I understand you all had
art therapy yesterday.

138
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,217
Maybe we can hang some of
the new pieces on the wall.

139
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,135
Cut your wrists, huh?

140
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,762
Greg, there are
certain topics...

141
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,389
Oh. I'm sorry,
is suicide taboo?

142
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:22,311
Gosh, if I've broken a rule on my
first day, I will kill myself.

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,147
Group's over.

144
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,233
That flew by.

145
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,153
You realize you're not the first
uncooperative patient on this floor?

146
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,821
Really? Is there a club?

147
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,408
Yes. Come with me
to the clubhouse.

148
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,997
That didn't take long.

149
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,207
I'm that good.

150
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,801
Come on, come on, come on.

151
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,595
Come on, Alvie,
let's see some action.

152
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,934
Me! Me! Me! Pass. Pass. Pass.

153
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,227
Good!

154
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,020
Come on, guys.

155
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,275
Ready to play nice?

156
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,026
Would you believe me
if I said yes?

157
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,194
No.

158
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,071
Then yes.

159
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,032
You do know
I'm trying to help you.

160
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,288
I also know you're trying to be
sweet, caring and effective.

161
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,956
You're just not.

162
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,211
You want out.
Just talk, be honest,

163
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,465
try to work with people,
try to deal with people.

164
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,469
Okay.

165
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,809
House! House! He's on my team.

166
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,853
Shut up. Nobody likes you.

167
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,481
Hey. Am I crowding you? What?

168
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,233
Can't see the sun?

169
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,485
Oh, no.
Everything's closing in.

170
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,821
Okay. Okay.

171
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,865
He's the claustrophobic one,
right?

172
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,658
Because I'm doing
this from memory.

173
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,785
You have to dribble.

174
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,911
Why?

175
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,165
CIA satellites aren't watching
me, they're watching you

176
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,334
'cause you're wearing green.

177
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,796
That one was just too easy.

178
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,593
Seriously, anorexia? Were
you supposed to be a girl?

179
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,303
And in answer to
your implicit question,

180
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,139
yes, those pants
do make you look fat.

181
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,106
How upset were you
when you woke up in the ER

182
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,901
and you were still
alive and a failure?

183
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,786
Two-nothing, good guys.

184
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,501
You're right. It is
rewarding to reach out.

185
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,342
You can't go up there.
It's yard time right now.

186
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,882
Put it on my tab.

187
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,908
I think you'll find music
therapy is more effective

188
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,661
if the patients are
inside to hear it.

189
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,833
Where'd you get the key?

190
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,335
They gave it to me.

191
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,591
So, if she ever talks, are we
gonna get a German accent?

192
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,180
No. She's my husband's sister.

193
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,517
So let him come play the piano.

194
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,644
He doesn't know how to play.

195
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,068
Nice. A little heavy
on the right foot, though.

196
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,032
See her head?
It bobs to the music.

197
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,245
It's the only real reaction
I'm getting from her.

198
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,166
Feels like we're talking.

199
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,711
You're not talking.

200
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,839
Her head is bobbing
to her pulse.

201
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,133
Are you a new doctor
on the ward?

202
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,593
Technically, yes.

203
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,515
Can I lead this time?

204
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,184
Come on.

205
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,686
Leave the lid unlocked
when you're done.

206
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,553
Can you close the door? You're
letting all the cool air out.

207
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,851
If you keep up this
scorched earth policy,

208
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,020
you're gonna end up
living in this room.

209
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,272
Are you ready
to try another strategy

210
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,274
or do you want me
to leave you in here?

211
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,292
Twenty-one. Two-one. That's game.
Hey, House is back.

212
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,044
I'll get the ball.

213
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,463
Come on. I need some meat.
I got no one left to play.

214
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,548
I'll play you.

215
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,384
Pssh, girl. Come on, House.
You can serve.

216
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,474
I had some time to think about
the approach I've been taking.

217
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:58,313
I'm new, I'm unhappy here, and I've
been taking it out on you guys.

218
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,608
Unfairly.

219
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,655
It was misdirected anger.

220
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:13,787
'Cause when you think about it, the
real jerks here are the doctors.

221
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,414
House.

222
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,293
You see how they give
you a ping-pong table,

223
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,461
but no paddles, no net.

224
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,088
It's like they're mocking you.

225
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,256
Preach.

226
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,301
The game is called table
tennis not table volleyball.

227
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,428
Greg, you know where
this is gonna end.

228
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,972
Whoever saw a tennis
court without a net?

229
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,392
A little run-down park across
from my apartment, growing up.

230
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,562
Three courts, no nets,
no one ever used it.

231
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,398
No one's gonna try to hang
themselves with a ping-pong net.

232
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,858
Of course not.
That's ridiculous.

233
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,735
It ain't right, Doc. You
treat us like little kids.

234
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:48,196
Little kids are allowed to play
ping-pong, they can play the piano.

235
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,449
Yeah, worse than little kids.

236
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,744
All right. Why don't we just go
and sit down and discuss it?

237
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,288
No, no, no! No! I want to
discuss it right here!

238
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,790
Guys.

239
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,961
Guys.

240
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,509
Guys!

241
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,353
We want...

242
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,493
House is right. I think
everyone here can handle these.

243
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,001
Seriously?

244
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,172
Is that your strategy? Give everybody
what they want, except me?

245
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,216
You're a natural leader.

246
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,861
You could do something
useful down here.

247
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,553
For them. Definitely for you.

248
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,056
Or we could keep fighting.

249
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,517
If you think you can break me,

250
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,396
if you think I'm not every
bit as stubborn as you.

251
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,615
He came to fight the Man
And he had the master plan.

252
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,202
But it started to unravel Nolan
smashed him with his gavel like...

253
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,620
Shut up.

254
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,206
So, you're gonna keep trying
to make them miserable?

255
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,541
No.

256
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,709
New plan?

257
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,876
Yep.

258
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,628
What is it?

259
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,963
I don't know yet.

260
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,883
His mind is burning
The wheels are turning.

261
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,343
The butter is churning.

262
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,762
You think Nolan can keep
House from strolling?

263
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,307
You know, it's easier to come
up with a new plan in silence.

264
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,851
Right. Cool.

265
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,149
Can I hum?

266
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,994
I'd like you all to welcome another
new addition to our ward. Steve.

267
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,662
Freedom Master.

268
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,373
Steve Elkerton's just a cover.

269
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,959
It's like Clark Kent or Bruce
Wayne or Peter Parker.

270
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,754
Cool, we get more Jesuses
than superheroes.

271
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,839
Well, I try to blend in,
in the outside world,

272
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,384
but I figure in here
everybody gets it.

273
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,428
Hey, we're living
in the Ward of Justice.

274
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,512
Alvie.

275
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,266
Can you explain a little more about
what you think everybody gets?

276
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,268
That there's good
and evil in the world.

277
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,437
And some people are special,

278
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,064
and they're chosen to help
keep evil forces at bay.

279
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,525
You don't think
you can stop bullets, do you?

280
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,611
I move out of their way.

281
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,446
Can you read minds?

282
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,032
No.

283
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,202
Group time, Greg.

284
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,038
Why isn't she talking?

285
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,878
She needs help. She needs
somebody to save her.

286
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,547
That's what we're
all trying to do.

287
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,844
Let's take five minutes.
Everybody get to know Steve.

288
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,100
I can fly.

289
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,188
I know you're scheming,

290
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,233
working on your next elaborate
plan to get out of here.

291
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:16,363
Why don't you put the plan on hold
for a few days, see what happens?

292
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,157
Just let me do my job.

293
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:23,703
If you prefer private to group, we
can do that, maybe try some SSRls.

294
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:28,458
If you think nothing's working, you
can always go back to your schemes.

295
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,877
God, if only you'd said
that two minutes ago,

296
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:34,422
before I came up with my new scheme.
Now I'm committed.

297
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,966
Get it?

298
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,011
Shaq up in my area

299
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,347
I'm a better baller
and a better rapper, what?

300
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,808
And I'm good
at basketball, too!

301
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,395
Do you have
third-floor privileges?

302
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,023
Ever since I shared in group
about my uncle fondling me.

303
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,818
Is that true? Yeah.

304
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,821
And now I can use the
third-floor vending machines.

305
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,385
Do you eat sour cream
and onion chips?

306
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,699
I mean, the whole
point is the dipping.

307
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,075
Sure, we save
time by not adding

308
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,869
the mix to the sour cream,
but you're missing out...

309
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,037
I need you to break
into Nolan's office.

310
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,372
Commando style.

311
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,957
I want you to focus.

312
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,208
You want me to mess him up?

313
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,544
Go into Nolan's office,
look at his calendar.

314
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,838
I need the name of the woman
he met with at 11:00 today.

315
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,007
No problem. And I'll get
you some old-school chips.

316
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,592
If they have them,
I'll get you some dip,

317
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,885
but I've never seen dip
in the vending machine...

318
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,596
Yes, get me chips
and dip. What else?

319
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,763
I get it, I get it.

320
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,849
Plan B. "B" is for blackmail.

321
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,643
I got you covered.
Commando style.

322
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,730
Let me go! I just wanted a little snack.
That ain't right.

323
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,942
Yo, I didn't know the machine was moved.
I want some Ritz Bits.

324
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,986
Yo, I might be pregnant.
I get these cravings.

325
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,826
You get the name?

326
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,913
Nolan's schedule book just has a big "X"
marking out the whole middle of the day.

327
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,249
Then we can assume the girl
he's with is called "Nooner."

328
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,294
Nooner, nooner
Nolan's gonna spoon her.

329
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,379
He's gonna fork her.

330
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,714
And then he's gonna knife her

331
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,676
I didn't get a chance to check
the phone or anything else.

332
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,095
That's okay.
I got her license plate.

333
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,429
I call my friend,
he gets the name,

334
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,348
I get the letter that
gets me out of here.

335
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,183
You got phone privileges?

336
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,103
I'm on level minus four. I'm
still writing with a crayon.

337
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,188
You? You gotta be a level five.

338
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,023
That's like the top
of the Space Needle.

339
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,901
Hal's the only one
that's up that high.

340
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,236
Hal's a level five?

341
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,863
They give him a point every
time he clears his plate.

342
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,365
I've been eating his potatoes.

343
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,700
Will he sell you some minutes?

344
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,952
No, I pay two cigarettes
for the potatoes.

345
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,912
Phone's worth a lot more.

346
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,000
Can you cheek a pill?

347
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,251
No.

348
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,921
That's too bad for you.

349
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,180
You sure you're good with this?

350
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,599
Yeah, yeah. Gotta be done.

351
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,061
So, how do we start?

352
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,441
I think we just start. Make it good.
Make it real.

353
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,446
Just do it already.

354
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,123
Code Gray!

355
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,792
Give me
five milligrams of Haldol!

356
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,964
Get him off me! Hey!

357
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,554
Give it to him.

358
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,995
Dude, that was awesome.

359
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,212
You think Hal will
mind if they're wet?

360
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,178
House?

361
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,764
No, it's your other
friend at the asylum.

362
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,100
How's it going?

363
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,602
Hallucinations are gone,
so is the Vicodin.

364
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,563
How's the leg? How's the pain?

365
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,482
They got me on
some non-narcotic.

366
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,485
I'm dealing. I need you
to run a license plate.

367
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,821
Was there a hit-and-run
on your floor?

368
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,157
House, just do
what you're supposed to do,

369
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:14,035
listen to the doctors, and
I'll be able to visit soon.

370
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,360
Track down the owner of
this car and I'll be

371
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,623
able to visit you. In your office.
Tomorrow.

372
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,710
My doctor's too smart, too old, and too
well-dressed to only be running one ward.

373
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,462
He screwed up
something in his life,

374
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,787
and I think
he's doing it again.

375
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,133
I need her name, so I can
blackmail the blackmailer.

376
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,760
House, he called me.

377
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,848
What did he want to know?

378
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,101
He wanted to know about you.

379
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,146
He wanted to warn me that you'd
be calling for something,

380
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,608
and he told me if I wanted to help you
get better, I had to let him do his job.

381
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,653
Yeah, well, now I'm calling you to
tell you that if he calls you...

382
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,323
House, I'm so sorry.
I wish I could help you.

383
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,825
You can.

384
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,795
Turns out,

385
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,841
you're my only friend.

386
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,305
House ain't a newbie
Now he's living on this floor.

387
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,432
And I hate you.

388
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,270
I'm gonna cooperate.

389
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,024
That's not much of a plan.
That's actually their plan.

390
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,861
No. I'm pretty sure their plan is for
me to actually swallow the pills,

391
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,988
to actually cooperate.

392
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,013
I'm so proud
of my little roomie.

393
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,599
I only taught him
everything he knows.

394
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,185
One, two, three.

395
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,441
Okay, Stomp, you start the betting.
Highest card wins.

396
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,028
That's probably
a fold. Richter?

397
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,322
Two cigarettes.

398
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,074
He's not confident, Alvie.

399
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,744
You can crush him. In the form
of a rhyme if you wanted.

400
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,164
No regrets Raise 10 cigarettes.

401
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,584
Whoa. That's a lot of nerve for
someone with a two on their head.

402
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,961
You're messing with me.

403
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,213
You can't raise 10,
I only have five.

404
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,298
Throw in your phone card.

405
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,466
I'm not gonna throw
in my phone card.

406
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,884
Can I play?

407
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,429
Come here. Why?

408
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,029
I want to see if you've
got what it takes.

409
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,225
Give me your best poker face.

410
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,689
Too rich for my blood.
You can take my seat.

411
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,524
Med time!

412
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,652
How are you feeling today?

413
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,238
Better than yesterday,
not as good as tomorrow.

414
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,678
I've been humming to her.

415
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,556
She sways.
Might be significant.

416
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,146
Are you ignoring me or are you just
letting my charm wash over you?

417
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,108
Kind of tough to play and chat.

418
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,153
Couple of weeks ago,
you told me

419
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,989
playing to her was
a complete waste of time.

420
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,494
You're right. Your playing
does get worse when you talk.

421
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,372
I assume she loved music.

422
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:31,459
She played for the Philadelphia
Philharmonic. Cello.

423
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,963
If she responded to the piano, she might
respond even better to the cello.

424
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,965
I play a little.

425
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:40,885
Hmm.

426
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,639
Maybe I'll bring one
in Tuesday. Thank you.

427
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,230
Different desk.
Different doctor.

428
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,898
You've been on meds
for a while now.

429
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,276
I'll be checking in with you periodically
to see if we need to adjust your dose.

430
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,904
Any dry mouth?
Trouble sleeping?

431
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,030
No.

432
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,866
Can I go now?
There's a manic out there

433
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,286
with a fresh carton of cigarettes
and he's a terrible bluffer.

434
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,082
It's nice to see that you and
Alvie are friends again.

435
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,166
Tell me about your fight.

436
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,252
He hit me, I hit him back.

437
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,087
Repeat until pulpy.

438
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,589
Alvie told me you
instigated the thing.

439
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,508
That tends to be
the way fights work.

440
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,052
Different interpretations
of the same circumstances.

441
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,762
Very understanding attitude.

442
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:25,930
There's that tone again.

443
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,432
You're smart.

444
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,977
How come every time you compliment
me, it sounds like an accusation?

445
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,021
You're not having any side-effects
from your meds, which is unusual.

446
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,189
It's not that unusual.

447
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,524
The story about the fight
isn't adding up.

448
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,777
Why don't you stop pretending that
you haven't reached a conclusion?

449
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:43,156
You don't trust me. Actually,
it's more fundamental than that.

450
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
You don't like me.

451
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,324
I didn't say that.

452
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,243
You think I'm not
taking my meds.

453
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,328
Are you? Yes.

454
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,999
So, what do you want me to do?
Want me to take a urine test?

455
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,042
Will that earn your trust?

456
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,086
Actually, yeah.

457
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,433
Have at it.

458
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,351
A little dignity, please.

459
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,729
You know the rules.
I have to watch.

460
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,845
Yes, but you don't have
to have court side seats.

461
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,900
Can I at least use a stall?

462
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:48,012
For he himself has said it.

463
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:52,683
And it's greatly to his credit.

464
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,854
That he is an Englishman.

465
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:57,439
He is.

466
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:06,572
An Englishman.

467
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,170
Get it while it's hot.

468
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,272
I'm sorry I doubted you.

469
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,653
Freedom Master, think
you could help me out?

470
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,115
You need help?
Of course. That's what I do.

471
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,993
Great. Could you move
the piano for me?

472
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,414
Five hundred pounds
is not too much, is it?

473
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,666
Is there something
trapped underneath or...

474
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,835
No, I just want to move
it away from the window.

475
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,420
I'm sorry, my powers
aren't for frivolous...

476
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,380
Just one quick lift.

477
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,423
Why are you doing that?

478
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,675
House, it's none
of your business.

479
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:12,597
I'm just curious, as a doctor.
What are you doing?

480
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,016
Either he is Freedom Master
and he shouldn't be here

481
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,935
or else he's suffering from a
serious and dangerous delusion

482
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,520
that he needs to deal with.

483
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,315
So legit medical reasons.

484
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,031
You're not just trying to break the
guy because he's a little different.

485
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,945
He's not different,
he's delusional.

486
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,071
Can you help me out?

487
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,323
What is she looking at?

488
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,908
You're not a superhero, Steven.

489
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,119
You're just a regular person, that's okay.
I can save her.

490
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,538
We're all just regular people.
It's what we do with that...

491
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:41,292
They stole her voice box.
They have it in there.

492
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,587
That's what she's staring at.
That's what she's staring at.

493
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,711
She's always staring at...

494
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,757
Your wife is dead.

495
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,556
Good can defeat evil.

496
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,351
Not every time. Evil people killed
a lot of good people that day.

497
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,478
You couldn't save her.
No one could save her.

498
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,984
It's in there. Her voice is in there.
Her voice is in there.

499
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,444
Code Gray.

500
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,862
Her voice is in...

501
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,409
Her voice is in there!
Her voice is in there!

502
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,208
Don't do it.

503
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,709
I'm not doing anything.

504
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,169
You're thinking.

505
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,339
Things go from thinking to doing
way too fast in this place.

506
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,841
Keep thinking, you're gonna wind
up with no mo in your mojo.

507
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,343
I'm thinking
of hitting you again.

508
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,346
You hate Medina, you hate all
of them, you want to hurt them.

509
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,765
You gotta keep pretending.
Step away from the hate.

510
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,061
What's the difference between pretending
to cooperate and cooperating?

511
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,106
Pretending is pretending. It's
not real, you don't mean it.

512
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,234
I sat and watched while he did
something stupid and pointless.

513
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,360
I cooperated.

514
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,613
In a few days, you won't have to
watch because you're going home.

515
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,115
You'll be getting
your job back.

516
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,534
Everybody, inside.

517
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,579
Closing ceremonies, everyone attends.
One of you is going home.

518
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,961
It's been a great week.

519
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,797
A number of you have made
tremendous strides.

520
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,801
But today we're here
to congratulate Susan.

521
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,434
We are proud of her. We
wish her well and we hope

522
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,854
- to never see her again.
- To never see her again.

523
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,823
Isn't it pretty?

524
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,959
Where's Freedom Master?

525
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,669
He isn't able to take part.

526
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,434
Get out there. He said everybody
has to get out there.

527
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,436
Talk. Say something.

528
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,022
Dr. House, leave him alone.

529
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,940
Did you drug him?

530
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,275
Of course I didn't drug him.

531
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,028
He's in flat affect.
He's practically catatonic.

532
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,112
Hey, we got cake.

533
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,280
He's fine.

534
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,782
Double chocolate. Yummy, yummy.

535
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,284
Don't tell me that he's fine!
You did this!

536
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,578
He was functioning.
He was happy.

537
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,079
He was delusional.

538
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,873
Yeah. He's way better off now.

539
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,124
Dr. House.

540
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,418
Let's talk.

541
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,384
Thinking sucks.

542
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:44,183
I'm not allowed to get angry?
They screwed him up.

543
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,810
And for the record,

544
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,354
I am two privilege
levels above Susan.

545
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,064
I got the same
depression scale score.

546
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,983
Every patient is different. It's
not about scores and levels and...

547
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,820
Happiness is happiness, the test
is the test, coping is coping.

548
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,447
And you think you're...
Absolutely!

549
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,325
I need to address
some deeper issues,

550
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,994
which I could do on
an outpatient basis.

551
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,287
Three hours a week?

552
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,998
That's just my opening offer. If you
want to counter, I'll likely fold.

553
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,083
No.

554
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,377
"No" is not an argument.

555
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,542
You trying to frustrate me?

556
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,629
No.

557
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,589
"No" again?

558
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,925
I can cope. I'm coping.

559
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,928
In fact, I'm coping
better than you think.

560
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:25,683
I've not been taking
my meds. Not one.

561
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,395
And yet I still scored a "high-functioning"
on your depression test.

562
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,106
So your proof of your
well-being is that you lied?

563
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,774
Manipulated.

564
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,735
My proof is that I can fool
the test, I can fool you,

565
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,153
which means
I am high-functioning.

566
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:41,365
I'm sane, rational, capable.
I should not be here.

567
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,576
These are your
pills from today?

568
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,412
I'm not gonna take it.
I'll just cheek it again.

569
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,250
Lick it.

570
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,878
You want me to lick your hand.

571
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,462
I washed.

572
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,051
It's sugar.

573
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,266
Your test results were improving
too regularly and too quickly.

574
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,101
I was concerned that you
weren't taking your pills,

575
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,022
that it was all an act. So I
switched you to a placebo

576
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,736
to see if your improvements
would continue.

577
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,573
Your psych tests
told me nothing,

578
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,701
but your urine tests
told me you were faking.

579
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,748
You need to stop
fighting the system.

580
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,750
You need to let me do my job.

581
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,508
So, what's the next plan?

582
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,346
There is no new plan.

583
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,724
I'm out of plans.

584
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,267
So, what do we do?

585
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,685
We stop talking.

586
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,309
I see you got some
cello in your trunk.

587
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,188
No, it's not a euphemism.

588
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,482
Are you spying on me?

589
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,317
I'm living in
a psychiatric hospital.

590
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,153
Staring out of the window
is what we do.

591
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,781
I assume you'll need
help carrying it up.

592
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,741
I still got grounds privileges.

593
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,829
And who's going to carry you
when you're carrying the cello?

594
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,874
Yes, cast aside the useless cripple.
How very German of you.

595
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,720
Seriously. The thing weighs
a ton with that case.

596
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:00,546
I think I'll need a dolly.

597
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,966
Or we could ask
Clark Kent to pitch in.

598
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,343
The dolly's probably easier.

599
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,596
The dolly already
feels good about itself.

600
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,101
He was a happy-go-lucky superhero
until they told him he has no powers.

601
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,812
You let him help out,
he feels good about himself,

602
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,897
might be less depressed.

603
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,819
So, why do you
put your life on hold

604
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,031
to visit your sister-in-law
five times a week?

605
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,075
Am I somehow a bad person
for showing compassion?

606
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,413
No. You're not even a bad person for
lying about why you're doing it.

607
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:41,462
Oh, that is impressive.
That is a superhuman feat.

608
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,510
Why don't you take a rest before
you fly that thing up to the ward?

609
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,351
He's still depressed.
Give me your car keys.

610
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,937
You gonna dangle them in front
of him to entertain him?

611
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,731
I'm gonna make him
feel like he's flying.

612
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,943
I'll just drive him around the
grounds, top down, wind in his hair.

613
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,740
Seriously? You're
gonna say no to that?

614
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,214
Why are you so nice to me?

615
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,343
I think you have a good heart.

616
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,763
Would you still be nice to me
if I told you that I lied?

617
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,099
I'm not just driving around the
grounds in your convertible.

618
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,726
I'm kidnapping him
and stealing your car.

619
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,067
You sure?

620
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,653
I was just starting to feel
a little heat between us.

621
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,097
Thought we had kind of a Bonnie
and Clyde thing going there.

622
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,449
Bonnie and Clyde
get shot to pieces.

623
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,160
Hmm. See you.

624
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,894
You can do this. And if you
hold my hand, I can do it, too.

625
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,386
Don't let go!

626
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,222
Going up!

627
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,696
Freedom Master is back!

628
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:18,285
Keep it down, Freedom Master,
you're scaring the good citizens.

629
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,370
That was the coolest
moment of my life.

630
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,872
It was fun.

631
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,583
You can repay me by telling
Nolan he's an idiot.

632
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,212
Smell that fresh air. And the
warmth of your yellow sun.

633
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,880
We do enjoy it.

634
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,552
Careful of the traffic. Don't
want to go damaging any fenders.

635
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,266
Hey! Hey! Come on. Get down.

636
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,521
There's no cry for help.
There's no cat in a tree.

637
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,984
Thank you, Greg.

638
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,612
No!

639
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,707
He's lucky to be alive.

640
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,920
He's got a lacerated spleen,
rotational pelvic fracture,

641
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,798
compound break
of the femur and humerus.

642
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,635
Everything in your life has
been about finding the truth,

643
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,890
but suddenly, with this guy, you decide
to reinforce a sick man's delusions.

644
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,229
You just wanted to take
a swing at me. Hmm?

645
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,025
You don't care about getting
out, you don't care about him.

646
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,069
You don't even
care about the truth.

647
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,157
You don't care
about anything, House.

648
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,953
I'm transferring you
to Winslow Psychiatric.

649
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:47,207
You'll have better luck pulling the
wool over their eyes. I'm done.

650
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,251
Don't.

651
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,924
I need help.

652
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,945
So, how is this
supposed to work?

653
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,364
You sit. I sit. We talk.

654
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,700
About what?
About whatever you want.

655
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,410
You want me to whine
about my mother?

656
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,954
Do you want to whine
about your mother?

657
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,374
I could tell you about the time I
was five and my goldfish died.

658
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,002
If that's where
you'd like to start.

659
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,837
I've had a billion things
happen to me in my life,

660
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,589
how am I supposed to know
which ones are relevant?

661
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,341
As far as I'm concerned,
they're all relevant.

662
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,927
Well, we better get moving 'cause
this session could take 50 years.

663
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,305
Yes, you are the sum of everything
that's happened to you,

664
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,184
and, yes, some events are
more relevant than others,

665
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:52,064
but the only way we can figure
out which ones are is to talk.

666
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,691
So, tell me,
what's on your mind?

667
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,319
What do you want?

668
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,990
I want to get better.

669
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,119
Whatever the hell that means.

670
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,205
I'm sick of being miserable.

671
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,664
So you'd like to be happy?

672
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,125
Again with the reflecting.
Yes, I'd like to be happy.

673
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,294
Being happy is
an excellent goal.

674
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,254
Not many patients
can crystallize

675
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,923
exactly what they're
hoping to get out of this.

676
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,341
Well, bully for me.

677
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,426
So, now all we have to do

678
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:25,389
is figure out how to get
you from here to happy.

679
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,852
SSRis? That's your
genius technique?

680
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,855
I don't think we should ignore
any tools that can help.

681
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,899
I know you don't have a
problem taking drugs.

682
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,901
For my leg. For pain.

683
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,404
Well, think of this
as being for psychic pain.

684
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,909
I don't want to
change who I am.

685
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,035
Miserable?

686
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:55,293
You think that by taking
meds you'll lose your edge?

687
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:59,131
Stop making the unique connections
that make you a successful doctor?

688
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,133
If Van Gogh was your patient,

689
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,969
he'd be satisfied painting houses
instead of the Starry Night.

690
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,014
Van Gogh would still be making
inspired paintings of the night sky,

691
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,350
just maybe not from
the room of his asylum.

692
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,435
You don't know that.

693
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,479
I know both his ears
would be intact.

694
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,567
And I know his life
would be better.

695
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,747
I know this doesn't
come naturally to you,

696
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,544
but you want my help, which
means you need to trust me.

697
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,389
Hmm.

698
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,391
Delicious.

699
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,404
Why are you here?

700
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,741
Waiting for my communion wafer.

701
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,374
You're cheeking it, right?

702
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,210
Nope.

703
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,670
Tell me you're cheeking it.

704
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,964
I swallowed it.

705
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,466
No, you didn't.
We don't take meds.

706
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,884
You don't take meds, Alvie.

707
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,719
I decided to get sane.

708
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,846
You're scamming again.
You can tell me.

709
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,390
I'm not scamming, Alvie.

710
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,142
They broke you.

711
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:41,066
They didn't break me.
I am broken.

712
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,947
And stop worshipping me and go
worry about your own loser life.

713
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,494
I hate you.

714
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,881
Prom?

715
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,299
Got an assignment for you.

716
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,926
Role playing?

717
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,054
I'm not sure how pretending
to be a businessman

718
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,391
with a foot fetish is going
to help, but I'm game.

719
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,727
Have you connected with any
of the other patients?

720
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,062
You've been here four weeks.

721
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,482
Tell me about your relationships
with the other patients.

722
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:26,611
Diane is convinced
that Silent Girl hates her.

723
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,405
Richter is not as
paranoid as you think,

724
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,699
he just likes
that you think that,

725
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,200
and my roommate hates me.

726
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:33,525
Only one of the things you said

727
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:36,746
indicated how somebody else
feels about you. So...

728
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,127
I'm sure they've done some form
of rudimentary analysis on me,

729
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,336
concluded that I'm a jerk.

730
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,256
You know, there is a way for them
to find out things about you

731
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,174
without deductive reasoning.

732
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,801
I have had relationships.

733
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,928
You've screwed up
relationships.

734
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,931
Every one of them.
Almost like that was the goal.

735
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:59,561
I want you to trust people.

736
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,315
Try.

737
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,986
Get dressed.

738
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,381
Just open up?

739
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,469
Just open up. Trust.

740
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:34,596
Strangers?

741
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,766
We'll start with strangers,
then work our way up.

742
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:43,229
If it helps, I find "Hello" to
be an excellent ice breaker.

743
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,573
Hi.

744
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,576
Hi.

745
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,162
It's like hello, only shorter.

746
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,915
Yes.

747
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,668
Glad we were able
to save that time.

748
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,837
Judging by the fancy suit,
I'd say you were a donor,

749
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:11,174
but the nervous demeanor says
maybe you've had issues,

750
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,594
probably that's why this
place has personal meaning.

751
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,931
But this is supposed
to be about me.

752
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,518
I take advantage of my friends.

753
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,980
Friend, really.
I've only got one.

754
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,442
It can be tough sometimes.

755
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,610
I'm not gay.

756
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:31,695
Neither am I.

757
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,446
Actually, I am.

758
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,532
See that guy over there?

759
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:40,036
He's my lover.
He's also my psychiatrist.

760
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,122
Which some would argue
is a little inappropriate,

761
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,458
but they just don't know
what love is. Am I right?

762
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,258
You're not gay. No.

763
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,428
But I have to tell intimate
secrets to people.

764
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,764
Maybe they should be true.

765
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,558
Hadn't thought of that.

766
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,727
To be on the safe side,
I should probably do both.

767
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,564
Starting with the fun ones.
Come on, let's get me better.

768
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,450
Hi.

769
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:19,993
Hi.

770
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,707
I'm a philanderer.

771
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,168
Oh.

772
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,372
Philanderer doesn't mean
that I give a lot to charity,

773
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,379
it means...

774
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:32,839
I know what it means.

775
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,678
You were asking me if there were
any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.

776
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:39,846
What?

777
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,848
Honey.

778
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,726
What did my husband
just say to you?

779
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:53,985
I was asking him if there were
nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.

780
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,612
Then where is your EpiPen?

781
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,780
My what?

782
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,991
No one with an allergy would
walk around without an EpiPen.

783
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,367
Give me your purse. No.

784
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,119
Give me your purse. Stop. No.

785
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:06,623
What really happened is...

786
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,753
I thought he was cute.
I hit on him.

787
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,046
We're going.

788
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,639
You having fun?

789
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,392
I did connect with one guy,

790
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,939
but then my propensity for
screwing things up overtook me.

791
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:34,818
Then my desire to have fun
overcame my propensity.

792
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,820
You didn't screw it up.

793
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,156
The assignment wasn't to get you to
trust people with a piece of your soul,

794
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,451
the assignment was to teach
you that you can trust.

795
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:48,498
Did any of these people rat you
out as the obnoxious womanizer

796
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,584
or the porn producer
that they think you are?

797
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:57,590
Why do you think that people would treat
you worse if they knew the truth?

798
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,972
Good night, Doctor.

799
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,269
Are you in trouble?

800
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,398
Apparently not.

801
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:16,651
So, what's next?
You wanna be my pimp?

802
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,448
Why don't we just talk?

803
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,118
Okay.

804
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,748
How come you weren't pissed
at me for stealing your car?

805
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:33,835
It was a nice thing to do.

806
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,964
Hmm. I'm not sure about the
German-English translation of "nice."

807
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:43,344
The stealing was nice or the
ruining of Freedom Master's life?

808
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:48,766
What you did was misguided
and irresponsible,

809
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,436
but it was also nice.

810
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,647
You gave him a moment
of pure happiness.

811
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:01,487
You asked me why I come here
so often to visit Annie.

812
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,742
She was my best friend.

813
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:10,163
Then she started pulling
away from everybody.

814
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,333
The doctors don't know why.

815
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,920
I think I married her brother

816
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:22,884
because he was the only other one who
was going through the same thing.

817
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,306
But he stopped visiting
after a couple of years.

818
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,477
I just couldn't stop.

819
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,648
I miss her.

820
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,158
I should go.

821
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,787
Good night.

822
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,425
Good night.

823
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,322
So, what happened?

824
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,700
You're talking to me now.

825
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,034
No.

826
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,584
Was it fun?

827
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,630
Yeah.

828
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,974
She kissed me.

829
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,979
Don't read into the phrasing.
We kissed each other.

830
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,303
And how do you feel about that?

831
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,192
How do I feel about that? It was a kiss.
Kisses are good things.

832
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,236
Okay.

833
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,614
That was a loaded "okay."

834
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,575
Not at all.
Why would you assume that?

835
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,702
You're being judgmental.

836
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,497
If I'd said that I had some delicious
Chilean sea bass for dinner last night,

837
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,423
would you say, "And how
do you feel about that?"

838
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,209
If the sea bass
was married, I might.

839
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,712
See, you're being judgmental.

840
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,715
Isn't that against
your code or something?

841
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,508
I'm simply stating the obvious.

842
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,886
It's complicated, not just
because she's married

843
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,805
and not just because
you're institutionalized.

844
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,143
I know you spent the last 12 hours trying
to figure out what that kiss means.

845
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:42,315
Who was that woman you were
with in the parking lot?

846
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,067
When you deflect,

847
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,402
it's more effective when
you're not that transparent.

848
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:49,072
Obviously you have
no problem with infidelity.

849
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:53,576
You're trying to rationalize that if
it's okay for your doctor, it's okay.

850
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,037
But just for the record,
I am not having an affair.

851
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,324
Then who is she? Why do you
think you're working so hard

852
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,133
to figure out the details
of my personal life?

853
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:03,252
Might not have to work so hard if there
were some personal items in here.

854
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:06,756
You've got one number
on speed dial, it says "Dad."

855
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,591
Come on, how old are you?

856
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,134
Why are you so afraid
to talk about this?

857
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,637
I want to talk about you. I want to
know who I'm taking advice from.

858
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,972
I'm not giving you advice,
I'm asking you questions.

859
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,975
I think that kiss meant a lot.
I think that scares you.

860
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,061
I think there are
no personal items in here

861
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,771
because you have
no personal life.

862
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,606
How do you think
you and Lydia will end?

863
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,608
You are a lonely man.

864
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,111
You've screwed up every
opportunity you've had in life.

865
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,029
What's the ending
to this story?

866
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,661
I don't know.

867
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,416
Visiting time.

868
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,813
Why did you kiss me?

869
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,528
How many reasons are there?

870
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:15,908
I like you. It felt like a
nice way of showing you that.

871
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,376
How'd it go with Lydia?

872
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:11,047
I found out she can only be happy
so long before the catatonic guy

873
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,726
with two broken limbs
rolls off the elevator.

874
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:16,344
Philosophically speaking.

875
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:19,889
Why do you value your failures
more than your successes?

876
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,226
My mother caught me masturbating
to pictures of her mother.

877
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,645
Can we get past
these cute deflections?

878
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,928
Successes only last until
someone screws them up.

879
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,067
Failures are forever.

880
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,110
So you accept that fact?

881
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,489
You accept that there's
nothing you can do?

882
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,033
Okay. I accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do.

883
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,743
Now what can I do?

884
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,997
You acknowledge failure
and you move past it.

885
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,874
You apologize.

886
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:48,501
Wow.

887
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,796
Powerful things,
these apologies.

888
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,674
You get someone
to jump off a building,

889
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,426
you say two words and you
move on with your life.

890
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,470
Hardly seems fair.

891
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,846
Is that the issue?

892
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,352
You caused him pain.

893
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:12,316
If the world is just,
you have to suffer equally?

894
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,447
You're not God, House.

895
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:23,327
You're just another screwed-up
human being who needs to move on.

896
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:29,041
Apologize to him.
Let yourself feel better.

897
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:35,381
Then you can learn to let
yourself keep feeling better.

898
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,116
Hey.

899
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,631
Dr. House. Everything okay?

900
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,177
Yeah.

901
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,056
Time for group.
Group time, everybody.

902
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,978
I have a surprise.

903
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:35,274
Two weeks from today, we're going
to have the Mayfield Talent Show.

904
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,943
Talent show? Who's in it?

905
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:41,030
I'd really love it if everybody
here could participate.

906
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,615
But then who's gonna watch?

907
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,951
The staff will come.
Friends and family.

908
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,161
Are you going to tape this?

909
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,621
No, it's just for us.

910
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,457
Well, if it's just for us,
I vote we don't do it.

911
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:56,379
Think of it as a fun way to
work on our therapeutic issues.

912
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,756
Alvie, maybe you could
sing one of your songs.

913
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,341
I don't sing, I rap.

914
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,885
Okay. Well, you can write
something just for us.

915
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,930
I don't write.
I just do. Freestyle style.

916
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,848
I think you're gonna
wanna be prepared.

917
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,850
Make something special.

918
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,227
Always special.

919
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:14,980
How about you, Diane? Is there
something you'd like to do?

920
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,816
I don't have any talents.

921
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,735
Sure, you do. You all do.

922
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,571
Steve, don't you think that
Diane has hidden talent

923
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,157
that we'd all like
to see come out?

924
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:28,661
You really think
he's going to answer?

925
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,538
Eventually. Why?

926
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,749
Because things pass.

927
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,836
Things change,
doesn't mean they get better.

928
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,080
You gotta make things better,

929
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,673
you can't just keep talking
and hope for the best.

930
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:47,012
Diane, maybe you and I can work
together and figure something out.

931
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,015
I can save him.

932
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,936
"They stole her voice box."
That's what he said.

933
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,147
That's what she was staring at.

934
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,565
That's why he's staring.

935
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:59,316
Dr. House, please.

936
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:00,693
Because there's
a music box in there.

937
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,027
Orderly.

938
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,781
Come on,
just give it to me. I can...

939
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:09,660
I'm not having
a psychotic break.

940
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,370
I promise you this will work.

941
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,548
It's that blue box
on the top shelf.

942
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,181
This is what you wanted. This
is what you needed. A voice.

943
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,184
You thought you could cure
Silent Girl with this.

944
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:36,270
So by your own rationale,
it should cure you.

945
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:41,275
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're healing.

946
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,652
All the parts work. Just speak.

947
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,947
Come on. Speak. Say something.

948
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:49,617
I think maybe everyone
should take a break now.

949
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:02,129
You're trying to fix,
instead of moving on.

950
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,445
I brought Dvořák. Four hands.

951
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,616
What?

952
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,577
I need to know what this is.

953
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,789
It's sheet music.

954
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:45,631
I told you. It's just
two people having fun.

955
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,051
There's two possible outcomes.

956
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:53,472
It ends, someone gets hurt, or it
doesn't end and someone gets hurt.

957
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,726
So the end sucks, it doesn't
mean the beginning has to.

958
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:03,941
Everything ends, life ends. It
doesn't mean that we can't enjoy it.

959
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,736
I can't... I can't do this.

960
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:13,701
All I know is I was happy five
minutes ago, and now I'm not.

961
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,620
How is that better?

962
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,748
Goodbye, Lydia.

963
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,758
I'm really worried about ECT.

964
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:33,262
Apprehension's normal.
Has anyone else had it?

965
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,180
They shocked me, man.

966
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,976
Thanks, that's very reassuring.

967
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,061
I don't know if I should do it.

968
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,731
Just do the treatment
or shut up.

969
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,149
Greg, there's a process.

970
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:49,028
Yes, a process. Wouldn't want to
disrupt the process with results.

971
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,654
Hizzy had a rough
night last night.

972
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:53,741
Guess he decided to go back to being
an ass instead of a hypocrite.

973
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,534
Let's move on.

974
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,495
Alvie, are you making any
progress writing your rap?

975
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,958
Yeah. But really, no. I just don't
want to write my songs down,

976
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:06,670
it takes all the spontaneity out
of it, it's not of the moment.

977
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,130
Alvie, if you
write things down...

978
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:13,427
When the time comes, my rhyme
comes When my spotlight shines...

979
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:17,765
Yeah. You're a genius.
Rhymes with penius.

980
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:22,227
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Beasley.
Dr. Nolan asked me to give you this.

981
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,609
Is this a day pass?

982
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,110
He'd like to see you.

983
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,882
Thanks for coming.

984
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,177
I was hoping you could take
a look at my dad's chart.

985
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,806
A consult? What happened?

986
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,517
You went through every
sane doctor in town?

987
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,852
I thought you wouldn't
mind getting off the ward.

988
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,818
The cleaning lady found
him on the kitchen floor.

989
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,975
Doctors here don't think
that he'll recover.

990
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:15,072
That I should pull the plug.

991
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:19,410
I want a second opinion, so I thought
I'd be a fool not to call you.

992
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:26,834
Lacunar infarct converted
to hemorrhagic stroke.

993
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,422
He squashed his brain.
They didn't miss anything.

994
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:33,966
That's what I thought.

995
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,968
That's what you knew.

996
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:40,097
His brain has been
replaced by blood.

997
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:45,686
It's over, and it's obvious to any doctor
who looked at that scan. Even a shrink.

998
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,480
You want someone to tell you that
what you need to do is okay.

999
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,066
You need permission.
Absolution.

1000
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,860
Not now, House.

1001
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,697
You have no friends, no family.

1002
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:01,326
At some point, you made a
mistake, you lost everything.

1003
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,831
And now I'm the closest
thing you got to a friend.

1004
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,374
Just shut up.

1005
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:12,796
I don't need you here
to play this game.

1006
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,892
I'm sorry I pushed you away.

1007
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,562
It's what I do when I'm afraid.

1008
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:15,734
Again, the German-English
translation may be a little off.

1009
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,615
I'm not crying because of you.

1010
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:25,661
I'm crying because
I'm pathetic.

1011
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:32,167
I brought her cello. In case she
magically wakes up for the show.

1012
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,254
Well, then I take
the apology back.

1013
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:41,301
We're all pathetic. It's what
makes everything interesting.

1014
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,012
I'm sick of life
being interesting.

1015
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:54,369
You're nobody
'til somebody loves you.

1016
01:12:55,038 --> 01:13:00,584
You're nobody
'til somebody cares.

1017
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:41,208
Ladies and gentlemen, the
one, the only, Juan Alvarez!

1018
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,592
Yo, yo, what's up? Ward Six is
jumping off, y'all.

1019
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,136
Give it up for DJ Richter
on the ones and twos.

1020
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,639
Yo, DJ Richter, spin that.

1021
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,772
Welcome to Mayfield
Where the day feels long.

1022
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,316
We act strong But there's
got to be something wrong.

1023
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,444
See, we got hidden talents
You don't see hidden secrets.

1024
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:12,155
If we could show you those...

1025
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:19,454
If we could show you those...

1026
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:29,172
Then we wouldn't
have no regrets.

1027
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:36,304
Wanna know my secret?
Sit back and let me explain it.

1028
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,141
My Pop split, Momma got sick
Cliché, ain't it?

1029
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,810
Now I'm a manic Hispanic
I'm trying to make it work.

1030
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,229
But the doctors
think I'm lazy...

1031
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,572
And my roommate is a jerk.

1032
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,284
Dr. House is
in the house, y'all.

1033
01:14:57,368 --> 01:15:00,328
Give it up for Dr. House
to the stage, y'all.

1034
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,582
Paging Dr. House
to the stage, y'all.

1035
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:09,171
Are you there, Dr. House?
It's on, bring it on, on.

1036
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:12,674
Oh, yo, he's coming
to the stage, y'all.

1037
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:17,429
It's Dr. House on the remix
Dr. House on the remix.

1038
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,973
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

1039
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,851
They say to take their pills
They say don't be a creep.

1040
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,228
But how can I get better...

1041
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,024
If I can't get no sleep.

1042
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:33,195
You gotta think before you act
in order to progress.

1043
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:38,700
If you don't make connections
then your whole life is a mess.

1044
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,455
Yeah, so tell me, Doctor
what I really gotta know.

1045
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,540
How do I get better?

1046
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,084
Just do a talent show!

1047
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,672
Oh, well, I guess I'm just a mess, yes!
Preach it to me, brother.

1048
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,007
A life of restlessness.

1049
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,884
But at least
we have each other!

1050
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,094
We got each other!
We got each other!

1051
01:15:58,179 --> 01:15:59,804
Like two brothers
from another mother.

1052
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,515
Duck and run for cover Ward Six.

1053
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:14,486
How are you doing?
You hanging in there?

1054
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,239
Usually, I open with that.

1055
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,993
Thanks for staying.

1056
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,915
So, what do you
want to talk about?

1057
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,293
Things are actually...

1058
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,672
Actually good.

1059
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,924
You're not just saying that because
you don't want to complain

1060
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,885
in front of the guy
who just lost his father?

1061
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,345
I'm not that cured.

1062
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,682
I still got stuff to do,

1063
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,519
but I'm good.

1064
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,028
I'm sorry.

1065
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,296
I was trying to prove a point.

1066
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,508
I was trying to be right.

1067
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:23,138
I ended up putting you
in a dangerous situation,

1068
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:25,682
and I was not equipped
to handle it.

1069
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:29,019
And you got hurt,
and it's my fault.

1070
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,690
And I'm sorry.

1071
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,451
Med time.

1072
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:53,209
I'm going to try one of
those pink ones today. You?

1073
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,264
Thank you.

1074
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,266
You're welcome.

1075
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,486
Got a surprise.

1076
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:20,690
Today we're here
to congratulate Annie.

1077
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:26,738
We are proud of her, we wish
her well, and we hope to

1078
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,824
- never see her again.
- Never see her again.

1079
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,464
If you go silent
for over a decade,

1080
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,800
you don't just get to slide
right back into society.

1081
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:54,015
She's going to a rehab
facility first. In Arizona.

1082
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:59,103
Her family's moving there.

1083
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:04,984
I'm sorry, House.
I just found out myself.

1084
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,283
I want an overnight pass.

1085
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:18,957
I can help you with this.

1086
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,416
I've earned it.
You have, but...

1087
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,836
Isn't extending trust part of the
whole "getting me better" thing?

1088
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,214
If you insist on a pass,
I'll give it to you.

1089
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:30,009
But I know where you're going and I
know you haven't thought it through.

1090
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,638
We need to sit down
and talk about this.

1091
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,350
Please give me the pass.

1092
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,129
Hi.

1093
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:08,089
Hello. Who are you?

1094
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,591
I'm...

1095
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,344
Ben, go inside, okay?

1096
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,227
You didn't say anything.

1097
01:22:21,729 --> 01:22:25,940
And now Annie's leaving, and I
hear you're going to Arizona.

1098
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,777
My husband travels
to Phoenix a lot,

1099
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:32,196
his corporate
headquarters are there.

1100
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,781
We've been wanting
to move for years,

1101
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,367
but we've been tethered here.

1102
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:37,952
Now we're not.

1103
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,290
I don't want you to go.

1104
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,793
I don't want to go.

1105
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,965
But I can't break up my family.

1106
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,842
I can't leave my children.

1107
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:57,388
I just don't want it to change.

1108
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,812
I'm sorry that I didn't
come to say goodbye.

1109
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:10,526
I thought it ended
kind of perfect.

1110
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,786
I have to go.

1111
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:42,600
Not the most exciting use of the
overnight pass I've ever seen.

1112
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,060
She left.

1113
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:46,938
And

1114
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:49,607
I'm lost.

1115
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,914
I'm gonna write your letter,

1116
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,417
to the medical board,

1117
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,253
recommending that
they give your license back.

1118
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:14,549
You can't just console me by giving
me a lollipop when I skin my knee.

1119
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:15,883
Two things just happened.

1120
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,886
You got hurt, which means
you connected to someone else

1121
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,555
strongly enough to miss them.

1122
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,808
And more important,
you recognized the pain

1123
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:28,146
and came to talk to me, instead of
hiding from it in a Vicodin bottle.

1124
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,066
The fact that you're
hurting and you came here,

1125
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:35,653
the fact that you're taking your
meds, and we're talking right now.

1126
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,575
Come inside and get some sleep.

1127
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,619
Tomorrow, you can start
saying your goodbyes.

1128
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:53,671
Today we're here
to congratulate Greg.

1129
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:58,092
We are proud of him, we wish
him well, and we hope to

1130
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:01,012
- never see him again.
- Never see him again.

1131
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:02,805
House.

1132
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,572
Back off. People already
think we're gay.

1133
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,903
What do you need, Alvie?

1134
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,071
My meds.

1135
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,492
I want to get better.
