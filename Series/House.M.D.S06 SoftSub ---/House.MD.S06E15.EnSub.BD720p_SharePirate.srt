1
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,996
It's estimated
the observable universe

2
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,958
is 93 billion
light years across.

3
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,877
It's probably
more accurate to...

4
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,338
I'm gonna be so far away.

5
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,717
I don't care. I don't
wanna break up.

6
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,051
I'll come on the weekends.

7
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,345
Stanford's on the other
side of the country.

8
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,472
My dad has like 10 million
frequent flier miles.

9
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,349
He won't care.

10
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,110
We all right over there?

11
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,989
Yes, Mr. Damon, I just had
something caught in my throat.

12
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,073
Abby, you know
you're not supposed

13
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,742
to have any food
or drinks in here.

14
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,785
It's just water.
I have a cough,

15
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,996
I didn't want to
disturb anyone.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,874
We can only observe
4% of the universe.

17
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,500
The rest of it
is unaccounted for.

18
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,377
I never knew you were
such a good liar.

19
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,838
Well, a little more vodka and you
might find out some more things

20
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,256
you didn't know about me.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,674
Really?

22
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,967
Nicholas.

23
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,093
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:38,264
What conclusions can we draw from
the incredible number of stars?

25
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,933
That the movie's either gonna
be really good or really bad.

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,356
I was thinking more about the
implications for extraterrestrial life.

27
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,527
Well, I guess if there's an
infinite number of stars,

28
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,112
odds are there's
at least one galaxy

29
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,572
with life other than our own.

30
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,948
Or?

31
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,409
Or not?

32
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:02,330
Or our solar system
is somehow unique.

33
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,124
The question then
becomes, in what way?

34
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,212
The question then becomes, could you
possibly teach us anything more useless?

35
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,799
What're you looking at?

36
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,677
Abby?

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,890
Oh, my God. Something's wrong!
She's not breathing!

38
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,186
Call 911!

39
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:17,446
Would you mind at least putting a
napkin under your jelly toast?

40
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,324
Get a table and I won't
eat on the couch.

41
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,951
Yes, you will.

42
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,662
But I won't have a good excuse.

43
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,914
Why don't you go get a table?

44
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,791
It's not my condo.

45
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,334
You have my permission.

46
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,378
Pick out whatever you want.

47
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,297
Then it would be a
reflection of me, not you.

48
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,506
That wouldn't be right.

49
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,717
No, it would be a
reflection of the fact

50
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,552
that the guy who's been
mooching off of me

51
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,887
for as long as I can remember

52
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,097
isn't a complete ingrate.

53
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,603
You've never furnished a home.

54
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,063
I have furnished
a bunch of homes.

55
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,899
No, you've married
a bunch of women

56
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,150
who've furnished
a bunch of homes.

57
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,568
You want to eat off
something, fine,

58
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,237
move your piano in here
and eat off that.

59
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,615
You're afraid.

60
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,199
Of a dining table?

61
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,410
You know, they don't
actually come to life

62
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,913
when you put a knob
off your bedpost on them.

63
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,998
You are what you sit in.

64
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,752
Your friends, your job, your
furnishings, it all defines you.

65
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,036
You don't really believe that.

66
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,256
You just don't want
to do the shopping.

67
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,008
Buy some furniture

68
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,136
or admit that
you're empty inside.

69
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,933
Hmm.

70
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,607
X-rays confirm the fluid that
almost suffocated her to death

71
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,942
was from pulmonary edema.

72
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,235
Means the problem is either
in her heart or lungs.

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,488
Tox screen's clean for
everything except the alcohol,

74
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,573
and her BAC was barely .05.

75
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,117
Means she only had
one or two drinks, tops.

76
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,536
And there's no sign of trauma.

77
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,288
How did you know?

78
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,790
Because if there was,

79
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,541
Cuddy wouldn't have needed
me to take the case.

80
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,627
How'd you know Cuddy... Foreman's
the only one with the balls

81
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,337
to take a case without
checking with me

82
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,049
and he's still working on
breakfast, which means that

83
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,846
the 18, no, 17-year-old
honor student...

84
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,475
Cuddy has a soft spot
for smart girls,

85
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,935
and they don't start drinking

86
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,354
until second semester
senior year.

87
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,148
So, either you think that smart
women look out for each other,

88
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,354
which means you're an idiot,

89
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,027
or you think Cuddy's not
smart, which means...

90
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,821
Well, I guess it's
the same both ways.

91
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,863
Then how did you...

92
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,108
Picture fell out of the file.

93
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,658
She looks smart.

94
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,909
Where's Taub?

95
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,160
You don't already know?

96
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,371
Yeah, he's at home
in a fight with his wife.

97
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,998
I'm just curious what
he wanted me to know.

98
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,750
His car has a flat tire.
He's waiting for a tow truck.

99
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,378
What about rising blood
pressure from binge drinking?

100
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,839
It could set off a hypertensive
crisis, cause heart failure.

101
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,507
Two drinks is hardly a binge.

102
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,509
Certainly not if
you're an Aussie,

103
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,052
but when
an American school girl

104
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,554
has two drinks
before 10:00 a.m.,

105
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,223
it's a pretty sure bet that the
plan is to have a lot more.

106
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,017
It probably wasn't the first
time she had that plan.

107
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,977
We'll get a C-13 pyruvate MRI

108
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,104
to check for cardiac
lactic-acid levels.

109
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,647
Someone call Taub.

110
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,358
Tell him to cut the ball
and chain on his own time.

111
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,777
We're arguing
about couples yoga.

112
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,071
No. We're arguing over the fact

113
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,073
that we don't ever do
anything together anymore.

114
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,992
We don't ever do
anything together?

115
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,202
Chris, I love you, but I swear,
if you start talking to me

116
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,496
like I'm on the witness stand
again, I'm gonna break your neck.

117
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,373
Honey, we do stuff
together all the time.

118
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,375
Really? Like what?

119
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,087
And besides sleeping, watching
TV, going out to dinner,

120
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,923
what do we do together,
just the two of us?

121
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,175
We...

122
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,971
You don't like
going out to dinner?

123
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,557
All right, I'll do the yoga.

124
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,725
Forget it.

125
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,810
Now you don't want me to do it?

126
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,812
Just go to work. No.

127
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,565
I'm not leaving
until we work this out.

128
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,152
I'm fine. Please, just go.

129
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,594
Where's Abby Nash?

130
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm Nick, her boyfriend.
This is my dad.

131
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,640
Hi.

132
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,766
You can wait in...

133
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,142
Where is she?

134
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,727
Is she okay?

135
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,517
She's having some tests run.

136
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,398
Is she okay?

137
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,404
We think her drinking
may have damaged her heart.

138
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,864
Her heart?

139
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,451
No. She doesn't drink.
Not that much.

140
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:33,744
Just when she's at school?

141
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,329
Nick, what's he talking about?

142
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,582
It was a field trip. One
of the kids had a fake ID.

143
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,209
But, Dad, you know Abby.
Tell him.

144
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,545
I know what she's like when the
two of you are around me, but...

145
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,756
If you're right, the tests
will come back negative.

146
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,008
Can you give her a message?

147
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,720
I brought her homework.
And I love her.

148
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,654
Sorry I'm late.

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,866
Nick loves you.

150
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,662
House doesn't believe
you got a flat tire.

151
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,986
What does he think I was doing?

152
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,081
Fighting with the wife.

153
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,333
Why would I lie about that?

154
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,546
She wants me to do yoga.

155
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,010
We need thinner cuts.

156
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,972
When you and Cameron
had disagreements...

157
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,809
I'm probably not the best guy
to go to for marital advice.

158
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,269
Sorry.

159
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,281
It's just... What's that
in the mitral valve?

160
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,857
All right, I get the message.

161
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,151
No. No, I'm serious.

162
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,778
What is that?

163
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,834
Could be a fungus.

164
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,878
ER drew blood cultures.
All negative.

165
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,296
No parasites, no fungus.

166
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,423
Could be fastidious
enteric bacteria.

167
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,676
You think she's been eating
your wife's cooking?

168
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,596
Hey, I'm on your side, man.

169
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,932
I am not fighting with my wife.
I had a flat tire.

170
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,142
It's in my trunk. You can
go look at it if you want.

171
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,229
Don't need to. Face tells
me you're bluffing.

172
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,773
Not yours, Chase's.

173
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,150
If she was infected through
the intestinal tract,

174
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,526
she'd have intestinal symptoms.

175
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,987
There are other ways to get enteric
bacteria into the bloodstream.

176
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,531
She's not an intravenous
drug user, she has no tattoos,

177
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,776
and she doesn't have any scars

178
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,784
that would indicate
she's a cutter.

179
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,578
Transesophageal echo could give us a
better idea of what we're looking at.

180
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,163
If that valve is
about to dehisce,

181
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,165
echo could trigger
a heart attack.

182
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,042
So come up with a better idea,

183
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,169
or have a crash cart ready.

184
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,842
Why are you lying to House?

185
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,455
Chase told me.
What's the big deal?

186
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,472
Maybe we can talk about this
another time. Or never.

187
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,724
I really don't think
she's gonna tell anyone.

188
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,601
If I admit we were fighting,

189
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,144
he's gonna want
to know what about.

190
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,772
So tell him, or tell him
it's none of his business.

191
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,190
This is easier. Really?

192
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,693
Because it seems much harder.

193
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,486
What do I know? I'm not a guy.

194
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,530
Yes, if only I could be as open

195
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,865
about my emotional
life as you are.

196
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,368
It's not about the yoga.

197
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,133
Really? I thought it was, since we
spent an hour talking about yoga,

198
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,664
but what do I know?
I'm not a girl.

199
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,916
My guess is she thinks you don't
want to spend time with her

200
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,127
because you're spending it
with someone else.

201
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,921
If she thinks I'm
cheating, she would ask.

202
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,132
Because you'd tell the truth?

203
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,508
I'm not seeing anyone else.

204
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,176
Doesn't matter.
You have a history.

205
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,594
And that's not her fault.

206
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,723
So what am I supposed to do?
I can't prove a negative.

207
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,891
That is a problem.

208
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,729
There's the heart.

209
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,066
Valves look fine. No vegetations.
No myxomatous changes.

210
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,862
Can you give her
a little more sedative?

211
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,241
She's dissecting.
She's rupturing.

212
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,451
Get the scope out.

213
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,496
This doesn't make sense.
Her BP's normal,

214
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,664
and her heart rate
was controlled.

215
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,915
We'll figure it out later.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,501
We've only got about 30
seconds to get her open.

217
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,255
No leakage from
the cannulation site.

218
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,423
Nice.

219
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,175
Let's see if she'll start up.

220
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,093
Cardiac paddles.

221
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,929
Charging.

222
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,265
And go.

223
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,933
Come on.

224
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,894
Again. Go.

225
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,230
Pushing five cc's adrenaline.

226
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,361
Zap her again. No.

227
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,203
It's not working. Clear.

228
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,872
Clear.

229
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,293
Normal sinus rhythm.

230
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,129
Thank God.

231
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,395
TEE and intra-operative
visualization

232
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,688
showed no vegetations
on the valves,

233
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,399
no structural abnormalities.

234
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,067
The dissection means
we were wrong

235
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,403
about alcohol causing
a hypertensive crisis.

236
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,405
And by "we" you
mean "you." Yeah.

237
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,449
You were the one who didn't
have any better ideas.

238
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,576
It's not my fault. I was
busy trying to judge Taub.

239
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,829
Since we already
ruled out trauma,

240
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,372
the dissection's
probably a genetic defect.

241
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,457
We're running the tests.
She's not marfanoid.

242
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,167
What about an allergy?

243
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,421
A severe enough one could set
off a systemic immune reaction,

244
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,590
cause fluid in the lungs and inflammation
that could weaken the aorta.

245
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,593
If it was an allergy, she'd be getting
better in the hospital, not worse.

246
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,679
Unless it was inside her.

247
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,724
Meaning?

248
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,060
You want my sperm?

249
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,981
We think a severe allergic reaction
could be causing a systemic breakdown.

250
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,607
To my son's sperm?

251
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,986
Actually, his semen is
more likely the problem,

252
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,321
which I realize is not
what you were reacting to.

253
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,950
When's the last time the two
of you had unprotected sex?

254
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,786
Never. I use a condom.

255
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,873
You always use a condom?
For everything?

256
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,043
Well, for most everything.

257
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,253
When?

258
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,714
The night before she collapsed.

259
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,635
I'm placing a drop of Nick's
semen protein onto the skin.

260
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,220
Then I'll abrade it
with a needle,

261
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,973
check for a rash
in an hour or so.

262
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,104
Mom, come on, we've been
dating for three years.

263
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:38,108
I'm not mad, sweetheart.
I'm just confused.

264
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,528
A systemic reaction can be
triggered by the protein in semen.

265
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:45,032
In most cases, the
reaction is fairly minor,

266
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,242
but in rare cases,
repeat exposure

267
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,870
can trigger a
hypersensitivity response.

268
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,080
"Repeat exposure"?

269
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,791
I know, I know, three years.

270
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,586
Is this supposed to hurt?

271
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,861
A reaction should
take longer than...

272
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,173
No, it's not that. Ow.

273
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,299
Abby, what's wrong?

274
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,675
My stomach.

275
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,847
Blood in the urine.

276
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,519
Help me!

277
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,145
No allergic reaction.

278
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,606
On the other hand, now
her kidneys are failing.

279
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,316
Could be some
kind of neuropathy.

280
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,527
Syphilitic lightning pains?

281
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,362
It's not syphilis.

282
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,532
VDRL and enzyme
immunoassays were negative.

283
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,616
What about a blood clot?

284
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,867
While she's on anticoagulants

285
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,202
for the aortic surgery?

286
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,453
Interstitial nephritis?

287
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,289
Wouldn't cause the
edema or dissection.

288
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,208
But cancer could.

289
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,710
Would you care to be a
little bit more specific?

290
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,754
If I could, I would've.

291
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,799
We could do a full body scan.

292
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,927
We hate full body scans.

293
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,971
And by "we" you mean "you."

294
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,764
We also hate when
a patient dies

295
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,141
before we figure out
what's wrong with them.

296
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,521
Do the scan.

297
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,234
How can you convince someone
you're not cheating on them?

298
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,945
Don't cheat. After a
while, they'll catch on.

299
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,655
What if I don't want
to wait that long?

300
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,658
Take them with you wherever
you go for 24 hours a day.

301
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,911
So your wife's a little insecure.
Is that so bad?

302
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,580
At least you know
she still cares.

303
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:19,042
I know she cares. What I
want is for her to be happy.

304
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,716
What? You don't think I
want my wife to be happy?

305
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,510
Sure. As long as
it makes you happy.

306
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,210
What do you think?

307
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,672
I think you work quickly.

308
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,760
Piece of cake. You give them
money, they give you furniture.

309
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,386
Not bad, huh?

310
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,265
Nope, it's not bad at all.

311
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,320
It's taking a really long time.

312
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,864
Just hang in there, and try not to
talk unless you really have to.

313
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,075
It can affect the images.

314
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,412
What was that? Hello,
are you still there?

315
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,626
I think there's something
wrong with the machine.

316
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,961
- It's not the machine.
- It's an earthquake.

317
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,127
Hold on, we'll get you out.

318
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,090
Get me out now.

319
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,881
Oh, my God! I can't hold on!

320
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,811
It's a black hole.

321
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,146
She's hallucinating.

322
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,064
I certainly hope so.

323
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,407
Hallucination
means brain problem.

324
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,201
Brain problems don't
split your aorta.

325
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,037
A vascular problem
could explain both.

326
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,998
Inflammation in
the blood vessel walls

327
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,916
leads to dissection
in the aorta

328
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,835
and could cause an
aneurysm in the brain

329
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,545
that could cause the visions.

330
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,046
It's a bit convoluted,

331
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,340
but brain and heart function
are susceptible, too.

332
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,968
If there was any sign of the
inflammation of the aorta,

333
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,179
that would make sense.

334
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,637
House! That's not funny.

335
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,055
I've got enough
problems already!

336
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,432
Trust me, this is gonna help.

337
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,726
An aneurysm explains
the hallucinations,

338
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,230
and it's the one thing we haven't
excluded from the differential.

339
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,607
Your texting does not
prove you're faithful.

340
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,360
It just proves you know she
thinks you're unfaithful.

341
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,197
You can't force trust.
What did she hallucinate?

342
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,158
The content of the
hallucination isn't relevant.

343
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,201
Not usually.

344
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,285
Not ever.

345
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,831
We know nothing,
brain knows all.

346
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,415
You get an ulcer,
you don't know it,

347
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,876
but the brain increases
mucin secretions.

348
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,121
It knows what the problem is,

349
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,504
it knows where the problem is.

350
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,173
It's a big logical jump
from a body's immune response

351
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,634
to the brain giving
subconscious diagnostic clues.

352
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,011
What about dreaming about
waterfalls, running streams

353
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,179
if you need to go
to the bathroom?

354
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,144
Sure. That's the same as the brain
shouting, "You have pancreatic cancer."

355
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,227
Her subconscious is trying
to tell her something.

356
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,312
We need to eavesdrop.

357
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,232
She was screaming she was being
sucked into a black hole.

358
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,526
So we should look for
a tumor in her anus.

359
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,820
We need the whole story.

360
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,239
A cognitive pattern
recognition program

361
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,575
might tell us what's
going on in her head.

362
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,537
Or we could act on something

363
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,747
based in science,
not science fiction.

364
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,834
Get an MRA with contrast to
see if she has an aneurysm.

365
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,712
Unless you think Cuddy's gonna
go for the mind reading.

366
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,130
Fine. Do the MRA.

367
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,335
When it comes back negative,

368
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,886
we can move on to the
crazy, but possible, ideas.

369
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,260
What did you do
with the furniture?

370
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,845
I returned it.

371
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,514
You told me to buy it.

372
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,351
But you didn't buy it.
You rented it.

373
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,105
You made one phone call
to Economy Furniture Supply.

374
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,775
"We get it done,
so you don't have to."

375
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,319
So what?
We had a table, chairs...

376
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,446
But no clue what
any of it meant.

377
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,074
Fine. I'll hire a decorator.

378
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,785
Perfect. Another woman
to tell you who you are.

379
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,453
I'll hire a male decorator.

380
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,040
Step inside one furniture store
and find one thing you like.

381
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,042
I like not doing this.

382
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,086
One.

383
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,469
Abby.

384
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,726
Hi.

385
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,354
Where's my mom?

386
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,732
She went down to get
some breakfast.

387
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,151
How are you feeling?

388
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:05,073
Well, besides the fact that I can
barely breathe and I ache all over,

389
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,408
not good.

390
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,911
Anything I can do?

391
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,747
Just don't go.

392
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,542
I'm not going anywhere.

393
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:33,101
Been a while since we've gone more
than a day without doing that.

394
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,769
I'm not going anywhere.

395
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,440
What'd you say?

396
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,027
I've been thinking...

397
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,904
Been a long time since we went more
than a day without doing that.

398
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,460
We have a secret.

399
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,506
Now, you don't need
to answer right now,

400
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,638
but, Abby, I want to marry you.

401
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,811
Tell him the secret. It's okay.

402
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,316
Something's wrong.

403
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,902
What? Abby, what
are you feeling?

404
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,986
I don't know.

405
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,404
Your secret is killing you.

406
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,824
I see... Maybe it's
all the medication.

407
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,826
I was just...

408
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,374
Abby, can you hear me?

409
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,667
You deserve to die.

410
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,881
I need four milligrams
lorazepam.

411
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,602
She seized for over a minute.

412
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,022
Inner-ictal EEG showed
no synchronous discharges.

413
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,108
And the MRA?

414
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,694
No aneurysms or arterial or venous
malformations in the brain.

415
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,363
As predicted.

416
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,865
What did we say
we'd move on to?

417
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,784
Out of body experiences
can be induced

418
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,953
by sensory overload in the
temporoparietal junction.

419
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,497
Temporoparietal junction
was clean on MRI,

420
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,207
MRA, and whole body scan.

421
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,293
Which just leaves us
with the question of

422
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,463
what happened during the
out of body experience?

423
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:29,134
If I say her blood pressure shot up
over 200 and she bit her tongue,

424
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,969
would that be
a satisfactory answer?

425
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,805
Sure. If you then went on
to answer the following,

426
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,641
did she float above her body?
Did she see Jesus?

427
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,143
Did she bathe in the Ganges?

428
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,563
No, no and no. Can we get
back to the medical science?

429
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,814
No.

430
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,566
She claims she emerged
from her body

431
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,110
as a younger version of
herself and started talking.

432
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,820
She couldn't remember
what was discussed.

433
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,822
But I'm sure
it wasn't a differential.

434
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,949
House, cognitive
pattern recognition

435
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,660
is 50 years from being
a useful diagnostic tool.

436
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,624
Even if we can get the equipment, it
takes hours for the initial mapping.

437
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,707
If she has another seizure,
she could stroke out.

438
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,918
Coincidentally, she could also
have a stroke if we do nothing.

439
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,087
I'm not telling a mother
who's scared out of her mind

440
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,922
that our best shot
is a magic trick.

441
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,300
It's not magical,
it's experimental.

442
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,219
Just like washing your hands
after pooping once was.

443
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,263
And technically,
it's not our best shot.

444
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,265
I'm pretty sure
it's our only shot.

445
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,896
Perfect. So, Foreman,
go get her consent.

446
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,273
The rest of you, go down
to the cog-sci lab.

447
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,317
The equipment
should already be there.

448
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,037
I'll catch up.

449
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,085
Thanks for the invite.

450
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,004
I am not sure I'm up
for the hospital food.

451
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,007
Good, 'cause I wasn't
planning on lunch.

452
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,135
While you watch video clips,

453
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,597
a computer maps how your
brain processes the images.

454
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,307
How long will it take?

455
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,101
Six hours. But that's
really just the prep.

456
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,979
Once the computer maps how she
processes the information,

457
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,940
we'll put her under
twilight sedation,

458
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,068
use the same equipment to monitor
her unconscious thoughts.

459
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,320
Hopefully, it'll spit
out a very basic video

460
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,155
of whatever's
going on in her head.

461
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,032
And what will that tell you?

462
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,742
Hopefully, it'll give us a clue

463
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,994
as to where your brain
thinks the problem is.

464
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,704
A lot of "hopefullys."

465
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,498
Could it hurt her?

466
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,376
We're at a diagnostic dead end.

467
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,044
We've got to try something.

468
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,930
This is much better than lunch.

469
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,390
I agree.

470
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,104
What made you think of this?

471
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,563
I missed you.

472
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:52,735
No, I mean this. The car
in the parking lot.

473
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:54,904
I just don't like feeling like

474
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,909
maybe this isn't the first
time you've done this.

475
00:26:56,991 --> 00:27:00,827
It's the first. I love you.
You know that, right?

476
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,036
Yes.

477
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,334
I want you to be
able to trust me.

478
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,295
And I want to, but...

479
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,763
Inspiration Point doesn't
open till after dark.

480
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,267
Got a real cool magic
show about to start.

481
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,980
Also, I'm gonna need
to check your spare.

482
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,717
Abby, can you think
of something specific?

483
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,885
Like what?

484
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,471
Doesn't matter. Just
make it a single image.

485
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,115
What are you thinking?

486
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,950
About Nick playing baseball.

487
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,577
Holy crap.

488
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,703
That's amazing.

489
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:26,788
Yeah.

490
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,499
Now all we have to do
is read her subconscious

491
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,461
and hope that it's completely
rational and went to med school.

492
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,840
Does anything get you excited?

493
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,226
Can I help you with something?

494
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,394
Yes.

495
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,254
I was wondering if
you could tell me

496
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,440
a little bit about
this dining table.

497
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,235
It's made of wood
and you eat off it.

498
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,320
So you're paid by commission?

499
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,405
It's furniture.

500
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,658
Find something you like,
let me know, I'll ring it up.

501
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,077
Thank you so much.

502
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,234
Okay, that's... That's not...

503
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,118
That is a remarkable collection,
if I can show it to you.

504
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,744
I'm Gabriella.

505
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,957
I'm really just looking for
a nice dining room table.

506
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,460
I see. You're daring.

507
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,129
Yes, I do that sometimes.

508
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,966
But right now, why am I daring?

509
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,302
You're not
constrained by rules.

510
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,263
What else attracts you
in the patio section?

511
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,725
Wait. This is a patio table?
For outside?

512
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,661
Well, it's taken us
just over an hour

513
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,915
to prove that she has a
very boring subconscious.

514
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,709
Anyone ever tell you you
can be a real buzzkill?

515
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,127
Yes.

516
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,758
Stars. Maybe that's a stripe.

517
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,552
It's the sky.

518
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,348
She's thinking about the moon
and the stars in the sky.

519
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,683
She's going to Stanford
to study physics.

520
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,102
It's not a big revelation that
she'd think about the sky.

521
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:59,106
Or a star could be a white blood cell.
Leukemia?

522
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,405
Who's that?

523
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,033
Her dad? He died
when she was eight.

524
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,993
What did Daddy die of?

525
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,538
Private plane crash.
No connection.

526
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:18,709
Stars, moon, sky, white
blood cells, heart valves,

527
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,378
black holes, or anus,

528
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,130
or a million other circular
passageways into the body,

529
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,132
and her dad.

530
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,385
What do you think it means?

531
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,638
She likes school and
she has daddy issues.

532
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,474
Neither of which helps us.

533
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,481
So now what do we do?
Start over?

534
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,983
We obviously missed something.

535
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,818
What about the liver?

536
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,653
What about her left toe?

537
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,904
Oh, sorry,

538
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,823
I thought we were randomly
picking out body parts

539
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,741
that had nothing to
do with her symptoms.

540
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,910
Liver's responsible
for proteins,

541
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,580
immunological effects,
production of red blood cells.

542
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,874
Might be able to explains the
lungs, the hallucinations...

543
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,127
Not the aortic dissection.

544
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,337
Her kidneys are also failing.

545
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,924
Polycystic disease could
explain the dissection.

546
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,843
So, that's one imperfect theory

547
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,345
plus a rare complication
of a second theory,

548
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,098
which gives us a
complete explanation.

549
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,269
Don't polish
the notion, Foreman.

550
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,063
Pineal gland is calcified.

551
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,108
It's supposed to be calcified.
Happens after puberty.

552
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,694
What if it's obscuring a tumor?

553
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,697
It's the only place we
couldn't look inside.

554
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,282
Get a better look
at her pineal gland

555
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,201
with three Tesla
fast-spin echo MRI.

556
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,794
You're pacing my office 'cause
you're buying furniture?

557
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,421
No. I'm pacing your office

558
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,424
because I'm physically
incapable of buying furniture.

559
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,468
For Amber's old place?

560
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,554
Yeah. It needs some new...

561
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,264
I know you bought
the place I wanted.

562
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,225
You're a jerk, let's move on.
Hire a decorator.

563
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,936
I'm supposed to find me.

564
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,105
Backpack through Europe.

565
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,857
I know it's hard to believe,

566
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,067
but you know
what says even more

567
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,319
about who you are
than your furniture?

568
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,029
The fact that
you are letting House

569
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,490
tell you how to buy furniture.

570
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,742
Call Beatrice.

571
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,383
MRI revealed no remarkable
features on her pineal gland,

572
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,009
but there were
slightly elevated levels

573
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,887
of lactate dehydrogenase
isoenzymes.

574
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,347
Which we would expect to see

575
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,474
if there was an allergic
reaction happening.

576
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,851
There's definitely no allergy.

577
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,647
Parasite? There's this
Middle Eastern parasite...

578
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,441
How exactly do you
want to be shot down?

579
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,235
On the basis of the fact
that she's never

580
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,278
been within 6,000 miles
of the Middle East.

581
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,197
Or on the basis of the fact
that all our scans

582
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,242
and urine samples
came back clean.

583
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:01,122
And yet she's still failing.
System after system.

584
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,087
So, either we find
the answer at autopsy or...

585
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:13,801
What?

586
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,056
I got nothing.

587
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:01,182
I was gonna head out. If there's any
change, I assume you'll page me.

588
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,185
Are you having an affair?

589
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,440
Does it bother you that your
wife doesn't have the guts

590
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,942
to actually ask
that question and I do?

591
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,694
On both ends, yes.

592
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,280
Difference is, I'm not
afraid of the answer.

593
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,240
And I might believe you.

594
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,450
I'm not having an affair.

595
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,659
But you want to.

596
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,286
No, I don't.

597
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,121
I'm through living like that.

598
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,748
Why?

599
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,916
What, you finally
got to the point

600
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,626
where half your age plus seven

601
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,753
just isn't young enough?

602
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,338
Talk to you later, House.

603
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:36,217
Or is it because you now really
are old enough to be their...

604
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,347
The dad.

605
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,892
Does he travel for work?

606
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,188
What do you mean, does he?
He died almost 10 years ago.

607
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,358
Not hers. Her boyfriend's.

608
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,737
He's the one in her visions.

609
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,245
I'm your son's
girlfriend's doctor.

610
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,412
Oh!

611
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,583
It's a mouthful, but probably
not as tricky as your title.

612
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,961
Okay. Is Abby
gonna be all right?

613
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,504
Do you travel a lot?

614
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,589
Yeah, I have a food
import business. Why?

615
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,091
Where do you go?

616
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,219
All over. France, Italy,
the Mediterranean? Why?

617
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,639
I think you exposed her
to a parasite.

618
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,099
Oh!

619
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,685
I thought the scans
didn't show any.

620
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,687
Because she doesn't have any.

621
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,564
But you just said... It's cool.

622
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:36,026
My theory is that her body was
able to kill off the parasite,

623
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,572
but what it couldn't do
was get rid of the shell,

624
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,949
which doesn't
show up on the scans.

625
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,952
That little piece of
microscopic garbage

626
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:49,290
set off an allergic reaction
called Cerebellar Schistosomiasis

627
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:54,378
delayed Hypersensitivity
Allergy or "CSDHA."

628
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,048
Risky, unpleasant treatment,
but completely curable.

629
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,425
Well, that's fantastic.

630
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,845
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
Only thing is,

631
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,223
did you ever have sex with
your son's girlfriend?

632
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,894
Where the hell
do you get off...

633
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,645
Shut up.

634
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:16,525
See, I can't treat this
unless I can confirm it.

635
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,943
The only way she could
have been exposed

636
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,653
to this parasite is sexually,

637
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,447
which means she's
gonna die very soon

638
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,132
unless you admit
that you slept with her.

639
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,747
Dad. What's going on?

640
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,248
Gee, this is bad,

641
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,625
because you now have
to choose between

642
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,003
her living and the
truth becoming public,

643
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:40,007
and frankly, given what the
truth is, it's a tough call.

644
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,431
You'd broken up.
She was crying...

645
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,184
Your girlfriend is not
allergic to your semen.

646
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,269
She's allergic to
the Egyptian parasites

647
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,939
swimming around
in your dad's semen.

648
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,402
You slept with Abby?

649
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,780
I was drunk. We both...

650
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,950
No need to explain.
Technically, she was legal.

651
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,621
Wait, wait! Wait!

652
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:16,919
Hey, all things considered,
it's actually great news.

653
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,061
So, what do you think?

654
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,939
You wussed out
and used a decorator.

655
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,150
Why can't that be me?
A wuss who loves decorators.

656
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,276
Because it's not.

657
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,778
Okay, it's not.

658
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,781
But don't return it.
I can't keep doing this.

659
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:50,077
You have to. You can't keep
letting other people define you.

660
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,165
Not another elephant.

661
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,767
The decorator didn't pick this.

662
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,562
You're gonna have
to buy your own cape.

663
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,504
I like what this says
about you, Wilson.

664
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,127
Wait, I don't remember him
at the wedding, do you?

665
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,213
I don't remember most of the
people who were at our wedding.

666
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,426
Which is why

667
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,557
I thought I'd ask the love
of my life to marry me.

668
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,270
We're already married.

669
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,398
I want to be better at it.

670
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,487
Well, that's beautiful.

671
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,893
What did you tell him?

672
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,312
That it doesn't mean
she doesn't love him.

673
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,273
And he bought it?

674
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,859
It's true.

675
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,948
Your wife say yes?

676
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,534
How did you know...

677
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,453
Monkey see, monkey do.

678
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,290
At least he has the
"young and stupid" excuse.

679
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,917
She said yes.

680
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,463
Good for you.

681
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,258
Thank you.
