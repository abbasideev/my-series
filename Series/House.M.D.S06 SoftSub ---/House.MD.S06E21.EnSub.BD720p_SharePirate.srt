1
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,120
A crane collapsed
in downtown Trenton.

2
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,579
Don't care.

3
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,627
My great-grandfather.

4
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,504
No, it's just a book he wrote.

5
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,257
Open it up.

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,471
Seriously? You're
giving this to us?

7
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,973
It's a big step you're taking.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,850
I wanted to congratulate you.

9
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,852
I understand that's
the adult thing to do.

10
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,395
How did you know?

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,063
I've known for a while.

12
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:08,151
The fact that you decided to
cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler.

13
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,528
Unless my intel is wrong.

14
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,156
Trouble in paradise?

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,907
We have to get to Trenton.

16
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,077
Somebody, help me.

17
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,336
Can you hear me?

18
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,587
Hmm.

19
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,673
Did that sound like a "yes"?

20
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,676
Sir, we have to get you to the OR.
You have a bad wound,

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,387
but we're gonna pack it and
transport you as fast as we can.

22
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,017
Skull fracture. Glasgow Coma score of 11.
She's immediate.

23
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,271
Move on. This guy's dead.

24
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,355
His wounds aren't so...

25
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,232
Forget the wound,
look at his toes.

26
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,694
Atherosclerotic emboli. He'll
never survive the surgery.

27
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,279
Maybe his shoes were too tight.

28
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,198
It's not the shoes,
skin shows smoker's facies.

29
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,604
He's not gonna
make it to morning.

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,057
He'll just take up
an ambulance ride,

31
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,452
surgeons' time and an ICU bed.

32
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,125
He's expectant. Leave him.

33
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,712
I only nodded off for a second.

34
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,381
I lost control of the load.
I'm so sorry.

35
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,049
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you out of here.

36
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,634
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,886
- He's secure.
- Ready?

38
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,345
Three, two, one.

39
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,519
Crane operator. He made it
through amazingly well.

40
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,564
Lucid and responsive, stable
fracture, right humerus.

41
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,316
Haven't gotten to
his lower half yet.

42
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,985
Tell me when something hurts.

43
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,613
I fell asleep,
killed all those people.

44
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,740
Something other
than your conscience.

45
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,409
Is that a pill in your pocket

46
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,871
or are you just happy to have
a tiny, pill-shaped penis?

47
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,999
Caffeine pills.

48
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,126
You fell asleep taking these?

49
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,836
I drank two cups
of coffee, too.

50
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,254
Is that normal for you?

51
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,339
No, I hate coffee.

52
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,841
I'm working on no sleep.
My daughter has the flu.

53
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,927
This much caffeine
for a coffee virgin...

54
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,846
There's no way he fell asleep.
He passed out.

55
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,140
Which means
a neurological disorder

56
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,850
caused the crash, not fatigue.

57
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,436
Hey!

58
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,356
We're taking the crane
operator back to Princeton.

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,316
They said he was barely
hurt, he can wait.

60
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,234
Steal an ambulance
and call the team.

61
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,400
Tell them we've got a case.

62
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,197
House, no. I need you here.

63
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,908
But he needs me there, and
he moans louder than you do.

64
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,712
There were over 100
people in that building,

65
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,411
only 76 have
been accounted for.

66
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,331
Foreman and your team can handle
the crane operator for now.

67
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,479
Having fun down there?

68
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,563
Lots!

69
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,400
Every time Cuddy
leans over a patient,

70
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,903
it's another opportunity
for a downblouse nipslip.

71
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,280
What's going on
between her and Lucas?

72
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,699
Besides them
moving in together?

73
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,950
That's not enough for you?

74
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,036
I gave her the
housewarming gift earlier,

75
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,747
and she paused
for a split second,

76
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,624
like she was hiding something.

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,377
It's probably her moral revulsion
at housewarming gifts.

78
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,379
Or maybe she didn't
want to accept a gift

79
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,047
for something she
wasn't gonna do.

80
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,634
You actually think they're
not moving in together?

81
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,970
What was that? You okay?

82
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,096
Yeah.

83
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,932
Vending machine collapsed.

84
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,852
She still using your
ex-wife as her realtor?

85
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,145
As far as I know.

86
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,773
Well, know a little farther, will you?
Look into it.

87
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,975
Hey!

88
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,769
Somebody down here!

89
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,818
If you can hear me, tap
three times or call out.

90
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,865
Is anyone there?

91
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,702
I'm not getting anything.

92
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,997
I heard something. There's
got to be a void down there.

93
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,374
There's a million voids down
there, it was the parking garage.

94
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,918
But our equipment hasn't
picked up any movement,

95
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,282
dogs haven't
picked up any scent.

96
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,462
There's smashed
cars down there,

97
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,255
you don't think that gasoline
could throw off their scent?

98
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,132
We gotta get back
to work, okay?

99
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,802
We'll get to this area soon.
Excuse me.

100
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,152
Anybody hear me?

101
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,616
Hey! Can anybody hear me?

102
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,347
Help me.

103
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,900
What's your name?

104
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,864
Please...

105
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,532
My husband's gift...

106
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,495
I was supposed to pick it up
at the framers. It's on Elm.

107
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,819
You should have
told me earlier,

108
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,915
I could've picked
it up on the way.

109
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,166
What's your name?

110
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,003
It's a picture from our Tortola
trip for his birthday.

111
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,372
I'm not asking your name because
I wanna become friends.

112
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,174
I'm trying to gauge
your mental state.

113
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,511
Hanna.

114
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,681
Okay, that's a start. What
day of the week is it?

115
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,848
Tuesday.

116
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,975
Better still.

117
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,894
What happened?

118
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,481
You know that giant
construction crane next door?

119
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,275
It's kind of on top
of you right now.

120
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,487
Okay, I'm gonna
try to pull you out.

121
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,740
Ow! My leg!

122
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,579
Okay. Okay.

123
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,458
I really need to get help.

124
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,835
No. Stay.

125
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,586
Someone else will come.

126
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,921
No one knows I'm down here.

127
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,215
Please! Stay with me!

128
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,634
Don't leave me in the dark!

129
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,386
I'll be right back.

130
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,054
No! Don't leave me in the dark!

131
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,390
Please stay!

132
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,271
He's still in the ER, House.

133
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,772
We haven't had time
to start a differential.

134
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,942
Perfect, we'll start right now.
Put me on speaker.

135
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,904
What causes syncope?

136
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,324
Your guy's stable. The two
dozen other patients...

137
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,616
Don't need to be diagnosed,

138
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,368
they just need to be bandaged.

139
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,245
What causes syncope?

140
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,497
Vasovagal reaction.

141
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,207
Meningioma,
sick sinus syndrome...

142
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,918
Or you're wrong
and he just fell asleep.

143
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,545
How's he gonna sleep
with 50 cups of coffee

144
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,713
going through his veins?

145
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,118
Were you never
a medical resident?

146
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,384
I hear Ten, Eleven and Twelve.
Where's Thirteen?

147
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,552
She's not here.

148
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,678
And answer to your
next question is,

149
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,884
"I don't know where she is."

150
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,681
Do you have the answer
to my question after that?

151
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,559
A space-occupying lesion in
his brain is most likely.

152
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,186
MRI will prove I'm right.

153
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,022
Or it'll just prove he suffered
head trauma from the crash.

154
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,440
Which we'd want to find anyway.

155
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,984
Two birds with one scan. Do it.

156
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,029
Having trouble finding
a vein for Hanna's IV.

157
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,947
Is she getting weaker? Paler?

158
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,074
No, no, she's stable.

159
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,369
That means her blood loss is minimal.
It buys us some time.

160
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,870
Get the IV into her tibia.

161
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,790
It's almost hollow, feeds
into the venous system.

162
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,045
Which they, obviously, don't
teach you in EMT school.

163
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,724
This side's still leaning pretty
bad, got to shore up this beam.

164
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,101
What do you got?

165
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,560
We need six 4X4s...

166
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,312
Told you I'd be back.

167
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,023
Heard you might be thirsty.

168
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,486
I assume that bodes well
for the rescue.

169
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,489
Structural beam, high-compression concrete.
I can't break it up.

170
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,990
You can't get me out of here?

171
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,742
No. Just means
we're gonna move on

172
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,452
to a different
piece of equipment.

173
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,663
I got airbags coming
in that'll lift 70 tons.

174
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,500
What's your name?

175
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,293
You testing my mental state?

176
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,421
If I'm gonna be stuck
down here for a while,

177
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,089
I'd like somebody to talk to.

178
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,254
Look, the guy who just left

179
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,092
is the one who's gonna be holding
your hand through all this.

180
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,468
You can talk to him.

181
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,928
Little pinch.

182
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,305
Ow! Ow!

183
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,685
Okay. Big pinch.

184
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,106
I got to call my husband.
Can I use your phone?

185
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,566
No bars down here.

186
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,445
L'chaim.

187
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,405
Where're you going?
Don't worry.

188
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,199
Fire Marshal Bill
will be back soon.

189
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,296
So, I hope I didn't weird you
out, giving you that gift.

190
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,797
Can we talk about this later?

191
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,048
Of course.

192
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,468
Is now later?

193
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,888
Maybe things aren't
going so well with Lucas?

194
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,765
If so, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to step into anything.

195
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,102
There's no problems. We're
doing just great. Thank you.

196
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,770
So why the weirdness?

197
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,232
Can you help?

198
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,032
When I opened it, I didn't think
it was a housewarming gift,

199
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,868
I thought it was
an engagement present.

200
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,583
It just happened last night.

201
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,506
No wonder you'd wanna
hide this from me,

202
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,132
since I'm such
a delicate flower.

203
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,343
I didn't know what to say,

204
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,748
and I've been
slightly distracted.

205
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,597
That might make sense, except
you're not wearing the ring.

206
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,476
So you are hiding it,
which begs the question...

207
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,978
House, it's in my office drawer

208
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,105
because I knew
I was coming here.

209
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,317
It's not weird,
there's no mystery.

210
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,779
I'm just getting married.

211
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,949
Excuse me.

212
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,786
How much longer?

213
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,830
Less than a minute.
Are you in any pain?

214
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,833
Nothing new.
Just a little claustrophobic.

215
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,628
Shouldn't you be taking
care of those other people?

216
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,963
The ones that I hurt?

217
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,219
Everything checks out okay.

218
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,601
My nose is bleeding.

219
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,313
It's expected, given the
trauma you've sustained.

220
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,524
That's not expected.

221
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,764
The way things fell,
this support beam

222
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,911
is now holding up
a giant pile of rubble.

223
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,831
We can't lift it without
jeopardizing everyone down here.

224
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,500
So it's time to
discuss amputation.

225
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,426
No.

226
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,679
Please listen to me. You've been
down here almost two hours.

227
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,973
By the time they
clear away the rubble...

228
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,100
We're not cutting off her leg.

229
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,645
You don't have to rush to
this to make his job easier.

230
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,064
You kidding me?

231
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,190
We leave the leg pinned,

232
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,775
we're risking crush syndrome.

233
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,901
What's that?

234
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,029
Your leg isn't getting
enough circulation.

235
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,323
The longer it's pinned,
the more the muscle dies.

236
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,241
So what does that mean,
like a limp?

237
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,076
Dying muscles release poisons.

238
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,495
We free your leg, the poisons
rush back into your system.

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,788
It could stop your heart.

240
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,082
So could cheeseburgers.

241
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,877
Just get your lazy friends
to start moving that pile.

242
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,213
She's got two more hours before crush
syndrome could possibly set in.

243
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,082
We're digging up there by hand.

244
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,550
I can't guarantee
I can get 10 tons

245
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,968
of debris pulled
off in two hours.

246
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,386
Well, you need to try.

247
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,972
It's my leg.

248
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,421
It's not just crush syndrome
you got to worry about, okay?

249
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,799
There's gas leaks,
there's fire,

250
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,186
we can never rule out
secondary collapses,

251
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,910
no matter how much
we shore this thing up.

252
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,272
You think chopping off
someone's limb

253
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,358
inside a pile of
dirty rocks is safe?

254
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,068
Sepsis, fat embolism,
hemorrhage...

255
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,486
Those risks are
nothing compared

256
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,363
to the risk of this thing
coming down again.

257
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,241
Captain, he's a jerk, but
that's what the patient wants.

258
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,994
Can we please just give it
a couple more hours?

259
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,167
Yeah.

260
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,586
I got to get up to triage.

261
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,759
Thank you, Doctor.

262
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,428
House.

263
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,933
You don't need to thank me.
It just makes sense.

264
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,269
Just promise me you won't
let them cut off my leg.

265
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,231
I promise.

266
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,555
Does that make you feel better?

267
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,734
For some reason, it does.

268
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,781
Your phone is
working down here.

269
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,284
Switched carriers, better
rollover minutes. Talk.

270
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,203
MRI was clean, but afterwards

271
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,047
he started bleeding
out of his eyes and nose.

272
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,251
So there was something
wrong before the collapse.

273
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,960
Unless it's just conjunctive
coagulopathy from the trauma.

274
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,796
Yeah, yeah, you don't think he
was sick before, we get it.

275
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,047
You're wrong.

276
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,298
Brain infection?

277
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,508
Sorry I'm late.

278
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,885
- Where were you?
- Physical therapy.

279
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,220
I left my phone in my locker.

280
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,597
The infection causes
neurological symptoms,

281
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,516
goes systemic,
and DIC causes the bleed.

282
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,642
Good theory.

283
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,367
Except for the part
that there's no fever.

284
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,979
Get an X-ray venogram.

285
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,981
See if you can find a
reason for your existence.

286
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,358
Also look for
venous sinus thrombosis.

287
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,735
We would've seen it on the MRI.

288
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,653
Not if you were too busy
not looking for it.

289
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,156
We should X-ray for
a facial fracture first,

290
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,574
this could all
be simple trauma.

291
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,033
Just do what I tell you.

292
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,202
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

293
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,663
You're leaving?

294
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,665
There's a dozen people here
who can save you.

295
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,951
I'm apparently the only one
who can save this other guy.

296
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:08,920
Wait.

297
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,338
Don't go.

298
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,641
Hanna's freaking out.

299
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,769
She's having a panic
attack, she can't breathe,

300
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,093
she's gonna rip
out all her IVs.

301
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,271
So calm her down.

302
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,856
She wants you.

303
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,358
I'm flattered. Give her oxygen.

304
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,863
They won't let O2 down
there, fear of explosion.

305
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,366
You have to go back.
She needs you, House.

306
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,222
You only came back because
I freaked out, right?

307
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:06,061
Not at all. I just realized how
big and scary the world is,

308
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,356
and how cozy and safe
this little place is.

309
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,569
Thank you.
I'm sorry I needed you.

310
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,787
Here. Call your husband.

311
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,800
Charlie?

312
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,469
I'm here in...

313
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,805
They called you?

314
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,600
They're helping me.

315
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,144
Are you coming?

316
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,941
I don't know how
this could've happened.

317
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,694
It's your birthday.
I'm so sorry.

318
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,779
See, this is why
I lied about the phone.

319
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,116
Your BP is spiking, so you're
bleeding faster from your leg wound,

320
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,368
and we'll have less time to save it.
Hang up.

321
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,079
Okay. Okay, they're
telling me I have to go.

322
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,254
That was stupid of me.

323
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,506
It was nice.

324
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,093
I don't see that
as a contradiction.

325
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,388
He was already on his way.

326
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,808
He was in Baltimore and they
all saw it on the news.

327
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,895
How many people were hurt?

328
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,691
What did I tell you about not
raising your blood pressure?

329
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,821
Can I ask what's wrong
with your leg?

330
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,364
Crane fell on it.

331
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,658
Small world.

332
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,411
You could've just said no.

333
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,247
I'll remember that
for my next human contact.

334
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,086
Would you pray with me?

335
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,005
No.

336
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,177
I'm not in the habit of encouraging
my patients' superstitions.

337
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,179
How's that a habit?

338
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,682
You plan on getting trapped
under a building again?

339
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,435
I don't believe in God.

340
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,313
I don't either.

341
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,608
Please.

342
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,625
I always thought

343
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,461
if I did the right thing,

344
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,964
if I treated people right,

345
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,698
then good things
would happen to me.

346
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,928
Do you think
that's how it works?

347
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,932
I didn't use to.

348
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,727
Then recently I tried.

349
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,691
Now I don't know.

350
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,448
Good news.

351
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,663
Advancing catheter
through interior jugular vein.

352
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,791
You told House
you were at therapy.

353
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,335
Did you transcribe
the entire meeting?

354
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,296
Entering the cavernous sinus.

355
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,673
Your therapy's on Thursdays.

356
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,968
It got rescheduled.
Injecting dye.

357
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,344
Really?

358
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,182
I'm not gonna rat you out,
we're friends.

359
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,019
I just wanna
make sure you're okay.

360
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,439
No filling defects.

361
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,069
Don't worry. I'm okay.

362
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,703
Do you think we could be friends
when I get out of here?

363
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,371
Yeah.

364
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,167
We'll catch a ball game or a
group sex show or something.

365
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,626
Put it in there.

366
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,675
Okay, when the beam starts
lifting, you're gonna feel pain.

367
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,678
It's gonna be like your foot's
gone to sleep times a billion.

368
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,639
You'll notice that I'm waiting
till now to tell you.

369
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,725
We're ready.

370
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,103
Lifting.

371
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,232
I'm feeling the pain already.

372
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,693
That's good. Means the
pressure's coming off.

373
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,196
Closer to getting out of here.

374
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,410
Come on. Help me pull her out.

375
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,246
Come on.

376
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,332
It's moving!

377
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,539
Hanna!

378
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,249
Hanna!

379
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,834
What the hell happened?

380
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,169
I think the adjacent beam
snapped during the lift.

381
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,967
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
We got a secondary collapse.

382
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,885
We're all right,
how are you guys?

383
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,637
Rescue 1, copy the mayday.

384
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,848
Main tunnel looks fine.
Red Team is on the way.

385
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,391
Lift this up.

386
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,018
One, two...

387
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,488
The kit. Give me the kit.

388
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:51,573
All right.

389
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,494
No breath sounds on the left side.
Tension pneumothorax.

390
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,329
Hey, Hanna.

391
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,331
One of your lungs
has collapsed.

392
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,041
I'm gonna have to
reinflate it, okay?

393
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,433
Hey, you better
get back up top,

394
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,227
make sure you didn't
nick an artery.

395
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,278
I'm gonna have to go.

396
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,242
It's okay. You're all right.

397
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,872
You're lucky this isn't worse.

398
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,625
You know who's even luckier?

399
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,770
You and just about every other
human being who wasn't down there.

400
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,423
What did the venogram say?

401
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,717
Clean. Now the guy is
starting to spike a fever.

402
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,636
Subarachnoid bleed.

403
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:55,929
Meningitis?

404
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,055
He didn't say
his neck was sore.

405
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,806
That's because
everything's sore.

406
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,185
He just took a 15-story swan
dive into concrete. Do an LP.

407
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,770
We also have to consider
other infections.

408
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,313
So you're suggesting
we do an LP?

409
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,648
I guess I am.

410
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,149
Genius.

411
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,859
Hey, bad news.

412
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,153
Because of the collapse, we
can't try the airbag again

413
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,905
until we get
everything off the top.

414
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,074
Be five, six hours, at least.

415
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,368
Then we have to amputate. No.

416
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,536
It's been four hours already.

417
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,039
It used to be a long
shot, now it's crazy.

418
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,250
Crush syndrome is basically
a build up of potassium.

419
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,668
If we remove potassium...

420
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,628
We're already treating
with sodium bicarbonate.

421
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,672
Not with glucose and insulin.

422
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,091
We got glucose in the kit, there's
got to be a diabetic here somewhere.

423
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,134
You want to dose
the insulin here?

424
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,387
In a non-hospital setting?
That is insane.

425
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,847
It's not worth it. Really?

426
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,849
Because I think
I'm the only one here

427
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,184
who knows what a leg is worth.

428
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,853
And fortunately, you're not the
one who's in charge, he is.

429
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,831
And he knows that
I'd testify against him

430
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,440
if Hanna sues for
cutting off a leg

431
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,276
without exhausting
every option.

432
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,194
Give us a minute?

433
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,283
I know you're angry,

434
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:02,453
but please don't put her life
at risk just to get back at me.

435
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,498
Really? Wow.

436
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,375
So this is all about you now?

437
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,295
You took her side against me

438
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,046
right after you heard
about my engagement.

439
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,216
Yeah, that must be it. It's not
that you're a pathetic narcissist.

440
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,718
I don't love you.

441
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:21,139
So just accept it and
move on with your life

442
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,765
instead of making
everyone miserable.

443
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,975
That's great.

444
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,144
A life lesson from a
middle-aged single mom

445
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,520
who's dating a man-child.

446
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,689
Screw you.

447
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,150
I'm sick of making
excuses for you.

448
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,445
I'm sick of other people
having to tiptoe around you

449
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,729
and make their own lives worse

450
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,033
while they try to
keep you from collapsing.

451
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,785
I'm done.

452
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,914
Fantastic. Just stay
away from my patient.

453
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,127
What are you
clinging to, House?

454
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,339
You're gonna risk her life
just to save her leg?

455
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,257
It really worked out
well for you, didn't it?

456
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,761
What do you have in your life?
Honestly, tell me.

457
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,139
I'm moving on.
Wilson is moving on.

458
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,434
And you? You've got nothing, House.
Nothing.

459
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,604
I'm going down there,

460
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,690
and I'm gonna convince her
to let me cut her leg off.

461
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,943
If you have any decency left,
you'll stay out of it.

462
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,370
No.

463
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,623
Dr. House promised.

464
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,250
If there was any other way...

465
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,795
It doesn't hurt right now.
I can wait.

466
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,758
Dr. House,

467
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,010
tell her.

468
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,890
Hanna,

469
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,937
we have to amputate your leg.

470
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,441
No. You said that
there was time.

471
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,819
There was. And it's run out.

472
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,864
No.

473
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:05,368
You asked me how
I had hurt my leg.

474
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:10,248
I had a blood clot,
and the muscle was dying.

475
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,251
And I had all these doctors
telling me I should amputate.

476
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,169
And I said no.
And they did this

477
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,338
very risky operation.

478
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,966
I almost died.

479
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,217
But you saved your leg.

480
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,346
I wish I hadn't.

481
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,642
They cut out a chunk of muscle
about the size of my fist.

482
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,855
They left me with this
mutilated, useless thing.

483
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,109
And I'm in pain every day.

484
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,612
And it changed me.

485
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,533
It made me a harder person.

486
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,743
A worse person.

487
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,538
And now...

488
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,707
Now I'm alone.

489
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,049
You don't wanna be like me.

490
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,429
You got a husband
who loves you.

491
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,182
You have friends,
you can start a family.

492
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,517
You have a life.

493
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,190
And this is just a leg.

494
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,167
Okay.

495
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,263
I got it.

496
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,026
I can't put you out 'cause it could
depress your respiration too much.

497
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,487
This should take away
some of the pain.

498
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,578
Will it be quick?

499
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:19,418
I'll use the scalpel to slice
through the skin, muscle and fat.

500
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,838
That should go pretty fast.

501
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,483
Then I'll switch over to the
electric saw when I get to the bone.

502
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,427
It's two bones about as
thick as a broom stick,

503
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,138
and takes about as
long to get through.

504
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,517
I'm gonna cut as close
to the concrete as I can.

505
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,477
Save as much of
your limb as possible.

506
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,229
Then the orthopedic surgeons

507
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,564
back at the hospital
will clean you up,

508
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,399
have you fitted
for a prosthetic.

509
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,694
You'll be running circles
around me in no time.

510
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,327
How bad will it hurt?

511
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,873
Like nothing
you've ever felt before.

512
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,945
Hanna.

513
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,073
Baby, I'm so sorry.

514
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,241
Shut up. It's all right.

515
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,034
You always loved my legs.

516
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,036
Baby, I don't care
about your legs.

517
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,621
Baby, I love you.

518
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,039
I love you.

519
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,457
I love you.

520
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,247
What?

521
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,167
He's fallen into a coma.
LP was clean, but...

522
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,376
What are his vitals?

523
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,669
Excuse me, Officer.

524
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,963
What do you mean "Officer"?

525
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,506
How long has there
been a cop there?

526
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:53,966
I don't know, 10 minutes.

527
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,093
He was being questioned
when he fell into the coma.

528
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,472
Was anything else making him nervous
or worried before his other symptoms?

529
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,316
He was claustrophobic
right before the bleed.

530
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,434
And before the fever,
we told him

531
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,102
that he probably
did fall asleep.

532
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,520
It's his BP spiking.

533
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,023
But that didn't cause
his first symptom.

534
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,026
Yeah, it did. All the caffeine.

535
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,736
We thought the problem
was in his toilet,

536
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,381
and by that, of course,
I mean his head,

537
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,198
which distracted us
from the fact that

538
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,158
it could've been just
a clog in his sewer pipe,

539
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,577
and by that, of course, I
mean his spinal cord and...

540
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,704
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
You get the idea.

541
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,749
An arachnoid cyst on his lower
spine, that's why we missed it.

542
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,292
He's been sitting
10 hours a day,

543
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,919
spiked his
spinal fluid pressure.

544
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,337
Run a CT...

545
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,715
BP 72 over 42.

546
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,008
Hanna?

547
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,052
Hanna? I can't breathe.

548
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,178
I can't breathe.

549
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,516
Breath sounds bilaterally.

550
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,392
It's not another pneumothorax.

551
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,896
Neck veins flat, no tamponade.

552
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,399
Damn it. I waited too long.

553
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,903
Hanna, you've got a clot in your lungs.
I'm gonna fix this.

554
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,571
IV streptokinase.

555
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,740
What's happening?
What's going on?

556
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,785
Her body won't get any oxygen
unless we can bust the clot.

557
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,953
This is a blood thinner.

558
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,583
Is she gonna be all right?

559
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,869
It'll make her bleed more,
we'll take care of that next.

560
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,176
It's not busting the clot.

561
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,846
Maybe it's the heart.

562
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,489
What? It's not a clot.

563
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,537
It's a fat embolism
from the amputation.

564
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,460
Okay. So what can we do?

565
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,381
Come on.

566
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,760
Do something. Please.
Please, do something.

567
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,846
Come on, guys, do something.
Come on.

568
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,015
Please, come on, do something.

569
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,766
Come on, do something!
Do something!

570
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,760
There's no way to
prevent a fat embolism.

571
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,013
Even if you'd done
this in an OR,

572
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,306
you couldn't have saved her.

573
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,239
You can't blame yourself
for her death.

574
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,658
This wasn't your fault.

575
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,326
That's the point!

576
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,162
I did everything right.
She died anyway.

577
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,999
Why the hell did you think that
would make me feel any better?

578
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,719
You shouldn't be
alone right now.

579
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,932
You're bleeding.

580
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,893
I'm gonna give you a task,
as an employee.

581
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,771
Get out of my way.

582
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,756
What's that?

583
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,511
I'm asking for some time off.

584
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,306
What's wrong?

585
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,564
Are you okay?

586
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,234
Obviously not.

587
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,563
You're gonna leap
across the room

588
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,857
and grab them out of my hand?

589
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:29,570
No.

590
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,614
It's your choice if you
wanna go back on drugs.

591
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,410
Okay.

592
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:41,081
Just so you know, I'm finding
it hard to see the downside.

593
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,710
You need to rebandage
your shoulder.

594
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,716
Is that why you're here?
Foreman sent you?

595
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,676
No.

596
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,761
Here to yell at me again?

597
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,888
No.

598
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,267
Well, I'm running out of ideas.

599
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,978
Lucas...

600
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,271
Oh, great.

601
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,523
You're feeling
uncomfortable again.

602
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,390
Probably means
you just got back

603
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,152
for some quickie
wedding in Vegas,

604
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,445
or you're already pregnant...

605
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,821
I ended it.

606
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,159
What?

607
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,869
I'm stuck, House.

608
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,989
I keep wanting to move forward,

609
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:26,126
I keep wanting to
move on, and I can't.

610
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,462
I'm in my new house
with my new fiancé,

611
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,131
and all I can
think about is you.

612
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:37,679
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

613
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,061
You think I can fix myself?

614
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,563
I don't know.

615
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,779
'Cause I am the most screwed
up person in the world.

616
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,072
I know.

617
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,992
I love you.

618
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,957
I wish I didn't.

619
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,085
But I can't help it.

620
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,915
How do I know
I'm not hallucinating?

621
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,711
Did you take the Vicodin?

622
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,381
Nope.

623
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,552
Then I think we're okay.

624
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,640
Yeah.
