1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,173
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Erin.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,384
He's not available
right now.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,219
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:15,223
Yes. Sure, I'll give him the message
when he gets up. Gets back.

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,019
Michael had chicken
pot pie for lunch.

6
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,270
Actually,
let me rephrase that.

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,565
Michael had an entire
chicken pot pie for lunch.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,567
Let me be more specific.

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:31,364
Michael ate an entire, family-sized
chicken pot pie for lunch,

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,699
and then he promptly
fell asleep.

11
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,784
So, we're all trying
to be very quiet,

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,828
so as to not wake him up
before 5:00 p.m.,

13
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,372
which actually
should be in about

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,087
10 minutes.

15
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,797
Okay, I'm gonna go in there
and change the computer.

16
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,340
Are you sure you can
change his watch?

17
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,591
I can do it.

18
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,552
What do you
need from me?

19
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,053
Normally, I don't
condone leaving early,

20
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,389
but I have an appointment
with the horse doctor.

21
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,850
How that horse became a
doctor, I don't know.

22
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,813
No, I'm kidding.

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,857
He's just a regular doctor who
shoots your horse in the head

24
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,483
when its leg is broken.

25
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,162
Like clockwork.

26
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,463
Oh, no.

27
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,175
What's so funny?

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,259
You had to be there.

29
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,219
Oh, yay, geography joke.

30
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:43,352
Oh. Wow, okay. All right, let's all
go home. Come on. See you all tamale.

31
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,479
Bye.

32
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,689
See you later,
Michael.

33
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,126
All right,
you ready for this?

34
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,712
Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees
our faces, then we leave, right?

35
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,130
Yeah.
Okay.

36
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,840
Wait, should I have
left the car running?

37
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,343
Oh.

38
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,053
Oh, don't get us wrong,
we like picnics.

39
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,721
Come on, who doesn't
like a picnic?

40
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,097
Tell them what
happened last year.

41
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,517
I had this huge spider
in my baseball mitt.

42
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,227
No, no, that guy
who hit on me.

43
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,646
Oh, right. Some drunk guy
hit on Pam last year.

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,481
Said he was grabbing
her for balance.

45
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,234
Yeah, you don't
grab these for balance.

46
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,069
Well...

47
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,532
I'm gonna say 30.

48
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,033
Ah, 40.

49
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,370
Insect repellent, which we clearly need,
reduces the effectiveness of SPF.

50
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,707
Good point, but thought of that
already, combination SPF/repellent.

51
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,167
Whoa. Homemade?

52
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,460
Of course.

53
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,671
You think the EPA would
ever allow that much deet?

54
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,509
Rolf is my best friend.
We met in a shoe store.

55
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,428
I heard him asking for a shoe
that could increase his speed

56
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,055
and not leave
any tracks.

57
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,140
Michael, isn't
that Holly?

58
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,146
We're just friends.

59
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,315
Hey, hey.
Wait a second.

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,693
Who let you in here,
is what I wanna know.

61
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,528
Oh, no.

62
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,530
I see they're letting
just anybody in here.

63
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,116
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, that's right.

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,451
All right.
All right. Mmm-hmm.

65
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,663
Hey.
Hi.

66
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,292
You remember A.J.,
my boyfriend?

67
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,627
A little bit. I meet
a lot of people.

68
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,920
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

69
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,630
Oh.

70
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,055
So, would you guys
like some lemonade?

71
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,433
Or one of you?
Or both of you?

72
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,728
Either-or. Combinations
are endless.

73
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,646
Lemonade sounds great.
Okay.

74
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,981
I'd love an
iced tea, actually.

75
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,816
You can go to hell.

76
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,277
I'm kidding.

77
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,323
Um, sure, I will get you the
best iced tea in the world.

78
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,910
I lied to Kevin.

79
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,412
Holly and I can never
be just friends.

80
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,248
I wrote down a list
of bullet points

81
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,000
why Holly and I
should be together,

82
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,003
and I'm going to find the perfect
moment today and I'm going to tell her.

83
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,840
Number one, "Holly, you
and I are soup snakes."

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,385
And the reason is

85
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,556
because in terms of
the soup, we like to...

86
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,434
That doesn't make any sense.
We're soul mates.

87
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,645
Holly and I are soul mates.

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,647
Jim, Pam.

89
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,106
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, Charles.

90
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,775
Nice day, huh?
Yeah.

91
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,861
Must be nice to get a
rest from all your rest.

92
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,448
I don't get it. He's not
even my boss anymore.

93
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,824
Do you want me to
beat him up for you?

94
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,911
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do
stuff like that. You should just do it.

95
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,997
Listen up, everyone. I've gone
over this lineup very carefully.

96
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,083
We cannot forget
the humiliation

97
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,460
we suffered last year
at the softball game

98
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,673
with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt
incident. Right?

99
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,883
Well, I could've
died, so...

100
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,136
I looked it up
online afterwards.

101
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,597
Erin, back row.
Ryan, you move up a row.

102
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,934
Bro-migo, do you think you
could put Erin on my row?

103
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,644
Why? I don't understand.

104
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,772
If... No, wait... Wait
a minute, I get it.

105
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,442
You want her to set you
up so you can spike it.

106
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,987
Uh...

107
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,489
I'll tell you what, I'm
gonna do you one better.

108
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,157
I'm gonna put you
next to Phyllis.

109
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,159
She's the best
setter on the team.

110
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,161
That's...
Sly dog.

111
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,329
...not what I meant.

112
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,831
Come on, folks!

113
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,250
What is up with
you two, Holly?

114
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,210
Um, not much.

115
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,837
We're designing a house.

116
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,463
Cool, for who?

117
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,298
For us.

118
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,759
Wow.

119
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,930
I'm designing a chair.

120
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,225
It's part of your pants.

121
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,060
You sit down,
you're supported.

122
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,063
I remember your chair-pants idea.
Yeah.

123
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,110
I like that. Put me down for a pair.
I'm a size-34 waist.

124
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,529
All right, fatty,
I will do it.

125
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,282
You know what, we should
actually rehearse.

126
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,367
Okay, yeah.

127
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,827
You guys are
really gonna do this?

128
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,996
You bet your
fat ass we are.

129
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,082
Well, in his
infinite wisdom,

130
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,627
David Wallace has authorized us
to put on a little presentation

131
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,546
about the history
of Dunder Mifflin.

132
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,132
Yep, old comedy team
is back together again.

133
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,633
That's right.

134
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,885
"Have you heard
the news?

135
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,387
"Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!"

136
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,681
"Newspapers for sale!"

137
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,522
Are you blind?
Are you blind?

138
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,402
Sir? With the glasses,
are you literally blind?

139
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,237
I'm concerned you
might be in danger.

140
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,073
These are expensive
Ray-Bans, jackass.

141
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,909
Okay, I was just
looking out for you.

142
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,160
You're doing great,
by the way.

143
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,369
Thanks.

144
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,205
I got it.

145
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,251
Kevin, come on!
Are you blind?

146
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,463
I could've gotten that, idiot! Can
you see things with your eyeballs?

147
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,589
It's not a sledgehammer!

148
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,342
Come on, people. We need to
get our heads in the game.

149
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,928
Let's focus. Come on,
you're better than this.

150
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,971
I am better than this.

151
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,265
Phyllis, why are you
sitting on the ground?

152
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,352
We've been out here for a
while, I don't need this.

153
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,194
Oh, come... Ryan, come on, man!
One second.

154
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,947
Wait, wait, wait! Net, net.
Her hand's on the net.

155
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,281
So what?
Rule violation.

156
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,574
Ball is ours.
Give it to me.

157
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,243
What?
Our point.

158
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,869
Okay, hey, Pam,
how you doing?

159
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,081
Hey, do you know if you're right-handed
or left-handed, or do you even know?

160
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,791
What hand do you use
to answer the phone?

161
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,042
Back off, Dwight.

162
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,217
Nice hit, Pam!

163
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,177
What?

164
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,558
Maybe I played a little in
junior high and in high school.

165
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,477
Maybe a little in college.

166
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,063
And went to volleyball
camp most summers.

167
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,189
All right, come on!

168
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,862
Yeah, look at that. We win.
Nice shot, Beesly.

169
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,905
Yes, we advance
to the next round!

170
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,407
Oh, Lord in heaven.

171
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,033
Had to be
part of the group.

172
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,875
Brought some snacky-snacks
in case we get hungry.

173
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,419
Ooh, yes, please.

174
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,215
Mmm.

175
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,761
So, what do you have
planned for us today?

176
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,683
What? Do you have a script
for the sketch or...

177
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,979
Um, no, I just thought
we'd wing it. That cool?

178
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,564
Crystal cool.

179
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,069
Hit it, Andy.

180
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,487
Bump, I bumped it!

181
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,281
Set. Don't set it to yourself.

182
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Yeah.

183
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,286
Ow! My ankle.

184
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,412
What happened?

185
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,872
I twisted it.

186
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,373
You weren't even moving.

187
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,335
Okay, sub.

188
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,711
I can play.

189
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,255
Is there a Meredith here?

190
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,341
Yeah! Man in!

191
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,968
Rolf, did you
not hear me?

192
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,847
I don't hear cheaters, tramps or
women who break my friend's heart.

193
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,058
Let's go!

194
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,230
We could do a movie
sort of thing.

195
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,482
We could do
Back to the Future.

196
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,235
Oh. We have to convince
Dunder and Mifflin

197
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,529
to go back in time,
fix their parents.

198
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,408
Could we get a DeLorean?

199
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,746
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and
they terrorize the whole community.

200
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,830
Oh.

201
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,292
Dunder, Dunder,
Dunder, Dunder...

202
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,175
We haven't found
our great idea yet.

203
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,635
No. No.

204
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,763
We're circling it.

205
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,847
Hmm.

206
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,690
Yes!
Oh, yeah!

207
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,900
Nicely done. We're still
gonna crush you, though.

208
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,777
Yes, we are. You suckers
are going down!

209
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,571
They're gonna wipe their
asses with your serves!

210
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,864
Piss all over
your faces!

211
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,075
That's true!

212
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,036
This reminds me of the
HR convention last fall.

213
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:25,249
Oh, yeah, with Bernie and Efrem.
That was hilarious.

214
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,417
Really, really funny.

215
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,751
Really funny.

216
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,839
Listen, guys. One more point
and we play corporate.

217
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,019
Settle down, gentlemen.

218
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,520
Good game!

219
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,107
Welcome to the 43rd Annual
Company Picnic, everybody.

220
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,483
Thanks for being here.

221
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,863
Now, a couple of employees have
volunteered to entertain us with a song.

222
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,364
Uh, it's
a sketch now.

223
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,490
Okay.

224
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:03,954
Introducing Scranton's Michael Scott
performing with Nashua's Holly Flax.

225
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,080
I have not seen this.

226
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,837
And now, presenting

227
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,673
SlumDunder Mifflinaire!
SlumDunder Mifflinaire!

228
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,221
Are you ready to play
SlumDunder Mifflinaire?

229
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,848
Yes, I am.

230
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,935
For $100, where did
Dunder meet Mifflin?

231
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,188
A, on easy street,

232
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,107
B, a tour of
Dartmouth College,

233
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,443
C, they never met,

234
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,071
D, brushing their teeth.

235
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,160
Oh. I'm thinking.

236
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,954
I'm going to say

237
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,543
B, tour of
Dartmouth College.

238
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,629
That is correct!

239
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,383
How did you know that?

240
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,637
I was there!

241
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,808
I was a tour guide at
Dartmouth College! No!

242
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,479
Nice campus.
Think you'll get in?

243
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,524
Yeah. I'm definitely
getting in. I'm a shoo-in.

244
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,067
I'm Robert Dunder.

245
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,902
I'm Robert Mifflin.

246
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,077
Robert Mifflin
had a great life,

247
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,414
but unfortunately had
undiagnosed depression,

248
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,959
which over 9 million Americans
suffer from and is very treatable.

249
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:36,004
For $250, how did
he kill himself?

250
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,132
A, a rope,

251
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,175
B, a knife,

252
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,511
C, a gun,

253
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,305
D, brushing his teeth.

254
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:51,145
$250 is more money than
I've ever seen in my life.

255
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:57,818
I will say C, a gun. He
shot himself in the head.

256
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,529
That is correct!

257
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,738
Yes!

258
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,867
I usually don't
enjoy the theater,

259
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,660
but this is delightful.

260
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,706
The economic downturn has
been difficult recently,

261
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,209
forcing the closures of
both Camden and Yonkers

262
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,379
to be followed soon
by what other branch?

263
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,300
For $500,000, is it

264
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,926
A, Scranton,

265
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,096
B, Buffalo,

266
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,183
C, Utica,

267
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,894
or D, Toothbrush?

268
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,521
I will say B,
Buffalo, final answer.

269
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,647
That is correct!

270
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,566
- What is he talking about?
- What?

271
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,775
No way.
It's gotta be a joke.

272
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,279
How did you know that?
David Wallace told me!

273
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,363
David, is this true?

274
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,824
Uh, okay, everyone,
we're at a picnic today...

275
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,076
Are we losing our jobs
or not, David?

276
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,162
They didn't know?
I guess not.

277
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,539
I'm sorry. This certainly
wasn't the time or the place

278
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,874
to announce
this sort of thing,

279
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,794
but there have been talks about
closing the Buffalo branch.

280
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,921
And?

281
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,215
We're closing
the Buffalo branch.

282
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,552
Are you serious? You've
gotta be kidding me!

283
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,847
We're the best branch in the company.
I don't believe it.

284
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,479
How could you
possibly think

285
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,856
that the right way to
announce a branch closing

286
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,025
was in a comedy sketch
at the company picnic?

287
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,736
Well, I didn't know
they didn't know.

288
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,404
What about the fact
that they're here today?

289
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,532
What about that? That
didn't throw up any alarms?

290
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,701
No, Michael needed a little
bit for his comedy sketch

291
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,079
and he thought, "Oh, this would
be real funny." Thank you.

292
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,623
Damn it, Michael. I told
you that in confidence.

293
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,752
Now I have to go over and deal with
these employees and their families.

294
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,212
A little boy just
walked up to me and said,

295
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,548
"Is my daddy gonna have
a job by Christmas?"

296
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,509
Well, he's just thinking
about his own gifts.

297
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,054
Maybe we shouldn't play
due to the circumstances.

298
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,974
Hey, people need volleyball
now more than ever.

299
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,517
How do you figure?

300
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,312
Because if we don't play,
then the other team wins.

301
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,149
Dwight's right. Corporate
deserves to get its ass kicked.

302
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,069
Let's do this.

303
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,989
Jim, come on!

304
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,826
Look who just woke up!

305
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,665
I've been up for a while!

306
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,754
It's 6 to 6.
It's a nail biter.

307
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,259
Kevin! Now it's 7-6. Or is that
too much accounting for you?

308
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,052
Here's an accounting
question for you.

309
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,930
What does one fiancé
plus one lover equal?

310
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,348
Answer, one whore.

311
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,142
Okay, knock it off, Rolf.

312
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,936
What? She's sitting there casting
aspersions... Rolf, please.

313
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,146
No, wait a minute.
I am asking nicely.

314
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,356
Wait, you don't mean that.
Rolf, leave it alone.

315
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,569
You got it.

316
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,529
All right.

317
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,705
Got it. Damn!

318
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,916
- I got it.
- Pam!

319
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,086
You all right?
Yeah. No, no, no, I'm fine.

320
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,379
You sure?
Yeah.

321
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,423
Hey, easy, easy, easy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

322
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,966
You want to get
that looked at.

323
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,135
No, no, it's fine.
Just give me a second.

324
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,971
I don't know. You know,
this is a company picnic.

325
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,307
So, technically, that is a
company injury, you know.

326
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,060
The safest thing to do is get
that examined. Right, David?

327
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,227
Yeah. All right, you know what?

328
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,812
You're just trying to get
rid of our best player.

329
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,689
Oh, Jim, you're
putting a volleyball game

330
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,066
in front of your
fiancée's health.

331
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,902
No... Look, seriously,
I can move it fine.

332
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,237
Come on, let's go. It's our ball.
Let's go. I don't know.

333
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,531
Yeah, I don't think we can
let you play with that foot.

334
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,117
Tell you what.
I spotted a small hospital

335
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,952
a few kilometers
south of here.

336
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,497
Get her back as soon as possible.
I'll stall them.

337
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,376
I guess that's
it for you, Jim.

338
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,712
All right, you know what?
Let's do this.

339
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,881
We'll be back.

340
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,218
Oh, man, I am so mad
that Pam got hurt!

341
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,557
I'll get it.

342
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,940
Probably shouldn't
have mentioned Buffalo.

343
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,692
Hindsight.

344
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,111
Should've had hindsight.

345
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,739
How do you think it went
before the Buffalo thing?

346
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,075
I think it went well.
I think it was good.

347
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,035
There weren't any laughs.

348
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,912
Well, that was
a tough audience.

349
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,623
Yeah, but we wrote it
specifically for this audience.

350
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,961
Believe me, I have seen a lot
of tough audiences in my time,

351
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,046
and that was one of them.

352
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,173
Well, I'm glad we did it.

353
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,468
Me, too.

354
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,612
We have a lot of good material
for next year's sketch.

355
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,162
I can't wait.

356
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,210
Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so
you'll have to stall a little longer.

357
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,087
No. Don't send in the subs yet.

358
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,590
Dwight, I don't know.
Think of something.

359
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,176
Well, to be safe, we should do an x-ray.
How long will that take?

360
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,470
Well, it shouldn't be too bad.
It's a slow day.

361
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,555
So, no other
radiation this year,

362
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,390
no metal plates, no
chance you're pregnant...

363
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,767
I'm sorry. Could we
just hurry this up?

364
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:22,851
I've got a game
to get back to.

365
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,144
Oh, good, because
my next question was,

366
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,604
"Do you have a game
to get back to?"

367
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,731
What did you think?

368
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,317
I loved it.

369
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,818
You know, there was
a part near the end

370
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,780
that seemed like that went
on a little long, but...

371
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,031
Well, you guys
should hit the road

372
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,117
before I close down
another branch.

373
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,452
Okay. So good
to see you.

374
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,870
Good to see you.

375
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,873
A.J.
Michael.

376
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,170
I didn't find
the perfect moment,

377
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,466
because I think that today
was about just having today.

378
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,805
And I think that we are one of
those couples with a long story

379
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,307
when people ask how
we found each other.

380
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,479
I will see her
every now and then,

381
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,441
and maybe one year,
she'll be with somebody,

382
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,693
and the next year,
I'll be with somebody,

383
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,154
and it's gonna
take a long time.

384
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,784
And then it's perfect.

385
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,704
I'm in no rush.

386
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,917
Ha! Dwight, come on, now.
It's time to put in the subs.

387
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,169
Yeah, it looks like Pam
won't make it back.

388
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,005
Okay?
Okay, fine.

389
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,715
All right! Come on. Okay.

390
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,176
Except you know what?
It's not fine.

391
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:42,097
How many people need to get hurt
before we learn a valuable lesson?

392
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,099
One? Two?

393
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,476
Three? Four?

394
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,311
Dwight...
No, no. Hear me out.

395
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,356
Five? Six?

396
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,607
Dwight.

397
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,109
Seven?
Can I finish, please?

398
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,193
Okay.

399
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,987
Eight?

400
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,864
Oh, Dwight, we're so close.

401
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,490
Just buy us
a few more minutes.

402
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,035
Well, they just called me in for an
update, so I'll call you right back.

403
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,495
Okay. Okay, great.

404
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,993
Hey, Dwight. Uh...

405
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,329
Send in the subs.
