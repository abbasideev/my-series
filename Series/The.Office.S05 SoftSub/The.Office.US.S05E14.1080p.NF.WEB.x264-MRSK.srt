1
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,015
This morning,
the phone guy comes in

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,477
and he shows Michael that our
phones have a PA function.

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,729
And then he just left.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,065
This is your
captain speaking.

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,735
The office will be flying at
an altitude of two stories.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,696
Look out your
left-hand window

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,948
and you will see
Vance Refrigeration.

8
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,578
I am the ghost
of salesmen past.

9
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,206
Do not come near me.

10
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,798
Yes, Michael Scott
for Dr. Johnson, please.

11
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,218
Hello, Doctor. I was just
following up about my mole again.

12
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,556
Now, I was looking online
about sebaceous zits.

13
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,142
I have not been
squeezing it.

14
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,935
Could I stick it
with a pin?

15
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,731
Toby Flenderson to
the principal's office.

16
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,067
Your mother called and it appears
that you wet the bed again,

17
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:11,821
so you have to get home to wash
your sheets because they're yellow

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,948
and they're wet
with your urine.

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,619
And, at 6'6",

20
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:24,417
from the University of North
Carolina, Jim Halpert!

21
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,918
That's pretty funny.

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,505
Hey, you know what? Did I drop my...
What the heck?

23
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,216
Is that...
You find it?

24
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,677
I didn't. I'll look
somewhere else.

25
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,429
All right.
All right.

26
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,223
Would you like
fries with that?

27
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,225
Please drive around.

28
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,383
Hello?

29
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,804
Good morning.
Good morning.

30
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,263
You ready?

31
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,145
And we're off.
Like a herd of turtles.

32
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,986
Well, Pam and I
have eloped.

33
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,781
Actually, we just
robbed a bank

34
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,324
and we are on the lam.

35
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,578
No, seriously,
I am on a lecture circuit.

36
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,332
Apparently, Scranton has the best
sales of any regional branch,

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,211
so David Wallace has asked me
to go to all the branches

38
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,048
except Nashua.
Still a little bit raw there.

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,175
Um... But I am going
to these branches

40
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,470
and I am telling them
my secret recipe for success,

41
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:04,725
my 11 business herbs and
spices in a sales batter.

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,897
Oh, that.
Well, that is Pam.

43
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,901
Pam is coming along as my assistant
and my driver so I can focus.

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,028
And I like to pack heavy.

45
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,363
He brought a sled.

46
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,198
No, that is a toboggan.

47
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,117
You never know when you're
going to find a snowy hill.

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,243
So...

49
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,829
Every magician
has a hot assistant

50
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,831
and every rock star
has a roadie

51
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,333
and Pam is my hot roadie.

52
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,919
Yeah, I love being
on the road,

53
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,296
but I especially love

54
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,547
the time and a half pay,

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,632
24 hours a day
for three days.

56
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,385
'Cause I have a mortgage now.
Got to bring home the bucks.

57
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,054
No, don't say "bucks."
It's not ladylike.

58
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:48,269
Here we go. Okay, so what
we do is we drive all day

59
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,188
and we stay in hotels together at night.
Separate rooms.

60
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,316
Well, that goes without saying.
I'm gonna say it anyway.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,569
Hey, look at what
you're wearing again, Pam.

62
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,864
Have you ever seen a magician's
assistant? That's...

63
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,284
This is a new cardigan.
Kind of blech.

64
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,870
Maybe you could tie it
around your waist

65
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,455
or lose the shirt
underneath or something.

66
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,665
No.
No? All right.

67
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,379
Hi, Kelly.
Screw you.

68
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,592
Excuse me. That is no way
to address a superior.

69
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,719
Oh, yeah?
Screw you, too.

70
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,640
Whoa. What was
that all about?

71
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,600
You forgot her birthday.

72
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,560
It was yesterday.

73
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,440
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

74
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,524
You do it.

75
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,109
Okay.
I insist.

76
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,404
Basically, after Phyllis
blackmailed Angela,

77
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,781
Michael asked them
both to step down

78
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,991
from the Party Planning Committee
because there was too much drama.

79
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,077
What he said was...
Just... Easy.

80
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,622
...there was a problem with having one
head of the Party Planning Committee.

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,668
She becomes too powerful,
so he appointed two heads.

82
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,127
Party planning?
I am a paper salesman.

83
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,253
This is literally
the stupidest thing

84
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,005
I've ever done in my life.
This is humiliating.

85
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,925
That's on my side.

86
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,178
So this is fun.

87
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,098
My birthday was yesterday,
and everybody forgot.

88
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,101
I got really dressed up and
excited and no one said a word.

89
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,978
There wasn't
even a party.

90
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,731
I think sometimes people are really
mean to the hot, popular girl.

91
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,233
Can I turn on
the radio?

92
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,860
No, I need silence or
Sam Kinison to prepare.

93
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,571
But then you fall asleep and
there's nothing for me to do.

94
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,949
Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
That's dangerous.

95
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,952
Well, then... Hey, you know what?
Let's just talk.

96
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,329
That's okay. I can...
I'm fine.

97
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,581
I'll just play a song
in my head.

98
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,921
You nervous about
seeing Karen again?

99
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,257
Since she was
the other woman?

100
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,676
Actually, you were
the other woman, so...

101
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,095
No, that was
a long time ago.

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,180
Is that why you're
wearing makeup today?

103
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,392
No, I'm not even
wearing that much.

104
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,103
I hate the idea that someone
out there hates me.

105
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,481
I even hate thinking
that al-Qaeda hates me.

106
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,734
I think if they
got to know me,

107
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,444
they wouldn't
hate me.

108
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,780
But Karen knows me and she
still hates me, so...

109
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,866
Oh, this is
a nice office.

110
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,786
You don't have to lie.
Through here.

111
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,539
Um, Phyllis?

112
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,625
Who's that?

113
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,794
She's out of your
league, Andy.

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,007
For your information, I've been
with lots of beautiful women.

115
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,800
Sexually?

116
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,303
This conversation is over.

117
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,055
I am single now.

118
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,185
What we have here is the ultimate
smackdown between the Nard-Dog

119
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,522
and crippling despair,
loneliness and depression.

120
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,651
I intend to win.

121
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,154
We just wanted to say
we are very sorry.

122
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,363
Screw you guys.
You're dead to me.

123
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,948
If you say screw you
one more time...

124
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,992
Yeah, screw you, beet farmer, I
didn't forget your birthday.

125
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,744
I would never do that!
Hey! Hey!

126
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,912
Guys, guys, guys.

127
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,081
We just want to make it up to you.
What can we do?

128
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,044
I guess my only wish would be that
nothing so terrible would ever happen

129
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,253
to anyone else ever again.

130
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,464
Oh, God.
Okay.

131
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,175
In a way, it's good that it happened
to me because at least I can bear it.

132
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,594
What kind of cake
do you want, imbecile?

133
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,678
Ice cream.

134
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,976
Okay, point at
the Dunder Mifflin.

135
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,530
Hello, Rolando, how are you? Hi.

136
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,491
Rolando, I'd like
you to meet Pam.

137
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,118
She is our
receptionist.

138
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,452
You know what?
Maybe

139
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,163
you guys could go out on a
little friend date sometime.

140
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,209
You're late. Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.

141
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,294
Karen will be right here
to take you over. Okay.

142
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,548
Don't be nervous.
Just picture her naked.

143
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,632
Stop it.

144
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,883
That's what I do.
Steal my trick.

145
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,426
- Please cut it out.
- Hey.

146
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,554
Hi, guys.

147
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,681
Oh, my God.

148
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,892
Is that Jim's?

149
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,018
- What?
- Michael!

150
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,145
Of course not.
Okay.

151
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,398
Wow. Oh, man.
My head just exploded.

152
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,485
Whoo! Thank God
for everybody, right?

153
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,740
Wow, you're huge!
That's incredible.

154
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,369
I... God, sorry, sorry.
My head is... I'm just...

155
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,123
I'm trying to figure out the last
time that you and Jim had sex, and...

156
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,375
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

157
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,419
Ten? Ten months?

158
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,595
Are you kidding?

159
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,221
Well, I'm not done yet.

160
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,683
Dwight, this fits in
the palm of my hand.

161
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,727
You haven't blown
them up enough.

162
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,521
Why have you chosen
brown and gray balloons?

163
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,064
They match the carpet.

164
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,566
What is that?

165
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,026
"It is your birthday,"
period.

166
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,319
It's a statement
of fact.

167
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,029
Not even
an exclamation point?

168
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,405
This is more
professional.

169
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,490
It's not like she discovered
a cure for cancer.

170
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,076
I can't believe
how bad this looks.

171
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,704
Are you trying to
hurt my feelings?

172
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,122
Because, if so,
you are succeeding.

173
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,126
Fortunately, my feelings regenerate
at twice the speed of a normal man's.

174
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,211
Okay, good then.

175
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,670
Have you collected
the money from everyone?

176
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,547
I am working on it.
How much do you have?

177
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,798
$6.

178
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,928
That's how much you and I contributed!
Damn it, Jim!

179
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,346
I said I was
working on it.

180
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,184
Trying to see
what CDs she's got.

181
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,687
It's good to know the deets
about the girl you're wooing.

182
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,731
Uh... Ah-ha!

183
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,150
Feist! Yes!

184
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,247
No!

185
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,291
Oh, my God.

186
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,838
Oh, no. That is so awful.
That is the worst news.

187
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,591
I have to go. I have
to do a presentation.

188
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,385
I'll talk to you...

189
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,471
This is going to be hard
for me to speak today,

190
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,432
because I just learned
that my father has died.

191
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,019
No, he didn't.
He is alive.

192
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,231
And this isn't even a cell phone.
This is a calculator,

193
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,693
but you bought it and now
you can't return it.

194
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,779
Or can you?
No, you can't.

195
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,283
Yes, Karen?
Do you need to go pump?

196
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,244
Not gonna have to do that
until after I have the baby.

197
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,913
No, I am wondering what
are you talking about?

198
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:27,459
I am talking about how you all
need to sell an experience.

199
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,796
Like I sold you on the idea
that my father had died.

200
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,673
But now we think
you're a liar.

201
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,218
Would a liar bring
mini Mounds bars?

202
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,930
I am a theatrical person.

203
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,266
Growing up I always thought
I would become an actor

204
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,104
because I have these
memorization tricks that I use.

205
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,106
Um...

206
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,609
For instance, I learned
the Pledge of Allegiance

207
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,237
by setting it to the
tune of Old MacDonald.

208
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:03,704
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

209
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,707
And to the republic
for which it stands

210
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,001
One nation under God

211
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,837
With a woof-woof here
And a woof-woof there

212
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,673
Here a woof, there a woof
Everywhere a woof-woof

213
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,384
You get it.

214
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,929
I don't know you. But I need to
know you in order to sell to you.

215
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,807
That is why I've asked you to go
around and tell me your names.

216
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,018
I have an amazing
mnemonic device

217
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,605
by which I have now memorized
all of your names.

218
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,986
Shirty, mole, lazy eye,
Mexico, baldy,

219
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,113
sugar boobs,
black woman.

220
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,658
I have taken a unique
part of who you are

221
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,704
and I have used that
to memorize your name.

222
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,625
Baldy, your head is bald,
it is hairless,

223
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:54,463
it is shiny, it is
reflective, like a mirror.

224
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,382
"M," your name is Mark.

225
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,093
Yes.
Got it. It works!

226
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,387
Uh, it's very insulting.

227
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,679
But it works.

228
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,891
I would like you all to give this a shot.
What do you say?

229
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,602
But we already know
each other's names.

230
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,021
Well, then it will be
easier for you.

231
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,315
But I still think it's
worthwhile to give it a try.

232
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,734
Okay, all right, everyone.
Meeting's over.

233
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,944
But I still have more.

234
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,321
Can I please see you
in my office, please?

235
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,367
She is pregnant. She is knocked up.
"K," Karen.

236
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,701
Pam, let's go.

237
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,082
I can't accept
these prices, Stanley.

238
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,333
They just cut
our budget.

239
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,168
Brought you guys
some coffees.

240
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,295
Stanley, I know you have
adult-onset diabetes,

241
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,507
so I put Splenda
in yours.

242
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,843
Let's see, how many
did I put in there?

243
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,681
One, two, three, four Splendas
in your coffee, Stanley

244
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,560
None in yours, Julia, because
I don't know how you take it

245
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,270
But if you'd rather...

246
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,605
Four Splenda?
Are you crazy?

247
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,107
No, I actually
only put in two,

248
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,943
but that's not how
the song goes.

249
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,445
Are you out of
your damn mind?

250
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,738
Are you out of
your damn mind?

251
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,700
You bring an angel like
that into this office

252
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,161
and you don't even
set me up with her.

253
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,205
We're not friends.
I didn't think about it.

254
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,542
We are friends.
Stanley, we're friends.

255
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,878
And you let me down.

256
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,548
You really like her, huh?

257
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,885
Yeah, I really like her
with all my heart.

258
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,557
Give me two clients
for her.

259
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,394
I grab this, and I
turn it on and I say,

260
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,981
"Prepare yourself for the
Utica Chain Store Massacre."

261
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,650
No, that is
incredibly dangerous.

262
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,319
No, don't worry,
the chain is off.

263
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,487
No, it's not.

264
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,198
You know, I think I'm just
going to distill all of this

265
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,158
and send it in
an e-mail to my team.

266
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,578
E-mail's not scary. This is an opportunity.
Don't blow it.

267
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,413
So, when are you due?

268
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,499
Uh, in about a month.

269
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,543
Wow, that is wonderful.
Congratulations.

270
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,421
Thank you. It just
all happened so fast.

271
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,673
It's really amazing.
Congratulations, Karen. Thanks.

272
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,427
So is there a guy
or a person

273
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:11,266
or a sperm machine
that did this to you or...

274
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,311
Yes, Michael.
My husband impregnated me.

275
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,521
Great.

276
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,439
His name is Dan.

277
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,235
This is us. We're so dorky.
That's cute.

278
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,694
Yes, thank you.

279
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,365
He's a dermatologist. We met at a bar.
Can you believe that?

280
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,159
What is happening there?

281
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,745
Oh, yeah, don't even...
That's really dorky.

282
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,163
It's really sweet.

283
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,581
No, it's really dorky.

284
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,000
You were right
the first time.

285
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,795
So how are things in Scranton?
How's Jim?

286
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,297
They're good.
Jim's good.

287
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,634
We're engaged.

288
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,389
That's so great.
That's great.

289
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,932
Thank you.

290
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,225
Oh, my God.
I'm so happy for you.

291
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,476
Oh, wow. Thank you.

292
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,231
Old hatreds dissolve
into new friendships.

293
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,984
This is really
a wonderful moment.

294
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,907
I have to take care
of a couple of things,

295
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,243
so Andy will be
taking over things here.

296
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,162
You are in good hands and
give my best to your mother.

297
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,876
So, Julia, um,
let's see.

298
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,924
With regards to billing,
should we send bills

299
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,594
to you or to your
boyfriend's house, or...

300
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,762
No, it can go straight
to our business address.

301
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,849
Oh, okay. All right.
That makes sense.

302
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,852
How does your boyfriend deal
with your phenomenal success?

303
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,397
Is he just, like, totally
threatened by you, or...

304
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,400
Actually, I don't
have a boyfriend.

305
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:48,155
Really? Is that...
Wow, that's so weird.

306
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,866
Guys, stop everything.

307
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,577
I'm about to ask out this girl
and I'm completely panicking.

308
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,078
Oh, my desk
is over...

309
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,331
This gal,
she's really into you?

310
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,124
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

311
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,084
I've seen her like
three times today

312
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,128
and we love
all the same music

313
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,922
and whenever I walk into a
room she totally looks up.

314
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:10,052
All right, say no more. This
is how I got Squeaky Fromme.

315
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,514
No small talk. Just show
her who's the boss.

316
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,099
Just go right in
and kiss her.

317
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,851
Okay, it sounds risky.

318
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,479
Have I ever steered
you wrong, Jim?

319
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,439
Wait, what?

320
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,150
I would give that
lecture a solid B-plus.

321
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,029
Although, for the record,
Karen, wow, kind of mean.

322
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,238
I like her.

323
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,617
Really? No, honestly. Tell
me what you really think.

324
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,912
I'm serious.
I'm really glad I came.

325
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,081
Why?

326
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,582
Because, um...

327
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,963
Because I'll never wonder ever
again if I did something wrong,

328
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,217
and now I have closure.

329
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,927
She's happy,

330
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,429
and, I don't know,
it feels good.

331
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,018
Thanks for
walking me out.

332
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:03,021
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all
kinds of weirdoes out here, so...

333
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,731
You must be freezing.

334
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,275
I am about to die.

335
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,861
Will you wait here
while I go get my jacket?

336
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,863
No, it's okay.
This is my car.

337
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,490
Okay. Okay.

338
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,701
Well, listen,

339
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,538
you're a new client and
as one of my new clients

340
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,040
you will always
be taken care of

341
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,043
and that is
the Nard-Dog guarantee.

342
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,003
What's a Nard-Dog?

343
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,880
This is the Nard-Dog.

344
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,717
Whoa! What the hell?

345
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:32,968
Oh...

346
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,138
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

347
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,307
I thought
we had this energy

348
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,394
and I'm a mess and I
just had my heart broken

349
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,980
and you came in today
and you're so pretty.

350
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,231
You're, like,
incredibly pretty.

351
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,276
I just got out of a relationship, too.
It's really hard.

352
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,611
Yeah, right? Wow.

353
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,739
Do you want to
talk about it?

354
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,532
Go to a mall or something,
just walk around?

355
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,742
No, I don't think so.

356
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,745
Sure, yeah, you're right.
It's too soon.

357
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,539
Definitely too soon
for me,

358
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,041
so I'm glad we got
that out of the way.

359
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,335
I'm going to be in touch
with you in three months.

360
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,588
I'm going to call you
about that order.

361
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,673
And maybe
about that mall walk.

362
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:12,966
Okay.

363
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,843
Take care, Julia.

364
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,011
Thank you.

365
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,727
Sorry I tried
to kiss...

366
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,857
We lost the account.

367
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,697
Damn it!

368
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,534
- Dwight Schrute.
- How old is Kelly?

369
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,744
Who is this?

370
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,329
It's Mose.
Who do you think it is?

371
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,915
Mose doesn't know how to use
a phone, so joke's on you.

372
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,292
Look, I'm at the supermarket and
they only have numbered candles.

373
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,460
How old is she?

374
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,754
Twenty-four.
Thirty-seven.

375
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,131
Do you think I'm calling you
for your best approximation?

376
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,216
I'll call you back.

377
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,019
I have here Kelly Kapoor's
personal and confidential file.

378
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,395
Allow me to share.

379
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,526
"Kelly Kapoor spent April
1995 to December 1996

380
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,861
"at Berks County
Youth Center."

381
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,738
Juvie.

382
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:22,869
"According to past employers, it in no way
affects her job..." Blah, blah, blah.

383
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,414
Are you asleep?

384
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,707
No.

385
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,919
Just thinking about
what you said.

386
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,506
About Karen,
about closure.

387
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,594
You remember Holly?
She used to work for HR.

388
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,430
No, remind me.

389
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,224
Blonde hair,

390
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,768
nice boobs.

391
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,520
Not too big,
not too small.

392
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,023
Perfect boobs. Of course
I remember Holly.

393
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,150
She was the
love of my life.

394
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,698
What you and Jim have times a hundred.
Just... She...

395
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,785
She just left
and I didn't...

396
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,370
I never got closure.

397
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,455
You know? I never
got closure with her.

398
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,750
I haven't talked to her since.
I haven't seen her since.

399
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,337
And I feel like I need to go
to Nashua and get closure.

400
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,922
I feel like
I need that.

401
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,220
Okay. Let's go.

402
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,975
Oh, just blow off
the lecture at Rochester?

403
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,646
Yeah. Screw them,
let's do this.

404
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,362
Okay.

405
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,286
I am collecting $3 from
everybody for Kelly's party.

406
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,579
I'd like to contribute.

407
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,039
Oh, great.

408
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,418
Here you go.
