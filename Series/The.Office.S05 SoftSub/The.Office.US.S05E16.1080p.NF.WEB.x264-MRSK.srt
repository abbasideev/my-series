00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,378
Hi.

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,921
Good morning.
Can I help you?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,591
Yes. I'm from Tech Star, about
a new phone system for you.

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:12,261
I was wondering if I could
talk to Michael Scott?

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,847
I'm sorry.
He's not in right now.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,684
Really? He's never
around when I come by.

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:18,768
Shoot.

8
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,687
They have new
phone systems now

9
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,980
that can ring
directly to a salesman,

10
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,441
or someone presses star
and they go to accounting.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,902
Basically, 95% of my job.

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,656
But I'd like to see a machine
that puts out candy for everyone.

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,159
Vending machine.

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,453
How about I make an
appointment to come back?

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,956
That way I know
he'll be here.

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,916
That is a great idea.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,084
Great.

18
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:51,384
Oh, boy! Let's see.
He's really...

19
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,886
Michael Scott, manager.
Hi, how are you?

20
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,096
Hi.
There he is.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,180
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,640
Great. Look at that.

23
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,434
I can assure you we don't
need a new system, though.

24
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,560
We're happy with ours.

25
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,644
Hello. May I help you?

26
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:02,770
Jim-bo.

27
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,023
Jim.

28
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,068
Aye!

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,574
Aye!

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,201
Aye!

31
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,664
Aye!

32
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,545
Okay. I'm going
to get going then.

33
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,921
Aye!

34
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,302
What was that?
That was funny.

35
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,762
That was funny.

36
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,555
Let's go do it
to somebody else.

37
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,848
Aye!

38
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,834
Look at that.

39
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,379
Cupids and hearts. Really shoving
our faces in it this year.

40
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,882
You doing okay, bud?

41
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,008
I miss Stacy.

42
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:18,221
Yeah. I hear you. It's been four
months since I was with Holly

43
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,515
and she was way
hotter than Stacy.

44
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,974
So if you think
you're hurting...

45
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,518
I can't even imagine.

46
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,026
This is our first and only
Valentine's Day as fiancés.

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,361
You're only engaged once.

48
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,988
Well, present company
excluded, but...

49
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,032
Really, Jim?
On Cupid's birthday?

50
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,283
Yeah.

51
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,036
She's fine.

52
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,123
So I received my first Valentine
from a secret admirer.

53
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,338
"Roses are red,
violets are blue.

54
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,217
"It's time for your dental
cleaning and maybe a checkup too."

55
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,226
Wow. Look at those.
How nice for you.

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,894
Up there, front and
center, beautiful.

57
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,064
I think they would
look better right here.

58
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,359
They're very pretty and
I wouldn't want them to fall.

59
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,072
Just about everybody in this
office is single right now.

60
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,198
Including me.

61
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:24,453
And everyone is experiencing an
incredible amount of emotional pain.

62
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:28,666
Especially me, because of my
great capacity for emotion.

63
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,296
And it is my first
Valentine's Day since Holly,

64
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:37,550
so I think that I am well
qualified to understand

65
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,262
that these people need to be
protected from having love

66
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,472
shoved into their faces.

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
Pam, really? They're back?

68
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,977
I can't see them when
they're on the floor.

69
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,562
They're for her
to look at, Michael.

70
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,397
Can I have a word with you?
Yes, let's have a word.

71
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,066
Yes. Jim.

72
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,695
Today is a very difficult day for
a lot of people in this office.

73
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,071
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

74
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,991
And the sexy looks
between you and Pam,

75
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,951
the general sexiness,
the flowers,

76
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,287
it's creating a bit of a
hostile work environment.

77
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,415
I understand. It's so
sexy it becomes hostile.

78
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,209
I actually thought we were
keeping it pretty low-key.

79
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,753
Well, if you guys insist

80
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,713
on having your own
private little love fest...

81
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,756
We do.

82
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,090
...that none of us
can be a part of...

83
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,759
You can't be a part
of our relationship, Michael.

84
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,470
Then we are going to have

85
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,097
our own private
Valentine's Day party.

86
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,182
That sounds fun.
So suck it.

87
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,308
- Yeah.
- Yes.

88
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,269
Hey, everybody, I just
invited Jim to suck it,

89
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,899
and I am cordially inviting all
of you to a special convention,

90
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,277
a lonely hearts convention
this afternoon.

91
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,487
Singles only.

92
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,072
Yeah. Deal with it, Pam!

93
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:45,284
So, we may not have someone
in our lives that we love,

94
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,704
but we do have each other.

95
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,960
Having trouble
finding a vein?

96
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,962
Yeah. A little.

97
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,297
How about now?

98
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,428
I trained my major blood vessels to
retract into my body on command.

99
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,431
Also I can retract my
penis up into itself.

100
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,982
I am about to give blood.
The gift of everlasting life,

101
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,526
the transfer of
my bodily fluids...

102
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,444
Wow, that's a big needle.

103
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,238
You're going to need to
lie down right over here.

104
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,656
Okay. Hello.

105
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,491
Hi. I can't talk right now.
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,659
Okay.

107
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,244
I'm really nervous.

108
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,412
Yeah. Me too.

109
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,496
Yeah?

110
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,165
When I get nervous,
I sort of clam up and...

111
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,333
Well, that's fine.

112
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,627
It's better for me
just to be quiet. Yeah.

113
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,338
Yeah. Can I point
something out to you?

114
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,381
Sure.

115
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,466
You're actually talking a lot.
Yeah. Sorry.

116
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,469
That's the other thing I do
when I get really nervous.

117
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,013
Okay. Here we go.

118
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,180
All right,
here we go.

119
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,890
Oh, God.

120
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,017
Just relax.

121
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,477
Yeah. I'm good.

122
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,980
I feel like
a human juice box.

123
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,064
Oh, God.

124
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,942
Hawaiian blood punch.

125
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,194
That's gross.

126
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,363
Type O-cean Spray.

127
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,949
God, stop. Stop it.

128
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,201
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be cool?

129
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,497
Hey. Why don't you guys come
have lunch with Bob and me?

130
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,041
We'll take all afternoon.

131
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,460
Michael is
terrified of Bob.

132
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,711
What do you think?

133
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,255
I have a lot of work
to do this afternoon.

134
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,216
Those mines aren't going
to sweep themselves.

135
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,469
We're in.

136
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,266
What?
I looked at the bag.

137
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,851
I looked straight
at the bag.

138
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,935
That's not good.

139
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,063
Could you distract me
for a second?

140
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,524
Just talk about things that
don't have blood in them.

141
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:44,445
Well, okay. Bags.

142
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,613
That...

143
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,697
All right.
That was bad.

144
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,074
That was mean.

145
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,742
A hat.
A hat.

146
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,786
A hat with no blood in it.

147
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,662
That is full of soup.

148
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,498
You're cute.
What?

149
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,582
You're done.

150
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,792
Already?

151
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,251
We did it.

152
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,920
Wow, I was
so nervous about this.

153
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,756
I don't think
I ate for three days.

154
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,676
Is he okay?

155
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,396
Oh, my God.
How long was I out?

156
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,776
What?

157
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,404
Excuse me, waitress,
where did the lady go?

158
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,198
She left.

159
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,366
Okay.

160
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,454
Wait a second. Wait a second.
That's hers. This is hers.

161
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,789
She left her glove.

162
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,126
I need her name if I'm
going to return her glove.

163
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,462
I'm sorry, sir. We can't
give out that information.

164
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,637
What are you doing?

165
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,805
Decorating.

166
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,223
I'll help.

167
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,103
Now it's just
a stupid baby.

168
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,564
Yeah. Thanks.

169
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,568
It is so nice to go out
with another couple.

170
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,819
Anything to get
out of that office.

171
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,903
I know.

172
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,198
I honestly don't know how you
can work with that jackass

173
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,660
and that other jackass
and that new jackass.

174
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,120
He's talking about
Michael, Dwight and Andy.

175
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,205
Yeah. I understood.

176
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,751
Well, here we all are,
alone but together.

177
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,128
No flowers for us.

178
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,466
Relationships. We don't need
no stinking relationships.

179
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,181
I think we should all go around and
tell our worst relationship story

180
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,473
and then get past it.

181
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,434
Just blow through it. Yeah?

182
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,770
Kelly, what about Ryan? He
treated you pretty terribly.

183
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,397
Well, his heart was
in the right place.

184
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,816
Yeah, but now his
heart is in Thailand,

185
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:49,069
along with the rest of his
body, having random sex.

186
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,698
Okay. Sorry.
Let's... Who else?

187
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,741
Oscar?

188
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,825
I don't think so.

189
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,203
Come on, I'm sure there's something
you need to get off your chest.

190
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,245
Thank you.

191
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,581
You want to...
Just anything? You sure?

192
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,626
I'm sure whatever you
did wasn't your fault.

193
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,669
Okay, well, who else?

194
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,757
Everyone here who's bowled a
280, please raise your hand.

195
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
No way.
Wow.

196
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,385
A 280?
That's impressive.

197
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,555
Okay, now everyone here who's
bowled under 70 raise their hand.

198
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Yikes.

199
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,933
Come on, Bob, raise your hand.
No, Bob.

200
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,142
No.
What?

201
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,728
One time. You love
bringing up that one time.

202
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,855
Yes, I do.
Jim uses a six-pound ball.

203
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,023
That is a lie.

204
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,900
Yes. He bowled five frames

205
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,320
with this pink sparkly thing until a
little girl had to ask for her ball back.

206
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,031
But that girl must have had monstrous
hands because the holes fit.

207
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,825
No, you just have
little dainty fingers.

208
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,370
You could always
model lady's jewelry.

209
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,788
Nobody asked, Bob.

210
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,583
Do you risk telling
them how you feel?

211
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,420
Do you say something that you
can barely admit to yourself?

212
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,797
God, what did you do?

213
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,424
Not that I approve
of any of it, but...

214
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,511
I was stupid.
I told him.

215
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,596
Was he into you in,
like, a gay way?

216
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,599
Moron, if he was
there wouldn't be a story.

217
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,268
He told me he wasn't gay.

218
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,187
- Really sad.
- I'm not done yet.

219
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,272
Oh, my God.

220
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,316
A week later, a friend
of mine calls me up

221
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:13,529
and he says, "I just saw him
in a gay bar in Kansas City."

222
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,116
Well, then it's a happy
ending, because he was gay.

223
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,450
You should call him.

224
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:23,622
My worst breakup was actually two breakups.
Two different men.

225
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,961
I was in love with both of
them and when things went bad

226
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,379
they had a duel over me.

227
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,547
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.
We were here.

228
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,631
No.

229
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,469
This was years ago when I was living
in Ohio. John Mark and John David.

230
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:42,933
Angela, you had two sets of different
men actually duel over you?

231
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,395
I guess I have.

232
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,148
All right, who's next?
Where's Andy?

233
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,608
He's on one of
his honeymoons.

234
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,735
What?

235
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,988
He made nonrefundable deposits
on his honeymoons,

236
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,490
so he's just knocking
them off one at a time.

237
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,992
I think today he's
hot-air ballooning,

238
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,287
and later he's got
a couples' massage.

239
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,415
My worst breakup
was with Stacy.

240
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,585
It was a Sunday morning.
We were reading the paper

241
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:16,216
and I said, "Oh, my God, I think the
Eagles could clinch the NFC East."

242
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,304
And she said that we're done.

243
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,892
You know what, guys, I don't
think we need to do this.

244
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,019
You're right. Okay,
everyone, back to work.

245
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,689
No, no, no, no. I mean
have this kind of party.

246
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,025
I look around and I see all
these beautiful people

247
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,526
who are alone on Valentine's

248
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,280
and I think that there are other
single people out there, too.

249
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,615
We just need to find them.

250
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,283
There's a girl out
there for all of us.

251
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,702
Maybe even in
this office park.

252
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,246
There has to be a way to get all
these lonely people together.

253
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,539
A net? A giant net?

254
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,375
No, not a giant net.

255
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,459
What do you have in mind?

256
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,628
I was thinking
maybe like a mixer.

257
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,712
Oh, God, that's
a terrible idea.

258
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:54,755
Old-fashioned
meat market.

259
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,881
No.
I don't think it is.

260
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,134
Lonely people mixing with
one another, breeding,

261
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,054
creating an even
lonelier generation?

262
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,890
You're not allowing natural
selection to do its work.

263
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,810
You're like the guy
who invented the seatbelt.

264
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,229
These people need love.

265
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,148
And I am going
to get it for them.

266
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,692
Who cares if we sell a
little bit less paper today?

267
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,902
A great boss cares more

268
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,948
about the happiness of his
employees than anything else.

269
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,741
I am going to be Cupid.

270
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:26,120
And I'm going to shoot my
sparrow at unsuspecting victims

271
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,957
and they are going to get hit
and say, "I'm in love.

272
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,209
"I was hit by
Cupid's sparrow."

273
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,254
Funny little bird,
but he gets the job done.

274
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,047
Hey.

275
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,882
Hey. No movement.

276
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,925
Still early.

277
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,677
Yeah, it's not that early.

278
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,679
So how are you holding up?

279
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,264
I'm okay.
I feel a little lopsided

280
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,224
because of all the blood they
took out of my right side.

281
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,018
No, no. I meant
about being single today.

282
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,562
Meh.
Meh!

283
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,646
Exactly.

284
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,690
Here we go.
Hello.

285
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,316
Hello.

286
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,068
Dwight K. Schrute.

287
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,320
Why don't you introduce me to
your little friend? Hi. Dwight.

288
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,323
Babe alert. Hello. I'm Michael Scott.
Welcome to our little shindig.

289
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,450
Hi. I'm Lynn.

290
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,868
Lynn, follow me.
Come on in.

291
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:06,952
Here we go.

292
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,912
For you we have one
of our top people,

293
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:13,375
Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here.
Show your beautiful self.

294
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,794
Hello.

295
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,879
Hi.

296
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,508
So run with the ball.
Run with it, Kev.

297
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,512
Where are you from?

298
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,597
I'm from here.

299
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,475
Yeah, okay. Well, he
only gets better.

300
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,310
Thank you, Michael.
Okay.

301
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,646
I can untie any knot.
I'm serious.

302
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,398
Name a knot, any knot.
Go ahead.

303
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,317
I believe you.

304
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,402
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

305
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,572
In fact, there are many knots
that I cannot untie.

306
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,828
So what's a woman as charming as
yourself find herself employed

307
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,622
on a day such as today?

308
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,749
I work at a place
that does catalogs for

309
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,585
community colleges
and small businesses.

310
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,378
You must use a lot of paper.

311
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,255
Oh, God, tons of it.

312
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,887
What's the rule
about eating

313
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,347
when people are
in the bathroom?

314
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,225
I think if you ordered hot
food you're allowed to eat.

315
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,809
Damn.

316
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,855
They've been in there
for like ten minutes.

317
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,318
Look at that.
Bob ordered hot food.

318
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,111
Yes.

319
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,948
And I think they
gave him too many fries.

320
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,533
We should help him out.

321
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,790
At the Circle Drive-in,
they show old movies.

322
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,792
It's really cool.

323
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,418
That does sound cool.

324
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,921
I used to go there
with my fiancée.

325
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:47,302
Before she left me.
I mean, before I left her.

326
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,932
She left me.

327
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,726
Shoot.

328
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,603
I think I blew it.

329
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,815
It all happened so fast.

330
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,443
So fast.

331
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,572
So, Erik, you
mentioned before

332
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,907
that you are in
tool and die repair.

333
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,033
I am.

334
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,744
Meredith recently had
a total hysterectomy.

335
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,080
So that's sort of a repair.

336
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,709
All right,
I'll let you guys talk.

337
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,046
It's going very well. People are mixing.
A lot of hope,

338
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,300
'cause that's what you hate to
see, when hope gets crushed.

339
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,179
Sorry. Thought I heard
somebody coming in.

340
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,017
So, it's not too late.

341
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,983
And the kind of discounts we're
talking about are not...

342
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,736
Hold on. Michael, why do you
keep looking at the front door?

343
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,279
No reason.
Is somebody after you?

344
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,322
Why do you always
go to that?

345
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,282
Has anyone ever been after
anyone in this office?

346
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,783
Hey, it just takes one.

347
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,160
Nobody's after me. I just...

348
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,120
I met a woman when
I was giving blood

349
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,747
and I thought
she might come by.

350
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,249
You met a woman when you were giving blood?
That is so romantic.

351
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,877
It's not a big deal, really.
I just, you know,

352
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,296
met somebody.
We hardly talked.

353
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,550
I picked up her glove so I was
hoping I could give it back to her.

354
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,219
Oh, my God, that makes it
even more romantic.

355
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,264
This is like a modern-day Enchanted.
It's like a fairytale.

356
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,474
She could be
your soul mate.

357
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,683
Not likely.

358
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:17,934
With three billion
women on the planet,

359
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,687
most of them live in Asia, so
the numbers just don't add up.

360
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,813
It's possible.
Could be.

361
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,483
Believe me, it's nothing.
I hardly even talked to her.

362
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,985
We just... We were lying
there next to each other.

363
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,987
I think our
blood bags touched.

364
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,072
Aww!

365
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,993
Here they come.
What?

366
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,328
No. Just kidding.

367
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,163
Seriously though,
that's enough.

368
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,998
Why don't you cover it
with the broccoli?

369
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,043
Great, I have to cover it?

370
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,670
Do you think they
dined and dashed?

371
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,423
They didn't dine so, yeah,
maybe they just dashed.

372
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,718
I thought we were
having a nice time.

373
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,886
We were.

374
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,970
Yeah.

375
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,310
Empty.
Mine too.

376
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,066
Oh, boy.
Oh, my God.

377
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,275
Okay.

378
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,904
Hi. Is this the party?

379
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:13,949
Nah.

380
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,212
Okay then.

381
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,429
So...

382
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,555
Where were we?

383
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,681
Bowling.

384
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,892
Yep, yeah, yep.

385
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,479
You didn't eat
much there, Jim-bo.

386
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,733
Initially I did.

387
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,942
Want some meat?

388
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,404
Sure, a little piece.
No mushroom, though.

389
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,488
I forgot.

390
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,948
Yeah. Thank you.

391
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:05,917
Hey, I'm sorry we did not
have a chance to talk more.

392
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,505
I get very nervous
talking to pretty girls.

393
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,134
Seriously,
feel how sweaty my hand is.

394
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,678
That's really sweaty.

395
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,221
Are you on e-mail?

396
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,389
Yeah.

397
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,520
Cool. Okay, bye.

398
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,688
Bye, Kevin.

399
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,986
Good Valentine's.

400
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,072
So basically the greater
volume you decide to buy in,

401
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,116
the greater discount
we can give you. Okay.

402
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,451
Okay? What's up?

403
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,661
Look, I'm going to go.

404
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,122
Before you go, I'd just love to
get a firm commitment on this.

405
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,332
You know, maybe sign...

406
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,667
Look, we already
have a paper supplier.

407
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,711
Okay.

408
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:54,549
Well, thanks for wasting
my time tonight, idiot. God!

409
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,220
Hey. You don't
deserve her.

410
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,806
Thanks, Michael.

411
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,271
Hey, if anybody wants to go...

412
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,943
We can stay a little longer.

413
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,361
- Really?
- Yeah.

414
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,029
- Yeah. Sure, Michael.
- Yeah.

415
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,781
No, this is great.
Absolutely.

416
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,949
Yeah.

417
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,451
Thanks.

418
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,473
Michael, it's time.

419
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,559
You know what?
You guys can get out.

420
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,894
I'm going to soldier
on for a little bit.

421
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,105
Come on. We'll all go.

422
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,606
Yeah.
Yeah. Let's go.

423
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,652
Okay.

424
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,614
Four months ago,
I dated a woman named Holly,

425
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,578
and this is actually the first
time that I've even considered

426
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,455
getting back into
that arena again.

427
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,041
You know what?
Sometimes it's not about

428
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,545
whether Cinderella
gets her slipper back,

429
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:18,925
but it's about the fact that the prince
even picked up the slipper at all.

430
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,304
There's a lot of
princesses out there.

431
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,225
You know, they have
all different sizes

432
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,811
and shapes of
feet and hands,

433
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,899
so I think...

434
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,650
I think my odds
are pretty good.

435
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,488
Pardon me, may I have
a chocolate chip cookie?

436
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,949
I gave blood earlier
and I'm still feeling woozy.

437
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,784
Of course.

438
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,746
That's weird.
You got a cotton ball

439
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,915
and tape and we've
been using Band-Aids.

440
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,085
I feel so woozy, I just...
Using Band-Aids.

441
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,253
Damn.
