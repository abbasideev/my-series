1
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,070
Last week,
I gave a fire safety talk,

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,782
and nobody paid
any attention.

3
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,785
It's my own fault
for using PowerPoint.

4
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,328
PowerPoint is boring.

5
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,206
People learn in
lots of different ways,

6
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,209
but experience is
the best teacher.

7
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,592
Today, smoking is
going to save lives.

8
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,281
Does anyone
smell anything smoky?

9
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,908
Did you bring
your jerky in again?

10
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,790
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

11
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,584
Fire!

12
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,170
Oh, fire! Oh, my goodness.
What's the procedure?

13
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,005
What do we do, people?
The phones are dead.

14
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,298
Oh. How did that happen?

15
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,424
It's out in the hall.

16
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,467
No. We don't know that.

17
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,926
The smoke could be coming
through an air duct.

18
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,553
Oh, my God!
Okay, it's happening.

19
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,804
Everybody stay calm.
Everybody stay calm!

20
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,222
What's the
procedure, everyone?

21
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,974
What's the procedure?
Stay... calm!

22
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,351
Everybody just... calm down!

23
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,645
No, no, Michael, no!
Touch the handle.

24
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,690
If it's hot there could
be a fire in the hallway!

25
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,693
What does warm mean? Oh, my gosh.
Try a different door.

26
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,820
Not a viable option.
What next?

27
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,113
- Don't run!
- Try the other door.

28
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,116
Here's a door. Check that one out.
How's the handle?

29
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,118
It's warm. Okay, go
to the back door.

30
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,120
Well, another option.
Another option.

31
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,747
Jeez! Okay,
settle down, everyone!

32
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,790
I forgot my purse!

33
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,041
Leave it, woman!

34
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,250
Get out of the way!
Go, go, go, go, go!

35
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,794
Things can be replaced,
Phyllis!

36
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,213
People, human lives,
however...

37
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,092
My hand! That's hot!

38
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,677
This one's hot, too.

39
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,721
Okay, we're trapped.
Everyone for himself!

40
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,307
Let's go! Let's go!
Get out of my way!

41
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,601
Okay. Okay. Okay!

42
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,727
Get out of the way!

43
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,687
Have you ever
seen a burn victim?

44
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,814
Move it!

45
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,233
Okay!
Procedure! Procedure!

46
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,860
Exit options!
Where do we go, folks?

47
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,695
Use a what to cover the mouth?
It's okay.

48
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,658
A what? A rag,
a damp rag perhaps.

49
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,327
Let's remember those procedures.
What are the options?

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,079
Okay! That's the wrong way.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

51
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,040
We've already tried that.
Remember your exit points.

52
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,458
Exit points, people.
Oscar?

53
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:48,751
What's next, huh?
Oscar!

54
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:49,961
Stay alive, I'm getting help!

55
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,045
Pull me up!

56
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,129
You're too heavy.

57
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,381
I only weigh 82 pounds.

58
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,925
Save Bandit!

59
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,597
How about 911? Anyone? 911?

60
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,359
What do we do?

61
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,486
Use the surge of
fear and adrenaline

62
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,988
to sharpen
your decision making.

63
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,574
Okay, I am not dying here.
Come on.

64
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,287
What is that?
What is that?

65
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,706
The fire's shooting at us!

66
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,667
What in the name of God
is going on?

67
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,170
I'm trying to...

68
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,392
Help! Help!

69
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,144
Oh, my God!

70
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,694
Attention!
Employees of Dunder Mifflin!

71
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,197
This has been a test of our
emergency preparedness.

72
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,491
There's no fire.
It was only a simulation.

73
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,576
What?

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,330
Fire not real. This was
merely a training exercise.

75
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,458
So what have we learned?

76
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,501
Oh, come on.
It's not real, Stanley.

77
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,586
Oh, my God.

78
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,712
Don't have
a heart attack.

79
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,255
No, no, no, no,
you will not die!

80
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,675
Stanley! Stanley!
You will not die! Stanley!

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,928
Stanley! Barack is President!

82
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,472
You are black, Stanley! I'm
gonna give him mouth-to-mouth.

83
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,223
No, no, no. Don't give him
mouth-to-mouth for this.

84
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,516
He just swallowed
his tongue.

85
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,895
Michael! Michael! Open your mouth.
Don't swallow it!

86
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,483
I'm fine! Leave me...
I'm saving him!

87
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,226
How could you possibly
think this is a good idea?

88
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,687
A lot of ideas were not
appreciated in their time.

89
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,021
Electricity.
Shampoo.

90
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,107
You could have burned down
the whole building.

91
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,901
I just want to say, for the
record, I did not kill anyone.

92
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,945
Stanley was attacked
by his own heart.

93
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,947
And he should be
released from the hospital

94
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,407
and back in the office
in a couple days.

95
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,660
Did you shout "fire,"
causing a panic?

96
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,746
Yes, I shouted "fire."
I shouted many things.

97
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,666
I also shouted instructions on
how to get out of the building.

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,335
So you can imagine my
frustration, as safety officer,

99
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,587
when nobody would heed of...

100
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,589
Heeded... Heeded of...
"Head." "Head."

101
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,841
When no one headed...
"Take headed of."

102
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,510
No one would take headed
of my instructions.

103
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,178
So you...
"Heed." "Heed."

104
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,263
"Take heed of."
"Take heed of."

105
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,850
And I don't see my co-workers
heeding this right now.

106
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,312
Wait, what?

107
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,522
Okay.

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,910
The city.

109
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,122
Dwight.

110
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,917
We are not mad,
we are just disappointed.

111
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,335
No, we are mad.

112
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,213
Yes, we are.
We are livid.

113
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,215
But we are going to
let this one slide.

114
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,592
Thank you.
No, we're not.

115
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,927
I am not
a mind reader, David.

116
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,849
Look, this is
a very serious offense.

117
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,267
We have cause to fire you.

118
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,436
Can you shove down?

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,898
Instead...
Shove down, please.

120
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,233
Instead what I think
we should do is

121
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,944
strip you of your title
as safety officer. No.

122
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,238
And we should take
a part of his pay

123
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,741
and donate it to the
charity of your choice.

124
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,992
Something that
Dwight doesn't like.

125
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,077
PETA.

126
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,371
Michael, you have to
take responsibility here.

127
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,791
One of your employees
had a heart attack.

128
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,459
He could have died
because of the way

129
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,960
you're allowing
your office to run.

130
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,754
Do you want that
on your conscience?

131
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,214
Do you?

132
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,757
Michael?
Are you talking to me?

133
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,550
Yeah.

134
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,718
What?

135
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,015
Well, I guess we papered
over that pretty nicely.

136
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,727
Always amuses me when corporate
thinks they can make some big change

137
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,980
with a 20-minute meeting
in some fancy high rise.

138
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,359
What's the matter?
Are you hungry?

139
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,153
No, Dwight,
I am worried.

140
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,781
A man's life is
in my hands.

141
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,324
Now don't you
worry about that.

142
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,368
I got it covered. Okay?

143
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,704
I am planning a bomb scare that
should really get the blood pumping.

144
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,373
That's not going to happen.

145
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,792
I'm taking over
as safety man.

146
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,418
What? You?
Yes.

147
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,878
Come on.
I'm a smart guy.

148
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,840
That's preposterous. I'll figure it out.
No. I will.

149
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,969
Nobody should have to
go to work thinking,

150
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,139
"Oh, this is the place
that I might die today."

151
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,058
That's what a hospital's for.

152
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,603
An office is for not dying.

153
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:07,236
An office is a place to live life
to the fullest, to the max. To...

154
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,075
An office is a place
where dreams come true.

155
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,914
Don't excite him.
Don't make him excitable.

156
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,878
Welcome back, Stanley.

157
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,588
Thank you, Michael.

158
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,257
It's true, around this
office in the past

159
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,467
I have been a little
abrupt with people.

160
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,969
Not maybe, yes or no.

161
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,012
No way. Uh-uh.

162
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,471
Are you from another planet?

163
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,681
Boy, have you
lost your mind?

164
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,974
Because I'll
help you find it!

165
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,058
Did I stutter?

166
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,894
I'm done. Goodbye.

167
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,356
But the doctor said
if I can't find a new way

168
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,235
to relate more positively to my
surroundings, I'm going to die.

169
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,737
Andy.

170
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,198
A throne for your highness.

171
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,491
I'm not sitting
in a wheelchair.

172
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,659
No, no, no.
No debate.

173
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,036
You are going to
sit in that wheelchair

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,787
until you are
back on your feet.

175
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,332
I'm going to die.

176
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,877
ABC, okay?

177
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,172
And that stands for "Airway,
Breathing and Circulation."

178
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,216
Okay. You know what? That
could be a little confusing,

179
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,927
because in sales ABC
means "Always Be Closing."

180
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,095
This is a farce. I should
be teaching this course.

181
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,222
Shut it. Shut it.

182
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:20,226
We found ourselves on the
less prepared side of things

183
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,894
when Stanley had his...

184
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,604
When his heart went berserk.

185
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,564
And I knew
exactly what to do.

186
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,485
But in a much more real sense,
I had no idea what to do.

187
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,571
So I thought we should have
a CPR training class.

188
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,283
And of course you can't
get the practice dummy

189
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,744
unless the instructor
comes along with it.

190
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,121
Red Cross and their racket.

191
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,251
I can't keep
doing this forever.

192
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,961
It's been 20 seconds.

193
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,631
Call it.

194
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,007
Would you like to try next?

195
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,968
Absolutely I would not.

196
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,345
You know who I really
think should go?

197
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,222
Stanley.

198
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,598
Oh, I don't know.

199
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,393
It's not a good idea, Michael.
He needs to rest.

200
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,270
No rest for the sick.

201
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,025
We are not always
going to be there

202
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,114
to coddle your heart back when
it disappears to be working.

203
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,783
What are you going to do if you're
by yourself and your heart stops?

204
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,243
I would die.

205
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,619
And you're
okay with that?

206
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,454
I'm okay with
the logic of it.

207
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,624
Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on.
Get up. Let's do this.

208
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,459
Yes,
I had a heart attack.

209
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,462
I would quit, but I'm too
old to find another job.

210
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,631
And I don't have
enough saved to retire.

211
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,551
I feel like I'm
working in my own casket.

212
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,053
Come on, Stanley!
You're losing you!

213
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,972
You're losing you! Do it!

214
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,974
Michael. This is you
we're talking about.

215
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,058
Michael.

216
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,269
Okay, okay, I'll show them.
Here we go.

217
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,690
- All right.
- So assessing the situation.

218
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,358
Are they breathing?

219
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,403
No, Rose.
They are not breathing.

220
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,197
And they have no arms or legs.

221
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,407
No, that's not part of it.

222
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,575
Where are they?

223
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,952
You know what?
If we come across somebody

224
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,998
with no arms or legs, do we
bother resuscitating them?

225
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,417
I mean, what kind of quality
of life do we have there?

226
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,210
I would want to
live with no legs.

227
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,962
How about no arms?

228
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,673
No arms or legs is basically how
you exist right now, Kevin.

229
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,008
You don't do anything.

230
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,636
All right. Well, let's get back
to it, because you're losing him.

231
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,013
Okay, too fast.

232
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,891
Everyone, we need to pump at a
pace of 100 beats per minute.

233
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,436
Okay. That's hard to keep track.
How many is that per hour?

234
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,562
How is that
going to help you?

235
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,023
I will divide and then count to it.
Right.

236
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,483
Okay, well, a good trick

237
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,319
is to pump to the tune of
Staying Alive by the Bee Gees.

238
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,362
Do you know that song?

239
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,781
Yes, yes. I do.
I love that song.

240
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,825
First I was afraid,
I was petrified

241
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,452
No, it's...

242
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,288
Stayin' alive,
stayin' alive

243
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,248
Okay. That's enough. You were
in the parking lot earlier.

244
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,209
That's how I know you.

245
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,840
Stayin' alive,
stayin' alive

246
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,387
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

247
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,139
Well, you can tell by
the way I use my walk

248
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,392
I'm a woman's man,
no time to talk

249
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,479
Music loud, women warm Been
kicked around since I was born

250
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,606
Well, it's all right
It's okay

251
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,817
You can look the other way

252
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,736
Okay! Okay!

253
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,242
Stayin' alive,
stayin' alive

254
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,203
Yeah. Okay, you didn't maintain
a hundred beats per minute.

255
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,331
And the ambulance didn't arrive
because nobody called 911.

256
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,416
So you lost him.

257
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,210
Okay, he's dead.
Anyone know what we do next?

258
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,295
Anybody? Rose?

259
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,672
I have no idea.
Anyone else?

260
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,591
We bury him. Wrong! Check
for an organ donor card.

261
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,635
If he has one, we only
have minutes to harvest.

262
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,761
He has no wallet,
I checked.

263
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,388
He is an organ donor.
He is?

264
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,723
Get me some ice
and Styrofoam bucket.

265
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,183
Here we go.

266
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,852
- Oh, my God!
- Dwight!

267
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,061
Dwight!

268
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,312
Dwight, what are you...

269
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,439
What are you doing?

270
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,275
We search for the organs. Where's
the heart? The precious heart.

271
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,444
I'm not feeling well.
I need to sit down.

272
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,112
Stanley.

273
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,989
Hey, Stanley.
Stanley.

274
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,157
Are you okay?

275
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,492
Oh, my God!

276
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,618
Oh, my God!

277
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,537
Dwight!
Clarice.

278
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,122
Oh, my God.

279
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,959
Can you tell me why you had to
cut the face off the dummy?

280
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,044
I didn't think it was very
realistic in the movie,

281
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,589
and it turns out
it's pretty realistic.

282
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,633
We had to pay for it.
It cost us $3,500.

283
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,970
$5,300 for a dummy?
Wow.

284
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,805
Well, okay, look.

285
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,184
David, this is
why we have training.

286
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,729
We start with the dummy and
we learn from our mistakes.

287
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,649
And now Dwight knows not to cut
the face off of a real person.

288
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,993
Hope you brought your
apetitos, my lady, my Tuna.

289
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,121
A little movie popcorn.

290
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,959
Damn it.

291
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,170
This movie,
a lot of buzz.

292
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,714
Not coming out
for another six months.

293
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,383
Mrs. Albert Hanaday.

294
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,929
So the friendship with the
Nard-Dog has its privileges.

295
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,599
We don't normally
download films illegally

296
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,976
because we're honest,
hard-working people.

297
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,394
And we don't know how.

298
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,855
But Andy does, so we have
to watch it with him.

299
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,982
Punishment fits
the crime.

300
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:25,989
I want you to meet my nana.
Nana, this is Sam.

301
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,660
Hi. Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Hanaday.

302
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,537
Please, call me Lily.

303
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,965
Let's play bridge.
You can be my partner.

304
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,677
All right, Lily.

305
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,482
What's going on?

306
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,110
No one really knows, but Pam's
parents are going through

307
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,237
a little bit of a rough
patch in their marriage.

308
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,073
My dad spent the night
at our place last night.

309
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,910
My parents have been fighting
for weeks and it kind of sucks.

310
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,370
Jim's been great.

311
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,332
But I'm going to need
to buy my dad a robe.

312
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,459
He's not saying
what he needs to say.

313
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,586
Hmm?

314
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,630
Who? Jack Black?

315
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,923
Yeah.

316
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,594
I mean, they just need to
communicate, you know.

317
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,723
If they said to each other what they're
saying to everyone else, then...

318
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,685
Hmm.

319
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,023
Jim and Pam are
like movie geniuses.

320
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,861
They're catching things that are
totally going over my head.

321
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,405
Hi, everyone.

322
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,658
Corporate has given
Dwight two strikes.

323
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,453
They are very,
very upset with him.

324
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,080
So, as a
disciplinary measure,

325
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,835
he is going to have to
issue a formal apology.

326
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,131
Dwight, have you prepared
your statement of regret?

327
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,133
I have.
Let's hear it.

328
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,014
I state my regret.

329
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,809
You couldn't have
memorized that?

330
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,478
I could not
because I do not feel it.

331
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,812
Okay, everyone,
I'm going to need you

332
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,773
to sign
this statement of regret

333
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,816
as an acknowledgment
that you heard it.

334
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,985
Okay? Everyone come on up here.
It's not a big deal.

335
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,446
It is a big deal.
You almost killed Stanley.

336
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,282
Yeah, right. I filled him full
of butter and sugar for 50 years

337
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,242
and forced him
not to exercise.

338
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,786
Now take a lesson
from Stanley

339
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,330
and jog on up here
and sign this. Okay?

340
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,583
Make a line. Just form
a line right here.

341
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,712
Sign it! Sign it now!

342
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,635
Hi, Dad.

343
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,345
Yeah, Jim has shaving cream.

344
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,805
Check our bathroom.

345
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,182
Lily?

346
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,267
I'm in here.

347
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,234
I... I'm sorry.
I didn't

348
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,321
realize you were
in the bath.

349
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,785
Do you want me to go?

350
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,955
I want you to stay.

351
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,383
Oh, boy.

352
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,884
Oh, man.

353
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,638
You know, Lily was supposed
to be Nicole Kidman.

354
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,308
And it was going to be
Sophie's mom, not grandmother.

355
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,977
But then Nicole Kidman
dropped out,

356
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,730
so they went with
Cloris Leachman,

357
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,565
- with a small rewrite.
- Just give me your hand

358
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,816
and get that in there.

359
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,901
Help me pull it around.

360
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,570
Oh, yeah. You did
that one already.

361
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,530
I know,
but if I get it deeper...

362
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,948
What is...

363
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,998
He was pretty
talkative at breakfast.

364
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,916
What?

365
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,503
Breakfast?

366
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,882
You mean when they
were eating soup?

367
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,092
I don't think
that was breakfast.

368
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,429
Unless soup... Does soup
symbolize breakfast?

369
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,805
So he doesn't share
with his daughter,

370
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,099
but he shares with
his daughter's fiancé?

371
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,351
You guys, they're making out.

372
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,647
Hey.
Hey.

373
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,734
Did my dad say
anything about my mom?

374
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,737
No. We mostly just
talked about cereal.

375
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,908
What?

376
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,451
I don't know.

377
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,120
I mean, maybe he'll talk to
you about some of the stuff

378
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,831
'cause he can't
really talk to me about it.

379
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,793
Mmm...
You're good to talk to.

380
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,297
I'm okay. I'm not great. And...

381
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,100
Everybody sit on the floor,
Indian-style like me.

382
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,646
My God,
if you're wearing a dress,

383
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,856
please keep your knees together,
nobody wants to see that.

384
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,487
My goal is to make
this office as peaceful

385
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,073
a place for Stanley Hudson
as I can.

386
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,244
And I think sounds have
a lot to do with that.

387
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,121
Here are some downloaded
peaceful sounds.

388
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,922
That one makes me think

389
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,174
of death.

390
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,762
It's kind of nice.

391
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:45,934
It is
a beautiful, sunny day

392
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,271
as we walk
through the meadow.

393
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:54,192
That is very
spiritual and relaxing.

394
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,655
And there are flowers and
it is sunny and beautiful.

395
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,409
Now, up ahead,
a castle in the distance.

396
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,578
Don't open your eyes.
What? Oh.

397
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:08,957
And you walk up
toward the castle.

398
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:15,046
And inside the castle
are four men,

399
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,506
and each of them...

400
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,717
None of them have shoes.

401
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,677
And they give you
a funny cigarette

402
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,096
and you feel
even more relaxed,

403
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,224
and then you want ice cream.

404
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,059
You want a big bowl
of ice cream.

405
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,020
So what kind of ice cream do you want?
Yell it out.

406
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,062
Chunky Monkey.

407
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,856
Too expensive.
Chocolate.

408
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,316
Racism is dead, Stanley.

409
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,860
You can have any kind
of ice cream you want.

410
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,570
What do you want?

411
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,614
What is that?
People, please,

412
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,324
I told you to get rid
of the cell phones.

413
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,826
It's my bio-feedback machine.

414
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,913
Oh, okay. What is that,
like a video game?

415
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:52,500
It alerts me when my stress level
goes up, so I can try to calm down.

416
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,919
You have stress?

417
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,170
Yes.

418
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,422
During our
relaxation exercise?

419
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,590
Let me
get you some water.

420
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,133
No, no, I'll help you up.
I'll help you up.

421
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,343
Here we go. Here we go.
Let me get you up.

422
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,761
No, Michael.
Would you step back?

423
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,930
Please, please.
Okay. All right.

424
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,015
- A little further.
- Okay.

425
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,435
That's better.

426
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,362
Okay.

427
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,907
I think that thing
is on the fritz.

428
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,870
Oscar, would you reach over
and touch his thing?

429
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,374
That's what he said. Right, guys?
Because of gay.

430
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,378
Let's give this a shot.

431
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,296
Hello!

432
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,553
Michael, I think you're what's
stressing everybody out.

433
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,558
So it wasn't
Dwight after all.

434
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,560
Looks like I'm the killer.

435
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,896
You never expect
that you're the killer.

436
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,900
It's a great twist.
Great twist.

437
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,825
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.

438
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:11,162
Oh. Hey, Mom. No.

439
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,916
What did Dad say?

440
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,337
What did you say to my dad?

441
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,422
What?

442
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,965
After you talked,
he called my mom

443
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,341
and said he was gonna look
for an apartment.

444
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,927
Oh, my God. Pam, I don't know.
I...

445
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,014
Nothing, truly nothing.

446
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,266
I mean, I just was
honest with him and I...

447
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,979
I'm so sorry. I don't know.
I'll call him again.

448
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,361
50 percent of marriages
end in divorce,

449
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,990
so it was her parents
or my parents.

450
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,456
What could Jim have said to make
my dad want to leave my mom?

451
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,959
And at what point in our marriage
is he gonna say it to me?

452
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,758
I don't get it.

453
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,260
Do I stress you out?

454
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,262
Nothing stresses me out.

455
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,725
Except having to seek
the approval of my inferiors.

456
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,477
Speaking of which...

457
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,068
Remember when
people used to say "boss"

458
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,738
when they were describing
something that was really cool?

459
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:31,367
Like, "Those shoulder pads
are really boss, man."

460
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,163
"Look at that perm.
That perm is so boss."

461
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,875
It's what made me
want to become a boss.

462
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,546
And I looked so good
in a perm and shoulder pads.

463
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:49,552
But now boss is just slang
for "jerk in charge."

464
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,765
Okay, everybody,
I figured it out.

465
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,143
The reason that you are
all so stressed around me

466
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,062
is that you are
too intimidated

467
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,065
to tell me
what you really think.

468
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:06,236
You are keeping these feelings
inside and that is causing stress.

469
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,904
So, what is the solution?

470
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:12,117
Solution is honesty,
laughter and comedy.

471
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,910
In short...
A vacation.

472
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:20,375
What? No. No. I'm talking about
a roast of Michael Scott.

473
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,337
Come on. Who here has the
Comedy Central Roast Channel?

474
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,505
You've seen it, right?

475
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,676
Everybody gets together and you start
hurling insults at the one guy,

476
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,471
and everybody's laughing and
everybody is hugging each other.

477
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,974
Michael, are you serious? Do you
really want us to roast you?

478
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,893
That's offensive.
It's not!

479
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,147
It's not offensive during a roast.
Anything goes.

480
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,190
And I want you guys to
really get cracking on this.

481
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:47,152
I want you to take me down.
Don't hold back.

482
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,989
I want you to really make fun
of anything about me.

483
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,200
It could be my race, could
be the fact that I'm so fit,

484
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,787
or I'm a womanizer,
fair game. Whatever.

485
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,664
I don't want to write
your stuff for you,

486
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,374
but I just want it
to be good.

487
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,504
Oh, my God.
Oh, man. Oh, my God.

488
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,923
I consider myself
a good person,

489
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,384
but I'm gonna try
to make him cry.

490
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,681
I can already feel people's
stress starting to melt.

491
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,268
I think they're very excited about
paying their respects this way.

492
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:25,273
I've got to make sure that
YouTube comes down to tape this.

493
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,446
May I have your attention,
please? Sign in.

494
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,782
Sign in on the sign-in sheet,
the clipboard.

495
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,867
This meeting is mandatory,

496
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,912
if you do not sign in,
your name will not be counted.

497
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,246
Thank you.

498
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,749
Hey, this is
your apology letter.

499
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,627
It was the last signature
I needed.

500
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,506
Welcome, welcome,
welcome, welcome, welcome!

501
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,258
You are all jerks.

502
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,054
Just kidding.
Not yet, anyway.

503
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,098
Welcome to the roast
of Mr. Michael Scott.

504
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,100
If you are here for
the Grabowski wedding,

505
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,853
it is the second door
on the left.

506
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,064
So, we all know
how these work.

507
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,108
It needs to get crazy.
Take your best shot.

508
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,277
I'm going to sit
right over chair.

509
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:16,824
And whoever wants to come up
and roast me, you may. Okay.

510
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,579
Lower the mike
for the midget.

511
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,459
If you ever wondered whether
you were Michael Scott,

512
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,795
here's a quiz to help.

513
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,966
If you ever put sun block on a
window, you might be Michael Scott.

514
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,012
I normally don't enjoy
making people laugh.

515
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,432
If you ever called
the fire department

516
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,519
because your head was stuck in
your chair, you might be...

517
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,187
Michael Scott.

518
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,484
Hey, hey.

519
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,112
I don't go make burgers
where you work

520
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,239
and then tell you
how to make burgers.

521
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,285
I have made a list of people
that I would make out with

522
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,662
before I would make out
with Michael Scott.

523
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,582
A turtle, a fridge,
anybody from the warehouse.

524
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
Yeah!

525
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:13,464
A wood chipper, Kevin,
a candle and Lord Voldemort.

526
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,882
Anyway,
happy birthday, Michael.

527
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:15,967
Yeah.

528
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,636
You'd be so lucky. Good one.

529
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,890
Michael, you ran over
me with your car.

530
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:29,147
You posted a picture of my bare
boobs on the bulletin board

531
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,441
with a caption
that said, "Gross."

532
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,525
Well...

533
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,653
Michael, you are
the reason I drink.

534
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,281
You are the reason
I live to forget.

535
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,586
No, no, friends only.
Friends only!

536
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,257
Several times a day,
Michael says words

537
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,634
that are way
beyond my vocabulary.

538
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,802
I know where
this is going.

539
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:00,887
Do you?
No.

540
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,722
Okay.
Remember spider face?

541
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,848
No.

542
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,183
Okay, because
the quote was,

543
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,352
"Cut off your nose
to spider face."

544
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,436
Spider... Okay.

545
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,189
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,358
How dare you all
attack him like this?

547
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,442
No, stop it.

548
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,527
Michael is your superior, okay?
Dwight. No, no, no, no.

549
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,446
You should be bowing
down in front of him.

550
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,739
Hey, hey. Right now. Okay?

551
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,282
They don't understand who they have.
That is the way

552
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,034
you're supposed to do it, idiot.
You're interrupting me.

553
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,952
I'm trying to get your back.
I'm trying to... Idiot, idiot.

554
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,704
Idiot. Are you
calling me an idiot?

555
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,539
Don't you ever
talk to me that way,

556
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,458
you pathetic
short little man.

557
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,920
You don't have any friends
or any family or any land!

558
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,132
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

559
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,219
Well, I just want to take a
minute to talk to you all

560
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,845
about something
very serious.

561
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,058
Once every hour, someone is
involved in an Internet scam.

562
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,394
That man is
Michael Scott.

563
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,688
He's supporting about
20 Nigerian princesses.

564
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:56,692
Hey, you know what?
Forgive me for caring, right?

565
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,571
Well, you know, Michael
is a great delegator.

566
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,532
He never does
any work himself, ever.

567
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,539
And one time I walked in on him
naked and his thing is so small.

568
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,417
How small is it?

569
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,502
If it were an iPod,
it would be a shuffle.

570
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,339
All right, can I make
just a little announcement?

571
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,592
In a professional roast,
usually the roaster

572
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,720
will say something nice about
the roastee after they're done.

573
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:29,100
Something about how much they love
them, so just keep that in mind.

574
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,018
Mike claims
we're all a family.

575
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,603
You know what... We are.
We are a family.

576
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,107
Okay, so, what's his name?

577
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,567
All the way in
the back there.

578
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,277
Oh, very funny.

579
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,695
What's his name?

580
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,779
Uh...

581
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,782
I'm thinking Roy.

582
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,493
Roy left years ago.
What's his name?

583
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,537
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

584
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,456
Michael, I gave you
a ride home last week

585
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,958
and we spent
an hour in traffic.

586
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,960
What's his name?
Jefferson.

587
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,796
Nope. His name is Michael.

588
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,476
What I hate about you

589
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,394
You really suck as a boss

590
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:19,442
You're the laziest, jerkiest And
you're dumber than an apple sauce

591
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,030
We're stuck
listening to you all day

592
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,824
Stanley tried to die
just to get away

593
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,409
Well, it's true

594
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,204
That's what I hate about you

595
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,123
That's what I hate about you

596
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,009
Yeah!

597
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:52,767
And now a man who deserves no
introduction, Michael Scott.

598
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:00,024
Thank you very much.
Thank you. That was great.

599
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,318
Great job, some great laughs.

600
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,907
Really, really went after
my intelligence there.

601
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:13,412
Dozens of online IQ tests
might prove you wrong, but...

602
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:20,753
And my thing isn't tiny, it's
average, so get your facts straight.

603
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:29,303
So when I heard that there was going to
be a roast in my honor, I thought...

604
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,641
Sorry. I think I have
a frog in my throat.

605
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,059
Um...

606
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:42,650
I decided to jot down some quick
thoughts about you people.

607
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:44,944
Um...

608
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,324
First up, Phyllis and Kevin.

609
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,952
Um...

610
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,272
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.

611
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,399
I'm sorry, Michael's
not here right now.

612
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,192
Can I take a message?

613
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,487
Great. I will. Thanks.

614
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,703
It's very unusual for Michael
not to show up to work.

615
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,955
My guess,
he's either deeply depressed

616
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,043
or an icicle has snapped off his
roof and impaled his brain.

617
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,338
He has this terrible habit of
standing directly underneath them

618
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,631
and staring up at them.

619
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,758
And I always say,
"Michael, take two steps back

620
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,551
"and stare at the icicle
from the side."

621
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,345
And he's like,
"No, I like the way they look

622
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,640
"from standing
directly underneath them."

623
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,933
It was only a matter of time.

624
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,519
Michael is so dumb

625
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,774
that he tries to put his
M&M's in alphabetical order.

626
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,611
All right, Kevin, enough
with the Michael jokes.

627
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,112
I think he got it
bad enough yesterday.

628
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,489
I'm almost done.

629
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,741
That reeks
and I'm trying to eat.

630
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,118
Attention, everyone, I've
just got a text from Michael.

631
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,621
He says "personnel day."
Are we hiring?

632
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,331
Yeah. You're being replaced.

633
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,166
I think he meant
personal day.

634
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,501
I don't know.
That's quite a leap, Pam.

635
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,503
I hope he's okay.
I feel bad.

636
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,546
Give it up. He's dead.

637
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:28,964
He just sent a text.

638
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,092
What's a text?

639
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,740
You know, sometimes
to get perspective,

640
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,704
I like to think about a spaceman
on a star incredibly far away,

641
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,915
and our problems don't
matter to him

642
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,751
because we're just
a distant point of light.

643
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,130
But he feels sorry for me

644
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,299
because he has an incredibly
powerful microscope

645
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,301
and he can see my face.

646
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,973
I'm okay.

647
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,102
No, I'm not.

648
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,104
Phyllis, there's
a package for you.

649
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,397
Oh.

650
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,817
Sign here.
Okay.

651
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,989
What?

652
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,829
Got it!

653
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,085
Sam, Sam, Sam.

654
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,714
It's not that you
dumped my granddaughter,

655
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,676
and it's not that you want children,
it's that you lied to me.

656
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,345
Can't you see that?
Can't you see?

657
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,223
I can never trust you.

658
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:05,269
Lily, no. Lily.
Lily, please.

659
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,980
Lily, stop!

660
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,486
I don't care how
much time we have left.

661
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,696
I don't care
what my friends say.

662
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,949
And I don't care
what your mom thinks.

663
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,328
Frankly, I'm pretty sure
she's not making any sense.

664
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:27,124
Please, move back
to my apartment.

665
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,055
Lily, I'm not giving up.
I'm not giving up.

666
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:47,728
Lily, Lily!
Push the reverse button!

667
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,272
Reverse the button!

668
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,659
Sam. Sam.

669
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,253
Hey, Dad. No, I know.
Mom told me.

670
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,635
Okay. Yeah,
I'll see you then.

671
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,619
So what did he say?
Was it my fault?

672
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,289
Yeah.

673
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:54,295
He said that you told him
how much you love me,

674
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,382
about how you feel
when I walk in a room

675
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,052
and about how you've never
doubted for a second

676
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:06,140
that I'm the woman you want to
spend the rest of your life with.

677
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,437
I guess he's never felt that
with my mom, even at their best.

678
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,106
You okay?

679
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,357
Yeah.

680
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,530
When you're a kid, you assume
your parents are soul mates.

681
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,241
My kids are gonna
be right about that.

682
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,535
I guess it also means

683
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,831
that sometimes love affairs look
different to the people inside them.

684
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,963
I'm not insightful enough
to be a movie critic.

685
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,925
Maybe I could be
a food critic.

686
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,010
These muffins taste bad.

687
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:47,306
Or an art critic.
That painting is bad.

688
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,854
Michael, it's
really good to see you.

689
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,483
Hey, why are you
wearing a turtleneck?

690
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,609
You all right?

691
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,486
Michael, I feel I was
a little harsh yesterday.

692
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,529
Yeah. Yeah, we're really sorry.

693
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,700
I spent the afternoon in the
park trying to feed the pigeons.

694
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,829
I guess they all flew
west for the winter.

695
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:15,125
And I just had some thoughts that I
wanted to share with you people.

696
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,585
What?
Well, I wrote them down

697
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,045
so I wouldn't forget.

698
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:24,385
Jim, you're 6'11"
and you weigh 90 pounds.

699
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,387
Gumby has
a better body than you.

700
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,097
Boom. Roasted.

701
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,182
Dwight, you're a kiss-ass.
Boom. Roasted.

702
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,060
Pam, you failed art school.
Boom. Roasted.

703
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,646
Meredith, you've slept
with so many guys

704
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,147
you're starting
to look like one.

705
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,273
Boom. Roasted.

706
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,401
Kevin, I can't decide
between a fat joke

707
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,944
and a dumb joke.
Boom. Roasted.

708
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,989
Creed, your teeth called, your
breath stinks. Boom. Roasted.

709
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,991
Angela, where's Angela?

710
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,075
Well, there you are.

711
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,829
I didn't see you behind that grain of rice.
Boom. Roasted.

712
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,331
Stanley, you crush
your wife during sex

713
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,083
and your heart sucks.
Boom. Roasted.

714
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,086
Oscar, you are...

715
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,718
Oscar, you're gay.

716
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:06,844
Wow.

717
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:11,515
Andy, Cornell called, they think you
suck and you're gayer than Oscar.

718
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,350
Boom. Roasted.

719
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,601
Boom. Roasted.

720
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:27,197
All right. All right, everybody.
You know I kid.

721
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,576
You know I kid.

722
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,496
You guys are the reason that I
went into the paper business.

723
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:38,709
So, good night, God bless.
God bless America.

724
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,335
And get home safe.

725
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,462
Yeah.

726
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,216
They say that laughter
is the best medicine,

727
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,553
so, Stanley, you can
throw away those pills.

728
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,138
You are cured.

729
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,851
Actually, better hold on
to the pills, just in case.
