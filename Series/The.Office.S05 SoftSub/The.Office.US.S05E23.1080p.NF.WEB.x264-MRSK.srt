1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:06,214
It's 4:30 in the morning. Do
you know where your kids are?

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:10,343
If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's
parents or my parents, you do.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,179
They're going to be
in this van, with me.

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,723
Who am I?
Nothing to fear.

5
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,893
I am just a 44-year-old guy
with a paper route.

6
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:24,482
Time to make
the doughnuts!

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,154
Come on!

8
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,450
No, I promise
I won't do it again.

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,785
Come on.

10
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:40,581
I lied!

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,797
We've been making 5:00 a.m.
deliveries for a couple weeks now.

12
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,426
Ever since I've gotten clean, there's
something about fresh morning air

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,803
that just really
makes me sick.

14
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,147
Hello! Time
to make the doughnuts!

15
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,817
Oh, Halpert, wow!
Boner patrol!

16
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,319
Arrest that man!

17
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,114
Your doughnuts
make me go nuts!

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,325
Hey, Pam.

19
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,828
We got the van
at a used car lot.

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,665
We think it says "Hallelujah
Church of Scranton" in Korean.

21
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,628
It was either this or an old school
bus with an owl living in it.

22
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,882
You didn't happen to bring any
coffee, did you, Michael?

23
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:31,966
Milk and sugar.

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,427
Oh, awesome.
You're a lifesaver.

25
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,183
Wait, is this
just milk and sugar?

26
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,267
That's what I said.

27
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,519
Do you drink
this every day?

28
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,188
Every morning.

29
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,941
We're...
We're doing okay.

30
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,736
A couple weeks in,
and we're having fun.

31
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,657
Yep, we have 20 of those...

32
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,870
Oh, excuse me! Sorry!
Sorry, no, it's...

33
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,456
It's a paper company now.

34
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,377
It's not for the church.

35
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,320
Okay, who covers
Van's Pet Grooming?

36
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,198
Oh, they're my client.
No, they were your client.

37
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,533
They just called and said
they were switching over

38
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,826
to Michael Scott
Paper Company.

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,995
Shame, Jim.
I expected more.

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,166
In the last month, we have lost 10
major clients to Michael Scott.

41
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,585
What are we supposed to do? They
keep undercutting us on price.

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,504
I don't want to hear excuses.
I want to see improvements.

43
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,381
This is unacceptable.

44
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,925
Hey, boss, I'd just
like to point out

45
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,762
that I have been here
less time than these guys.

46
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,973
Why are you telling me this?

47
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,852
I just think the bar should
be lower for a newbie.

48
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,063
Is that something you
really want to have said?

49
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,484
I don't want
to have said that.

50
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,905
But I think it's important
that you know it.

51
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,367
I don't know what to do
to inspire these people, okay?

52
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,369
Maybe it's my fault.
It's not your fault.

53
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,705
Some people just don't
want to be inspired.

54
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,501
I wrote a memo to all departments
asking them to find ways to save money.

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,379
But...
Charles.

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,464
I got your memo. Thank you.

57
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,718
I want you to know, I'm putting my foot
down when it comes to expense reports.

58
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,636
Waste not, want not.

59
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,681
Well said, Angela.

60
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,021
Been there, done that.

61
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,485
You know what we need?
We need some couches in here.

62
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,572
Michael, we should really
consider getting a delivery guy.

63
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,075
Oh, know what you would love?
Is if we built a loft.

64
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,870
Why would I love that?

65
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,705
Can we afford
a delivery guy?

66
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,333
Like in a dorm room,
you put your desk underneath,

67
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,085
you have your loft up top,
you can sleep up top.

68
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,337
Yeah, I know
what a loft is.

69
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,172
Most dorm rooms
don't even have that.

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,548
Most do in the magazines.

71
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,176
Let's see what
a delivery guy costs.

72
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,138
We should look into that.

73
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,058
Or we just go for the loft.

74
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,978
Hi.

75
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,523
Could you let Charles know
that David is here, please?

76
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,442
Jim, hey.
Hey, David.

77
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,779
David Wallace! Hello, we've been
expecting you, David Wallace.

78
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,072
Charles and I
were waiting for you.

79
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,283
There he is! There he is!
How was the trip up?

80
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,494
A lot better than a month at the
Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.

81
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,663
Oh, you know what?
It hasn't been that bad.

82
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,457
Hasn't been that bad. These people
are the salt of the Earth down here.

83
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,752
You couldn't ask for a better
way to learn a company.

84
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,380
I feel like I should
be thanking you.

85
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,974
The conference room is ready,
if we want to get started.

86
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,309
You know, I just want
to address everyone first.

87
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,770
Oh, yeah, take your time.
Stanley, pay attention.

88
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,896
Hi, everyone.

89
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,022
Hi.

90
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,441
Hi. Look, it's no secret...

91
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,567
Hi.

92
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:23,447
Hello. It is no secret
that Michael Scott Paper

93
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,449
has siphoned off a large
chunk of our core business,

94
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,827
and I'm here, I just want
to reassure everyone

95
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,121
that we think this is
just a temporary setback.

96
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,205
Right.
Okay?

97
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,334
Maybe, and I don't know, if you'd
just returned Michael's call,

98
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,461
none of us would
have lost clients.

99
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,255
I've been wondering
that myself lately.

100
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,799
We're just going to get started,
we're going to figure this out.

101
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,676
Rest assured. Jim, can you
come in with us, please?

102
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,177
Oh, Jim, hold on.

103
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,847
You know, David, Dwight's
been my guy, okay?

104
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,348
Yeah, Jim...

105
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,059
Really? I find that
extraordinarily surprising.

106
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,020
He shows promise.

107
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,647
And Jim, I don't...
He's been a disappointment.

108
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:57,773
We'll bring them both in.
Okay, great.

109
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,860
Dwight,
come on in. Also, Jim.

110
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,739
Come along, afterthought.

111
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,076
How much can we afford
to pay a delivery guy?

112
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,786
Well, if these numbers
you gave me are correct...

113
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,371
They
are correct, sir.

114
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,415
Then you can't afford
to pay him anything.

115
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,624
Okay.

116
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,128
A lame attempt at humor.
Swing and a miss.

117
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,422
Your prices are too low.

118
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,090
Lowest in town.

119
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,677
Why do you think Staples and Dunder
Mifflin can't match your prices?

120
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,845
Corporate greed?

121
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,806
Look, our pricing model is fine.
I reviewed the numbers myself.

122
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,309
Over time, with enough volume,
we become profitable.

123
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,019
Yeah, with a fixed-cost pricing
model, that's correct...

124
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,103
Yeah.

125
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,064
But you need to use a
variable-cost pricing model.

126
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,983
Okay, sure...
Right. So...

127
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,861
Why don't you explain what
that is, so they can...

128
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,905
Just explain what that is.
Explain what you think that is.

129
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:46,989
Okay.
Just explain it.

130
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,576
As you sell more paper and your
company grows, so will your costs.

131
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,748
For example, delivery man, health
care, business expansion...

132
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,208
Whatever. Yeah, so...

133
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,252
At these prices, the more paper you
sell, the less money you'll make.

134
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,130
Our prices are the only thing
keeping us in business.

135
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,758
They're actually putting
you out of business.

136
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,302
Okay, okay.
Hold on, hold on.

137
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,889
Ty, I would like you to
crunch those numbers again.

138
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,183
It's a program.
There's no such thing as...

139
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,894
Just crunch them.
Just crunch them, please.

140
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,647
Crunch.

141
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,233
Did it help?

142
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,342
Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott.

143
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,387
Well, this is
slightly embarrassing.

144
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,144
I'm going to have to ask you to
pay me a little bit more money

145
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,105
for that delivery
we dropped off yesterday.

146
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,316
Yeah, we did.
We got the check.

147
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,444
But we're just going to need
a much, much bigger check.

148
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:12,366
When a child gets behind the wheel
of a car and runs into a tree,

149
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,370
you don't blame the child.
He didn't know any better.

150
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,500
You blame the 30-year-old woman
who got in the passenger seat

151
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,962
and said,
"Drive, kid. I trust you."

152
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:31,010
Now, would corporate approve a temporary
price reduction for returning customers?

153
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,344
God, no.
That's stupid.

154
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,470
Yeah, it makes us
look weak.

155
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,930
I agree. It just...

156
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:39,268
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.
My apiarist owes me a favor.

157
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,771
Really?

158
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,273
Does he do good work or...

159
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,776
No, Jim,
I use a bad apiarist.

160
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,364
Fellows, why don't
we take a five-minute break?

161
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,160
And then we will come back,
start fresh, sort this out.

162
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,412
Five minutes
exactly. Okay.

163
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,749
Hey, Dwight, can I talk to you?
Sure thing.

164
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,960
Hey, I saw you called.

165
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,296
You're just
out of business?

166
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,298
We have maybe a month.

167
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,300
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

168
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,094
Oh, yeah, well, don't worry about it.
We'll figure it out. We'll be okay.

169
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,679
That's what Michael said.

170
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,973
Oh, yeah, well, only this
time we will be okay.

171
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,892
Idiot.
Idiot. Idiot.

172
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,602
That's my new Dwight ring.
I like it.

173
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,354
Good, right? Hello?

174
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,940
Idiot, we're starting back up.
This is Dwight, by the way.

175
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,316
Oh, okay.

176
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,861
Don't worry about it.

177
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,828
Did I ever tell you about the
day that Steve Martin died?

178
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,414
Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
I know.

179
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,585
But I always thought that the day that he
died would be the worst day of my life.

180
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,837
And I was wrong.
It's this.

181
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,349
You want to hear
something sad?

182
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,976
I would love that.

183
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,397
So Jim and I are getting married,
and the wedding's really expensive,

184
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,192
so I tried to get a job on the
weekends to earn extra money.

185
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,697
I applied to Old Navy,
Target and Walmart.

186
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,825
None of them
called me back.

187
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,411
Not even
for an interview.

188
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,125
I never went to Thailand.

189
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,377
Really?

190
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,504
I went to Fort Lauderdale.

191
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,007
Was it nice?

192
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,759
Yeah, it was amazing.

193
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,221
There is a great
pad thai place, though.

194
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,390
I love pad thai.

195
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,143
You never had pad thai.

196
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,269
No.

197
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,648
There's a lot
I haven't done.

198
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,985
Now, this is a projection
of over three months.

199
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,321
We still have the retail...
Well, that's assuming that...

200
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,656
Hey, let me float
something out there, okay?

201
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,867
Can I just say...
Can I say something?

202
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:04,079
There is a hive of bees
outside the front door.

203
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,167
We kidnap the queen,
extract her alarm pheromones,

204
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:12,379
place them on a flushable wipe
and put that in his bathroom.

205
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:20,054
I can't believe I'm about to say
this, but the cheapest option

206
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,557
is to make Michael an offer.

207
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,062
Yes. Yes, I was going to say the
same thing. We can buy him out.

208
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,273
- Oh, but you didn't.
- Oh, man!

209
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:36,070
If only Michael had children. That's
how you really apply the pressure.

210
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,321
What
is wrong with you?

211
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,991
Jim, you're pretty close with them. You
think they'd be up for hearing an offer?

212
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:45,412
Oh, I don't know. You know, they've
taken a good deal of clients, so...

213
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,708
I mean, I guess I could go down there and
try to nudge them in the right direction.

214
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,461
You know what?
Why don't I do it, okay?

215
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,506
Michael adores me. I'm the man for this
job. Charles, you got my back on this?

216
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,216
No. Jim, I think
you should go.

217
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,344
Okay. So I'll be back in...
Back in a bit.

218
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,225
Hey. Can I talk to you
guys for a second?

219
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,268
We're not hiring, Jim. Actually
here for something else.

220
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,895
Listen, I can't make
you laugh right now.

221
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,271
You know I love
a good guessing game,

222
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,148
but why don't I just tell
you what I'm here for?

223
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,943
Turns out you guys have made a pretty
big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.

224
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,027
Oh, that's nice.

225
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,196
David Wallace has asked me
to come down here,

226
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,242
and see if you would be interested
in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.

227
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,660
Seriously?

228
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,287
Are you being serious?
He's bluffing, Pam.

229
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,456
Jim, what you don't understand
is that this company's worth...

230
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,250
No.

231
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,334
We don't have...

232
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,421
See, I'm here to learn as
little information as possible.

233
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,925
All I really need to hear is if
your incredibly successful company

234
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,344
would be receptive
to a buyout.

235
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,642
Yes.
Yes.

236
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,768
Maybe.
Three yeses.

237
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,771
I will see you
titans of industry upstairs.

238
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,358
Yes, well, we are not only tight
ends, we are also quarterbacks.

239
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,776
I missed
the last part.

240
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,944
That's a pun.
Got it.

241
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,154
Yep.

242
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,993
Oh, wow.

243
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,414
Okay, so you're not going to reveal
in any way that we're broke?

244
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,457
Of course not.

245
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,125
That we're having any
problems at all. Nope.

246
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,171
Right, just to reiterate, none
of us is going to say anything

247
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,589
that might indicate
we are going broke.

248
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:23,385
Right, right, there is no way in hell
that I am going to say that we're broke.

249
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,640
Oh, I'm really worried
I'm going to say it.

250
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,142
No, Michael.

251
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,310
No, man.

252
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,436
You're...
You're fine.

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,104
We have to come from a
position of strength.

254
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,607
Yeah, just put it out of your mind.
It is.

255
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm good.

256
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,655
Hello.
Hi.

257
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,325
Michael Scott Paper Company
to see Mr. David Wallace.

258
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,410
I believe
we're expected.

259
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,752
Well, well, well,
how the turntables...

260
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,804
Michael, in order to
expedite these negotiations,

261
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,932
we are prepared to make you
a very generous offer.

262
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,809
And we are prepared
to reject that offer.

263
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,436
Michael, you haven't
even heard...

264
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,938
Never accept
their first offer.

265
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,482
What is your second offer?

266
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,108
$12,000.

267
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,737
Are you kidding me?
That is insultingly low.

268
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,823
I don't even want to hear
what your first offer was.

269
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,492
What do you hear?

270
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,456
Here's the situation. Your
company is four weeks old.

271
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,750
I know this business. I know
what suppliers are charging.

272
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,211
I know you can't be
making very much money.

273
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,799
I don't know how your prices are so low.
But I know it can't keep up that way.

274
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,135
I'm sure you're scared,
probably in debt.

275
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,513
That's the best offer
you're going to get.

276
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,516
I'll see your situation, and
I'll raise you a situation.

277
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,602
Your company is losing
clients left and right.

278
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,773
You have a stockholder meeting coming up and
you're going to have to explain to them

279
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,610
why your most profitable
branch is bleeding.

280
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,406
So they may be looking for a
little change in the CFO.

281
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,366
So I don't think I need
to wait out Dunder Mifflin.

282
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,994
I think I just
have to wait out you.

283
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:19,793
Okay, now, I don't know that I can get this.
I do have to go to the board for approval.

284
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,047
How's about $60,000?

285
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,262
$60,000.

286
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,514
Michael?

287
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,812
We're going to have to talk about this.
Just amongst ourselves.

288
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,356
Okay, done.
Please, take the room.

289
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,318
We're outside.
Take your time.

290
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,450
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
$60,000?

291
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,410
We are so rich.

292
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,620
Are you
kidding me?

293
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,706
Well, Jerry, the one
who got away.

294
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,295
May I ask why you're leaving the
Michael Scott Paper Company?

295
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,548
Really?

296
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,010
Please hold.

297
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,976
Charles...
Dwight.

298
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,603
May I have your attention?

299
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,855
The Michael Scott
Paper Company is broke.

300
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,815
What? How'd
you hear that?

301
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,985
They've been calling all their clients
and begging them to pay more money.

302
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,528
That can only mean one thing.
They're desperate.

303
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,115
Which can only mean one thing.
They are total failures.

304
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,617
Great work, Dwight.
Quiet, you.

305
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,743
No, I mean,
great detective work,

306
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,953
'cause this must be the first
case you've ever cracked, right?

307
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,831
You don't "crack a case." That
has a pejorative connotation.

308
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,500
It's like calling
a policeman a cop.

309
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,086
You solve a case, and,
yes, I've solved plenty.

310
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,046
So, how long
can they stay viable?

311
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,006
What are your top
five cases?

312
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,132
I'm going to answer
Charles first.

313
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,217
Because he's solved
zero cases.

314
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,470
Okay, one,
Case of the Beet Bandit.

315
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,639
Missing beets from all over
the farm, no footprints.

316
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,559
Inside job, Mose in socks.
Boom, case closed.

317
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,854
Okay, do not go anywhere
near the conference room.

318
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,939
Done.

319
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,442
Because you have embarrassed
me for the last time today.

320
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,152
Got it?
I'm not following you.

321
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,529
You two are morons.

322
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,822
Got it.

323
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,865
Get out.

324
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,455
So, you've thought it over, yes?
And you accept our offer?

325
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,542
We can finally put
this whole thing behind us?

326
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,670
No.

327
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,342
Can you give us another
minute, please?

328
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,428
Yeah.

329
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,805
Okay.

330
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,567
Michael... How could you
do this to me, Michael?

331
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,402
You just cost me
$60,000.

332
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,987
Why are you assuming
you'd get the whole thing?

333
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,532
It's a lot of money, okay? But we
need money coming in every week.

334
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,075
We need jobs.

335
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,537
Wouldn't you rather have
a fishing pole than a fish?

336
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,665
I would rather have
$60,000, honestly.

337
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,710
No, Michael's right.
Jobs are safer.

338
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,880
Agreed?

339
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,423
Agreed.
Yeah.

340
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,341
But that's all, okay?

341
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,761
Yeah, discuss
these things...

342
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,262
Hello?

343
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,766
I want my old job back, I want
my old parking space back,

344
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,017
I want a Sebring...

345
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,060
They don't make them anymore.
I can...

346
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,104
And I want Charles gone.

347
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,732
I'm not firing Charles.
He's very valuable.

348
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,983
That's very kind
of you to say, David.

349
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,109
I need him gone.

350
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,360
No.

351
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,070
Okay, then
I want Pam back.

352
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,947
You already have
a new receptionist.

353
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,199
Sales.

354
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:38,867
Thank you.

355
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,951
Pam's not a salesperson.

356
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:44,498
Yes, she is, at the Michael Scott
Paper Company in its heyday.

357
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,374
That's right.
Okay.

358
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,419
Please continue.
And Ryan.

359
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,714
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds
of thousands of dollars, Michael.

360
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,799
You know...
Ryan...

361
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,968
David, I don't care if Ryan
murdered his entire family.

362
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,178
He is like a son to me.

363
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,138
Do you realize
what you're asking for here?

364
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,974
You're talking about salary,
plus health benefits...

365
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,476
And dental this time.

366
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,020
Insurance, taxes, social
security for three people?

367
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,814
This is a heck of a lot
more than 60 grand.

368
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,607
You're talking about
a multi-million dollar buyout.

369
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,150
These are our demands.

370
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,236
Your company cannot
be worth that much.

371
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,571
Our company is
worth nothing.

372
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,949
That's the difference
between you and I.

373
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,743
Business isn't about
money to me, David.

374
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,914
If tomorrow my company goes under, I
will just start another paper company,

375
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,625
and then another
and another and another.

376
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,418
I have no shortage
of company names.

377
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,337
Michael...
That's one of them.

378
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,258
Yes. These are our demands.
This is what we want.

379
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,136
Our balls are in your court.

380
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,564
Okay, deal.

381
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,775
Okay?

382
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,736
Can we have
the room, please?

383
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,072
Yeah.

384
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,467
Can you
believe it?

385
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,678
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Oh, my God!

386
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,431
That's what
I'm talking about!

387
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,978
There are certain defining
moments in a person's life.

388
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:34,482
The day he's born, the day he grows
hair, the day he starts a business,

389
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,320
and the day he sells that
business back to Dunder Mifflin.

390
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,865
What have
I learned from all of this?

391
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,367
It is far too early to tell.

392
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:48,538
I just know that I am flying high, and
I don't even want to think about it.

393
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,081
I just want to enjoy it.

394
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,626
Hey, guys...
No. No, you're done.
