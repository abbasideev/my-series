1
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,301
You gonna answer that, Kev?

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,679
Oh, right. Thanks.

3
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,684
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Kevin.

4
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,852
Please hold
while I transfer you.

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,355
Oscar! Your mom!

6
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,443
Charles is having Kevin cover
the phones for a while.

7
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,946
How do I say this
diplomatically?

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,533
I think Kevin is doing exactly as
well as anyone might have expected

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,953
someone like him to perform
in a position like that.

10
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,164
Please hold.

11
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,833
Andy! Phone call!

12
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,459
No, stay there.

13
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,671
Kev, I thought we nailed the
whole transfer thing earlier.

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,507
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand,
but then I washed it.

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,552
It is "transfer," "extension,"
and then "transfer" again.

16
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,470
Okay. Andy, get ready.

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,722
- Transfer...
- Here we go.

18
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,432
...extension, transfer.

19
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,268
Oh, man!

20
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,978
It is 134!

21
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,104
Kev!
Kev, come on!

22
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,188
Hustle!
Hold on!

23
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,940
You are murdering
the Nard-Dog!

24
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,360
This is Kevin. Please hold,
and I will transfer you.

25
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,904
You're bad
at this, too!

26
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,114
Don't answer that call!

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,241
Just transfer
the damn call.

28
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,744
Your call is very
important to us.

29
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,500
Okay, way to go.

30
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,878
My maid died.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,530
Today is my first day at my new job
at Michael Scott Paper Company, Inc.

32
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,201
You know, Apple Computer
started in a garage.

33
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,952
And we're starting
in a condo.

34
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,996
So we already have
a leg up on Apple.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,874
Look, it's official.

36
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,712
Oh, good,
my hooker's here.

37
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,089
I'm kidding! Hi!

38
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,508
Michael, you were
expecting me, right?

39
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,510
Yes, I was.
Yes, I was.

40
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,386
Are you wearing anything
under the robe?

41
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,181
That is inappropriate, Pam.
Come on in.

42
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,102
This looks great, Michael.

43
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,562
Thank you.

44
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,815
Would you like
some French toast?

45
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,024
Yes, please.

46
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,484
What shape?

47
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,320
Square is fine.
All right.

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,864
I just wanted to fill you
in on a few details.

49
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,075
As you know, I will be
running the branch

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,701
while we search for
Michael's replacement,

51
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,703
so please feel free
to come to me

52
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,163
with any questions
or concerns.

53
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,206
Yeah.

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,500
Where will you be staying
while you're in Scranton?

55
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,585
Staying? In a hotel.

56
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,546
Charles, where
were you born?

57
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,508
Actually, I meant questions more about the
day-to-day operations of the company.

58
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,009
Okay? Yeah.

59
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,722
How are operations of the
company, just day-to-day?

60
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,186
Okay, let's go over
non-discretionary cuts, okay, guys?

61
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,987
Thank you. So...

62
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,155
Can you please stop that?
What?

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,533
You're breathing
very heavily.

64
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,368
This is how I breathe.
No, it's not...

65
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,830
Okay, Jim Halpert,
I need your eyes up front.

66
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,917
Oh, no, I was just... No, hey,
hey, I just want to hear "yes."

67
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,171
Yes.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,965
Good.

69
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,592
As I was saying...

70
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:41,846
Oh, no! The new boss
does not find Jim adorable!

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,222
Oh.

72
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,059
So, what do you say
we get started?

73
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,228
After breakfast.
I'm full.

74
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,355
So, how are you feeling
about the new company?

75
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,065
I feel good. Wow.

76
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,568
Are you excited about
the new company?

77
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,904
Yeah, I'm excited to
start the company.

78
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,614
After breakfast.

79
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,117
We did that,
so what's next?

80
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,039
Michael, just stop for a second.
Michael, stop for a second.

81
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,582
No, I'm whipping up...
No, I know you are.

82
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,708
Just let me have...
Let go, please.

83
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,460
Just give me...
Fine!

84
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,755
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,342
I can't do this.

86
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,637
This is pathetic, isn't it?

87
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,640
I am such an idiot.

88
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,851
I gave up the only job
I ever loved to do this?

89
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,191
I have egg in my Crocs.

90
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,029
I never see him drink.
I never see him eat.

91
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,657
I don't think he even
uses the bathroom.

92
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,159
Oh, he does. He does.

93
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,078
I feel weak today.

94
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,872
I felt much
stronger yesterday.

95
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,416
Like Benjamin Button
in reverse.

96
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,543
You know, Michael,
when I feel overwhelmed...

97
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,170
I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.

98
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,799
I know. No, I'm saying that
when I feel overwhelmed,

99
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,885
something I like to do
is make a list.

100
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,430
Make a list of
things to do,

101
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,015
and then start with
the easy stuff.

102
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,141
Whatever calms you down.

103
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,144
Okay, first, work out.

104
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,106
And hey, look,
you did that.

105
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,149
Check.

106
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,860
Eat an enormous breakfast.

107
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,863
Check.
Don't patronize me, Pam.

108
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:23,948
I think you should
get dressed.

109
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,241
I'm not getting dressed.

110
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,828
I'm not getting dressed. I have too
many things to do before I get dressed.

111
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,371
I need to find 100 clients.

112
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,831
Michael,
that seems impossible.

113
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,957
It's totally impossible.

114
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:38,129
We need to come up with one realistic
thing that we could do today.

115
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,923
Assemble a sales team.
A dream team.

116
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,091
Great.

117
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,384
Okay, Ryan.

118
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,594
No. What? Why?

119
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,097
He's everything I'm not,
and everything I am.

120
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,390
He's the whole package.

121
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,766
No, we're not
gonna hire Ryan.

122
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,353
Um... Oh, Vikram! Best
salesman I've ever met.

123
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,732
Okay. He worked at that
telemarketing place.

124
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,150
We'll find him.
Okay.

125
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,112
Oh, also, we have a meeting this
afternoon with a potential investor.

126
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,238
Really?
Yeah.

127
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,740
We have an investor already?
Maybe.

128
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,783
Barbara Keavis. She invests
in local businesses

129
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,745
and I'm putting together
a little presentation for her.

130
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,079
Michael, that's fantastic.

131
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,914
Yeah, I guess
it's not so bad.

132
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,708
Got a few things cooking.

133
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,084
Um...

134
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,462
Hey! We need to
get you dressed.

135
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,338
I have doubts
about this, too,

136
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,965
but when one person
freaks out,

137
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,302
sometimes it weirdly makes
the other one calmer.

138
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,430
That's one thing I've learned
about relationships.

139
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,641
I hate that I just used
the word "relationship."

140
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,144
Hey! You look great!

141
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,939
Let's go.
All right.

142
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,568
Oh.

143
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,154
You a soccer fan?

144
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,656
Oh, yeah,
I'm so embarrassed.

145
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,284
You weren't supposed to see this.
This is like my secret obsession.

146
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,661
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

147
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,746
No way!
Yeah.

148
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,331
I hate soccer.

149
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,917
But guess who doesn't
hate soccer.

150
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,168
Charles Miner.

151
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,505
I was actually in Germany for
the 2006 World Cup finals.

152
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,759
You bastard!
That should have been me!

153
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,595
Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport.
All right, man.

154
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,763
Cool!

155
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,684
I've never been a kiss-up.

156
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,771
I... It's just not
how I operate.

157
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,148
I mean, I've always
subscribed to the idea

158
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,359
that if you really want
to impress your boss,

159
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,113
you go in there, and you do
mediocre work, half-heartedly.

160
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,741
Next on the list,
open the mail.

161
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,036
Oh, wow, "Michael Scott
Paper Company."

162
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,247
Okay.

163
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,082
Very official.

164
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,088
"Dear Mr. Scott, please be
advised that it is in violation

165
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,298
"of your condominium
agreement to conduct

166
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,968
"a business headquartered
in your residence.

167
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,678
"The penalty, a forfeiture
of residence..."

168
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,638
No, okay,
it's fine, it's fine.

169
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,849
We're just gonna add,
"Find office."

170
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,433
How are we gonna
find an office?

171
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,560
How can we pay
for an office?

172
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,937
Next on the list,
"song parodies."

173
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,189
Okay, okay,
Achy Breaky Fart.

174
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,315
Great, let's sing it
in the car.

175
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,984
No, no, no, no,
My Stumps.

176
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,944
Like My Humps, but with
a guy with no legs.

177
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,904
Yeah.
We can do this.

178
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,072
We can do this.

179
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:16,620
Whoa, and he just goes, boom, goal!
Yeah, that's... That's Pelé.

180
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,122
You know your soccer, man.
I do.

181
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,834
I prefer Maradona.
Diego Maradona.

182
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,335
Oh, yeah?
From Argentina.

183
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,422
I didn't know we had so many
soccer fans in the office.

184
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,966
I mean, to be fair, I was the first
one to talk about it, but...

185
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,093
Yeah, what about you, Jim?
You a fan of the game?

186
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,012
Oh, no. No, not really.

187
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,347
Well, it's not for
everybody, I suppose.

188
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,851
That's 'cause I'm more
of a player.

189
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,977
Oh, yeah?
You bet.

190
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,478
Really, Jim?

191
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,316
I had no idea
you played soccer.

192
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,611
'Cause you never,
ever talk about it.

193
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,529
- Well, I do. I play.
- Wow!

194
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,947
You can be so
modest sometimes.

195
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,115
Maybe we should
get back to work.

196
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,868
Maybe you and Charles should
kick the soccer ball around.

197
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,952
Maybe we will someday.

198
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,829
Maybe you will tonight after work.
What do you say?

199
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,372
It's a great idea, Dwight.

200
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,375
Great ideas are just part of
what I bring to the table.

201
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,045
I don't try and be
anything that I'm not.

202
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,464
What do you say, Jim? Huh,
want to play some soccer?

203
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,590
Hey, anybody else?

204
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,633
I'm into that.
Sounds fun.

205
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,509
Game on!
Okay.

206
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,887
See you on the field, Jim-bro.
See...

207
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,555
I can't wait!

208
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,642
Yep, I used to play
soccer in school.

209
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,102
From second
to fourth grade.

210
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,021
I was on the orange team.

211
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,320
We got Vikram!
You got me.

212
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,114
Where are we going?

213
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,574
We have a meeting
with an investor today.

214
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,661
Yes, we do,
so get excited.

215
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,332
But I have to go to the
bathroom real quick.

216
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,585
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be right back.

217
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,756
He seems really confident.
He can be.

218
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,341
Confidence...

219
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,345
It's the food of the wise man,
but the liquor of the fool.

220
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Hmm.

221
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,433
I'm looking forward to getting
to know you better, Vikram.

222
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,396
Hey, I would like
a pair of Size 9, please.

223
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,817
It's Michael.
I'm swamped, Michael.

224
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,236
Happy birthday
to Sally in Lane 27.

225
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,782
Okay, imagine a company that has
no memory of your past misconduct,

226
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,951
because they have no files.

227
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,831
He's taking
a long time.

228
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,624
Is it possible
he's bowling?

229
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,335
I mean, you know him
better than I do.

230
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,964
Yes. Yes, it's possible.

231
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,137
Well, he's always been a
lifelong friend... Michael!

232
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,305
What's going on?

233
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,598
I'm...
Hey, Ryan.

234
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,975
Excuse me. Yes?

235
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,226
This wasn't on the list.

236
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,061
Yes, it is.
No.

237
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,271
Yes.
It's not.

238
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,564
It is.

239
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,815
When did you add this
to the list?

240
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,402
Pam, everyone deserves
a second, second chance.

241
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,240
Ryan, just out of curiosity,
how much do you get paid here?

242
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,908
$60,000 a year.

243
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,286
You get paid by the year
at the bowling alley?

244
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,495
What do you make,
secretary?

245
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,581
Back to work, shoe bitch!

246
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,166
I told you guys,
I'm really busy here, so...

247
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,420
Would you like to come to work for
the Michael Scott Paper Company?

248
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,714
What size shoes are you guys?
Uh, nine.

249
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,882
What are those?
A men's 10?

250
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,091
No.

251
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,426
Look what he's doing.
What is he doing?

252
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,553
He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.

253
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,389
He's already paying for himself.
Sorry!

254
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,351
Where is it?
Right here.

255
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,146
Hey, come on, guys. These are
prime selling hours, you know.

256
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,153
- Miner...
- Oh, there he goes.

257
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,863
...sees his partner.
Yikes.

258
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,281
Halpert, he looks up.
Oh, man!

259
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,617
The famed duo!
He sets him up!

260
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,285
He sets him up!
All right.

261
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,495
Yeah!

262
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,331
Goal!

263
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,499
I can't wait to play
with you.

264
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,542
Oh, it's gonna be
the worst.

265
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,128
Do you guys wanna hear
about Thailand?

266
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,797
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

267
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,926
It was indescribable.

268
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,636
Sounds awesome.
Neat.

269
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,347
What sort of
investing firm is this?

270
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,724
Vikram, you ask a lot of
questions, and I like that.

271
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,143
Hey, Nana! Hi!

272
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,561
Michael!

273
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,563
People turn to their
families all the time

274
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,107
when they need help
starting out.

275
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,401
And if my nana's
investment club can help

276
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,610
the Michael Scott
Paper Company

277
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,823
become a reality, then I'm sure
that's what she would have wanted.

278
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,324
Does want.

279
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,494
Well, I'm sure that you must all
have very, very busy schedules,

280
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,206
so I appreciate you
meeting with us here today.

281
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,961
What this is, is a business that I
have worked toward my entire life.

282
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,129
Hey!

283
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,965
I have assembled
what I believe to be

284
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,010
the most exciting, sought-after
talent in the industry today.

285
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,139
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you the dream team.

286
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:49,351
From our very own Scranton,
Pennsylvania, Pam Beesly.

287
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,980
Pretty Pam is always
reaching for the stars

288
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,525
and someday, she may just
surprise us all and grab one.

289
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,861
Meet Vikram.

290
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,323
From his humble beginnings as a...
Stay standing.

291
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,119
From his humble beginnings
as a prominent surgeon,

292
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,248
he risked it all to become the
most successful telemarketer

293
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,749
in the lipophedrine industry.

294
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,044
And do not call it
a comeback.

295
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,674
The youngest vice president in
the history of Dunder Mifflin,

296
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,303
and recent bowling alley
employee, Ryan Howard,

297
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,723
is about to make
a splash in paper.

298
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,849
So let's hear it.

299
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,394
Okay, I have spent
the last 15 years

300
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,230
learning the ins and outs
of the paper industry.

301
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,817
With a lean, mean fighting
crew and low overhead,

302
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,195
I think I can perform
the same business

303
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,530
at a much, much higher
rate of profit.

304
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,909
How do you expect to turn
a profit in this economy?

305
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,786
By wanting it more,
by working hard...

306
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,497
What's your mission
statement?

307
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,251
My mission is stated
as follows.

308
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,504
I will not be beat.

309
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,547
I will never give up.

310
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,424
I am on a mission.

311
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,635
That is the
Michael Scott guarantee.

312
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,970
Come on, Oscar. What
positions do people play?

313
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,597
Wing.
The leg.

314
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,517
Jim, what do you play?
Left.

315
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,852
Forward or half?
Forward, definitely.

316
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,062
Okay, striker, huh?
Striker!

317
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,356
Let's see what you got in those legs.
All right, let's do it.

318
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,815
All right.

319
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,444
No, no, no. This... No, this
is supposed to be the kickoff.

320
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,779
Kickoff.

321
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,032
My strategy is to touch the
ball as little as possible.

322
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,117
Chalk it up to teamwork.

323
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,869
All right!

324
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,623
And I offer
same-day free delivery.

325
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,625
Michael, I don't know
about this.

326
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,462
Nana, I really think that Papa
would want you to do this.

327
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,715
I'm not so sure.
Well, what is it exactly?

328
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,094
I mean, what... What specifically?
It doesn't have to be paper.

329
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,013
We could sell medicine
and other...

330
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,349
See, this is what
concerns me.

331
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,061
We could just give him a chance.
It's not much money.

332
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,021
Well, this might not be
the right time,

333
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,982
but I need more than
I originally asked for.

334
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,402
This isn't a hand-out club,
it's an investment club.

335
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:04,945
Okay.

336
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,656
I love you, Michael. I do. Okay.

337
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,701
But no. I mean it. No.

338
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,167
I thought Nana raised
some good questions.

339
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,379
What kind of a name
is Nana?

340
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,339
It means "grandmother."

341
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,550
Oh, sweet Jesus.

342
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,845
Look, I'm sorry
to do this,

343
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,347
but can you drop me back
at the telemarketing building?

344
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,391
You know, Michael,
if you want to succeed,

345
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,977
you've got to
apply the same...

346
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,067
Get him, Jim!
Go, go!

347
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,153
Come on, talk to me, Jim!

348
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,739
- Ah!
- Oh, my God!

349
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,991
Jim, what the...

350
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,784
Phyllis, are you okay?
Are you okay?

351
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,870
No, I swallowed a crown.

352
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,456
- Why'd you duck, Jim?
- Yeah, Jim.

353
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,791
Why would an experienced
soccer player, like yourself,

354
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,209
duck at the very
last moment?

355
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,377
Okay, I'm just gonna go
get some ice.

356
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,047
Does that make you
feel better, huh?

357
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,798
I'm... I'm sorry, Phyllis.

358
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,050
Oh, yeah,
Jim's sorry.

359
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,970
Do you get TNT? The station.
Do you get TNT?

360
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,223
Yeah, I have cable
and satellite as a backup.

361
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,982
Yeah, I know, two
not-so-great things in a row.

362
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,570
Yeah, well, stuff happens, right?
At least we got Ryan.

363
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,614
The Ry-guy.

364
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,783
We should call him
Rye Bread.

365
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,992
We don't have
to call him that.

366
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,078
Unless you like it.
We could call him that.

367
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,788
I can't do this.

368
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,247
What's that?

369
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,501
I can't do this.
I had a real job.

370
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,921
I sat 10 feet away
from my fiancé.

371
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,965
I had health benefits.

372
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,759
I was just feeling
impulsive.

373
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,929
I should have gotten
a tiny tattoo on my ankle.

374
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,016
I just keep getting bored, and I
let things build up and build up,

375
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:02,062
and then I do something too big, like this.
Who does this?

376
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,314
Well, you know what?
My mom always used to say

377
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,235
that average people are the most
special people in the world.

378
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,653
And that's why
God made so many...

379
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,196
We don't have any money.

380
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,031
We don't have an office.
We don't have anything.

381
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,491
Well, we should
make a list.

382
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,744
Lists are good, lists are
good, lists are good.

383
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,374
First on the list, let's get
you out of the car, all right?

384
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,500
Okay.

385
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,168
How come, out of
everyone in the office,

386
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,796
I'm the only one
who went with you?

387
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,214
Is it because
I'm that stupid?

388
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,843
I mean, your own grandmother
doesn't even believe in you.

389
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,808
I want you
to listen to me.

390
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:45,355
Because I want to tell you
the situation

391
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,733
that we are both in
right now, okay?

392
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,487
You quit your job, I quit my job.
We both quit.

393
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,741
Those are the facts.
That's what happened.

394
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,951
Now, what are our
choices right now?

395
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,245
Because, you know what,
kiddo? You quit.

396
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,873
Yeah.

397
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,333
So, what are our options?
Well...

398
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,087
We can start this paper company.
We can try.

399
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:13,633
Or... That's it, that's our
only option, because we quit.

400
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:19,598
Pam, I do my best work when
people don't believe in me.

401
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,392
I remember
in high school,

402
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,853
my math teacher told me
I was going to flunk out.

403
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,563
And know what I did?

404
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,483
The very next day, I went
out and I scored more goals

405
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,569
than anyone in the history
of the hockey team.

406
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,072
See what I mean? I thrive on this.
I thrive on it.

407
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,074
So I'm going
to go inside,

408
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,118
I'm going to make
some calls,

409
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,578
I'm going to get us
an office space,

410
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,665
and I'm going to show you why you
joined this company, all right?

411
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,929
You've gotta have some extra space.
Billy, work with me here.

412
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:04,142
There's got to be some sort of secret
office that you have lurking around.

413
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,688
Something awesome and free.
You keep it off the books.

414
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,067
Oh, no. Not there.

415
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,903
That would be humiliating.

416
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,863
I did what I had to do.

417
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,532
I stepped in,
I took charge.

418
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,909
That's what
being a man is.

419
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,995
And earlier today,
I was freaking out.

420
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,289
Pam stepped up.
She was the man.

421
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,793
Don't think a woman
can be a man?

422
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,921
Well, then that's your
stereotype, not mine.

423
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,423
Okay.

424
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,099
I could work here.

425
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,101
I can see this.

426
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,562
It's right in the middle
of the paper belt.

427
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,688
Are you good?

428
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,982
Yeah, I'm good.
Are you good?

429
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm good.

430
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,746
You know what they say.
Keep your friends close.

431
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,463
Michael, you're back.

432
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,299
Yes, I am, Charles.
Mmm-hmm.

433
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,135
Except this time, you've no
legal right to kick me out,

434
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,304
because I have started
my very own paper company

435
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,806
right here in the building.

436
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,226
If I were you, Charles Miner,
I would watch your step,

437
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:32,188
because the Michael Scott Paper Company
is about to open a big old can

438
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,566
of whoop-ass
on Dunder Mifflin.

439
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:41,489
Actually, a six-pack. We're going
to open a six-pack of whoop-ass.

440
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,326
He looked scared.
