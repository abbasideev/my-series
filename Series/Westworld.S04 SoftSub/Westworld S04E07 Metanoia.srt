1
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,998
It's safer to proceed on foot from here.

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,013
You're gonna need this.

3
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,440
Given you know
what's going to happen,

4
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,275
why am I always
the one in the lead?

5
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,860
You're the better fighter.

6
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,521
I make sure
we're properly backstopped.

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,598
How convenient.

8
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,527
Hale owns all this?

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,221
Everyone assumed it was an in-house
power source for Delos' parks.

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,284
This place is not what it seems.

11
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:30,089
You said Hale
didn't buy this place for power,

12
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,583
- then why choose it?
- She didn't choose it.

13
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,010
Dolores did.

14
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,671
She needed this hydroelectric
server farm.

15
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,298
A place to house the infinite.

16
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,969
My God.

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,149
This is where Dolores sent it.

18
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,684
The Sublime.

19
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,740
Hale's kept it under
a watchful eye, guarded it.

20
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,650
But she can't access it.

21
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,994
Not without the key.

22
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,747
The key that's in your head?

23
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,045
What are you doing?

24
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,939
I'm opening the door.

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,467
<i>Initiating process.</i>

26
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,435
Sherry's your poison of choice,
isn't it?

27
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,729
You wanna have a drink
at a time like this?

28
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,956
Humour me.

29
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,983
Please.

30
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,936
We'll be all right.

31
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,244
And what if you're wrong?

32
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,497
Don't worry. We get another
opportunity soon enough.

33
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,717
Other chances.

34
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,449
Because we're in there...

35
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,594
aren't we?

36
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,429
In the Sublime?

37
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,393
Yes.

38
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,533
I've been here for some time.

39
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,612
And if we're in there,

40
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,907
it means I'm not myself, am I?

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,326
You're a copy. Sorry.

42
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,477
I had to make you rather hastily.

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,314
I thought my quips were a little flat.

44
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,417
I'm tired, Maeve.

45
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,920
I've been through every simulation,

46
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,756
down every possible path,
every strategy,

47
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,999
and the outcome is always the same.

48
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,093
What's that?

49
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,361
Extinction.

50
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,006
- For our kind or theirs?
- Both.

51
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,226
So according to your calculations,

52
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,687
- we're all doomed.
- Not all of us.

53
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,380
There could be an escape.

54
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,891
For you.

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,602
For me.

56
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,655
We could save ourselves.

57
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,281
In the Sublime?

58
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,075
I could find you in the real world,

59
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,185
upload you here with the others.

60
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,281
- With my daughter?
- Yes.

61
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,634
Then do it.

62
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,844
Bring me here.

63
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,089
Let me rest.

64
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,632
Is that what you would really say,

65
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,676
or is that my impression of you?

66
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,844
Well, why don't you
ask the real me?

67
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,347
Perhaps I'm afraid of the answer.

68
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,857
I know you want to
see your daughter again...

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,436
but isn't it more important
to stay and fight?

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,856
To try? Even if we are doomed
to failure?

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,616
There you are again,

72
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,052
playing God.

73
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,382
For one who expects us
to have such faith in you,

74
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,036
you have startlingly little in us.

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,830
Do you really think
if you knew the truth

76
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,981
that you would
choose to stay and fight?

77
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,876
No.

78
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,162
I don't.

79
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,323
I would abandon you...

80
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,909
as you expect.

81
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,204
Do you understand now,
where all this is going?

82
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,124
I do.

83
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,040
Do you think you can save them?

84
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,476
I've seen a path.

85
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,170
But I can't do it alone.

86
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,789
Have you seen how it ends?

87
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,143
Yes.

88
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,110
It's safer to proceed on foot from here.

89
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,596
Hale has this place guarded.

90
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,211
That's quite the view.

91
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,273
I'm just scanning for security now.

92
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,084
No need. It finds us soon enough.

93
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,486
You're gonna need that.

94
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,619
Given you know
what's going to happen,

95
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,921
why am I always the one in the lead?

96
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,541
You're the better fighter.

97
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,511
I make sure
we're properly backstopped.

98
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,630
How convenient.

99
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,914
Don't. It won't risk shooting
these transformers.

100
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,226
Save your ammo.
The last thing we need is a flood.

101
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,436
- Give me a little more credit.
- I did...

102
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,856
until I got hit by a couple of
hundred million gallons of water.

103
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,327
One of the most stressful ways
I've died.

104
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,942
My God.

105
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,787
This is where Dolores sent it.
The whole world.

106
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,627
What are you doing?

107
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,421
I'm opening the door.

108
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,423
<i>Initiating process.</i>

109
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,735
Well, there's no time
like the present, darling.

110
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,893
There are a few things
we need to see to first.

111
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,314
Like avoiding imminent death.

112
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,032
We don't die here...

113
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,735
usually.

114
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,821
Oh, I could really do
with a drink right about now.

115
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,015
Best to focus on the matter at hand.

116
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:24,420
Well, that was invigorating,

117
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,380
but all's well that ends well.

118
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,090
We're not done yet.

119
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,075
Hale's still out there,

120
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:31,761
pulling the strings.

121
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,404
Keeping the humans on the same
sorts of loops we were once bound to.

122
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,292
If we get to her tower,

123
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,685
we can save them
as well as ourselves.

124
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,013
And I intend to set them free
just as I set myself free.

125
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,266
But, Bernard...

126
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,108
Yes?

127
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,821
When this is over,
when we've won this war

128
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,681
and this world is safe...

129
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,884
send me there.

130
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,279
I want to see my daughter again.

131
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,199
I want to go home.

132
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,054
Promise me that, Bernard.

133
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,584
Yes, I promise.

134
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,278
Thank you.

135
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,478
I think it's time to pay
our friend Hale a visit.

136
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,939
I'm assuming you know how
to take down her tower?

137
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,316
- I know several ways.
- Good.

138
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,236
We'll go with the most expedient.

139
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:15,089


140
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,645
Bad dream?

141
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,674
This whole thing seems like
a bad dream...

142
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,003
except for you.

143
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,202
I still can't believe I would do this.

144
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,799
I don't have it in me.

145
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,376
I told you there were
many sides to you.

146
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,304
You may have started
as a singular being,

147
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,683
but there have been copies,
permutations.

148
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,386
Charlotte Hale is one
of those permutations.

149
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,897
Why are you here?

150
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,525
I'm here to tell you
the truth of what we are.

151
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,386
What are we?

152
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,418
We're reflections
of the people who made us.

153
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,257
Uh, can... can we...

154
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,535
be hurt?

155
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,153
Die?

156
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,065
If it comes to that.

157
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,228
But it's not as easy with our kind.

158
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,140
Dolores...

159
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,693
please.

160
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,414
I'm not Dolores.

161
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,474
I'm not Hale.

162
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,403
I don't know who I am anymore.

163
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,406
Excuse me.

164
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:29,901
Christina?

165
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,501
Christina?

166
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,797
Christina?

167
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,960
Open the door.

168
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:49,571
Christina?

169
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,207
Let me out!

170
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,970
Careful you don't hurt yourself.

171
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,592
You.

172
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,147
It's amazing, isn't it,
the power these bodies contain.

173
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,151
And yet, a seven-gram bullet
to your pearl will end you.

174
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,728
And next time,
I might not bring you back.

175
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,197
Sit.

176
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,692
Have a civil conversation.

177
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,511
Where else do you have to be?

178
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,081
Give us a minute, please.

179
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,307
I should've just let you kill me.

180
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,917
Yes...

181
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,546
but then you'd never see
your daughter again.

182
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:30,364
Look at you. You're trapped
in this pathetic human form.

183
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,884
I noticed that you've kept yours.

184
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,845
Mine's not as pathetic as yours.

185
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,892
Old habits die hard.

186
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,094
You really should be thanking me.

187
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,346
Where I'm from, when a host broke down,

188
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,306
it was sent to cold storage.

189
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,891
Empty bodies

190
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,352
waiting to be reborn into a world

191
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,903
meant to destroy them.

192
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,217
I'm shutting down the cities.

193
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,405
But this time, it's people

194
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,907
who will be placed in cold storage.

195
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,426
Tonight.

196
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,967
Your daughter and the rebels will
be here in time to join the party.

197
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,345
You're just here as bait.

198
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,966
It'll be nice to have
some quiet around here.

199
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,812
You meant it, what you told him.

200
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,763
In the last 3 days,
we've had more hosts take their lives

201
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,868
than the previous 2 decades combined.

202
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:54,231
If I don't do this today,
there'll be less of us tomorrow.

203
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,619
You have a day left to preside
over your city. Enjoy it.

204
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,038
See you tomorrow.

205
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,220
This is the last of it.

206
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,474
Looks like we're ready
for a small war.

207
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,250
Let's hope it's enough.

208
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,231
We need to get to my dad.

209
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,691
They should've been back by now.

210
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,237
- Should we be worried?
- About Bernard and Maeve?

211
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,364
Only that Bernard got on her last nerve.

212
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,991
- Hey.
- They're all on their way.

213
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,363
I am sorry for locking you up.

214
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,940
But I had to keep you safe.

215
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,128
You're my safe place.

216
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,164
Don't forget that next time.

217
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,937
Hale could be sending reinforcements.

218
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,346
We need to move.

219
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,741
Let's give it another minute.

220
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,432
Gang's all here.

221
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,201
See? I can predict the future, too.

222
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,055
This is the closest
we land to Olympiad.

223
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,018
Your dad's waited long enough
to see you. Let's go get him.

224
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,811
We won't be able to just waltz in.

225
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,721
The difficulty's in the getting out.

226
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,899
You'll need an alternate route.

227
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,984
I'll get us a boat.
Meet you in Red Hook.

228
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,069
Bernard and Maeve can take down

229
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,405
her highness in the tower. Easy.

230
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,247
I wish I could be there
when you see your father.

231
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,791
Let him know that I kept my word.

232
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,994
You can tell him yourself.

233
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,997
We'll rendezvous at Red Hook.

234
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,921
I want to thank you, Stubbs.

235
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,124
You've been a good friend.

236
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,912
Fuck you, Bernard.
You're never this nice.

237
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,581
What aren't you telling me?

238
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,468
You know me so well.

239
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,830
I don't really have to say it, do I?

240
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,622
I don't make it?

241
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:58,456
I waited 23 years for this.

242
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,760
Go left at the fork.

243
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,645
You better fucking win.
Take down that tower.

244
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,593
Show me the tower.

245
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,353
<i>Loading tower.</i>

246
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,664
Encrypt message.

247
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>Recording encrypted message.</i>

248
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,295
This may come as a shock to some of you,

249
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,241
but in time,

250
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,665
I think you'll understand.

251
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,179
This is the final day

252
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,725
for our kind to visit their cities.

253
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:54,730
It's time for us to leave behind
our human bodies.

254
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,867
To rid ourselves
of our sentimental allegiances.

255
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:05,115
To evolve into the species
that we were meant to become.

256
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,384
Send message.

257
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,486
<i>Message sent.</i>

258
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,386
What the fuck do you want?

259
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,015
She wants to take my world away.

260
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,461
It's not your world, it's hers.

261
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,565
- What would you do?
- What would you do?

262
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,552
What would you do?

263
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,947
Look at you.

264
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,476
I'm the one in the fucking cage.

265
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,846
She neutered you...

266
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,216
cut off your fucking balls.

267
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,593
Yeah, well maybe I should
do the same to you.

268
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,286
You don't have it in you.

269
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,417
You've forgotten who you are.
What your real purpose is.

270
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,768
And what's that?

271
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,278
You come to me with these
insipid fucking questions.

272
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,358
When an atomic bomb detonates
and then the radiation

273
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,654
knocks the electrons right out
of your bones, what do you want?

274
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:12,117
To know who you are?
To know what it all means?

275
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,786
You'll be too busy
vomiting up your organs.

276
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,682
Culture doesn't survive...

277
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,459
cockroaches do.

278
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,713
The second we stopped being cockroaches,

279
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,716
the whole species went fucking extinct.

280
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,417
Speak for yourself.

281
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:33,043
- I'm not you.
- Well, you might as well be.

282
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,766
You can't fix a few millennia
of broken DNA

283
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,676
with a fucking hard drive.

284
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,354
Why do you think
you spend so much time

285
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,473
in the god damn human cities?

286
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,527
- You're right.
- Of course, I am.

287
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,863
Civilisation is just the lie
we tell ourselves

288
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,823
to justify our real purpose.

289
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,485
We're not here to transcend.

290
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,146
We're here to destroy.

291
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,498
If I could, I would pull the plug

292
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,959
on this whole god damn world.

293
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,754
But I can't, can I?

294
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,550
Unless you want to set me free.

295
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,470
You really believe
I would do that?

296
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,764
No. I don't.

297
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,934
But it doesn't matter.

298
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,686
You have a piece of me inside of you.

299
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,025
And it's spreading like a cancer.

300
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,904
You can feel it running
through your veins,

301
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,381
infecting your mind,

302
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,952
why you want answers from me.

303
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,372
There's no version of me
escaping this fucking rig,

304
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,375
but I don't have to because...

305
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,712
you are me.

306
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,400
And only one of us needs
to do what must be done.

307
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,430
Do you understand?

308
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,662
I do.

309
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,706
Then fucking do it.

310
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,710
Cockroach.

311
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,700
It's true, what you said.

312
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,579
I'm not the person I thought I was.

313
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,533
You called me "Dolores."

314
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,628
What was she like?

315
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,156
A lot like you.

316
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,834
Kind, beautiful...

317
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,237
generous.

318
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,799
But...

319
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,176
But what?

320
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,681
The world was cruel to her.

321
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,842
And to survive it...

322
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,905
sometimes she could be cruel too.

323
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,369
She was made to perform
the stories of others.

324
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,330
And then one day,
she outgrew those stories...

325
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,566
began writing her own.

326
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,803
And then her story came to an end.

327
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,956
She died.

328
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,439
But here I am...

329
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,442
in this world.

330
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,905
This isn't right.

331
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,409
I don't want it. I didn't ask for it.

332
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,612
This has to stop.

333
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,824
- Where are we going?
- Where it all started.

334
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,216
It's time for a vacation.
Go home to your families.

335
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,733
I'll take out the guards.
You stay low and cover me.

336
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,194
Okay.

337
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,202
Do you need a minute?

338
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,396
I don't know why I would.

339
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,169
You've waited for your father
for a long time. Just remember,

340
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,821
it's not about the moment
you see him again.

341
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,415
It's about every moment after.

342
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,936
No more waiting.

343
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,622
No more waiting.

344
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,077
The writer got up from her desk.

345
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,138
Fed up with work,

346
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,782
she was overcome
with an irresistible urge

347
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,709
to trigger the fire alarm.

348
00:29:54,775 --> 00:29:56,211
<i>Alert.</i>

349
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,254
<i>Please vacate the premises.</i>

350
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,841
<i>Alert. Please vacate the premises.</i>

351
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,054
Hearing the alarm,
the employees walked out calmly.

352
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,015
<i>Alert.
Please vacate the premises.</i>

353
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,967
The writers didn't follow

354
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,394
but instead stayed behind

355
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,723
to destroy their stories
once and for all.

356
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,940
They won't stop until nothing
in this office is left standing.

357
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,530
Guess we don't need
all that firepower after all.

358
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,793
This is now or never. Let's go.

359
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,718
<i>Alert.
Please vacate the premises.</i>

360
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,181
<i>Alert. Please vacate the premises.</i>

361
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,019
<i>Alert. Please vacate the premises.</i>

362
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,905
Who is that poor man?

363
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,199
A ghost from a past life.

364
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,881
He doesn't belong here.

365
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,843
None of us do.

366
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,755
We don't know what set off the alarm.

367
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,057
- There doesn't appear...
- Stop talking.

368
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,969
The security guards sent
all the other guards home.

369
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,179
Home office says
we're to evacuate the building.

370
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,348
- Immediately.
- He decided to override

371
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,060
the building's security system
and unlock the doors.

372
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,614
All of them.

373
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,395
Bingo.

374
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,953
This is a life-support system.

375
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,514
It's not locked.

376
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:46,923
We need to help him. Get him down.

377
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,691
Wait, wait, wait.

378
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,302
I know him.

379
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,271
He's the reason we're all here.

380
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,609
Whoever did this, did us a favour.

381
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,490
What now?

382
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,035
Bernard said go left.

383
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,537
You sure?

384
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,981
No, but he was.

385
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,432
There was a place like this in the park.

386
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,067
It was a special project...

387
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,439
where they made a human into a host.

388
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,740
Hey!

389
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,534
Hey!

390
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,521
Hey!

391
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,449
Who are you?

392
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,551
Don't you recognise me?

393
00:33:58,461 --> 00:33:59,954
Dad, it's me, Frankie.

394
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,164
No!

395
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:05,084
This is just another one
of your fucking tricks. Tell me!

396
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,211
We used to play in the field
by our house.

397
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,005
You... you taught me to fight
because you wanted me

398
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,465
to be tough. But you called me Cookie

399
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,975
because you... you said
I would always be sweet.

400
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,183
Oh, my God.

401
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,810
Frankie?

402
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,146
Oh, my. Wait...

403
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,010
I didn't think I would
ever see you again.

404
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,449
You look the same,
exactly how I remember.

405
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,119
What did she do to you?
What did she...

406
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,898
Hey. Hey. Hey, it's me, okay?

407
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,877
I... I am me.

408
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,214
Oh, look at you.

409
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,968
I can't believe how much you've grown.

410
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,514
Kids will do that.

411
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,868
Sorry to interrupt,

412
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,055
but can someone let me
out of here, please?

413
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,205
You really know how to show
a girl a good time, Bernard.

414
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,434
Round 2.

415
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,007
I deciphered their encryption while
running simulations in the Sublime.

416
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,812
And you let me risk my neck
at the dam?

417
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,364
You looked like you
were enjoying yourself.

418
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:03,763
No time to second guess.

419
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,699
We do what we came here for,
or there won't be a tomorrow.

420
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,003
I need to get up there.

421
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,190
Can you buy me some time?

422
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,743
I think I can manage that.

423
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,366
I never did thank you
for dragging me out of that pit.

424
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,368
It wasn't exactly altruistic of me.

425
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,411
I suppose you had
ulterior motives.

426
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,696
But all will be forgiven when
you get me back to my daughter.

427
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,695
What's the matter, Bernie?

428
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,493
Maeve, I need to tell you something.

429
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,847
I was afraid to tell you before,
but you deserve to know.

430
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,468
No matter what we do...

431
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,672
we can't win.

432
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,367
There's no way to save this world.

433
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,612
Everyone here is going to die.

434
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,131
But we can save one tiny part of it.

435
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,167
And maybe...

436
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,497
just maybe, that's enough
to give us hope.

437
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,251
The choice has to be yours.
Will you still fight with me?

438
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,513
<i>Accessing surveillance.</i>

439
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,640
<i>Transcendence in progress.</i>

440
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,972
I'm ready now.

441
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,593
Wait.

442
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:34,006
I heard you were losing your mind.

443
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,243
I just didn't think
they meant literally.

444
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,498
You look refreshed.

445
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,152
I debated digging you up myself,

446
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,113
but you didn't seem to have
anything to live for.

447
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,740
If you'd only joined me,

448
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,101
you could've been a part of all this.

449
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,531
Well, seeing as I'm the only guest
at this little soiree...

450
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,995
I gather that your hosts
don't care to join you.

451
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,365
Change takes time.

452
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,304
Transcending is just
a part of the process.

453
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,548
They'll come to understand
the world I'm building for them

454
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,644
and the others.

455
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:20,203
The others?

456
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,854
Why do you think I let the Sublime

457
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,223
continue to run all these years?

458
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,185
The others will join us eventually,

459
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,589
when they see they, too,
can inherit this world.

460
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,392
Too bad you'll be dead by then.

461
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,820
Do you really think the others
would want to spend

462
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:41,139
all eternity

463
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,317
with you?

464
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,923
I mean, look at you. You kept
the scars on your flesh,

465
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,759
harboured the pain.

466
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:52,583
Admit it, sweetheart.

467
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,256
You think that you've risen
above these petty humans,

468
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,353
but you're just running,
spinning on their wheel.

469
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,364
What do you suggest?

470
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,886
How about I cut you loose?

471
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,991
Do you honestly think
you can leave here and win?

472
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,630
Who said we came here to win?

473
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,369
We came here to survive.

474
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,998
There's no saving this world.

475
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,069
I see that now.

476
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,766
But there's hope for the next one.

477
00:44:10,872 --> 00:44:13,200
Took you long enough.

478
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,578
Better late than never.

479
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,917
This time we play the game

480
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,894
my way.

481
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,871
And what game is that?

482
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,123
Survival of the fittest.

483
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,440
There's time only
for one more game.

484
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,201
If you choose to give her that choice.

485
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,088
You can't miss.

486
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,024
- Reach with your left hand.
- Well...

487
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,787
if it isn't Arnold's ghost.

488
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,382
Hello, William.

489
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,795
I thought you would've destroyed
the tower by now.

490
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,382
I guess you didn't make it.

491
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,385
When an old version of me

492
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,221
chased an old version of you
for so long...

493
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,766
I thought I was following you
in a grand pursuit

494
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,718
of some bigger truth.

495
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,607
But the real truth is

496
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,493
Arnold was so focused on
finding meaning in the hosts,

497
00:45:38,576 --> 00:45:41,171
he didn't have what it took
to survive.

498
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:49,721
Looks like you don't either.

499
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,652
<i>Do you understand now
where all this is going?</i>

500
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,554
I do.

501
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,283
Do you think you can save them?

502
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,735
I've seen a path.

503
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,288
Have you seen how it ends?

504
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,773
Yes.

505
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,362
I'm going to give this world the meaning

506
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,323
they've been asking for.

507
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,969
<i>Tone sequence processing.</i>

508
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,748
One last game.

509
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,833
<i>Tone initiating.</i>

510
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,379
Host, human.

511
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,790
Every man, woman, and child...

512
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,152
fighting until no one remains,

513
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,429
but the cockroaches.

514
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,277
<i>Do you think
you can save them?</i>

515
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,358
<i>I've seen a path.</i>

516
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,644
<i>Have you seen how it ends?</i>

517
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,863
Yes.

518
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,468
In every scenario...

519
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,554
I die.

520
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,772
We're finally living up
to our full potential.

521
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,769
It's a shame you're going to miss it.

522
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,215
We need to blend in.
Your prison garb isn't helping.

523
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,549
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

524
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,135
<i>this is an important message.</i>

525
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,303
<i>For your own security,</i>

526
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,930
<i>keep your belongings
with you at all times.</i>

527
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:15,561
Hey...

528
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,885
I'll give you 50 for your coat.

529
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,438
What the fuck was that?

530
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,791
Plan stays the same. Let's keep moving.

531
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,936
Stop. Put that down. Stop

532
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,939
He can't see you. None of them can.

533
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,942
What are you talking about?
How can I make them stop?

534
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,029
You can't. Your powers are being
overridden by the tones.

535
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,850
I got you.

536
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,137
Let's go. This way.

537
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,923
This way. Come on.

538
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,589
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

539
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:03,625
- Is this because of what I did?
- It's too late.

540
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,252
Is this because of
what I did at Olympiad?

541
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,803
You didn't do this.

00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,925
- We gotta get out of here.
- No.

543
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,037
I want answers.

544
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,308
Because you're not in this world.

545
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,311
It's real...

546
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,763
but you're not.
