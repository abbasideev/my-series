1
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,209
I don't like it.

2
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,671
His businesses are legitimate.
Why would he need us?

3
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,760


4
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,807
He's been buying most of the old city

5
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,310
and the outlying areas
using holding companies.

6
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,312
The land is mainly worthless,

7
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,315
but I don't understand what he's doing.

8
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,862


9
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,435
<i>Encantado.</i>

10
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,482
Likewise. Have you seen it before?

11
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,861
When I was a kid.
Road trip with my parents.

12
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,113
- Hasn't changed a bit.
- Hm.

13
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,990
Let me show you around.

14
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,658
Mm-hm.

15
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,209
We've upgraded the turbines.

16
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,920
They're rated to last
100 years without maintenance.

17
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,798
All to power... this.

18
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,221
We're looking for resilience.

19
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:06,769
Our timeline
is more ambitious than most.

20
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,397
We offer a unique proposition.

21
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,568
Data has always been fungible.
Temporary.

22
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,322
If you invest yours with us,
it will be written in stone.

23
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,408
- Forever.
- Forever...

24
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,785
in my experience
is a little bit longer

25
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,287
than most people expect.

26
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,806
How much of our platform
are you looking to reserve?

27
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,225
- All of it.
- Come again?

28
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,562
What I want is already in there.

29
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,273
It was stolen from me.

30
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,610
From one of my facilities,
eight years ago.

31
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,571
And I know you were
paid handsomely to store it.

32
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,951
I would suggest you take it up
with the person who stole it.

33
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:07,121
I can't. She's dead.
Which means I can't decrypt it.

34
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,499
And no one else can.

35
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,627
I don't want it moved or disturbed.

36
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,046
So I'll take the whole shebang.

37
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,760
This is a unique asset,
and as such, it's not for sale.

38
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,305
This is America.
Everything here is for sale.

39
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,352
That's a pretty good return
on your investment.

40
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,528
We know what you've been doing.

41
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,031
You think anyone sells land
without our approval?

42
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,869
We've been happy to sell.
It's worthless scrubland.

43
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,164
But you can't have this place.

44
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,251
You ever hear the one
about the missionary

45
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,044
who tried to negotiate with the tiger?

46
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,131
He told the tiger
he could eat most of him,

47
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,675
but he had to stop
when he got to his head.

48
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,679
You and your friends in the cartel

49
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,140
or whatever the fuck you're
calling yourselves these days

50
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,559
sell me this lump of concrete, today.

51
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,520
Or?

52
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,273
Or you give it to me
for nothing. Tomorrow.

53
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,027
We, uh...

54
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,947
we weren't very welcome
when we came here.

55
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,032
We had to accept

56
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,242
whatever the old timers
offered, at first.

57
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,621
We buried most of them
at the bottom of this lake.

58
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,251
Our organisation has
a long, proud history

59
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:39,422
of defending itself
and its business aggressively.

60
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,468
Door number two, then.

61
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,179
<i>Mañana.</i>

62
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,655
<i>Mañana.</i>

63
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,730


64
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,693
He said that
yesterday he would have paid.

65
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:12,491
But today we would
give it to him for nothing.

66
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,629
Thank you.

67
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,882
Is my work done?

68
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,511
Yes. You can rest now.

69
00:10:53,675 --> 00:11:01,435


70
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,987
You're up. I have a dilemma.

71
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,908
Which would you choose? White or black?

72
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,455
Christina?

73
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,040
- They both look great.
- Pick a side, Chrissie.

74
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,671
What are you wearing tonight?

75
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,090
Uh, this?

76
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,092
Right.

77
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,220
It looks great,

78
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,640
unlike these damn bags under my eyes.

79
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,684
I look like a zombie.

80
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,687
- Bad night's sleep?
- Nightmares.

81
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,105
Maybe I should've taken a tab.

82
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,983
But, uh, I just kept
tossing and turning.

83
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,993
Is it that weirdo again?

84
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,204
I blocked him,
but he keeps getting through.

85
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,413
It's just some creep

86
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,874
or a bot trying to sell you
a privacy subscription.

87
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,375
I guess.

88
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,297
Lately, I feel like
someone's watching me.

89
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,449
No offence, but how?

90
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,760
I mean, except for work,
you don't leave the apartment,

91
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,472
which is why you're coming out tonight.

92
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,557
I mean, he's supposed to be
a really nice guy.

93
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,226
And his profile's platinum rated.

94
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,687
Set-ups are just so awkward.

95
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,441
And so is dying alone.

96
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,070
You cannot hide from the world
forever, Christina.

97
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,241
Okay.

98
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,107
That was insane.

99
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,650
This is way better than I expected.

100
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,069
This place is fucking wild.

101
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,029
Can't believe this is your first time.

102
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,239
Come on.

103
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,283
I know a spot that's really
gonna blow your mind.

104
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,793
Can you see it?

105
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:41,380
It's looming over us. The tower!
Can you see it? Huh?

106
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,717
Can you see it? Can you see it?

107
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,802
Record pitch.

108
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,306
There's a young girl.

109
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,225
Not that young.

110
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,145
More like late teens.

111
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,859
She lives at home
with her father in the country.

112
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,656
Scratch that. The city.

113
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,201
He's a little infirm,

114
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,828
so she spends most of her time with him.

115
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,081
But she dreams of a bigger life

116
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:02,002
with excitement, adventure, romance.

117
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,962
Christina.

118
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,924
Pause record.

119
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,388
We need to talk
about your work performance.

120
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,099
I mean, don't you want
to advance in your career?

121
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,351
- Of course I do.
- Well, then you got to stop

122
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,853
pitching these saccharine stories.

123
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,315
You know, people want sex,
danger, violence,

124
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,735
transgressions, melodrama.
They want tragedy.

125
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,363
- Yada, yada, yada.
- I know.

126
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,450
I... I was thinking maybe I could write

127
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,161
in some different genres
to broaden it out.

128
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,707
Maybe a little romance, some humour.

129
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,075
Maybe just save that for your diary.

130
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,886
I know you've got it in you
to write the kind of copy we need.

131
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,507
Now, take that story you wrote
a couple months back.

132
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,510
Poor schmuck loses everything,
drowns his sorrows,

133
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,279
stalks some girl.

134
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,103
How'd it end again?

135
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,892
- Everyone dies.
- Yes. That's right.

136
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,560
It's a real tearjerker.

137
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,481
Just, uh, bring more of that.

138
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,360
Or else I'm gonna have to
find another writer who can.

139
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,239
- Understood?
- Yes. Of course.

140
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,699
All right.

141
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,014
<i>Hello? You hear me?</i>

142
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,725
<i>I know you're out there.
I saw what you wrote.</i>

143
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,977
<i>Why are you doing this to us?</i>

144
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,688
<i>You have to help me.
Your game is ruining my life...</i>

145
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,675
<i>Always a classic</i>

146
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,052
<i>by the inimitable Hendrix.</i>

147
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,514
<i>And now, back to our coverage
of the festivities.</i>

148
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,849
<i>Preparations are underway
for this year's...</i>

149
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,088
No!

150
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,811
Are you ready, darling?

151
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,438
- For what?
<i>- This is the new world.</i>

152
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,818
And in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want.

153
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,779
Oh, for fuck's sake...

154
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,697
Got any plans for the anniversary?

155
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,244
Nah. Just work.

156
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,206
Cashing in on that overtime, eh?

157
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,124
Man, seven years ago,

158
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,002
it would've just been robots
working the holiday, but...

159
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,421
lucky for us,
they're all scrap metal now.

160
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,925
Least the riots
ensured our job security.

161
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,095
That wasn't exactly the point
of the riots.

162
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,055
Yeah, 'cause the riots had no point.

163
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,349
They won us our freedom.

164
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,686
Sure, but from what? Ourselves?

165
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,854
Hey, man, the way I look at it,
that Incite machine that they blew up

166
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,484
didn't tell us who we could be,
it told us who we already were.

167
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,780
- You actually believe that?
- Don't you? Let me ask you this.

168
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,765
Has your life changed since they
destroyed those machines?

169
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,764
You haven't been practising enough.

170
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,525
Dad!

171
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,919
Good to see you, Cookie.

172
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,889
Here. All right.

173
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,611
- How'd you do that?
- Like I said, practice.

174
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,596
A lot of it.

175
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,898
On cans?

176
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,177
Yeah. On cans.

177
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,620
Here.

178
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,172
M'kay.

179
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,650
Remember. This.

180
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:08,786
Now stare at it.

181
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,289
Okay. Visualise.

182
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,168
Breathe out.

183
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,286
Hold steady.

184
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,605
And squeeze.

185
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,440
Frankie! Caleb!

186
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,446
I was visualising.

187
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,074
Well, come inside
and visualise meatloaf.

188
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,262
- Just a little longer?
- C'mon, listen to your mother.

189
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,703
Coming.

190
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,324
Go wash up.

191
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,970
Enough with the cowboy shit.

192
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,389
- She likes it.
- She's seven, Caleb.

193
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,433
Thanks to you, her hobbies
are sugar and violence.

194
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,236
Look, I'm sorry.

195
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,281
I know it's not an easy day for you,

196
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,325
but the war is over.

197
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,120
It's time you start living that way.

198
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,181
Okay?

199
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,957
Hm.

200
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,426
Go set the table.

201
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,887
What's the magic word?

202
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,424
Divorce.

203
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,581
- Love you too.
- Hm.

204
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,474
You lose power the other night?

205
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,385
Must've been spared.

206
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,845
You, uh, sure you don't want

207
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,680
some extra bottles for your guests?

208
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,766
Guests?

209
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,476
Your friends.

210
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,144
Stopped by asking for directions.

211
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,854
I tried to describe it,

212
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,483
but you live pretty far
off the beaten path.

213
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,735
You really should get
a sat phone or, um,

214
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,238
- some kind of connec...
- These friends of mine,

215
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,365
how long ago did they stop by?

216
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,283
Not 20 minutes since you been in.

217
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,415
On second thought,

218
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,926
why don't you go ahead
and add that to my tab?

219
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,313
Fire!

220
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,094
How did you find me?

221
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,514
Two days ago. We got a signal.

222
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,309
Your little power outage. It was enough.

223
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,937
How many more are after me?

224
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,981
I'm no... not at liberty to say.

225
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,691
Well, let me liberate you.

226
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,985
Seven years,
I've been off the grid alone,

227
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,405
not bothering anyone.

228
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,782
And yet here you are darkening my door.

229
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,744
Who sent you, Colonel Brigham?

230
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,413
Who the fuck is that?

231
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,207
I'm afraid I don't have
the patience to explain.

232
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,401
Now be a dear.

233
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,612
Close your eyes, won't you?

234
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,244
<i>Go get her.</i>

235
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,330
I've got no idea she's home or not.

236
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,274
Haven't seen her
in a couple of days.

237
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,429
Shit.

238
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,808
<i>Welcome home.</i>

239
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,899
- Hello?
- You on your way?

240
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,610
Shit. I forgot.

241
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,153
<i>You didn't forget.</i>

242
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,072
<i>You repressed.</i>

243
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,324
I'm not going to be
an accessory after the fact

244
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,577
to the murder
of your social life. Let's go.

245
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,953
But...

246
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,480
Look, I'm sure it was nothing.

247
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,273
Probably that kid from the fourth floor

248
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,150
that likes to smoke weed
on the fire escape.

249
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,903
- Yeah. Right.
- Mm. You want some?

250
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,613
- No, I'm okay.
- Hm.

251
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:32,325
Here. In case.

252
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,912
And remember, smile.
You have to at least try.

253
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,039
Do I?

254
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,000
I mean, even if by some miracle
we're right for each other,

255
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,711
shouldn't it be natural and easy?

256
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,755
Are you kidding?

257
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:50,843
Take a look at this world.
Nobody wants easy or natural.

258
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,721
Art is a lie
that tells the truth, honey.

259
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,850
And the truth is, you need to get laid.

260
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,193
Look at this.
All the people. You like people.

261
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,696
- You should try breathing.
- I should get a drink.

262
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,281
Uh-huh. Yes, you should.
It's going to be great.

263
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,617
Thank you.

264
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,871
Huh. Just give me the signal
if he's a dud.

265
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,707
Hm?

266
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,961
Oh, and don't forget to smile.

267
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:31,759
Most people think
it's just elite gambling,

268
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,011
but there's a system to investing.

269
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,305
Patterns that some minds
can decipher.

270
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,099
If there weren't,
I wouldn't be sitting

271
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,518
in this lovely restaurant
drinking superb wine

272
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,478
with such fine company.

273
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,151
So, enough about me.
What is it you do, again?

274
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,738
I'm a writer for Olympiad Entertainment.

275
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,932
Thank you.

276
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,993
Uh, wh...
what games do you write for?

277
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,744
Maybe I've played them.

278
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,748
I've been working on a new game.

279
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,916
It doesn't have a name yet.
It's still in beta.

280
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,961
But even after it's released,
you probably won't know my work.

281
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:09,589
I mostly write non player characters.

282
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,798
What's that?

283
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,350
Background characters that interact
with the players on their journeys.

284
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,804
Not as high-profile
as programming the leads.

285
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,239
But it's just as important.

286
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,774
For most players, the background
characters are just cannon fodder.

287
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,181
I'm not doing it for the players,
I'm doing it for myself.

288
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,726
How so?

289
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,573
Real life can be disappointing.

290
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,870
Not that it's so bad. Just...
there should be more to it.

291
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,450
Maybe you just haven't found
the right man yet.

292
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,725
You sound depressed.

293
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,245
There's tabs for that.

294
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,265
They'll fix you right up.

295
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,360
What if I'm not the one that's broken?
What if it's the world that needs fixing?

296
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,206
There's tabs for that feeling, too.

297
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,184
Of course.

298
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,056
Will you excuse me?

299
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,915
- Please stop calling me.
<i>- Wait, wait!</i>

300
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,585
<i>Don't hang up. You need to help me.</i>

301
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,128
<i>The doctors think I'm crazy.</i>

302
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,506
<i>But I know you're real.
Just like the tower is real.</i>

303
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,050
<i>You need to stop what you're doing.</i>

304
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,510
I told you, I'm not doing anything.

305
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,095
<i>You're destroying my life.</i>

306
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,264
I'm not. I don't even know you.

307
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,807
<i>You can't hide from me.</i>

308
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,475
<i>I will find you.</i>

309
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,271
<i>Do you understand?
You have to end this, or I will.</i>

310
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,898
You need help,
and I hope you get it.

311
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,766
But next time you call,
I'm going to the police.

312
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:35,484
<i>No, no, don't hang...</i>

313
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,826
<i>Yeah, I'm surprised.</i>

314
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,202
<i>I just bumped into a work friend.</i>

315
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,329
Oh, really?

316
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,955
<i>I think I'm gonna be out for a while.</i>

317
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,498
<i>Don't be discouraged about tonight.</i>

318
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,917
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

319
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,878
Maya, it's fine, really. Have fun.

320
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,130
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm almost home.

321
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,883
<i>Okay, good. I gotta go. You're okay?</i>

322
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,134
- Yeah.
<i>- Take care.</i>

323
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:01,219
Bye.

324
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,061
- Sorry about that.
- It's my fault.

325
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,579
I wasn't paying attention.

326
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,012
I, uh, I didn't see you there.

327
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,565
But now I do.

328
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,189
It's okay.

329
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,159
You scared me.

330
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,989
I guess we're even.

331
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,548
I'm Peter.

332
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:32,166
I... I just have to get home.
My room mate's waiting for me.

333
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,877
I've been wanting to meet you
for such a long time.

334
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,338
- Excuse me?
- I knew you existed.

335
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,466
I was worried you weren't real,
but here you are.

336
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,469
Why are you doing this to us?

337
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,226
It's you. You're the one
who's been calling.

338
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,978
I need to ask you
to leave us alone.

339
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,604
- No.
- No, stop!

340
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,689
Stop! No, no, no!

341
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,023
- No!
- This isn't who I am.

342
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,901
- Get away from me!
- Please, this is important.

343
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,696
I lost my job, my wife.

344
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,239
I thought it was the tower. But...

345
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,662
it was you. You made me do those things.

346
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,414
All these people do
what you want them to.

347
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,790
I don't know what
you're talking about...

348
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,417
- No!
- No, no, let me go!

349
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,876
You need to stop!

350
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,413
No! No! No!

351
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,656
How did you know so much about us?

352
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:22,717
The game. You wrote us into it. How?

353
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,553
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Pe... Peter...

354
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,598
I'm so sorry for everything
that's happened to you.

355
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,518
But I have nothing do with that.
I can't help you.

356
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,463
You need to help me.

357
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,231
I need for the story to change.

358
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,641
I need the ending to be different.

359
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,323
- I'm sorry.
- No!

360
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:52,713
Get off me, man!

361
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,352
"They heard a voice scream,

362
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,306
'We need our dragon!'

363
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,358
But my father and the dragon knew

364
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,904
that nothing in the world
would ever make them go back

365
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,658
to Wild Island.

366
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,282
The end."

367
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,244
All right. Time to tuck in.

368
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,630
All right.

369
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,007
You and Bear Bear sleep good, all right?

370
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,844
Can we leave the lights on tonight?

371
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,015
- Why would we do that?
- Bear Bear's scared.

372
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,184
I told him I'd keep watch over him.

373
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,730
Well, you know the best way
to keep watch at night

374
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,191
is to turn the lights down
around you and light up...

375
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,443
Light up the perimeter.

376
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,530
That way, no one can see you,
but you can see.

377
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,158
See everyone.

378
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,578
Look, um, Bear Bear doesn't need
to think about this stuff.

379
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,748
Okay? Everyone is safe and sound.

380
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,875
Promise?

381
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,054
I promise.

382
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,590
Okay, goodnight.

383
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,853
- Did you hear that?
- It's probably nothing.

384
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,030
Goodnight, Mum.

385
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,199
Come on, let's get you in bed.

386
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,669
- Hey.
- Fuck!

387
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,549
What the hell is this, Caleb?

388
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,050
There is something out there.

389
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,846
Yeah. A raccoon or a neighbour
or a delivery man.

390
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,975
We've been through this.

391
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:22,646
You just need to take
deep breaths. Calm yourself.

392
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,024
The past is in the past.

393
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,985
Nothing is going to hurt you
except your own mind.

394
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,813
I'm sorry.

395
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,950
<i>Are you gonna help me or not?</i>

396
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,048
Peter, I know that you're upset,

397
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,716
but whatever you think is happening,

398
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,593
you're just confused.

399
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,889
<i>So you're not gonna help.</i>

400
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,891
I wish I could,
but the stories that I write,

401
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,017
they're not real.

402
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,561
<i>Do you remember how mine ends?</i>

403
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,816
What?

404
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,738
- Peter, where are you?
<i>- Look up.</i>

405
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,210
Is this up to me,
or did you write this, too?

406
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,691
I found it under her pillow.

407
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,809
You're rubbing off on her, Caleb.

408
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,104
Isn't that a good thing?

409
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,622
Not when she's pretending
to have PTSD.

410
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,190
I see the messages you and your
war buddies send to each other.

411
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,303
Chemtrails, government cover-ups.

412
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:03,140
You see threats everywhere,
and now so does Frankie.

413
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,976
Look, I am not paranoid.

414
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,368
Maybe you're right.

415
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,447
I'm beginning to think
it's not that you fear war,

416
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,742
- it's that you miss it.
- Oh, my...

417
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,086
This life is too ordinary for you.

418
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,830
What?

419
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,210
You have a job,

420
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,834
a home,

421
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:38,033
a beautiful child,
and a very patient wife.

422
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:41,887
But it's never enough, is it?

423
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,181
Hey.

424
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,546
False alarm, Bear Bear.

425
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,383
See? It's just a raccoon.

426
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,176
Crap.

427
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,685
Hey there.

428
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,631
Is your daddy home?

429
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,679
Daddy, this man wants to talk to you.

430
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,847
Frankie!

431
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,110
I believe this is yours.

432
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,587
- Who are you?
- An old friend.

433
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,340
Caleb!

434
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,703
Frankie!

435
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:46,262
Are you okay?

436
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,830
- Go inside.
- Okay. Are you okay?

437
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,518
Hello, darling.

438
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,579
It's really you.

439
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,658
You know, I thought...

440
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,385
I was sure I was never gonna
see you again.

441
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,121
And yet here I am,

442
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,792
disposing and dismembering
just like the good old days.

443
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,504
If something happened to my daughter,

444
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,672
you have no idea...

445
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,206
I have every idea...

446
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,210
which is why it won't come to that.

447
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,922
I know who sent those men after us.

448
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,892
William.

449
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,844
He's back at it.

450
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:00,210
I, uh... Frankie's asleep. Thank God.

451
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,172
I called Carver.
The guys are downstairs.

452
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,801
All these years,
I thought you were paranoid.

453
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,791
But the war isn't over, is it?

454
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,648
No, it is me they wanted.

455
00:48:23,742 --> 00:48:25,611
Look, I am the one
who brought this upon us.

456
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,547
And I am the one
who has to end it.

457
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,400
So you're leaving.

458
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,504
Only for a little while.

459
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,560
You promised you'd be a father.

460
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,848
I am one.

461
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:46,472
Everything I do is for you...

462
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,784
and for Frankie.

463
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,948
You're going to get yourself killed.

464
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,068
Hey, I will come back to you.

465
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,012
I promise.

466
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,825
All right.

467
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,243
- You know the drill.
- You got it.

468
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,240
I always knew this day was coming.

469
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,758
As soon as you stop running,
everyone else starts to catch up.

470
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,597
- Any idea why now?
- I don't know.

471
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,808
But I had a little tête-à-tête

472
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,976
with the one that they sent after me.

473
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,813
We're not the only ones
William was after.

474
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:28,098
He was very interested in talking
to a Senator in California.

475
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,201
Then we should get to him first.

476
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,630
We?

477
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,625
I'm coming.

478
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,777
It's the only way
I can protect my family.

479
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,105
I'll be fine on my own.
You can stay here.

480
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,574
- You probably should.
- Would you?

481
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,477
No.

482
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,057
But I'd regret it.

483
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,461
Record pitch.

484
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,873
I want to write a new story.

485
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,622
About a girl...

486
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,446
a girl who's searching.

487
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,695
<i>The girl doesn't know
what she's searching for.</i>

488
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:51,233
<i>She just knows there
is an emptiness in her life.</i>

489
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,874
<i>Or maybe it's inside her.</i>

490
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,083
And when she finds the thing
she's searching for,

491
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,677
everything will make sense.

492
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,551
I want a story with a happy ending.

493
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,441
Stupid.

494
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,629
Stupid stories nobody wants to hear.
