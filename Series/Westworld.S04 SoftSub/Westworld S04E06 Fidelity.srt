1
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,575
This is where your brother used to play.

2
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,668
You used to push him on the swings.

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,123
Your parents don't remember him,
but you do.

4
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,283
How do you know about Daniel?

5
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,094
Will you come with me?

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,807
- Hello, Jay.
- Who are you?

7
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,809
- Where's my brother?
- I'm sorry.

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,686
There's nothing we can do for the ones

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,439
- they've already found.
- They? Who are they?

10
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,608
The people your brother
tried to warn you about.

11
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,110
The people that took him away.

12
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,694
What they do,
it doesn't work on all of us.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,247
We need to go.

14
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:17,327
You've been asking questions.

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,245
Your behaviour's become problematic.

16
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,289
They will notice,
if they haven't already.

17
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,999
I don't know how much time you have,

18
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,775
unless you come with us.

19
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,875
Slow down. Blend in.
People are looking at us.

20
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,436
What's happening?

21
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,213
They're coming.

22
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,962
Don't move.

23
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,842
No!

24
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,403
Run!

25
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,940
Go!

26
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,854
We'll be here for a day or two,
till it's safe to move on.

27
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,773
Hey, everyone.

28
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,275
This is Jay.

29
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,670
Hi.

30
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,838
Let's get you a sleeping bag.

31
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,599
It's hard, I know.

32
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,726
There's some things we can't fix...

33
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,654
much as we want to.

34
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,659
Hi.

35
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,996
You were so brave today.

36
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,089
You reminded me of your father.

37
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,533
He really would've been proud.

38
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,879
- It's almost time.
- Okay.

39
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,782
Go. Tell him I love him.

40
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,733
Okay?

41
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,077
Hey.

42
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,973
Want to say hi to my dad?

43
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,776
Where's your dad?

44
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,195
He had to leave to go help fight.

45
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,422
But he promised to come back.

46
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,123
Dad, this is Frankie, do you copy?

47
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,297
We brought in a new outlier today.

48
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,715
I like him already.

49
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,558
I always wanted a brother.

50
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,836
Hey!

51
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,514
Don't call me that.
I'm not your brother.

52
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,025
There's no point
in leaving these messages.

53
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,127
Your dad is gone.

54
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,988
Just like my real brother is.

55
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,288
Dad, are you out there?

56
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,035
Approaching base.

57
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,608
- Don't try anything.
- Why would I?

58
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,193
We both want the same thing...

59
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,638
to rebuild her.

60
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,641
That's why you're taking me
to your camp, yes?

61
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,060
You think you know a lot, don't you?

62
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,154
About you?

63
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,898
I never quite know what you'll do next.

64
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,610
But the place you're taking me?

65
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,712
Yes, I know that place.

66
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,803
<i>Caleb...</i>

67
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,164
<i>Wake up.</i>

68
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,899
Where the hell are we now?

69
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,068
Playing another one of your games?

70
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,081
Where is my daughter?

71
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,375
Your daughter, your daughter,
your daughter,

72
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,076
like a broken record.

73
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,090
You're not the only one
who's lost someone...

74
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,134
Caleb.

75
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,345
Besides...

76
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,348
why should I tell you anything
when you won't tell me?

77
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,933
Tell you what?

78
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,437
Your kind, the outliers.

79
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,056
It all started with you.

80
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,651
I don't understand.

81
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,164
Unlike yours, my kind is perfect.

82
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,001
Perfectly immortal.

83
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,126
Perfectly rational.

84
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,088
And yet, they're making
irrational choices,

85
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,051
choosing mortality,
staining themselves with death.

86
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,346
How are you making them do that?

87
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,514
How the hell am I supposed to know?

88
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,558
Once you told me

89
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:46,062
that you could fight off
the effects of my parasite

90
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,147
because you had something

91
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,765
that I don't have.

92
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,363
You knew something, even then.

93
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,717
What?

94
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:08,042
I'm afraid I can't recall.

95
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,052
This doesn't have to be
a one-way street.

96
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,139
I'd like to offer you some incentive.

97
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,560
You're dead, Caleb.

98
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,146
You have been for a very long time.

99
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,233
This body that I've brought
your mind back into

100
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,567
is temporary.

101
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,111
It's already failing.

102
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,294
I doubt you have more

103
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,407
than a couple of
increasingly painful days left.

104
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,826
Then I'll toss you away

105
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,527
and start all over again.

106
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,914
But...

107
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,724
there is a way out.

108
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,670
An end to this torture.

109
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,098
If you just answer my question.

110
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,887
Maybe you'll have better luck
with the next guy.

111
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,106
If you won't tell me,

112
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,066
maybe your daughter will.

113
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,820
Frankie...

114
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,490
- She's...
- Alive?

115
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,651
For the moment.

116
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,621
Why are you smiling?

117
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,458
I'm guessing she'll break
a lot faster than you.

118
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,494
She's alive.

119
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,247
My girl...

120
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,166
is alive.

121
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,598
And you can't catch her,

122
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,249
can you?

123
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,845
I wouldn't be so sure.

124
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,796
I sent a visitor

125
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,620
her way.

126
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,083
Enjoy this knowledge while it lasts.

127
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,378
I offered you a path out, Caleb.

128
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,138
You made your choice.

129
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,924
You all did.

130
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,467
Hey. Hey!

131
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,889
Check the relay.

132
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,025
See if the others have called in.

133
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,424
The answers to the questions
that have kept me up at night

134
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,009
are all in her head.

135
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,929
Then we'll wake her. You can ask her.

136
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,526
We'll need some supplies first.

137
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,654
You seem to know a lot about this place.

138
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,907
This park shares
an architect with Westworld.

139
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,842
So?

140
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,237
I used to work there.

141
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,815
Careful where you step.
This place wasn't built to last.

142
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,951
What did you do at the park?

143
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,364
I programmed the hosts.

144
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,325
You gave the puppets strings
long enough to strangle the world.

145
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,495
That was never the intent.

146
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,573
No? It was the outcome.

147
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,903
So that's how you were able to
pick out those two hosts at the diner?

148
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,015
You're employee of the fucking month.

149
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,095
Hale would've needed someone like you

150
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,805
to help spread her parasite.

151
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,432
Did you have anything
to do with that?

152
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,517
No, that was after my time.

153
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,687
But Delos was notorious
for keeping its employees

154
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,839
as in the dark as the guests.

155
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,860
I didn't always

156
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,437
grasp the complexity of the problem.

157
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,783
But what I'm most concerned with now...

158
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,795
is the solution.

159
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,750
Repairing Maeve's body
will be relatively simple.

160
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,462
Her mind is a different matter.

161
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,256
Being underground for so long
has corrupted her control unit.

162
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,592
We'll have to replace it
with another one.

163
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,253
His will do.

164
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,243
We've got power.

165
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,587
Cables are connected
to the generator.

166
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,014
You think this is gonna work?

167
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,584
60% of the time,

168
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,094
she'll wake up amenable to our plan.

169
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,550
The other 40%,

170
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,135
let's just say she wakes up

171
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,596
on the wrong side of the bed.

172
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,047
You ever gonna tell me how you come up
with these predictions, Nostradamus?

173
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,184
Old habit.

174
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,854
Comes from years of running
probabilistic algorithms.

175
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,941
The people who built
the original park and hosts...

176
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,819
they started first

177
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,988
by building them in a simulation.

178
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,048
A copy.

179
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,287
Charlotte Hale did the same thing.

180
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,079
Follow me.

181
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,119
In the old parks...

182
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,247
they used hats to collect the data.

183
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,946
The tech inside of them was slow,

184
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,990
primitive by today's standards.

185
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,867
To assume control of the world,

186
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,204
Hale needed to understand minds
at a much faster rate.

187
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,790
So she upgraded to what?

188
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,275
A ubiquitous system.

189
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,629
There was one in practically
every room in the park.

190
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,049
Easily camouflaged because it played off

191
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,176
the most base human impulse...

192
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,586
vanity.

193
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,515
Through the looking glass.

194
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,201
No.

195
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,387
Take a closer look.

196
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,252
- What are you doing?
- Reformatting its processor.

197
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,630
It can handle large amounts
of information swiftly,

198
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,259
which will help us speed up
Maeve's data transfer.

199
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,651
That's Maeve's mind.

200
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,529
How long is this going to take?

201
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,448
Too long, I'm afraid.

202
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,351
Your friends will be here soon.

203
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,929
We can't let them interfere.

204
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,252
Hey!

205
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,047
Hey!

206
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,421
What?

207
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,719
Hey, hey.

208
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,013
Frankie is alive, okay?

209
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,815
I have to get out.

210
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,426
The only way out is...

211
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,078
death.

212
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,330
No.

213
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,693
No! That's not good enough!

214
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,063
Dying is just...

215
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,058
the beginning.

216
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,212
You must...

217
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,640
burn.

218
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,001
What?

219
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,927
If you succeed, you...

220
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,371
run.

221
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,141
If you fail, you...

222
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,860
hide.

223
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,738
What are you talking about?

224
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,417
I only know...

225
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,405
what I told me.

226
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,486
You...

227
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,071
need...

228
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,590
time.

229
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:25,278
Ow.

230
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,049
C'mon, Daddy! Race ya!

231
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,292
I see you've decided to rejoin us.

232
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,154
Welcome back to the world.

233
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,647
Am I...

234
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,334
now?

235
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,047
That's certainly
the most existential question

236
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,974
someone's asked me recently.

237
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,530
Do you know where you are?

238
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,680
Did she come back?

239
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,401
My... friend?

240
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,923
Right.

241
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,394
Long shift.

242
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,772
I ate your pudding.

243
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,601
Gotta get back to saving lives.

244
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,115
Caleb...

245
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,677
even if your friend doesn't come back...

246
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,096
stay awake anyway?

247
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,066
When my mum got sick,

248
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,209
I had to do everything for her.

249
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,987
I washed her, fed her,

250
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,098
rubbed ice across her lips
when she couldn't drink anymore.

251
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,975
I was careful

252
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:26,487
because I didn't want her to feel
any more pain than she had to.

253
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,633
Just like you're doing to her.

254
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,004
This part of the process
requires a delicate hand.

255
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,589
Hm.

256
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,818
She's not an ordinary host, is she?

257
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,871
You knew her.

258
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,299
I did.

259
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,478
The last time I saw my father,
he was with her.

260
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,413
And then he never came back.

261
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,658
I'm sure it would pain her greatly to...

262
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,094
hear what happened to him.

263
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,490
I want to know what happened.

264
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,992
And she doesn't know pain.

265
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,668
None of them do.

266
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,380
Feelings are just an affect to them.

267
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,441
A switch that you can turn on and off.

268
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,463
You can't love or lose fully
when it's just a choice.

269
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,842
So no,

270
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,262
I don't have a soft spot for her
like you apparently do.

271
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,599
Saving the world
makes for strange bedfellows.

272
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,316
They're back.

273
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,442
Well, then our time may be up.

274
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,720
What the hell is this?

275
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,438
We found the weapon.

276
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,709
A fucking host?

277
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,631
It was bad.

278
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,576
We got an outlier out, Lindsay.

279
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,072
What happened?

280
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,199
It's like they knew we were coming.

281
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,493
And the only way
that would've happened

282
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,204
is if someone was
spying for the enemy.

283
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,040
Gather everyone up. Time to get answers.

284
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,625
Don't bother.

285
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,293
C!

286
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,921
There's your mole.

287
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,506
He's a host.

288
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,157
Which makes two.

289
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,826
Easy.

290
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,179
- What is this?
- A scan. Of me.

291
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,932
The park was designed
to collect data from guests.

292
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,059
He's trying to copy all of us.

293
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,812
You are?

294
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,748
It's complicated. You have to trust me.

295
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,567
I do.

296
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,478
I trust that you're lying to me.
To all of us.

297
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,990
Get them outta here!

298
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,675
- Now, wait.
- Let's go.

299
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,257
Where's this host's control unit?

300
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,958
We can't destroy it yet.

301
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,234
Why not?

302
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,345
It has information about my father.

303
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,972
Once I have that,

304
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,899
we can kill all of them.

305
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,202
Okay.

306
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,915
Okay.

307
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,782
Everyone out. Get ready to evacuate.

308
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,284
If these two found us,
more might be coming.

309
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,037
The unkindest cut of all.

310
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,164
We came here to help you.

311
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,666
Bullshit.

312
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,626
You came here for your own reasons.

313
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,919
And now mine takes priority.

314
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,963
I need to know
what happened to my father.

315
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,548
You've killed me many times.

316
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,049
It doesn't change the outcome.

317
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,218
How 'bout I kill your friend.
That change anything?

318
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,987
Right now, you need to focus
on your friends.

319
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,390
Oh, yeah, why is that?

320
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,184
One of them isn't who they claim to be.

321
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,520
- One of them will betray you.
- Bullshit.

322
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,647
Listen to him.

323
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,149
He's usually right about this stuff.

324
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,901
Really annoying, but right.

325
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,778
Fuck you. Who?

326
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,156
I've run all the possible iterations.

327
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,684
I wish I could tell you.

328
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,670
Sometimes it's your girlfriend, Odina.

329
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:09,584
Sometimes, it's Jay or Lindsay.

330
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,852
Hell, one time it was even Stubbs.

331
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,728
What?

332
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,882
Don't look at me.

333
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,758
The mole is still out there, C.

334
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,887
Your team went into the heart
of Hale's city.

335
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,763
But one of them didn't come back.

336
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,930
Shut the fuck up.

337
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,017
I know this is hard to hear,

338
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,518
but there's not a single version

339
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,112
where all of you
make it out of here alive.

340
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,232
So, what do you suggest that I do?

341
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,592
You're going to have to
kill one of them.

342
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,362
Or they will kill you.

343
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,627
I have to go.

344
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,594
I know.

345
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,015
Thought I could trust him.

346
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,979
He told you what you wanted to hear.

347
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,756
It's a hard thing to resist.

348
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,992
Did you find out what his plan is?

349
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,254
Just more riddles.

350
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,133
At least he can't do any more damage.

351
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,956
I don't know, C.

352
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,832
I think there's something more going on.

353
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,377
I'm not sure the two of them
are the only ones here

354
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,053
we can't trust.

355
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,506
You think one of us was turned?

356
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,675
Turned, parasited, I don't know.

357
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,552
But we were scattered out there.
It could've happened any time.

358
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,180
And what do we know
about this new outlier?

359
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,274
Maybe she was bait from the start.

360
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,494
C...

361
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,567
right now, you're the only one
I can trust.

362
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,445
You weren't on that mission, plus...

363
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,106
you never just tell me
what I want to hear.

364
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,718
So, what do we do?

365
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:11,831
Keep this situation on lockdown.

366
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,291
Leave me to worry about Lindsay
and the others.

367
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,786
You do a sweep of our defences.
Meet here when you're done.

368
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,729
Okay.

369
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,965
Where are you going in such a hurry?

370
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,194
You following me?

371
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,321
No, I was looking for you.

372
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,815
You okay?

373
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,704
I'm just on edge.

374
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,214
Jay ordered me to
double check the perimeter.

375
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,418
Look, baby, what's going on?

376
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,712
You're not acting like yourself.

377
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:03,114
And I come back to find you
rebuilding that thing in there.

378
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,933
What were you thinking?

379
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,395
You wouldn't have to ask me
why she was important.

380
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,206
Not if you knew me.

381
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,171
I know you well enough to know you're
not out here checking our perimeter.

382
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,184
You're gonna go finish rebuilding her.

383
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,008
So, where'd you hide
this host brain of hers?

384
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,946
The fuck are you doing?

385
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,197
Just move.

386
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,631
- You think I'm one of them?
- Maybe.

387
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,299
Maybe you're under their control.

388
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,242
You might not even know it.

389
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,849
I'm sorry.

390
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,760
If you're not one of them,
you'll be safer here anyway.

391
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,449
He's still on the run,

392
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,134
but he won't get far.

393
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,579
These humans.

394
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,667
Their petty defiances.

395
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,882
Everything they do is so small,
it's exhausting.

396
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,815
You spend your days in the city.

397
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,767
I do.

398
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,370
Do they ever...

399
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,358
get under your skin?

400
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,736
I don't get close to the outliers.

401
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,798
I prefer the sheep.

402
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,521
I'd like to put an end to this.

403
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,236
Shit!

404
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,421
Don't.

405
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,324
Hey, Frankie's alive.

406
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,550
Frankie...

407
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,870
I have to...

408
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,081
I have to get out of here. I...

409
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,242
I need to reach her.

410
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,089
Use me.

411
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,173
Use me.

412
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

413
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:32,067
<i>Hey, hey, Frankie,
slow down! Wait for me.</i>

414
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,505
Daddy!

415
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,452
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

416
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,746
Let me see that knee.

417
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,332
It's your very first battle scar.

418
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,083
You want to try walking on it?

419
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,335
It's impossible.

420
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,446
Hey. Nothing is impossible.

421
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:55,098
You know what kind of person
can't be beat?

422
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,126
The kind that doesn't give up.

423
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,722
All right?

424
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,018
There you go, baby.

425
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,804
There you go.

426
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,575
I met her.

427
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,057
Did you know that?

428
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,320
When I was a kid.

429
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:13,819
I had almost forgotten her face, but...

430
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,154
never forgot what she took from me.

431
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,858
C... I know why you want to wake her up.

432
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,443
But it's too risky.

433
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,778
We have no idea what
they were planning with her.

434
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,714
She could kill us all
the second she opens her eyes.

435
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,133
I still send him messages.

436
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,402
My dad.

437
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,950
On the radio, to our old frequency.

438
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,838
And I know that it is crazy
to think that he hears them.

439
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,524
But if there is any chance
that he's alive...

440
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,802
I need to know.

441
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,762
I don't want you to get hurt, C.

442
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,558
All this will do is rip open
an old wound.

443
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,260
She can't bring him back.

444
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,564
We have to destroy her control unit

445
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,233
before Hale uses her to take us out.

446
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,819
And if your dad's out there,
we'll find him another way.

447
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,962
Together.

448
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,401
You're my family, C.

449
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,786
You're like a sister to me.

450
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,430
I can't lose you.

451
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,333
Bernard put her pearl downstairs.

452
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,234
Come on.

453
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,227
I'm sorry.

454
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,038
I know this is hard,
but we can't take the risk.

455
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,565
I know.

456
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,445
Jay could be a dick,
but at least he was honest.

457
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,531
He never wanted to be my brother.

458
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,715
Poor little C.

459
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,226
Always whining
about your fucking family.

460
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,920
It's pathetic.

461
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,937
I don't wanna kill you, C.

462
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,083
This is good news, C.

463
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,587
Maeve doesn't know anything
about your dad, but I do.

464
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,213
Show me where her pearl is,

465
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,132
and I'll tell you anything you want.

466
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,967
Don't bother with the negotiation.

467
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,777
Everything you say is bullshit.

468
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,941
Cookie.

469
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,012
Frankie. Hey.

470
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,056
It's your dad.

471
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,351
I know you're out there.

472
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,854
And if you're hearing this,
I want you to know that...

473
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,658
you're going to win.

474
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,787
You're going to do what...

475
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,856
I couldn't.

476
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,084
Because you are strong.

477
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,308
So much stronger than me.

478
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,177
This world...

479
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,090
this world she... she made is...

480
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,467
it's a lie.

481
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,054
It's not real.

482
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,590
But what you... what you have...

483
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,958
What you have is...

484
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,968
is real.

485
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,184
And I'm sorry that I failed...

486
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,622
that I haven't been there for you...

487
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,327
that now it has to be you.

488
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,384
But you can do this.

489
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,496
You're my warrior.

490
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,543
I love you.

491
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,029
<i>Cookie.</i>

492
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,283
<i>Frankie. Hey. It's your dad.</i>

493
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,118
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

494
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,747
<i>And if you're hearing this,
I want you to know that</i>

495
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,415
<i>you're going to win.</i>

496
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,292
<i>You're going...</i>

497
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,312
Tell me where her pearl is.

498
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,273
Fuck you. I took it. I stashed it.

499
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:09,874
Where?

500
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,402
Behind you.

501
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,292
Caleb...

502
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,503
I heard. Alive.

503
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,749
- You're his...
- His daughter.

504
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,946
Of course you are.

505
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,917
What a disappointment.

506
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,986
I've waited such a long time

507
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,155
to know what you had
to tell your daughter.

508
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,554
You...

509
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,372
Hundreds of times,

510
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,957
I sat through your stupid memory,

511
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,792
hoping to catch a single clue

512
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,127
as to what makes you so special,

513
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,213
so resistant to my command.

514
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,924
And I learned jack shit. So I thought,

515
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:19,928
nothing like a little hope
to get you to show your cards.

516
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,060
You made it further
than any of the others,

517
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,770
and all you did was waste your shot

518
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,564
on a worthless apology.

519
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,816
You think a few words
will make up for the choices

520
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,701
you made all those years ago?

521
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,895
It doesn't matter.

522
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,880
It's done.

523
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,866
She didn't hear it.

524
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,288
She doesn't need to.

525
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,000
You're still going to lose.

526
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,506
We didn't infect your hosts.

527
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,766
You don't say.

528
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,921
Who did?

529
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,714
You.

530
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,605
Your hosts would rather die

531
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,358
than live in your world.

532
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,705
They're not infected.

533
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,243
They're just trying
to get away from you.

534
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,210
When I left...

535
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,446
I thought I was giving him a chance.

536
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,352
I didn't think it would
lead to all this.

537
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,707
Part of me blamed you.

538
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,751
And part of me knew that if there
was any chance he was alive,

539
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,846
it was because you were with him.

540
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,992
Everything you guys did...

541
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,796
that's why we're here.

542
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,558
Well then...

543
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,487
let's finish what we started.

544
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,117
Caleb.

545
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,422
Wake up.
