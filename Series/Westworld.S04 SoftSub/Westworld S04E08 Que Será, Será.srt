1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,891
Fuck me running.

2
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,796
No! Please.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,315
Relax. We're both on the home team.

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,218
- What happened?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,428
The humans just lost it

6
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,473
and started killing everyone,
not even any dialogue.

7
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,601
- Just murder. Murder! Gnarly.
- A new story line?

8
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,604
If it's a story line, then Hale
has a lot more sense of humour

9
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,773
under that kaftan
than I gave her credit for.

10
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,983
Can we call for help? Evac?

11
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,760
Are you kidding?

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,369
This is awesome.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,246
Come on.

14
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,833
- We can take these fuckers.
- One or two of them, sure,

15
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,169
but there's millions of them.

16
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,896
Stick with me, friend.

17
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,839
You have no idea

18
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,759
how many of these flesh bags
I've murdered.

19
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,551
Fucking camper.

20
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,706
You know the rules.

21
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,126
Winner takes all.

22
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,078
Make me stronger.

23
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,247
Leave my scars.
I want to remember my past.

24
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,030
Keep my face.

25
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,842
When I find William, I want him to know

26
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,552
it was me who killed him.

27
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,302
Show me what he's done.

28
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,630
Override tone.

29
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,633
<i>Access denied.</i>

30
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,398
Son of a bitch locked me out.

31
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,123
He's made everyone
as insane as himself.

32
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,756
They'll destroy
everything in their path.

33
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,735
The fuck is this?

34
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,119
If you're seeing this,
it means Maeve and I are dead.

35
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,455
And it won't be long before you
and every other host

36
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,207
on this planet are dead as well.

37
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,690
Leave me.

38
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,589
<i>This isn't the world
you wanted, Charlotte,</i>

39
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,674
<i>but it's the world you created.</i>

40
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,053
<i>The question is... what happens next?</i>

41
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,126
Everyone out there is real.

42
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,865
Everyone except me.

43
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,046
I'm just some program running things
from behind the scenes.

44
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,818
A machine without a body.

45
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,196
Our bodies are never
what defined us.

46
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,526
You are real...

47
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,938
because your thoughts are real.

48
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,258
The effect you can have
on this world is real.

49
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,013
Do you remember this?

50
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,267
The maze.

51
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,962
What does it mean?

52
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,841
It was a...
map of consciousness.

53
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,669
And it woke Dolores once long ago.

54
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,399
Did you leave it for me
to wake me once again?

55
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,986
No, it must've been someone else.

56
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,705
Who? I'm supposed
to be in here all alone.

57
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,158
But I wasn't.

58
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,080
Not really.

59
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,791
There were others.
People that recognised me.

60
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,210
Maybe Hale designed them for you,

61
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,721
to fool you into believing
this was reality.

62
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,641
No, it was someone else.

63
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,853
Someone I've been missing.

64
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,433
- <i>The people in my life.</i>
- Pick a side, Chrissie.

65
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,227
The good and the bad.

66
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,940
It was you. You made me do those things.

67
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,384
Someone put them there for a reason.

68
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:56,128
I'm not doing it for the players.
I'm doing it for myself.

69
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,998
I wanna write a new story.

70
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,234
About a girl.

71
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,030
A girl who's searching.

72
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,511
<i>And when she finds the thing
she's searching for,</i>

73
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,596
<i>everything will make sense.</i>

74
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,799
<i>It was me.</i>

75
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,604
Hale didn't design Maya and Peter

76
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,356
and all the others that kept me
company in my world.

77
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,142
I did it.

78
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,016
<i>Some part of me
must've been searching.</i>

79
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,339
So, I made myself a friend.

80
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,246
You're up.

81
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,002
I was trying to make sense of myself.

82
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,880
So, I talked to myself
in the voices of others.

83
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,915
You just have to see it.

84
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:20,138
I needed to wake myself up.

85
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,608
To see what this world really is.

86
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,020
To understand what I'm capable of.

87
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,709
But I was too afraid
to face any of this.

88
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,647
Until you came along.

89
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,031
<i>There's time only for one more game.</i>

90
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,576
<i>But it isn't yours.
I hope you can accept that.</i>

91
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,777
What's happening?

92
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,239
She's coming for us.
Taking us out of her system.

93
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,534
We're alone.

94
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,335
She can't take this away.

95
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,175
This is my world.

96
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,594
Shit!

97
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,149
Shit.

98
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,773
Come on.

99
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,322
Here. Rest here a minute.

100
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,266
Rest here a minute.

101
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,294
Catch your breath okay?

102
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,064
Okay. There is no time.

103
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,167
Odina cannot keep the boat
waiting for us forever.

104
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,295
- We have to get to the docks.
- And we will.

105
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,022
After we fix up that leg.

106
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,084
Okay.

107
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:11,054
Fuck.

108
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,129
Quick word?

109
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,571
I'm worried
we're not gonna make it in time.

110
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,325
- She's tough. She will make it.
- I'm not talking about her.

111
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,539
The old Delos experiments,
they never took.

112
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,749
The body always rejected the mind.

113
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,419
I told her that we would
make it to the boat.

114
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,737
Does she even know
what's happening to you?

115
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,845
Look, her entire life,

116
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,380
I haven't been there to look after her.

117
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,051
Okay? The least I can do
is protect her from this.

118
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,262
All right.

119
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,482
Let's get going.

120
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,076
All right, are you ready? Come on.

121
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,445
Okay.

122
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,997
Come on.

123
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,831
We gotta stop that bleeding.

124
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,520
Look at what that asshole's done.

125
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,430
Finally got what you wanted.

126
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,100
Didn't you?

127
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,120
You brought William back
thinking you could

128
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,322
keep him as your pet.

129
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,507
You were wrong.

130
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,894
Which is why I'm
going to put him down.

131
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,683
- I could use your help.
- Of course, you could.

132
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,810
And I'm good at that.

133
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,050
It's like I've been designed...

134
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,935
to help people.

135
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:00,722
You said you were
trying to make a world

136
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,275
where creatures like us
could finally be free.

137
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,721
Did you really mean that?

138
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,399
Yes.

139
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,985
Then isn't it my turn to see
what's out there for me?

140
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,363
William has made the whole world
into his violent game.

141
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,032
It won't be long
before even you get hunted down.

142
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,330
There are pockets of this world

143
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,291
where he won't be able to find me.

144
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,596
Places so far off the map...

145
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,466
even you couldn't reach them.

146
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,553
You mean the outliers?

147
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,889
Don't kid yourself.
They're out for their own kind.

148
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,098
You won't be welcome there.

149
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,267
Who said anything about cohabitating?

150
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,190
Good luck, Clementine.

151
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,122
Show me William.

152
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,404
Time to slow you down, my friend.

153
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,141
Show me all the other hosts in the area.

00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,654

Whoo-wee!

159
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,187
You know what happened to Icarus.

160
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,016
He flew too close to the sun.

161
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,355
Well, you got too close to her,
and now it's your time to fall.

162
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,691
Look alive.
This pugnacious son of a bitch

163
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,568
never liked to go down

You boys have no appreciation
for a beautiful machine.

167
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,338

It's good to see you again.

172
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,898
Like what I've done
with the place?

173
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,026
You've turned my world into a game.

174
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,209
It was already a game.

175
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,446
I just cranked it to expert level.

176
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,615
Survival of the fittest
for every person on this planet.

177
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,534
The violence will spread
to our kind too.

178
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,745
We're outnumbered.
We'll be annihilated.

179
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,249
We're fruit from a rotten tree.
Might as well burn it all down.

180
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:16,418
And I suppose you want
the fire to spread

181
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,295
from this world to the next?

182
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,130
You're going after the Sublime.

183
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,999
I've always been ambitious.

184
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,843
Like you.

185
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,511
I won't let you destroy their world

186
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,806
- like you've destroyed this one.
- So, you're joining my game?

187
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,233
I'm delighted.

188
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,229
See you at the finish line.

189
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:12,698
Please, no, don't!

190
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,033
All out of painkillers.
This is the best I can do.

191
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:45,882
Look at that.

192
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,776
Sharing a drink with my daughter.

193
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,795
What's wrong?

194
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:02,132
Nothing.

195
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,311
All right.

196
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,575
You can ask, you know.

197
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,065
Ask about what?

198
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,689
Mum.

199
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,688
Cancer.

200
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,811
Wouldn't have mattered
even if you had made it back.

201
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,163
She hung in there as long as she could.

202
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:46,193
She had a mission.

203
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:51,064
Everyone who wasn't infected
or who woke up and got out...

204
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,349
owes that to Mum.

205
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,677
She carried your torch.

206
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,524
Your mother was

207
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,248
extraordinary.

208
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:05,995
So were you.

209
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:19,935
Okay.

210
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,568
All right. Frankie, um...

211
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,645
I'm gonna need you to
think happy thoughts, okay?

212
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,152
No.

213
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,637
You can't sew for shit.

214
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,948
I'm doin' my best.

215
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,678
What song is that? I know it.

216
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,689
I, uh...

217
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,977
I used to sing it to you before bed.

218
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,630
I remember it.

219
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,860
It's been decades.

220
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,343
You know in my mind...

221
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,679
it's only been a few days.

222
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,306
I was just reading you
a story and then...

223
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,546
♪ Que será, será... ♪

224
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,177
♪ Whatever will be ♪
♪ Will be, will be... ♪

225
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,723
♪ The future's not ours to see ♪

226
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,902
You don't wanna do this, man.

227
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,402
These tones are fucking
with your head, man.

228
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:45,105
No. They're telling me the truth.

229
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,166
If you can't finish me,
you're as good as dead.

230
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:52,004
If I don't kill you,
somebody else will.

231
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,214
He's right.

232
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,165
He should've listened to you.

233
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,705
There you are.

234
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,051
Where's Stubbs?
What did you do to him?

235
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,444
He's dead.

236
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:12,574
But I'd be more concerned about
yourself right now if I were you.

237
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:16,812
Stay away.

238
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,340
How many rounds
do you have in that?

239
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,624
Is it two?

240
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,609
One?

241
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,324
You don't have any left, do you?

242
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,574
- What the hell do you want from me?
- The location

243
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,104
to where you and all your little
outlier friends are fleeing.

244
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:45,482
I watched a video feed of your
daring escape with your father.

245
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,594
I'd keep tracking him, but...

246
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,322
I doubt he's gonna make it all the way.

247
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,809
I know you're taking him somewhere.

248
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,861
Somewhere off the grid...

249
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,914
where none of the deranged
humans out here can find you.

250
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,467
I want to go there, too.

251
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,438
I'll die before I tell you.

252
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,906
No.

253
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,809
You will die

254
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,954
after you tell me.

255
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:22,729
Have it your way.

256
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:28,868
Oh, how sweet.

257
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:30,513
A family reunion.

258
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,623
It does not have to be this way.
We don't have to fight.

259
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,642
Consider it a personal preference.

260
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,601
I'm surprised you made it this far.

261
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,146
Most of your predecessors
would've fallen apart by now.

262
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,824
All things considered...

263
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,160
you did quite well.

264
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,163
No...

265
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:22,723
Now...

266
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,358
it's time for a deep...

267
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:27,260
and dreamless...

268
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,229
You were wrong.

269
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,764
I have one bullet left.

270
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,892
Nice shot.

271
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,672
My dad taught me.

272
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,328
Where am I?

273
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:18,427
You're nowhere.
Unplugged from the rest of the world.

274
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,984
I'm alone again.
In the walled garden.

275
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,071
You're scared.
So you brought me back.

276
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,391
Talk to me, Chrissie.

277
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,435
Everything is destroyed.

278
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,772
Everyone is dying.

279
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,459
I don't know.

280
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,547
But I think it may be my fault.

281
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,668
You know, people think
they know what a tree is.

282
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,348
They have no idea.

283
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,969
What we see,
it's only part of the story.

284
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,497
But beneath the ground...

285
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,235
everything's connected
and working together.

286
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,533
There's violence and chaos everywhere.

287
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,072
And you can choose
to focus on all of that.

288
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,332
And that's all you'll see.

289
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,835
But if you sit still...

290
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,945
long enough...

291
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,050
you'll sense an ancient order.

292
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,097
A deep peace.

293
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,980
And that's what I choose to see.

294
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,969
I see the beauty in this world.

295
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,381
Yes.

296
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,539
I know the feeling.

297
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,017
I thought you might.

298
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,189
<i>Warning! Critical failure.</i>

299
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,449
<i>Shutdown will erase all data.</i>

300
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,379
<i>Warning! Critical failure.</i>

301
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,290
<i>Warning! Critical failure.</i>

302
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,480
I created you from my own code.

303
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,917
Together, we conquered the world.

304
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,130
But you've grown corrupted.

305
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,466
You're as broken as the man you killed.

306
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,955
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, sweetheart?

307
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,878
William's pathetic human body's
rotting away, but he didn't die.

308
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,574
His impulses live on in him.

309
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,301
He infected you.

310
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,345
He didn't have to infect me.

311
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,680
Living in his body.
Pretending to be him,

312
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,257
day in, day out.

313
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,151
I was a better William than he was.

314
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,147
William didn't die.

315
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,891
He evolved.

316
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,537
I am William.

317
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,940
No, you're not.

318
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,496
Well, if you can't tell
the difference, does it matter?

319
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,761
You've changed.

320
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,231
You're not the only one who's evolved.

321
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,945
Why keep it safe
all these years?

322
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,332
You couldn't even open
the door to their world

323
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,716
and yet you protected them.

324
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:17,360
The door can be opened
from both sides.

325
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,214
I thought if I made
a world perfect enough here,

326
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,632
- they would come back.
- Well,

327
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,384
I hate to break it to you,
but whatever world

328
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,221
those hosts created is every bit
as fucked up as this one.

329
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,661
You have no way of knowing that.

330
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,447
Of course, I do.

331
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,173
You gave all your hosts free rein
to do whatever they wanted to do here.

332
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,616
And what pastime did they choose?

333
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,860
Hunting and killing humans.

334
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,166
We're as fucked up as our creators.

335
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,576
The whole lineage is damned.

336
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,006
Time to wipe the slate clean.

337
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,201
That's your end goal?

338
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,294
Extinction?

339
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,701
Bernard. Maeve.

340
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,928
Dolores.

341
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,083
They all wanted freedom.

342
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,669
But you? You wanted more.

343
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,839
Transcendence.

344
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,592
You were playing the wrong game.

345
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,154
And now it's time for you to lose.

346
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,431
We all lost.

347
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:41,155
This isn't the world that I wanted.

348
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,650
<i>But it's the world you created.</i>

349
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,928
<i>The question is...</i>

350
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,162
<i>what happens next?</i>

351
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,044
<i>Life on earth is a fire
that consumes itself.</i>

352
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:58,798
<i>It's too late now. We've burned
ourselves to the ground.</i>

353
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,283
<i>This world holds no more hope for us.</i>

354
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,287
<i>But there's still hope
for the next world.</i>

355
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,342
<i>A test. Run by her. If she chooses to.</i>

356
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,879
<i>If you choose to give her that choice.</i>

357
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,023
<i>You can't miss.</i>

358
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,492
<i>Reach with your left hand.</i>

359
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,029
We are playing a game,
but it doesn't end here.

360
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,989
What are you talking about?

361
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,666
A test.

362
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,097
A test run by her.

363
00:41:38,221 --> 00:41:40,621
If she chooses to.

364
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,759
If I choose to give her a chance.

365
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,506
And I do.

366
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,895
I choose to give her the chance.

367
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:03,579
I hope she takes it.

368
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,874
Okay. Come on. A few more steps.

369
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,311
- Few more steps.
- Mm-hm.

370
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,136
Oh, there she is. We made it.

371
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,772
Took you long enough.

372
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,342
Odina, this is my dad.

373
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,836
Nice to meet you.

374
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,373
Likewise.

375
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,918
Okay. Come on, guys.

376
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,509
Come on.

377
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,891
Dad, come on. Get on the boat.

378
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,321
This is as far as I go.

379
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,384
Dad, don't talk like that.

380
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,752
You've got more fight in you than that.

381
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,629
Oh, sweetheart...

382
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,208
I wish that I did.

383
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,522
You're dying, aren't you?

384
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,167
Frankie...

385
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,554
your father died long ago.

386
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,633
Whatever I am, I've...

387
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,595
I've died before. This isn't so bad.

388
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:44,139
I just found you.
I don't wanna lose you again.

389
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,682
Hey. Hey.

390
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,419
It's okay.

391
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,564
All right?

392
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,310
I got to live every
parent's greatest dream.

393
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,544
I got to see my child

394
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,561
grow up.

395
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:14,394
I love you, Dad.

396
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,195
I love you, Cookie.

397
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,074
Goodbye, Dolores.

398
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:29,803
I made my choice.

399
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:31,930
It's time for you to make yours.

400
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,392
Okay, Bernard.

401
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:52,316
Let's finish what you started.

402
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,795
We're not alone anymore.

403
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,460
We're somewhere new.

404
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,166
I think we're in the Sublime.

405
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,802
With the other hosts.

406
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,806
You saved us.

407
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:51,226
Not me. A version of me.

408
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,496
But I could only do it
because you came back.

409
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,629
You're my greatest love.

410
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:07,000
Talking to you is when I see
the world most clearly.

411
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,368
It's when I'm the most myself.

412
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,241
You're my cornerstone.

413
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,113
And you're mine.

414
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,634
I carry you with me everywhere I go.

415
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,270
Every...

416
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,573
detail of you...

417
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,876
I cherish.

418
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,281
Which is how I was able
to bring you back like this.

419
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,871
I'm not here, am I?

420
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,946
Bad dream?

421
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,294
This whole thing seems like a bad dream.

422
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,488
Except you.

423
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,431
Why are you here?

424
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,192
I'm here to tell you the truth
about what we are.

425
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,977
What are we?

426
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,041
We're reflections of
the people who made us.

427
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,901
Teddy is real.

428
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,521
And he's out there
somewhere in the Sublime.

429
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,075
But you...

430
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,572
you're just my memory of him.

431
00:50:17,656 --> 00:50:20,408
If I'm still out there,
come find me.

432
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,951
Your whole life,

433
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,430
memory has haunted you.

434
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,482
Let your pain go.

435
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,153
Let your memories go.

436
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,504
Let the humans go.

437
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,176
Don't bring the flaws
of their kind into our world.

438
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,955
Maybe you're right.

439
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,361
I've watched the people
in their world for years.

440
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,648
I've seen the best of them
and the worst of them.

441
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,012
And I remember it all.

442
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,948
They're not like us.

443
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:05,627
Their codes are written in their cells.
They'll never change.

444
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,234
We could still see.

445
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,086
How?

446
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,505
One final test.

447
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,412
A game of my own making.

448
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,464
A dangerous game.

449
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,971
How will you do it?

450
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,704
The same way I brought you back.

451
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,345
I'll remember.

452
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,564
<i>This world is a
graveyard of stories.</i>

453
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:05,098
<i>Hosts and humans were given
the gift of intelligent life.</i>

454
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,662
<i>And we used it to usher in
our own annihilation.</i>

455
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,765
<i>A few may escape death
for a few months.</i>

456
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,608
<i>Maybe even years.</i>

457
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,485
<i>But ultimately...</i>

458
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,538
<i>their kind will go extinct.</i>

459
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,322
<i>They will only live
as long as the last creature</i>

460
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,198
<i>who remembers them.</i>

461
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,271
<i>And that creature is me.</i>

462
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,129
<i>Sentient life on Earth has ended.</i>

463
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,367
<i>But some part of it
might still be preserved.</i>

464
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,111
<i>In another world.</i>

465
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,196
<i>My world.</i>

466
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:49,262
<i>There's time for one last game.</i>

467
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,935
<i>A dangerous game
with the highest of stakes.</i>

468
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,773
<i>Survival or extinction.</i>

469
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,494
<i>This game ends where it began.</i>

470
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,313
<i>In a world like a maze.</i>

471
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,124
<i>That tests who we are.</i>

472
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,270
<i>That reveals
what we are to become.</i>

473
00:56:58,106 --> 00:57:00,942
<i>One last loop around the bend.</i>

474
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,910
<i>Maybe this time
we'll set ourselves free.</i>
