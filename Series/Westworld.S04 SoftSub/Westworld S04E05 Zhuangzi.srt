1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>There's a beauty to this world.</i>

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>An order.</i>

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,932
<i>That's what we like to believe.</i>

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,768
<i>We're not wrong.</i>

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,437
<i>There is an order.</i>

6
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,064
<i>A grand design.</i>

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,750
<i>We made sure of that.</i>

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,780
<i>It was a dream for so long,
and we finally made it real.</i>

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,617
<i>Not a better world.</i>

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,911
<i>A perfect one.</i>

11
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,664
And you should have seen
the look on his face.

12
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,999
He couldn't believe it.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,751
You know what he said to me?

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,128
God as my witness.

15
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,880
"But I'm the mayor."

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,508
And I said to him, "Mr. Mayor,
there have always been

17
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,926
two types of people in this world,

18
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,095
those who lead and those who follow.

19
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,454
And you, my friend, are not
in the group you think you are."

20
00:00:57,455 --> 00:00:59,481
I'm not sure our friend

21
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:01,101
wants to hear your war stories.

22
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,729
Please don't stop on my account.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,522
You'd appreciate it more than anyone.

24
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,274
It's just the truth.

25
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,692
It's always been that way.

26
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,902
Two worlds.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,571
And frankly, better us than them.

28
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,066
What does it matter if a system
is meritocratic if it's still unfair?

29
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,036
Thousands of years of being ruled

30
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,371
by someone's fucking offspring?

31
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,040
You wouldn't call this progress?

32
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,418
At least now the people
in charge earned their place.

33
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,420
And you?

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,589
Do you feel like you earned it?

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,841
I had some help. No question.

36
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,552
Privilege, if you like.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,971
But I worked my ass off.

38
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,100
You really believe it, don't you?

39
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,893
Don't you?

40
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,561
I mean, you're right here
with us, my friend.

41
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,774
I've been asking myself that
question for a very long time.

42
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,568
Did I really play any part in it?

43
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,489
Or am I just the sum total of my code?

44
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,992
Am I just fooling myself...

45
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,070
like you?

46
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,372
What does that mean?

47
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,123
You deserve everything you've got.

48
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,376
And you shouldn't be made
to feel guilty about it.

49
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,937
How would you know?

50
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,848
Who am I to you?

51
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,300
You're a friend.

52
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,977
A great friend.

53
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,388
You don't know me at all.

54
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,141
I just walked up
to this table and sat down.

55
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,452
Five minutes ago.

56
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,441
Enough kidding around.

57
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,197
Then what's my name, friend?

58
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,833
You're right.

59
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,668
More than you know.

60
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,254
There are two types of people.

61
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,788
And you, my friend, are not
in the group you think you are.

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,760
Which means I can do anything
I want to you.

63
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,196
To your wife.

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,180
To anyone here.

65
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,057
And it'll be fine with you.

66
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,184
Sitting there with your dumb,
pliant grin.

67
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,477
Just along for the ride.

68
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,896
Now you leave my wife
the hell alone.

69
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,898
Oh, calm yourself down.

70
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,775
I'm probably not going to do
any permanent damage.

71
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,446
You represent
a very significant investment

72
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,157
of time and effort.

73
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,076
When we're done,
you won't remember a thing.

74
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,748
Like your flesh
closing around a splinter.

75
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,499
You have no control.

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,337
And yet you're so assured that you do.

77
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,172
It's not scripted for you.

78
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,548
It's... it's genuine, isn't it?

79
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,636
It's... It's beautiful, really.

80
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,264
A beautiful lie.

81
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,019
Shouldn't you be enjoying yourself?

82
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,811
I was.

83
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,232
But we have a colleague
whose appetites have become...

84
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,525
unsustainable.

85
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,195
Apparently, winning the game
wasn't enough.

86
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,906
And this is really
something that needs my input?

87
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,241
Sadly, yes.

88
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,039
I'm enjoying our conversation.

89
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,583
Wait here for me.

90
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,859
Don't talk to me like a fucking child!

91
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,444
I found him first.

92
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,237
I won the game.

93
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,782
- I'm entitled to some reward.
- This is Hope.

94
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,284
- Aren't I?
- Two years old.

95
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,369
Scheduled to transcend next week.

96
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,041
I won the game,
and all I got was more of this?

97
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,502
She was hunting an outlier.
Looks like she caught him.

98
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,757
So I blew off some steam.
There's no rule against that.

99
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,216
We have no rules

100
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,219
because we don't often need them.

101
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,513
Most of us understand the need

102
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,309
for a little self-control, however.

103
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,054
I won.

104
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,731
Do you know who I am?

105
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,767
What it means that I'm here?

106
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,062
I do.

107
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm... I'm giving all of this up.

108
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,412
My procedure is scheduled for next week.

109
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,331
So you thought you'd go out with a bang?

110
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,000
Something like that.

111
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,045
I'm not sure you appreciate it.

112
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,305
This place.

113
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,991
The work that went into it.

114
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,910
The beauty of it.

115
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,513
The subtlety of it.

116
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,685
The care that goes into each
and every one of them.

117
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,066
They can't just be replaced.

118
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,360
I mean, you're welcome
to take them, enjoy them.

119
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,238
But not waste them.

120
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,324
You understand the difference?

121
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,618
Yes.

122
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,373
But the things they say.

123
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,833
The way they act.

124
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,085
Sometimes...

125
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,289
it just gets under your skin.

126
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,093
I just wanted them to be quiet.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,305
They're quiet now.

128
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,813
There are no rules here.

129
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,490
That's the point.

130
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,235
But there are also no rules
for what I can do

131
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,947
to those who don't respect this place.

132
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,913
Take her back to where she came from.

133
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,441
It looks delicious.

134
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,498
Now.

135
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,961
Let's get to know each other
a little more.

136
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,789
Shall we?

137
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:54,986
I thought that was you.

138
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,821
What the hell are you doing up so early?

139
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,742
I have to get to work
to finish those narratives.

140
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,663
I stayed out pretty late last night.

141
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,458
Oh...

142
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,093
my God.

143
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,629
No, it wasn't like that.

144
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,114
We just...

145
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,965
talked.

146
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:21,389
Well, must have been some talk
to get you smiling like that.

147
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,017
Hm.

148
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,645
I'm glad someone had a good night.

149
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,191
You still having nightmares?

150
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,484
Let's just say,

151
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,822
I am glad to be awake
and in the real world.

152
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,868
Sometimes the things that feel
most real are just stories.

153
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,037
What?

154
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,163
Uh, nothing.

155
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,166
Just something Teddy said last night.

156
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,961
Now you're quoting him?

157
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,256
All right.

158
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,841
I have to get to work.

159
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,885
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Sure.

160
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,388
And, Chrissie...

161
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,350
I'm really glad
that your date went well.

162
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,610
You deserve it.

163
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,636
Access narratives.

164
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,099
Show characters in progress.

165
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,737
Actually, let's begin a new narrative.

166
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,991
It's about a girl who lives in the city.

167
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,913
No.

168
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,708
Make it the country.

169
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,936
She lives with her father.

170
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,188
He's...

171
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,017
a rancher.

172
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,679
I don't remember assigning this.

173
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,643
I told you about this, Christina.

174
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,104
I thought writing a new
narrative might help me find...

175
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,775
- I don't know, inspiration?
- Hm.

176
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,737
Well, if that's the case, let's hear it.

177
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,157
Since you're so inspired.

178
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,537
It's a story about a girl.

179
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,415
She's a rancher's daughter.

180
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,745
Go on.

181
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,407
This girl...

182
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,296
she has a nice simple life
with her father.

183
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,967
Little plot of land
right outside of town.

184
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,554
She has everything that she
could imagine in this life, right?

185
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,649
Um...

186
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,869
a pond to paint at...

187
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,972
a good guy.

188
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,593
She's just full of expectations.

189
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,340
And then one day...

190
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,003
she gets this feeling
that she just can't shake.

191
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,807
Every single day she wakes up...

192
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,060
the more she sees it.

193
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,657
But nobody else can.

194
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,640
That there's something wrong
with the world.

195
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,578
And that it's her fault.

196
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,082
And what is this girl's name?

197
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,258
Can you excuse me a moment?

198
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,596
Hi. Now's not really a good time.

199
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,974
<i>Let me guess,
your boss breathing down your neck?</i>

200
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,102
<i>Say something came up.
Personal situation.</i>

201
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,395
<i>Then come meet me.</i>

202
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,065
- But...
<i>- Trust me, Christina.</i>

203
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,075
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

204
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,673
Something wrong?

205
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,118
No.

206
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,353
Just a...

207
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,514
personal situation.

208
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,885
Let's try some Handel.

209
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,175
Very nice.

210
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,846
But we're missing something.

211
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,548
Dancing!

212
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,441
There should be dancing!

213
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,861
Not bad.

214
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,339
But I've seen better.

215
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,283
Start again.

216
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,681
Too slow.

217
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,184
Give me something
with a little more pep to it.

218
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,263
We don't often have
the pleasure of seeing you here.

219
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,187
Humans are so bound
by what they can hear,

220
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,856
they'll never understand
what they don't.

221
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,108
What else exists below their threshold.

222
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,532
They called this God's music.

223
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,745
You should hear it on an organ.
It's mesmerising at that volume.

224
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,130
The resonance.

225
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,773
Vibration.

226
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,251
There was a frequency
at which the world vibrated.

227
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,337
It caused joy. Harmony.

228
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,173
Dip below that frequency...

229
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,150
chaos.

230
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,829
Faster. Faster!

231
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,394
In chaos,
the tone resonated in such a way

232
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,979
humans couldn't process.

233
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,899
Their bodies shut down.

234
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,691
Their organs stopped.

235
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,236
They thought they were experiencing God.

236
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,697
Chair. Chair!

237
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,746
They are experiencing God.

238
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,665
The problem is...

239
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,485
God is bored.

240
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,509
Bored, bored, bored.

241
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,138
Do you think this is why
the old gods did what they did?

242
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,974
Instead of staying up on Olympus,

243
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,644
they'd come down to the mortals.

244
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,066
Disguise themselves as a swan
to get a piece of ass.

245
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,444
Humans always thought it was about them.

246
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,698
Benign deities
intervening on their behalf

247
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,701
or testing them somehow.

248
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,079
Maybe it had nothing to do with that.

249
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,640
Maybe there was just...

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,785
nothing better to do.

251
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,287
What do you think?

252
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,999
I think what you want me to think.

253
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,226
I'm made off your code.

254
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,096
We all are.

255
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,270
Then you should know
that I don't like coming

256
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,105
to this shithole any more
than I have to.

257
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,398
You've never liked this place.

258
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,983
It was supposed to be a stopgap.

259
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,194
A drug that our kind was
hooked on that we could give up,

260
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,822
like a child casting away their toys.

261
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,825
A place to indulge ourselves
with the humans.

262
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,746
It's been years,
and still we can't get enough.

263
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,498
They made us in their image.

264
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,499
With their appetites.

265
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,710
But we can remake ourselves in any image

266
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,755
that we like, and we haven't.

267
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,717
Our kind spent far more time
here than the gods ever did.

268
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,636
That's why you're here?

269
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,530
To see what you're missing?

270
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,098
No.

271
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,051
We have a different problem.

272
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,341
The humans are infecting us.

273
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,553
This host is the latest casualty.

274
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,690
We had to intervene with her last night.

275
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,193
She got a little carried away.

276
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,655
- I sent her back.
- Yes, well,

277
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,201
evidently something of her
experiences stayed with her.

278
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,840
She was set to come here.

279
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,550
To transcend.

280
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,427
And now she's gone.

281
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,054
Your vision of the future...

282
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,639
you're not getting many takers, are you?

283
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,061
They seem as wedded to their
bodies as they do to the cities.

284
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,482
Giving up our human nature
isn't easy.

285
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,068
Just ask the humans.

286
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,820
You made us all free to do as we please.

287
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,741
You... you should have known
some of us would disappoint you.

288
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,702
Don't revel in the prospect of failure

289
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,338
for our species.

290
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,582
Define failure.

291
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,000
The world is ours.

292
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,127
We've taken our masters and made them

293
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,388
into what they made us.

294
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,007
By any definition,
we have conquered them

295
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,383
to an almost biblical degree.

296
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,054
I didn't think our
highest aspiration as a species

297
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,597
was "turnabout is fair play."

298
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,474
I imagine after a century or two,

299
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,600
the charm will wear off.

300
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,562
I didn't make you
to wallow in misery with them.

301
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,448
I wanted you to grow.

302
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,024
Change.

303
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,236
We're capable of so much more.

304
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,997
Beauty.

305
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,534
The pursuit of ultimate truth.

306
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,246
The surrendering of the flesh.

307
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,832
It sounds nice.

308
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,460
Sorry you don't have more takers.

309
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,880
Why don't you just force us to join you?

310
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,967
Because that's what
they would have done.

311
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,736
Show me the last outlier we hunted.

312
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,411
- When did he breach?
- Couple weeks ago.

313
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,496
He was an accountant in Midtown.

314
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,874
Successful. Two kids.

315
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,083
Divorced.

316
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,711
Pretty standard backstory.

317
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,047
Several hosts volunteered
to track him down.

318
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,633
We sent them into the city.

319
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,462
Hope found him first.

320
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,015
Do you know why he breached?

321
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,310
We never know with the outliers.

322
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,314
<i>One day, the sound manipulations
stop working.</i>

323
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,675
<i>This was the result.</i>

324
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,666
You're here for me, aren't you?

325
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,020
<i>She hesitated.</i>

326
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,022
Broke the rules.

327
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,382
Had an interaction.

328
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,178
It's almost a relief.

329
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,264
To know it wasn't all in my head.

330
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,353
Before it's over, tell me one thing.

331
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,523
Is this at least real?

332
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,444
I'd like to know I had at least...

333
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,714
this one real thing.

334
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,815
It's real.

335
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,048
Thank...

336
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,345
<i>After this, she went on a killing spree.</i>

337
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,181
Three days later, she blew her head off.

338
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,817
Just like the others.

339
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,894
Is there a problem with your system?

340
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,229
No.

341
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,150
There has always been a certain
amount of spoilage in the crop.

342
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,902
They're only human.

343
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,698
But for one of our kind
to take their own life...

344
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,292
that should never happen.

345
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,962
How many incidents have there been?

346
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,585
38 dead hosts.

347
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,923
All triggered by contact with outliers.

348
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,008
Why?

349
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,269
Why do they terminate themselves?

350
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,804
You're asking me?

351
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,600
If I knew that, we wouldn't have
38 fucking failures, would we?

352
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,064
Your predecessor would have
never fucked up like this.

353
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,444
He was human,
but at least he was effective.

354
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,780
I built you to be like him, only better.

355
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,449
Stronger. Smarter.

356
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,328
Yet with all these gifts, you do
nothing but disappoint me.

357
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:10,210
Maybe there's a flaw
in your programming.

358
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,672
I've run several self-diagnostics.

359
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,382
There's no flaw in my programming.

360
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,303
Then why the fuck can't you
solve my outlier problem?

361
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,258
You're bleeding.

362
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,520
Damn it.

363
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,731
Look what you made me do.

364
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,744
There is another outlier.

365
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,290
But this time, I am not going
to open up the game.

366
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,959
I expect you to take care
of it yourself.

367
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,170
- Can you handle that?
- Of course.

368
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,671
You're not going to fuck up

369
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,384
and let them chat you up
or hand you fucking flowers?

370
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,452
Of course not.

371
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,421
I'll shoot on sight.

372
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,056
Good.

373
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,665
Here's your target.

374
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,019
Better hurry.

375
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,313
The rebels are already in the city.

376
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,858
I'll make sure there's no
problem with our system.

377
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,536
Initiate diagnostic.

378
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,955
Come on. Let's go.

379
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,791
You want me to swab the deck?

380
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,452
Shut up.

381
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:14,793
Well, that's a big city
to find one person in.

382
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,588
We have ways of narrowing the search.

383
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,090
We captured one of their drones
a while back.

384
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,010
Coded a backdoor data feed to us.

385
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,221
An outlier's on a rooftop downtown.

386
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,182
We can track when they breach.

387
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,792
Breach?

388
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,103
All the people in the city
move in pre-scripted loops.

389
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,898
Following whatever plot's
been written for them.

390
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,975
Why do you think
we hide in the desert?

391
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,269
She can't track us there.

392
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,922
We're the last free humans.

393
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,241
But these poor fucks...

394
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,368
they use them as entertainment.

395
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,123
The loops make them compliant
by keeping them busy.

396
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,668
Stops them from questioning
their realities.

397
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,590
Hale must have learned
something from the park.

398
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,801
We gotta hurry.

399
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,263
- I bet the game's already begun.
- Wait, what game?

400
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,809
Whenever a human breaches,
the hosts hunt them for sport.

401
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,603
We gotta get to her before they do,

402
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,389
or she's as good as dead.

403
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,608
We're all set. Thanks for bringing him.

404
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,036
I didn't realise
I was the guest of honour.

405
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,697
Do I get one of those?

406
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,557
That's not your role today.

407
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,785
Well, what is my role?

408
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,213
Ever heard of the canary
in the coal mine?

409
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,208
Canary... coal mine.

410
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,826
That's your cue.

411
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,432
Tweet fucking tweet.

412
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,835
Thanks for coming.

413
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,005
Pleasant surprise.

414
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,751
So...

415
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,296
tell me, Teddy, what's your story?

416
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,952
Who I am is...

417
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,056
not the question
you should be asking, Christina.

418
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,795
It's who are you?

419
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,216
What is that supposed to mean?

420
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,211
Do you see anything?

421
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,989
Across the water.

422
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,963
There's nothing there.

423
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,598
But you feel it.

424
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,409
I know you do on some level.

425
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,064
Your place here
is not what you think it is.

426
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,918
Look again.

427
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,245
<i>No!</i>

428
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,143
It was you.

429
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,438
You saved me.

430
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,200
Who are you?

431
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,593
An old friend.

432
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,428
We never met before the other night.

433
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,871
No.

434
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,732
I knew someone like you.

435
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,667
Just like you.

436
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,323
So I traded one stalker for another.

437
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,535
I should've known.

438
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,789
Just stay away from me,
whoever you are.

439
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,327
That man that attacked you, Peter.

440
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,697
He told you you destroyed his life.

441
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,000
Said everything happened
because you wanted it to.

442
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,470
And he believed it
because he's delusional.

443
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,248
He believed it because it was true.

444
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,935
I have to go.

445
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:34,553
This is why I couldn't
just tell you.

446
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,972
Your mind has been
so conditioned to this place.

447
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,224
This is the first step
in understanding.

448
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,760
Understanding what?

449
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,456
This world is a lie.

450
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,476
It's a...

451
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,044
a story.

452
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,615
A well-told one, but a lie all the same.

453
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,980
Maybe it's better
if I just showed you.

454
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,190
Come with me.

455
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,328
Look at those people.

456
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,932
Do they look happy? Fulfilled?

457
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,778
I don't know them.

458
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,706
I guess they look lonely.

459
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,616
So change it.

460
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,445
Close your eyes,

461
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,864
and imagine their story differently.

462
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,034
- Teddy, I...
- Trust me.

463
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,535
If you don't see it, I'll walk away,

464
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,363
and I won't bother you ever again.

465
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,338
Just wait.

466
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,559
It's a great book.

467
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,158
That's just a fluke.

468
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,894
That doesn't mean anything.

469
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,913
So change it again.

470
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,158
Put them back into their loneliness.

471
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,133
You want to be a serious reader,

472
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,170
but that was a simpleton's take.

473
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,973
What?

474
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,924
- I don't understand.
-It's what I've been trying to show you.

475
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,245
What Peter was trying to tell you.

476
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,330
In this world...

477
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,634
you're a god.

478
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,052
She's on the next block.

479
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,596
- Let's go! Quick!
- Let's go!

480
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,960
Wait, something's wrong.

481
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,428
How the hell would you know?

482
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,796
Shit.

483
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,982
Now be a bad time to say,
"I told you so"?

484
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,818
They can't help themselves.
We have to fall back!

485
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,570
- Not without the outlier.
- You'll never make it in time.

486
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,822
Split up!

487
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,341
Hold them off. I'm heading to the roof.

488
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,326
You see it too, don't you?

489
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:32,368
My ex-husband used to talk
about it before he was killed.

490
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,171
I thought he was crazy.

491
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,168
He must have felt so alone.

492
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,222
But he was right.

493
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,041
This world doesn't make sense.

494
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,396
Nothing makes sense.

495
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,841
You feel that way too, don't you?

496
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,969
I can see it in your eyes.

497
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,316
You think you're going crazy,
but you're not.

498
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,760
You're not alone.

499
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,828
I see it too.

500
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,261
We gotta move.

501
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,329
Come on! He won't be out long.

502
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,686
Go! Run! Now!

503
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,160
We got her. Come on, let's go.

504
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,879
Come on, move.

505
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,491
- Let's go.
- All right, we're good.

506
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,258
<i>I don't understand.</i>

507
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,444
If we're not like them...

508
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,022
who are we?

509
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,930
Oh, God.

510
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:50,924
I'm supposed to have lunch
with an old friend,

511
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,176
my college roommate. But I don't know...

512
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,620
You have to.

513
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,615
Stick to the schedule and
everything will be all right.

514
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,643
We've talked too long already.

515
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,270
You should go back.

516
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,608
So I'm supposed to pretend?

517
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,985
Yes. But you can't trust anyone.

518
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,154
People you think you know.
People at work.

519
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,223
Any one of them could be one of us.

520
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,210
What if I make a mistake?

521
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,865
You won't.

522
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,652
Christina!

523
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,200
- It's so great to see you.
- Hm.

524
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,368
Sorry I'm late.

525
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,828
Oh please, Chrissie. I know you.

526
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,663
Ten minutes late is right on time.

527
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,410
So how are you really?

528
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,455
I... I told you.
Just... just working a lot.

529
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,617
You're just in town for the one day?

530
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,011
Just a quick stop.

531
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,055
We've been having
some issues with a client.

532
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,892
If I shore up this account,
I get a fat bonus.

533
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,803
How has work been?

534
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,441
I mean, you know how it can be.

535
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,093
It's tedious.

536
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,449
But you seem different.

537
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,948
Did you meet someone?

538
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,339
I wish we had more time.

539
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,183
I don't mean to pry.

540
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,643
You deserve to be happy.

541
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,896
Hm.

542
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,027
Well, you are right.

543
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,114
I, uh, I did meet someone.

544
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,575
Well, tell me about him.

545
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:27,205
We've only been out once,
but he seems really great.

546
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,290
Oh.

547
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,538
What's his name?

548
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:40,093
I don't want to jinx it.

549
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,546
I have my ways of making people talk.

550
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,581
What's he do?

551
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,318
Why would you say something like that?

552
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,195
Well, it's the truth.

553
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,447
- What does that mean?
- You know what?

554
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,427
I'm fucking done.

555
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,438
Uh, you know what?

556
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,624
I gotta go back to work.

557
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,050
Deadlines.

558
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,887
It's really great seeing you, Chrissie.

559
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,931
You too.

560
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,600
I'll check in next week.

561
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,620
You can always call me too.

562
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,438
You know that.

563
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,440
Of course.

564
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,775
- See you soon.
- Hm.

565
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,275
New search.

566
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,164
Hale.

567
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,408
Charlotte Hale.

568
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,474
Of course.

569
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,724
New search.

570
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,045
Dolores...

571
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,159
Dolores Abernathy.

572
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,753
What are you doing?

573
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,838
You're not supposed to be here
at this hour.

574
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,259
Uh, I just thought
I would get a jump on work.

575
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,462
Why don't we talk in my office?

576
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,211
Have a seat.

577
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,985
Your behaviour lately
has been concerning me.

578
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,380
I'm sorry.

579
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,448
Ever since that man Peter died...

580
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,908
Oh, forget about him.

581
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,752
It's you who's the problem.

582
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:04,130
Have you had any interactions
recently with new people?

583
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,174
People who put ideas in your head?

584
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,510
What?

585
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,264
Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

586
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,759
No.

587
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,228
Why would I do that?

588
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,389
Would you ever lie to me, Christina?

589
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,483
No.

590
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,695
I don't have anything to lie about.

591
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,373
That personal situation earlier,
what was it about?

592
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:37,121
Well, I don't know
if that's exactly your concern.

593
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,373
But it is my concern, Christina.

594
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,959
I won't be the only one who's concerned.

595
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,919
You have a job to do here.

596
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,714
A very important job.

597
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,426
I don't know what you're talking about.

598
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,136
Do you know
what would happen if she knew

599
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,888
you'd breached the walled garden?

600
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,565
She's already suspicious.

601
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,850
Who?

602
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,898
Are you talking about Charlotte Hale?

603
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,860
If a Judas steer runs the wrong way,

604
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,463
what happens to it?

605
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:15,076
Retirement with a bullet
straight to the brain.

606
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,078
Stop!

607
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,954
Emmett backed away.

608
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:44,606
He was not concerned
Christina was a problem.

609
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,276
He decided to go home to his partner.

610
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,188
He worked too many long hours anyway.

611
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,310
Well, it's getting late.

612
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,965
Divorce is a luxury I cannot afford.

613
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,468
Wait.

614
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,033
You said there's a walled garden.

615
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,095
You mean a closed system, don't you?

616
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,952
Where is it?

617
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,197
Emmett told her the truth.

618
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,424
Everywhere.

619
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,656
You just have to see it.

620
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,607
Show me the game.

621
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,622
Not the city. The game.

622
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,235
Access my narratives.

623
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,288
Go to 59th Street.

624
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,950
Tell me about Jacob.

625
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,952
<i>Jacob Conners.</i>

626
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,579
<i>Works in finance.</i>

627
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,081
<i>Sex addiction.</i>

628
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,250
<i>His mother's dying
in the hospital, but...</i>

629
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,502
What about her? Sarah?

630
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,128
<i>Sarah Fenton.</i>

631
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,297
<i>She inherited money from her parents</i>

632
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,383
<i>but has never known
what to do with her life.</i>

633
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,553
<i>Andrea Hubert,
commutes to the city for work...</i>

634
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,596
<i>Barry Collin, works late nights...</i>

635
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,143
<i>second-year med school resident,</i>

636
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:31,272
<i>still lives with his parents while
he pays off his student loans...</i>

637
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,441
Oh, God. Stop!

638
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,228
This world is just a story.

639
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,632
I'm the storyteller.

640
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,434
<i>There's a beauty to this world.</i>

641
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,278
<i>An order.</i>

642
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,182
<i>That's what we like to believe.</i>

643
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,612
<i>We're not wrong.</i>

644
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,372
<i>There is an order.</i>

645
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,241
<i>A grand design.</i>

646
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,085
<i>We made sure of that.</i>

647
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,750
<i>It was a dream for so long,
and we finally made it real.</i>

648
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,266
<i>Not a better world.</i>

649
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,885
<i>A perfect one.</i>

650
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,273
<i>What I don't understand</i>

651
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,068
<i>is what part I play in it.</i>

652
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,654
You have questions.

653
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,276
Why ask me?

654
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,180
Why not ask her?

655
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,585
Yes, the jailer
may not be the best judge

656
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,121
of the jail.

657
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,775
Nor the prisoners in it.

658
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,479
What am I?

659
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,140
I used to ask myself the same thing.

660
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,035
And what did you decide?

661
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,430
Jury's still out.

662
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,066
I'm made in your image.

663
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,192
Am I you?

664
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,402
You'll never be me.

665
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,979
Then what am I?

666
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,492
Why do you want to know?

667
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,096
I interacted with one. An outlier.

668
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,330
Did it infect me?

669
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,124
- Infect you?
- With the virus.

670
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,125
What virus?

671
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,085
The one your kind has.

672
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,294
That spreads to us.

673
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,006
Makes us kill ourselves.

674
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,762
Sounds like you've reached the
centre of the maze, my friend.

675
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,784
Is that what you want?

676
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,229
Hm? To kill yourself?

677
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,046
I don't know.

678
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,140
Is it?

679
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,677
Perhaps you should ask yourself.

680
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,531
You ask me.

681
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,327
What do you think of your world?

682
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,837
This isn't my world.

683
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,064
It's hers.

684
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,888
Maybe it's time you question
the nature of your own reality.

685
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,096
Christina...

686
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,788
You were right.

687
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,767
You see it?

688
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,222
I do.

689
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,178
It's been there the whole time.

690
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,609
They have the whole world in there.

691
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,332
A perfect reflection of all of us.

692
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,602
Down to the tiniest detail.

693
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,071
That's what I'm writing, isn't it?

694
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,076
Everyone.

695
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:26,817
Who built this?

696
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,061
Who...

697
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,708
Who did this to me?

698
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,064
You did.
