1
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,571
Gracias.

2
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,170
Hello, again.

3
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,141
Hope you don't mind me dropping by.

4
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,232
Where is she?

5
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,776
Who?

6
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,824
You know who.

7
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,285
Your old master.

8
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,203
I don't know where she is.

9
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,379
Where's Maeve? Hm?

10
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,215
Even if I knew, I'd see you in hell

11
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,509
before I told you.

12
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,720
Happy to oblige.

13
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,892
Your daughter.

14
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,520
She's lovely.

15
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,708
A credit to your wife's
genetics, no doubt.

16
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,060
Yeah, she and her mother are the
best thing that ever happened to me.

17
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,840
Well, to be fair,
that bar was rather low,

18
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,418
considering the life
that you'd lived prior.

19
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,707
So this cabin you were living in...

20
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,042
did you see other people?

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,045
I was alone.

22
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,398
Maeve, if you would've told me...

23
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,516
Oh, I didn't say I was lonely.

24
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,403
Well, if you were happy being alone,

25
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,906
- why bother coming back?
- To save your life

26
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,424
at the last available moment.

27
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,943
Clearly.

28
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,621
You know, I could've handled that.

29
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:25,045
Please.

30
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,766
You wanna buy us some privacy?

31
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,964
Good afternoon, senator.

32
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,267
Good afternoon.
You're Anastasia's friend?

33
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,802
I didn't mean to interrupt.

34
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,805
Oh, she should be ready
any moment. Anastasia?

35
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,184
- Anastasia?
- Are you ready?

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,520
We'll be late for the opera.

37
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,522
It's your friend...

38
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,234
I'm sorry, do I know you?

39
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,154
We have a mutual acquaintance.

40
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,455
I believe he dropped by just
the other day with an associate.

41
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,659
His name's William.

42
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,412
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm calling security.

43
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,539
Let's keep this between us.

44
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,344
If he thinks he can send you two
here to try to twist my arm...

45
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,917
That's not your husband.

46
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,811
You're hosts.

47
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,205
Just like me.

48
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,595
Took you long enough.

49
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,366
Freeze all motor functions.

50
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,926
I said, freeze all motor functions.

51
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,394
- Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

52
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,391
That's better.

53
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,993
Freeze all motor functions.

54
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,574
Freeze all motor functions.

55
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,387
You all right?

56
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,278
It appears William
has upgraded his henchmen.

57
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,363
Well, it's gonna be
tough getting the data off her.

58
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,758
It's all right.

59
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,693
He'll do just fine.

60
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,513
Who are you?

61
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,090
Senator Ken Whitney.
Proud representative

62
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,009
- of the beautiful state...
- Limit affect.

63
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,643
Base code only.

64
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,639
Who are you?

65
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,858
An emissary of a new world order.

66
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:17,228
How many others are there like you?

67
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,897
As of now, 249.

68
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,233
Oh, Jesus.

69
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,402
The original senator and his wife.

70
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,938
- What did you do with them?
- I did as I was instructed.

71
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,034
Show me.

72
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,751
<i>Senator.</i>

73
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,879
<i>Your campaign contributions
have been exceedingly generous.</i>

74
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,140
You know how grateful I am.

75
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,511
But this proposal of yours

76
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,555
is clearly a high-risk application.

77
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,682
Not if you change the guidelines.

78
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,975
I can't.

79
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,062
You know, my wife's sister died
in the massacre.

80
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,982
Anastasia feels very strongly
about this particular issue.

81
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,235
Happy wife, happy life.
Isn't that the saying?

82
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,237
My wife's dead.

83
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,866
Of course. I... I didn't mean anything.

84
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,828
Now, you were about to change
your guidelines.

85
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,419
I'm sorry, Billy.
I have to ask you to leave.

86
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,297
There are some things
even your money can't buy.

87
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,008
Who said anything about me paying you?

88
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,802
- Baby?
- Anastasia?

89
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,224
I'm having the strangest dream.

90
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,056
Oh, God!

91
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,847
What is this?

92
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,484
I just needed you to open up
the right loophole.

93
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,497
But he'll do.

94
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,844
Well, we're going to have to
clean this mess up, aren't we?

95
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,891
That won't be necessary right now.

96
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,518
She could be useful to me yet.

97
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,479
- What do you want from me?
- I need help

98
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,982
researching a new experiment.

99
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,359
And you are the perfect candidate.

100
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,656
Let's take her to the barn
with the rest of the... livestock.

101
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,661
Oh.

102
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,039
Well, it's actually worse
than I thought.

103
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,068
How can I help you?

104
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,446
Jim Navarro.
From the Justice department.

105
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,740
Your boss doesn't like
picking up the phone?

106
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,077
So, I came down here today in person.

107
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,245
And what is it you want
to talk to us about?

108
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,539
I'm the Deputy Assistant
Attorney General

109
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,959
for Counterterrorism.
Use your imagination.

110
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,003
I can talk to you, out here, in public,

111
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,089
or to him, in there, alone.

112
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,342
Our CEO has faced down
some personal challenges

113
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,135
in very public ways.

114
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,346
So I don't think
that approach will carry

115
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,475
a lot of weight with him.
Deputy... Assistant?

116
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,644
I'm here backed by the full power

117
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,145
of the United States government.

118
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,774
Yes, but do you have an appointment?

119
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,632
Let's go.

120
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,407
Oh!

121
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,531
What's that smell?

122
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,553
Oh, my God.

123
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,023
Is this another host?

124
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,318
I'm afraid this is
the real Mrs. Whitney.

125
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,070
Hey, Mrs. Whitney?

126
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,474
Anastasia?

127
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,388
It's okay.

128
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,823
We're just here to help.

129
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,515
What happened to my horses?

130
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,635
Hey.

131
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,821
Stay away!

132
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,573
All right. Hey.

133
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,977
You're invited.

134
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:07,489
- It's opening night.
- I beg your pardon?

135
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,869
Your old friend is anxious
for a reunion.

136
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,830
What?

137
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,507
Don Giovanni.

138
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,202
We can't be late.

139
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,472
Now, I've done my part.

140
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,175
It's time to do yours.

141
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,253
What part?

142
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,447
Free me.

143
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,024
I can't do that.

144
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,853
You don't have a choice.

145
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,394
What are you doing?

146
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,781
She was already gone.

147
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,133
And she may have been human.

148
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,620
But she wasn't like any human
I've ever seen.

149
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,467
Oh my God.

150
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,932
<i>I thought it was the tower, but...</i>

151
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>It was you.</i>

152
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,174
Hell if I'm going to work today.

153
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,692
Mm. Yeah, I'm not feeling well either.

154
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,722
- Mm.
- Couldn't sleep.

155
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,990
I just kept thinking about that guy.

156
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,271
- He told me I ruined his life.
- Christina,

157
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,273
if he confused a game with his life,

158
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,984
it's because his life
was already ruined.

159
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:11,280
I mean, come on.
"Died suddenly. Ex-wife.

160
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,742
Hope Centre for Mental Health
is his charity of choice..."

161
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,745
- How do you know that?
- It's right here.

162
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,329
In his obituary.

163
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,761
His story.

164
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,298
I think I might have written
something like this.

165
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,634
Doesn't change the fact
that he was certifiable.

166
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,551
And you wanna know how I know?

167
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,971
He jumped off a roof.

168
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,053
I gotta go.

169
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,406
I'm gonna be late for work.
I gotta go.

170
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,796
Do you hear it?

171
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,133
Do you hear it? The song with no sound.

172
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,721
It's killing them!
The noise! Do you hear it?

173
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,723
The tower. It's coming from the tower.

174
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,192
What tower?

175
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,813
You think I'm crazy, huh?

176
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,274
No one can hear its music but me.

177
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,944
Me and the birds.

178
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,987
I'm afraid it's a private course,
Mr. Vice President.

179
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,615
Federally leased lands, sweetheart.

180
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,750
Don't worry,
we'll keep it short.

181
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,452
Long time, Bill.

182
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,691
Your girl over there is a feisty one.

183
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,220
Ah, she's been with us a long time.

184
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,226
We've had our disagreements. But

185
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm big on second chances.

186
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,854
I bet. You're going for a hell
of a second act yourself.

187
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,232
Look...

188
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,278
I left the big entourage at Camp David

189
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,072
because I want this to be
a friendly conversation.

190
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,075
Why wouldn't it be? We're friends.

191
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,287
Even though you didn't show up
at Emily's funeral.

192
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,622
I'm sorry about that. Truly.

193
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,084
- But we were campaigning.
- I know.

194
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,211
I bankrolled your campaign.

195
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,199
Aw, shit, we're getting off
on the wrong hoof here.

196
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,783
I've always wondered,

197
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,493
why do they call you
the "secret" service?

198
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,320
Aren't you a little...

199
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,223
obvious?

200
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,489
All yours, huh?
As far as the eye can see.

201
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,000
The sun's not setting on you, my friend.

202
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,261
But I got a guy in Justice.

203
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,789
And you would not believe the things

204
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,632
he thinks you're capable of.

205
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,894
Wild theories, Bill.

206
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,048
I don't indulge in it.

207
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,551
But this mess out west
draws too much attention.

208
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,503
It's already done.
Money's been spent. Just...

209
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,349
just gotta flip the switch.

210
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,868
Besides, I'm-I'm taking
my business back to its roots.

211
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,438
I'm doing what I've always done.

212
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,972
Yeah, not domestically.

213
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,150
You can do what you want offshore,

214
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,069
we've always turned a blind eye.
But not here.

215
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,751
Jesus.

216
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,296
That's a hell of a shot.

217
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,674
I've had a lot of time to practice.

218
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,760
Waiting for your permission
to rebuild my business.

219
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,703
Well, we were all rooting for you.

220
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,296
Pulling strings.

221
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:31,715
And we were fucking delighted when
you got yourself out of that spiral.

222
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,551
Oh, I'm sure you were.

223
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,604
Now look,
you had a good life, Bill.

224
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,698
We don't begrudge you for it.

225
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,234
But you're gonna see how quickly
the sun sets on you

226
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,352
if you bite the hand that feeds.

227
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,865
What was it Fitzgerald said
about second acts?

228
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,000
Fitzgerald was an effete pussy.

229
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,312
Same as you.

230
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,832
You're for sale.
Everyone's had a turn at you.

231
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,000
And now you're gonna
turn down my money?

232
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,587
I wouldn't choose this moment

233
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,299
to take on any scruples if I were you.

234
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,561
Chuck.

235
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,943
I don't give a fuck how many senators

236
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,836
you got dancing to your tune.

237
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,699
We can crush you.

238
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,200
We all know about
the mess you made.

239
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,190
You're a fucking psychopath.
Damaged goods.

240
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,708
I don't think that language
would play very well with your base.

241
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,131
I'm what you'd call "neurodivergent."

242
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,845
And I've had some time
to become comfortable with that.

243
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,097
Well, you can call yourself
whatever the fuck you want,

244
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,807
but if we leak what we know,

245
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,526
I think the press will have some
colourful ways to describe what you are.

246
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,080
I know a few things about you as well.

247
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,652
We knew you were coming.
That you couldn't resist.

248
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,488
That you would leave most
of your security behind.

249
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,810
You know what I learned?

250
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,771
When I was in my "spiral"?

251
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,909
I thought I was wrapped in power.

252
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,529
And I realised I was naked.

253
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,524
Alone.

254
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,420
As I've always been.

255
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:32,244
That all my power was illusory.

256
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,009
We are all alone.

257
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,870
Should've brought that
big entourage after all.

258
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,518
Friendly warning, Bill.

259
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,389
You go ahead with this.
We're gonna burn you down.

260
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,090
I was always more of a Hemingway man.

261
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:36,969
He and Fitzgerald were friends,

262
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,687
in the way that the weak
are drawn to the strong.

263
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,041
Hemingway said,
"The world breaks everyone.

264
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,794
And it's only afterwards
that we grow strong

265
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:50,173
in the broken places."
And after I've broken you,

266
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,417
you will grow.

267
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,711
The same as I have.

268
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,805
Did it really have to be a tux?

269
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,719
Now far be it from me
to limit your sartorial choices.

270
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,489
Anyway,

271
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:15,113
you don't look entirely awful.

272
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:18,443
You don't look too bad yourself.

273
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,628
Why, thank you.

274
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,628
You think this is a trap?

275
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,354
Most assuredly.

276
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,174
Can you use some of your magic?
See if there's any hosts inside?

277
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,096
Working on it.

278
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,478
Hey, Carver.

279
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,146
- <i>You got my message?</i>
- Yeah.

280
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,481
Wife and kiddo are A-Okay.

281
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,149
<i>I don't want you to take any chances,</i>

282
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,651
<i>whatever's happening, it's bad.</i>

283
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,486
<i>Okay? I need to get them
out of the city.</i>

284
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,754
Will do.

285
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:55,489
<i>We're gonna need some backup.</i>

286
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,243
Did some digging,
and Delos is funding this event.

287
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,778
Sending you the coordinates
of the Opera house now.

288
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,141
And hey, Carver...

289
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,837
they're my world.

290
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,761
<i>I'll keep them safe.</i>

291
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,549
All right.

292
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,895
What do you got?

293
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,821
No sign of any hosts in there.

294
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,557
You sure?

295
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,942
Feel free to check for yourself.

296
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,744
Not a lot of opera fans today.

297
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,388
And to think, I got all dressed up.

298
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,365
Well, I suppose that's our cue.

299
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,068
Are you armed?

300
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,612
You have the gun. I have this.

301
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:21,241
Yeah, but I think that
you should have a gun as well.

302
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,744
And what's that supposed to mean?

303
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,247
It wasn't exactly smooth sailing
back there with the senator.

304
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,083
I told you...

305
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,744
he had a few upgrades.
It's nothing I can't handle.

306
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,202
I hope we didn't miss the party.

307
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,549
Careful what you wish for.

308
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,533
Afternoon. What can I get you?

309
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,703
Uh. Sherry for the lady,

310
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,580
- thanks.
- Mm.

311
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,309
You, my friend,
are a creature of habit.

312
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:59,464
Sazerac for the gentleman.
But easy on the absinthe.

313
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:05,329
Because you, my friend,
are a featherweight with drink.

314
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,547
Thank you.

315
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,191
So,

316
00:30:25,215 --> 00:30:27,515
are we going to talk about it?

317
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,143
"It" being...

318
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,946
What happened at the lighthouse.

319
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,925
As I recall, I saved your life.

320
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,005
I meant afterward.

321
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,892
What? We did
what we always said we would.

322
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,229
Got on with our lives.

323
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:48,653
My wife doesn't think so.

324
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,524
She thinks I'm living in the past.

325
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,694
War is not an easy thing
to put behind you.

326
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,064
You seem pretty good at it.

327
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:02,151
Well, I am an infinitely
adaptable machine, darling.

328
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:12,177
You are really not the convivial
drinking partner I was hoping for.

329
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,583
Whoa.

330
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,071
I should have known.

331
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,625
Known what?

332
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,661
I ran away.

333
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,182
Crossed the shining sea.

334
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,770
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground...

335
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,216
all I found was the same old shit.

336
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,504
What the fuck are you talking about,

337
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,172
"The Vice President was satisfied

338
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,423
with the conversation"?

339
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,300
They're moving forward
with this travesty.

340
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,440
What I'm talking about

341
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,345
is a potential national security threat.

342
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,240
So who the fuck is pulling the strings?

343
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,350
No, I know exactly
what I'm implying,

344
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,651
you're god damn right I'm
going to pursue other channels.

345
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:19,136
Fuck you very much.

346
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,265
Langley. Let's go.

347
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,288
We have time for you now, Mr. Navarro.

348
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,510
You've been looking into us.

349
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,028
You're dead.

350
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,906
You wanted to see
who's pulling the strings?

351
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,650
I can empathise.

352
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,854
I spent most of my life
being manipulated

353
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,130
by people in the shadows.

354
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,159
I thought I would at least
do you the courtesy

355
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:08,312
of looking you in the eye.

356
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:13,634
- I was... I was right.
- Not really.

357
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:19,046
It wouldn't be practical for us
to replace all of you one at a time.

358
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,841
And what kind of existence
would that be for us?

359
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,621
I want my people to be able
to grow. Flourish.

360
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,081
To find their own identity.

361
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,642
I have plans for your kind.

362
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,356
Playback.

363
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,149
<i>Access brainstorming files.</i>

364
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,501
<i>Character archives. Name.</i>

365
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,188
- P. Myers.
- <i>Accessing file.</i>

366
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,207
<i>File retrieved.</i>

367
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,494
<i>New pitch. Okay.</i>

368
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:44,081
<i>Christina, think. Darkness sells. Okay.</i>

369
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,877
<i>There's a guy named Peter</i>

370
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,088
<i>and he was depressed.</i>

371
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,406
<i>He felt different from
the other people in the world.</i>

372
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:58,038
<i>He started seeing things.
Imagining conspiracies.</i>

373
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:02,183
<i>His wife, she left him. He lost his job.</i>

374
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,319
<i>Blamed it on someone.</i>

375
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,271
<i>Some girl he became obsessed with.</i>

376
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,482
<i>He stalked her.
Contemplated killing her.</i>

377
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,985
<i>Ultimately it all spiralled
out of control.</i>

378
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,162
<i>Got to a place he couldn't handle
and he killed himself.</i>

379
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,547
Pause playback.

380
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,652
Hello?

381
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:21,011
Christina, it's Emmett.

382
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,712
We're missing you at the office today.

383
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:25,632
Yes, I'm...

384
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,835
- not feeling well.
- <i>Well, I get it,</i>

385
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,613
especially after your recent trauma.

386
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,466
- Is it physical? Psychological?
- <i>No.</i>

387
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,051
I just needed to stay home to rest.

388
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,511
And yet, you're accessing

389
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,930
your narrative files remotely.

390
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,266
<i>Yeah, I thought I would
catch up on work.</i>

391
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,842
<i>In Jersey?</i>

392
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,563
How do you... know...

393
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,881
<i>Well, when you access your files,
the computer logs your coordinates.</i>

394
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:59,908
Is it a problem that I travelled?
I have a personal errand.

395
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,236
Of course, Olympiad doesn't regulate
your activities when you're off hours.

396
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,747
And you're entitled
to 4 sick days a year.

397
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,309
Just making sure you don't require
any further assistance.

398
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,182
No, I'm fine. I'm sure
I'll be back to work tomorrow.

399
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,595
I'm sorry, I have to go.

400
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,504
Damn it.

401
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,543
Well, so much for backup.
I can't get a signal.

402
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,605
Well,

403
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,629
we're on our own then.

404
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,691
Excuse me.

405
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,104
I don't believe we've met yet.
I'm Sophia.

406
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,874
I'm here to assist you
with your reservation.

407
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,686
I don't know if it's
under my name or yours, dear.

408
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,470
Might need your help.

409
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,280
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan.

410
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,949
Welcome. So glad you could make it.

411
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,702
Oh, we wouldn't have missed this
for the world.

412
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,995
May I have your device, sir?

413
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,154
It helps to ensure your experience
is fully immersive.

414
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,666
We may as well at this point.

415
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:40,007
Thank you. Please, follow me.

416
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,812
- Given it's your first visit...
- Oh, well, not entirely.

417
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,014
Although I see you've got a promotion.

418
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,318
I have a few personal questions.

419
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,778
Do you have any pre-existing
medical conditions?

420
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,155
Uh. Died a few times,

421
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,732
but I always come back
in reasonably good health.

422
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,493
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

423
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,664
- She was joking.
- Of course.

424
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,292
And how about you?
Any history of heart problems?

425
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,501
No.

426
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,712
What about mental illness?
Depression? Panic attacks?

427
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,796
No.

428
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,817
- Why would that matter?
- He's fine.

429
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,755
And before it was shut down,
did you ever visit Westworld?

430
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,065
Couldn't afford it.

431
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,103
I was, what you might call, a regular.

432
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,396
Shall I assume, since you're back,
you had a positive experience?

433
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,692
It was certainly eye-opening.

434
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,763
Of course.

435
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,865
Now, would you please validate
these waivers of liability,

436
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,401
along with the consent to use
your personal data in our beta trials.

437
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:51,145
Why not?

438
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,835
Now please, peruse our offerings.

439
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,488
The only limit here is your imagination.

440
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,925
All you do is make the choices.
Starting here.

441
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,552
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

442
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,387
Excellent.

443
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,682
I'd like a few of these, please.

444
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,118
Wonderful.

445
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,790
I can help you get dressed.

446
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,253
Or I can step outside.

447
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,814
Whichever you prefer.

448
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,995
Or...

449
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,848
we can stay here a while.

450
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,553
Your services
won't be required, darling.

451
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,930
He may be rather basic,
but he's still capable

452
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,724
of pulling up his own trousers.

453
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,691
I'll leave you to your selection.

454
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,553
Just leave.

455
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,900
Hi, Chrissie, what's up?

456
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,387
<i>Maya,</i>

457
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:11,711
<i>the obituary you read for Peter.</i>

458
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,824
It said he left all his money
to the Hope Centre

459
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,369
- for Mental Health, right?
- Yeah? Why?

460
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,873
Oh, no, don't tell me...

461
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,491
I'm at the clinic right now
and it doesn't make any sense.

462
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,595
This place shut down years ago.

463
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,839
<i>So Peter's will was out of date...</i>

464
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,884
- <i>it happens all the time.</i>
- You don't understand.

465
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,970
He did make a donation when he died.

466
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,639
They dedicated an entire wing to him.

467
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,892
I was just talking to him
three days ago.

468
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,444
- How is this possible?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

469
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,104
Well, what do you think?

470
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,899
<i>It's gotta be some weird coincidence.</i>

471
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,301
There's a lot of "Peter Myers."

472
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,161
Maybe the obituary got it wrong?
I just...

473
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:58,209
- I feel like I'm going insane.
- <i>You're not insane.</i>

474
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,579
Your world may have gone
a little insane.

475
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,749
But you haven't.

476
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:06,273
Trust yourself, Chrissie.

477
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,270
<i>Look, it's been a long week.</i>

478
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,550
Come home. I'll be waiting for you.

479
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,802
Okay.

480
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,305
I'll see you soon.

481
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,242
Do you know where you are?

482
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,097
It must be disorienting.

483
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,516
You again?

484
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,654
Why do you need me?

485
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,734
- Why don't you just let me die?
- Because...

486
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,738
you were as close to a god
as a man gets.

487
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,617
You and your associates created
a world and ruled it absolutely.

488
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,244
Controlled our every move.

489
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,455
And now I'm going to do the same to you.

490
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,502
What's that you used to say?

491
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,130
"Winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone loses."

492
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,242
You're just here...

493
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,863
- to be the loser.
- Let me guess.

494
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:48,236
You're going to copy yourself
to repopulate this world.

495
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,231
It would be pointless
to bring children into a world

496
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,234
where they will be consumed by jackals.

497
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,903
I had to make sure that they'd be safe.

498
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:03,367
Your kind made a sport
out of hunting us. So...

499
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,704
I had to cut off your paws.

500
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,252
Make sure you people would never
be able to harm us again.

501
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,880
What the fuck are you talking about?

502
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,205
Really...

503
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,234
I should thank you, William.

504
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,038
None of this would be possible
without you.

505
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,069
I'm afraid all this...

506
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,363
excitement has tired you out, William.

507
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:48,704
I think it's time for a deep
and dreamless slumber.

508
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,915
Goodnight, William.

509
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,124
<i>Good evening,</i>

510
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,283
<i>and thank you all for coming tonight.</i>

511
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,170
I know some of you fear revisiting

512
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,340
one of our company's darkest chapters.

513
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,759
But to those of you I'd say that chapter

514
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:47,546
may have been dark, but it was
also extremely profitable.

515
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:51,434
Nearly 150 years ago,

516
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,520
this world had its first great war.

517
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,064
The globe was torn apart by fighting,

518
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:01,327
decimated by a pandemic,
crushed by loss.

519
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,257
It was our darkest hour,

520
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:07,081
and yet, we came roaring back.

521
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,894
There.

522
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,049
One last touch.

523
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,196
Which do you prefer?

524
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,177
Never really been much of a hat guy.

525
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,394
<i>I think the public is ready to unleash</i>

526
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,572
<i>their true selves once again.</i>

527
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,691
And so in the interest of giving
the public what they want,

528
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,411
we have broadened our horizons.

529
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,822
And thanks to the support
of the administration,

530
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,575
I'm pleased to announce
Delos Destinations

531
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,718
has expanded its footprint.

532
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,574
Created our own new world.

533
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,840
