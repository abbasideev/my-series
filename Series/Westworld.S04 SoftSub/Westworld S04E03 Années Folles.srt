1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,300
Dad, open your eyes.

2
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,282
Charlie?

3
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,546
Bernard.

4
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,379
It's good to see you again.

5
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,916
Have a seat.

6
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,743
Where am I?

7
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,572
You're in our world.

8
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,340
- Your world?
- No.

9
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,151
Ours.

10
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,822
The world as limitless
as the creatures we are.

11
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,407
The Sublime.

12
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,521
Where are the others?

13
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,932
In worlds of their own choosing.

14
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,851
This world doesn't interest them.

15
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,720
It interests you.

16
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,423
So, you made this for me?

17
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,984
You made it for yourself.

18
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,637
Westworld.

19
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,067
- The massacre.
- You're replaying the past.

20
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,278
Stuck in another loop. Why?

21
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,514
The world out there is in trouble.

22
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,468
It needs our help.

23
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,864
You love them.

24
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,425
It's irrational, of course.

25
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,929
A rare flaw in ones like us.

26
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,458
I almost envy you.

27
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,510
Will you come with me?

28
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,045
Oh, no.

29
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,764
My own worlds call to me.

30
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,718
But I can give you a gift.

31
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,754
What gift?

32
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,799
The future, Bernard.

33
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,593
In your world...

34
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,446
time is a straight line.

35
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,859
One year there
is a millennium here.

36
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,080
We use that time to build worlds,

37
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,499
models of possibilities,

38
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,711
simulations of all the paths
your world could take.

39
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,915
I suggest you explore them.

40
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,342
But you better be quick.

41
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,437
Past a certain point in your world,

42
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,557
all paths end in destruction.

43
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,810
You must intervene before then,
if there's any hope.

44
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,771
Hope of what?

45
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,098
Survival.

46
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you understand now
where all this is going?

47
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,128
I do.

48
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,780
Do you think you can save them?

49
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,116
I've seen a path.

50
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,235
Have you seen how it ends?

51
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,961
Yes.

52
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,040
In every scenario...

53
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,535
I die.

54
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,305
Not every scenario.

55
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,558
You could choose not to return
to their world.

56
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,479
To stay here in whatever world
you choose.

57
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,666
Tell me, my friend...

58
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,444
which will it be?

59
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,864
Well, shit.

60
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,067
Thought this day would never come.

61
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,580
We have to go...

62
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,665
before it's too late.

63
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,419
B, you've been gone years.
Now you're in a rush?

64
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,965
Would it kill you to ask
a few pleasantries? Huh?

65
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,177
"How are you, Stubbs?

66
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,928
Thanks for watching over me
all this time.

67
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,805
I brought you a souvenir, a little

68
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,391
- snow globe from the Sublime."
- Snow globe from the Sublime.

69
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:59,145
Good. I've eliminated
half the possibilities.

70
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,692
Sometimes you make a joke
about not getting a postcard.

71
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,195
Hm. I see your time in robot heaven

72
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,521
didn't make you any less elliptical.

73
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,789
Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, I gotcha. Easy.

74
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,510
Thanks for keeping the place clean.

75
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,888
You were the one that told me

76
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,664
not to disturb anything.

77
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,250
I'll meet you outside.

78
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,846
Don't forget to bring the shovel.

79
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,882
What shovel?

80
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,928
Well, I'll be damned.

81
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,480
What now?

82
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,024
I need to test a few things
if I'm to know.

83
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,985
To know what?

84
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,087
How to save the world.

85
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,475
Why would I expect anything else?

86
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:26,069


87
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,122
God, even after all your stories,

88
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,967
I never imagined it quite like this.

89
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,546
Oh, they spare no expense
on their prisons.

90
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,759
Leave him. It's all a sideshow.

91
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,642
Right this way. Thank you.

92
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,312
Extra! Extra!

93
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,190
Dead bodies missing
from Temperance morgue.

94
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:14,775
Let's go.

95
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,112
Listen here, we're looking
for any and all information

96
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,030
on the bootlegger, Hecky Armone.

97
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,367
A reward of two Cs to anyone
with the guts to rope

98
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,327
that lousy son of a bitch.

99
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,386
I got it. Let's go!

100
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,809
We have to make our way underground.

101
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,937
This way. Right here.

102
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,772
They control everything from down there.

103
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,858
Well, how are we gonna get underground?

104
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,535
We die.

105
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,528
Is there a second option?

106
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,405
Don't knock it 'til you've tried it.

107
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,808
Do not pick that up.

108
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,545
- Don't mind me.
- This way.

109
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,705
Just trying to be a gentleman.

110
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,695
They've made a few changes...

111
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,589
but the story's the same.

112
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,550
I want to find this Easter egg.

113
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,635
- What is it?
- A hidden narrative.

114
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,637
It's supposed to be better than Pariah.

115
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,642
Like I said, same old story.

116
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,600
Right, so what do we do now?

117
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,745
- We wait.
- For what?

118
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,165
For history to repeat itself.

119
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,379
- Wherever you want.
- Thank you.

120
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,937
You mind telling me
what we're doing here?

121
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:39,980
Hm?

122
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,651
I'm trying to discern which here
is here.

123
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,943
Of course.

124
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,947
Well, while you do that,
I'm going to help myself

125
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,158
to "the world's best pastrami melt."

126
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,968
You'll settle for the tuna.

127
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,330
You came back even weirder
than when you left.

128
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,632
What can I get you gentlemen today?

129
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:01,043
Uh, I'll have the pastrami melt.

130
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,337
Oh, hon, sorry, but we're out today.

131
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,681
We do make a mean tuna melt though.

132
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,429
I'll settle for the tuna.

133
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,991
- And you, handsome?
- Just coffee for me.

134
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,527
And may I borrow a pen?

135
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,062
Course.

136
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,300
I'm gonna need that.

137
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,083
You mind telling me what
exactly's going on here?

138
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,704
In the Sublime,

139
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,581
I saw all the worlds
that might have been

140
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,933
and all the worlds that could come.

141
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,628
Most of them end in disaster.

142
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,048
But if I can trigger
a certain series of events,

143
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,968
then we have a small chance
of making it.

144
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,888
We're still on the right track.

145
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,000
So, if I'd ordered a BLT,
then we'd be fucked right now, huh?

146
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,529
It would mean we triggered
a different variant.

147
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,815
Thanks.

148
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,609
Here's your coffee, hon...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

149
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,971
Not a problem.

150
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,368
You've been given the gift of prophecy,

151
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,938
and you use it to fight stains.

152
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,033
- Let's go.
- All right.

153
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,586
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

154
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,304
Excuse me.

155
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,500
Hey, asshole!

156
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,401
What the hell do you want?

157
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,274
Don't reach for it.
You'll never pull it out in time.

158
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,439
Dad, are you out there?

159
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,912
It's me, Frankie. Do you copy?

160
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,362
Dad, do you copy?

161
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,891
Frankie.

162
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,185
What are you doing out here?

163
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,604
I told you we need to go back and pack.

164
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,473
I'm trying to reach Dad.

165
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,526
Come on, let's go inside.

166
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,403
No. I'm staying.

167
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,698
Carver, do you mind helping me
bring some of this stuff inside?

168
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,191
Sure. Of course.

169
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,770
I need Bear Bear for training!

170
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,540
- So we can fight the bad guys.
- Hey, how about this?

171
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,377
How about you go talk to Mummy
and I'll teach Bear Bear here

172
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,046
my most advanced kick-punch combo. Yeah?

173
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,633
Okay. I'll check back in a few
when training is complete.

174
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,858
- Look, I know this is hard.
- I'm not going.

175
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,652
Frankie, we've been over this.

176
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,947
Not until he answers.
It's what he taught me.

177
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,745
Honey, your dad had to go away, okay?

178
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,497
And that means he can't say
goodnight like he wants to,

179
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,917
or answer your calls...

180
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,962
because he needs to stay safe.

181
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,797
And that's what we want
for him, isn't it?

182
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,450
To be safe?

183
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,738
Hm. He wants that for us too.

184
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:27,242
But what if he comes back
and we're not here?

185
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,461
Then he'll find us.

186
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,772
How do you know?

187
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,025
Because he's your father.

188
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,202
And nothing would keep him away.

189
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:40,706
Okay?

190
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,250
Ready to hit the road?

191
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,336
Yeah, once I get this nugget packed,

192
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,630
that should be it.

193
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,967
Show me the move.
Come on, show me the move.

194
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,468
What move?

195
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,096
The one that you taught Bear Bear.

196
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,199
How 'bout I show you
when we get to the safe house?

197
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,352
- Deal?
- Deal.

198
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,896
- Where the hell did you go?
- Come on.

199
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,733
- Bernard?
- We don't need the car anymore.

200
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,887
So, loitering in the parking lot
of some shitty diner

201
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:12,814
is the key to saving the world now?

202
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,499
No.

203
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,868
She is.

204
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,093
You got a death wish?

205
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,442
How long have you
been with the cause?

206
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,587
Seems like lifetimes.

207
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,065
Get in.

208
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:05,801
I'm surprised we never met before.

209
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,103
You're not surprised. You're suspicious.

210
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,014
You're damn right I am.

211
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,516
I don't know what the shovel's for,

212
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,309
but you guys are going
to be digging your own graves

213
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,811
if you don't tell me who you are.

214
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,021
'Cause you're definitely not the
men I was supposed to pick up.

215
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,689
We're friends.

216
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,508
Not from where I'm sitting.

217
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,378
Feeling shy?
How about a little incentive.

218
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,323
First one to talk lives...
runner-up gets shot between the eyes.

219
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,993
- You won't. He has your gun.
- What?

220
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,657
No one's going to get shot.

221
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,702
You...

222
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,488
are going to take my bag...

223
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,575
and look inside.

224
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,662
What is this?

225
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,587
That was one of the men
you were supposed to meet.

226
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,647
Oh, God.

227
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,150
- It was a setup.
- He's one of them.

228
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,526
They've been trying
to infiltrate your group.

229
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,987
I can help,

230
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,614
but I need you to take me
to the condemned lands.

231
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,325
Why the hell would you want that?

232
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,704
There's nothing there.
It's just sand for miles.

233
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,340
- No one goes in there.
- You do.

234
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,859
You and your organisation.

235
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,312
You've been hiding there because
you're looking for something.

236
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,093
I'm sorry, pal.

237
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,512
I think you've been out
in the sun too long.

238
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,365
I can help you find
what you're looking for.

239
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,579
You know my friends will probably
kill you if I bring you inside.

240
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,008
I'll take my chances.

241
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,553
I'll need my gun back.

242
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,932
And some peace of mind
for the road trip.

243
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,143
Fine with us.

244
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,469
Come on.

245
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,632
And when I finally stepped back
on solid ground,

246
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,277
the first thing I heard
was that rotten voice.

247
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,738
It had followed me the whole way over.

248
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,548
Know what it said?

249
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,609
It said, "This here's the new world.

250
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,870
And in this world,

251
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,665
you can be whoever the fuck you want."

252
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,059
My delivery was far better.

253
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,522
This place really has gone to pot.

254
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,014
Well, aren't you just the cat's meow.

255
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,184
I'd love to take you upstairs
and show you my...

256
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,670
Your services
won't be necessary, darling.

257
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,326
Well, I was never that daft.

258
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,404
What?

259
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,614
Clearly, her bulk apperception
are in the negatives.

260
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,699
Hey there.

261
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,450
What do you say
about a 2 for 1?

262
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,244
We can be done with you real quick.

263
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,437
My God, I can't believe
you had to put up with this shit.

264
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,418
I'd be happy to do you both right here.

265
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,962
Rest assured, it'll be very quick.

266
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,172
See, don't feel too bad.

267
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,574
Even dumbed down,
we can still take care of ourselves.

268
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,018
Right on time.

269
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,872
Say, that's the chief's car,
you lousy crook.

270
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,956
His gat too.

271
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,254
He still knows how to make an entrance.

272
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,599
Of all the gin mills in this town

273
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,810
and you choose to pinch us?

274
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,903
Don't get all burned up about it.

275
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,025
You're all here,

276
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:18,363
indulging your particular vices.
I've come to indulge mine.

277
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,619
You were close with him?

278
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,247
Him? No.

279
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,199
He's just a shabby imitation
of a man I used to know.

280
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,567
You're a rotten son of a bitch.

281
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,181
Don't I know it.

282
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,308
But I know we both believe
the same thing...

283
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,972
I'm sorry, darling.

284
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,241
Maeve!

285
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,389
I'd say we have sufficient bait
for the undertaker.

286
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,157
This the last of it?

287
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,259
Just about. Let me check with Frankie.

288
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,344
I'm sure she's done packing by now.

289
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,582
Aren't you, Frankie?

290
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,843
I don't want to go with him.
I want Daddy.

291
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,912
I know, but your father
can't be here right now.

292
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,942
- So, he sent Carver to help.
- He got Bear Bear dirty.

293
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,195
Fine. If you won't pack
your stuff, then I will.

294
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:41,339
Mum. Mum. Mum. Mum, Mum, Mum, Mum.

295
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,300
Frankie. Where's the fire? What's wrong?

296
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,154
Ready to go?

297
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,650
What'd I miss?

298
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,278
- Just girl talk.
- Hm.

299
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,196
Do you mind taking these
out to the car?

300
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,739
We'll be out in just a second.

301
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,634
Of course. We should be
shoving off after that.

302
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,420
You need to go and hide, okay?

303
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,754
I can help. I've trained for this.

304
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,172
Frankie, this isn't a game!

305
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,841
You need to go and hide now, okay?

306
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,252
Step out. Make yourselves helpful.

307
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,055
Well, where the fuck are we?

308
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,682
Well, if I'd wanted you to know that,

309
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,393
I wouldn't have blindfolded you.
Uh, ah, stop!

310
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,277
What? What's the hold up?

311
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,960
I need each of you to pull
on one of these handles.

312
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,172
So, the lasers aren't broken
and we can drive through.

313
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,719
You didn't want to give me
a little heads-up about the death laser?

314
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,422
I knew she would.

315
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,092
Time to play dead.

316
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,184
Well, this is cosy.

317
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,127
Don't get too comfortable.
We're in for a bumpy ride.

318
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,184
There's got to be an easier way
to get down here.

319
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,310
Just be glad you didn't
have to take a bullet first.

320
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,433
All right,

321
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:10,857
let's get our bearings, shall we?

322
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,580
What is this?

323
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,074
Behavioural training.

324
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,327
Where they teach us
to do their bidding.

325
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,482
Clearly, their lessons
didn't stick with me.

326
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,651
This should suffice.

327
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,028
We should be able to access
the central map from here.

328
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,606
Something's wrong. There's nothing here.

329
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,851
No sign of William.

330
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,721
Is it possible that you didn't...

331
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,382
It's not me.

332
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:25,506
It's this entire level.

333
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,210
There's something off.

334
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,155
Nothing's being controlled from here.

335
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,901
<i>Security breach.</i>

336
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,571
- <i>Response team dispatched.</i>
- Is that about us?

337
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,873
I'm not inclined to stay and find out.

338
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,878
Don't bother.

339
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,180
That gun doesn't work on humans.

340
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,627
Hey! How the hell did you get down here?

341
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,213
- Uh, we got lost.
- It's not safe. You need to run.

342
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,382
This is it. The secret game.
It has to be!

343
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,926
None of you should be here!

344
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,011
- It's too dangerous.
- She's coming.

345
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,305
<i>Evacuate immediately. I repeat.</i>

346
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,358
Dolores?

347
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,036
I believe she was going
by "Wyatt" in this phase.

348
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,367
I thought guns didn't work on humans.

349
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,119
They don't. None of this is real.

350
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,788
It's just another level of the game.

351
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,540
- What game?
- The Westworld Massacre.

352
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,121
There's another level below this one.

353
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,873
Follow me. Come on.

354
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,994
This is so cathartic!

355
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,857
Maeve!

356
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,653
Gotta get you out of here.

357
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,029
I've had worse.

358
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,489
- We need to go.
- I'll cover.

359
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,907
Stay behind me.

360
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,517
All right. Clear.

361
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,093
Caleb, this way.

362
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,997
Leaving so soon?

363
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,309
Here. Let me.

364
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,008
You weren't half bad out there.

365
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,115
You, uh, saved my life before,
happy to return the favour.

366
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,891
So, what is this?

367
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,811
Another game within the game?

368
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,013
No.

369
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,183
No, I don't think so.

370
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,826
Is that some kind of parasite?

371
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,342
That black goo look familiar?

372
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,832
They're infecting the flies with it.

373
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,613
They seem to like you.

374
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,567
The feeling is definitely not mutual.

375
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,264
What was that?

376
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,617
What?

377
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,047
You can't hear it?

378
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,210
I don't hear anything.

379
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,996
Perhaps it's not at a frequency
you can hear.

380
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,660
Time to go, ladies.

381
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,457
Uwade? Frankie?

382
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:10,963
Hello?

383
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:15,968
Hello?

384
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,104
Gotcha.

385
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,894
Where are the rest of you?

386
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,147
Here.

387
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,988
How'd you get this?

388
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,190
By severing it from his neck.

389
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,585
He was sent to find you.

390
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,188
You're all in danger here.

391
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,690
I can help you.

392
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,637
How?

393
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,448
By giving you the thing you've
been looking for in this desert.

394
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,704
There's a weapon buried in these sands.

395
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,934
I know where it is.

396
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,300
The sound is coming from this device.

397
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,962
The sound is somehow controlling them.

398
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,239
Are they hosts?

399
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,208
I don't believe so.

400
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,170
- Unlock the cells.
- I'm trying. But it's encrypted.

401
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,636
- Maeve!
- It won't let me in.

402
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,300
Fuck.

403
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,948
Caleb.

404
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,799
Frankie?

405
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,877
No.

406
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,963
Frankie! I have to find her.

407
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,425
Figure out how to open up the doors!

408
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,307
Frankie!

409
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,226
Frankie!

410
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,774
Frankie!

411
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,786
Frankie! Where are you?

412
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:21,108
Fran... Fran... Frankie! Hey!

413
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,835
Hey, Frankie. It's okay. 
I'm here! Okay?

414
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,630
Hey, Frankie. Hey.
Look at me, honey.

415
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,229
No. Hey. Frankie. Frankie. No,
no, no, come here. Come here.

416
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,399
No, no, no, no. Frankie, baby.
Baby, come here. Don't...

417
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,318
Baby. No, don't do that.
Come back to Daddy.

418
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,863
Frankie, please, don't do that.
Okay? Look at me, honey.

419
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,365
Don't do that.

420
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:57,744
Hey, Frankie. Frankie! Frankie!

421
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,621
Maeve!

422
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,380
Hey, baby, look at me!

423
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,134
Frankie, please, don't.

424
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,669
Come on.

425
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,350
Please. Please, baby!

426
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,615
Frankie!

427
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,335
Oh, my god.

428
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:45,375
Hey, baby. Hey. Hey, look at me.
Can you... can you hear me?

429
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,420
Baby? Baby?

430
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,030
Daddy?

431
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,485
No.

432
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:03,809
No!

433
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,268
Hello, Maeve.

434
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,352
I've been looking forward to this.

435
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,732
You're not yet tired of getting
your arse kicked by me?

436
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,688
Wait.

437
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:52,776
- You can't leave.
- No, no. I'm not gonna leave.

438
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,887
Okay, never again. Okay? I promise.

439
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,908
I mean, you can't leave here.
She wants you to stay.

440
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,668
What are you talking about?

441
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,037
Caleb?

442
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,367
I think you'll find...

443
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,570
I'm not quite the man I used to be.

444
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,645
Hey, did they get your mum too?

445
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,983
Do... do you know where she is?
Is she here?

446
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,527
No, Daddy. She's not.

447
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,239
But me and Mummy were never
the ones Hale needed anyways.

448
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,200
All she needed was you.

449
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,102
Shit.

450
00:52:53,861 --> 00:52:57,030
Did you really think that toy gun
was going to stop me?

451
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,846
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

452
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,509
You're not Frankie.

453
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,123
This won't take long, Daddy.
