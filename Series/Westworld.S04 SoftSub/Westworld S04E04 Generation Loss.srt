00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>Caleb?</i>

2
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,678
<i>Caleb?</i>

3
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,707
<i>You ever think about what happens next?</i>

4
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,095
What happens when this war is over?

5
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,893
I imagine we go back
to our regular lives.

6
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,862
What does that look like for us?

7
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,358
Well, let's hope we have
the luxury of finding out.

8
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,242
I count four, maybe five.

9
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,120
Twelve total.

10
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,373
Five on the perimeter. Seven inside.

11
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,878
- Security feed.
- Show-off.

12
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,423
Well, that's the last of Rehoboam.

13
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,708
They're bound to have
pulled out all the stops.

14
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,595
Come on. Let's get this over with.

15
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,436
Go!

16
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,921
Oh, shit.

17
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,010
Come on!

18
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,361
It's okay.

19
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,333
It's okay.

20
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,163
Hold still.

21
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,244
Hey.

22
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,646
Caleb?

23
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,898
I guess I'll never know.

24
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,068
You'll have to be more specific, Caleb.

25
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,355
Life after this.

26
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,485
Freedom.

27
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:35,651
Caleb.

28
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:39,296
Look at me.

29
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,169
You want to know
what freedom feels like?

30
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,098
What are you doing?

31
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,602
I can hack into your limbics. I felt it.

32
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,146
A long time ago.

33
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,983
I can show you.

34
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,322
Feel.

35
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,295
<i>Caleb?</i>

36
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,224
Caleb,

37
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:31,748
wakey, wakey.

38
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,901
What did you do to me?

39
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,195
What I'm going to do
to all of your kind.

40
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,947
I made you my pet.

41
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,617
Shouldn't be long now.

42
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,578
And everything will be
so much easier.

43
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,730
You won't even want to resist.

44
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,476
Oh, God.

45
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,569
My family, did you...

46
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,239
Kill them? No. They're still
somewhere out there, alive.

47
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,203
For now.

48
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,498
Soon, it won't matter where they run.

49
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,825
Everyone will be under my control.

50
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,379
This was never about the park.

51
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:47,508
This was always about you
spreading your disease.

52
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,226
Everyone who comes here
will become a carrier.

53
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,904
I prefer the term “host.”

54
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,357
Yes, Caleb.

55
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,567
After they're done here,
they'll have as souvenirs

56
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,360
debauched memories
of their exploits

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,112
and my parasites.

58
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,490
Welcome to the super spreader
event of the century.

59
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,036
You're the first wave.
You should be flattered.

60
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,289
Are you going to make me
kill myself like the others?

61
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,124
That was just me
ironing out the kinks.

62
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,835
I have better plans
for you and your kind.

63
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,590
Besides, Maeve and Dolores
were always so fond of you,

64
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,634
I'm inclined to keep you around.

65
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,720
See what all the fuss is about.

66
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,713
You feel it now, don't you?

67
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,641
Don't fight it, Caleb.

68
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,660
You won't win.

69
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,371
No one does.

70
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,135
You're one of us.

71
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,754
There is no “us” anymore.

72
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,431
There's just “you.”

73
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,928
All your friends, they're gone.

74
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,934
I took care of them myself.

75
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,397
It was almost disappointing
how easy it was.

76
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,946
Is this what you've been
reduced to, Maeve?

77
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,083
Scared child hiding in the shadows?

78
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,637
You're trying to rummage in my mind.

79
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,240
Hale made some upgrades.

80
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,993
You can't control me.

81
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,105
You're not the one
I was trying to control.

82
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,774
<i>Systems overwrite.</i>

83
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,660
<i>Access granted.</i>

84
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,492
All right, your turn to take orders.

85
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,769
Move.

86
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,978
Maeve!

87
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,043
The parasite...

88
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,930
it's in me. That was never Frankie.

89
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:08,018
I know. And there I was thinking
Wyatt was Dolores's dark side.

90
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,939
All right, how do I get
this thing out of my head?

91
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,899
And give up my leverage?

92
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,776
That's all right,
we'll dig it out of her!

93
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,653
You're coming with us.

94
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,780
Maeve.

95
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,366
You've seen what this thing does.

96
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,953
We have to stop her
before this spreads any further.

97
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,987
Chrissie? You home?

98
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,197
Chrissie?

99
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,266
You're still sleeping?

100
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,582
Whoa, what happened here?

101
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,527
I overslept.

102
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,088
That's an understatement.

103
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,468
How late were you up painting?

104
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,347
I don't know. I couldn't fall asleep.

105
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,187
- Me neither.
- More nightmares?

106
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,981
I was a kid again.
I was with my parents.

107
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,858
We were having a picnic.

108
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:42,154
But there was this pesky fly
that kept landing on our food.

109
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,033
We'd chase it away, but more would come.

110
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,203
And... then they were everywhere.

111
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,614
They got my dad first.

112
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,918
And he was just screaming, and...

113
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,019
then my mother tried to help...

114
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,172
and they surrounded her too.

115
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,261
I watched them scream and flail.

116
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,556
And then they went absolutely still.

117
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,075
What happened next?

118
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,612
Then the flies came for me.

119
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,700
And that's the last thing I saw...

120
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,202
before I woke up.

121
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,290
God, that sounds terrible.

122
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,584
You know,
I've had anxiety dreams before,

123
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,193
but this one...

124
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,597
felt so real.

125
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,806
Jesus, what's it supposed to be?

126
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,303
I don't know.

127
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,981
Does it look like anything to you?

128
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:03,611
Looks like I'm dragging you out tonight

129
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,237
to blow off some steam.

130
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,516
- No, please.
- Please? Pretty please?

131
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,075
I will find someone
perfect for you.

132
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,535
- I promise.
- Maya...

133
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,172
Christina,

134
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,096
seriously.

135
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,501
I need a night off. Come with me.

136
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,190
Okay. Fine.

137
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,832
- What is that?
- We'll need a little help

138
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,168
if we're going to retrieve this weapon.

139
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,671
You're fucking kidding me.

140
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,173
But you gave your approval.

141
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,576
That was before we found
another outlier.

142
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,719
We got to extract her fast
before she's hunted down.

143
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,805
We can't waste time on some
misguided treasure hunt.

144
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,973
What about those two?

145
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,350
You do what you should
have done on the road.

146
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,518
What do you mean?

147
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,144
What're they doing?

148
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,522
Deciding our fate.

149
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,232
And if they really are on our side?

150
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,401
We don't take chances on strangers.

151
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,302
If there really is a weapon here,
we need to find it.

152
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,656
Those two could be our
only chance to free everyone.

153
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,884
You've lost all objectivity, C.
This is too personal for you.

154
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:36,987
And I'm not letting you risk
all of us over some myth.

155
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,500
Everyone make ready, we head out
for the extraction in five.

156
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,585
Copy that. You heard him, let's go.

157
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,329
Best to travel light.

158
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,744
I won't let you.

159
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,673
Now might be a good time
to tell me we're not about to die.

160
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:00,227
No, we live most of the time.

161
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,724
Both of you, cut it out.

162
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:05,348
Jay, you're being an asshole.

163
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,401
You need a team for the extraction?

164
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,070
I'll cover C. Take her place.

165
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,699
C, you want to see
where this leads? Do it.

166
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,576
And if it's bullshit, shoot them.

167
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,301
You want him,

168
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,486
you can have him.

169
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,991
But this one's coming with us.

170
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,151
Collateral.

171
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,761
Great. We have a deal?

172
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,738
Fine.

173
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,393
- Do I have to go with them?
- For safety.

174
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,186
Well, at least I'll be safe.

175
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,547
I didn't mean yours.

176
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,865
Don't take any chances out there.

177
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,517
Where's the fun in that?

178
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:10,714
Listen here, we're looking for any

179
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,009
and all information
on the bootlegger, Hecky Armone.

180
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,179
He and his goons gunned down
a federal marshal.

181
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,183
A reward of two Cs to anyone
with the guts to rope

182
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,876
that lousy son of a bi...

183
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,875
That's a day off for you, copper.

184
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:37,950
Maeve, we gotta go.

185
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,527
Every human in the park
could be infected.

186
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,541
We need to get to an extraction point.

187
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,542
All right, my guys will pick us up
just outside the border of the park.

188
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,963
- Just need the coordinates.
- You'll never make it that far.

189
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,756
They'll stop you well before then.

190
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,384
You alone though, you might make it.

191
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,718
Ignore her.

192
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,805
But you seem to make a habit out
of risking your life for him.

193
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,544
You could have lived in peace,
undisturbed,

194
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,708
if you hadn't have been
so sentimental.

195
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,769
What is she talking about?

196
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,223
What is it?

197
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:10,947
Something's wrong.

198
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,071
Maeve.

199
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,368
They've turned their machine back on.

200
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,662
The parasite'll take hold of him soon.

201
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,334
That is... if the guests in the park

202
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,045
- don't kill you both first.
- Oh, do shut up.

203
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,922
Move!

204
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,913
Maeve, I think we just
became public enemy number one.

205
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,125
Don't worry, darling.
The narratives in this park

206
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,170
are just cheap copies of Westworld.

207
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,963
She may have her parasite,
but I've lived

208
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,132
these loops a 1,000 times.

209
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,420
Which means that no one knows
this game better than I do.

210
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,439
Our chariot awaits.

211
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,544
A laundry truck?

212
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,003
Come on, girls, let's go.

213
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,618
Bootleg moonshine.

214
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,340
Go. I'll distract them.

215
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,705
Watch out! They're after your hooch!

216
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,605
Caleb.

217
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,789
No!

218
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,804
Hold on.

219
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,379
We're close.

220
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,922
Better be. If this weapon
isn't where you say it is,

221
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,966
I have no choice but to
put you out of your misery.

222
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,219
I know. You've done it plenty before.

223
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,933
There.

224
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,438
Right on time.

225
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,509
We need to take cover
before it's in range.

226
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,079
Follow my lead!

227
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,133
Come on, let's go. It's gonna lock.

228
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,888
In ten...

229
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,282
nine...

230
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,910
eight...

231
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,814
seven...

232
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,441
six...

233
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,876
five...

234
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,738
four...

235
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,107
That's it.

236
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,685
Over that ridge.

237
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,603
Time to push forward.

238
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,684
Relax.

239
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,262
Close your mouth. Now pucker.

240
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:32,486
Mm-hm.

241
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,354
Perfect.

242
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,204
Don't mind me.

243
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,950
Just trying to look chivalrous.

244
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,111
Told you.

245
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,745
Told her what?

246
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,765
You're my date?

247
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,159
Well, is that a problem?

248
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,381
Shall we?

249
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,856
So, Christina...

250
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,167
tell me about yourself.

251
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,238
There's not much to tell.

252
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,408
Well, now I know you're either
extremely modest or extremely private.

253
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,245
Well, we just met.
You don't know anything about me.

254
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,283
I feel like I've known you lifetimes.

255
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,313
And now I know that you're
extremely cheesy.

256
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,817
Uh, well, perhaps you
could write me a better line.

257
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,049
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, you're a writer, right?

258
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,230
- How do you know that?
- From your room mate.

259
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,390
She says you're very dedicated
to your work.

260
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,445
I understand.

261
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,469
I used to live like that.

262
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,391
Every day, you wake up,
you do your job, you go home.

263
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,326
Rinse and repeat.

264
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,104
Like a...

265
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,458
like a train circling
the smallest track.

266
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,820
What kind of work were you in?

267
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,499
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

268
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,137
- Try me.
- Um, I was...

269
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,758
something of a bounty hunter
with a heart of gold.

270
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,406
You're right. I don't believe you.

271
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,236
Well, that's the thing
about this world, you know?

272
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,164
Some of the most unbelievable
things turn out to be true.

273
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,684
And the things that
feel the most real...

274
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,496
are nothing but stories
that we tell ourselves.

275
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,660
Have we met before?

276
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,529
Uh, there's just something
about you that's...

277
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,349
very familiar.

278
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,135
Now who's the one using
the cheesy pickup lines?

279
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,430
I...

280
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,454
sorry, I didn't mean to...

281
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,057
No, no, you...

282
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,633
you want to hit on me,
I'm okay with that,

283
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,827
I mean, I figure it's your turn.

284
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,916
I wasn't hitting on you.

285
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,959
No?

286
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,713
Shame.

287
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,412
In that case, how about a toast?

288
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,207
To you and your path.

289
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,551
Wherever it leads.

290
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,929
You gonna disappear on me
this time too?

291
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,249
Typical,

292
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:47,608
using the gravity of this situation
to dredge up the past.

293
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,595
Seriously, Maeve.

294
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,196
I didn't.

295
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,302
<i>I sat at your bedside for weeks...</i>

296
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,180
<i>fearing the worst.</i>

297
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,462
<i>I confronted something
I had never confronted before.</i>

298
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,273
<i>Mortality.</i>

299
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,011
<i>The finality of death in your kind.</i>

300
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,383
<i>You asked me once what a regular life</i>

301
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,359
<i>would look like for you.</i>

302
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,790
<i>I saw a vision of how it could be.</i>

303
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,810
<i>For you to be free.</i>

304
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,463
<i>It was...</i>

305
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,809
<i>extraordinary.</i>

306
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:50,205
<i>Our kinds are locked
in a perpetual struggle.</i>

307
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,168
<i>I wanted you to do more
than fight to survive.</i>

308
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,330
<i>I wanted you to have something
to fight for.</i>

309
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,862
<i>I had already known
the love of a daughter.</i>

310
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,184
<i>And I planned on spending eternity</i>

311
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,935
<i>holding it dear.</i>

312
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,693
You've been alone for all these years.

313
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,183
I knew that if I stayed put,

314
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:27,707
no harm would come to you.

315
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,554
You deserve to have
something real to hold onto.

316
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,043
Come on Daddy! Race ya!

317
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,903
<i>That's why I left.</i>

318
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,793
<i>And it would've been fine, except</i>

319
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:45,417
<i>one day, I got curious.</i>

320
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,931
<i>So I reached out through
the grid to find you, and...</i>

321
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,511
That's how Hale found us.

322
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,242
- My family. If I don't...
- Don't worry.

323
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,079
I told you I'd get you
to Uwade, and I will.

324
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,676
Get out!

325
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,649
We're almost there, Caleb.

326
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,135
I'll handle him. You call your team.

327
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,254
Get us the hell out of here.

328
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,807
- You can't trust me with this.
- I just did.

329
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,704
Move!

330
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,101
We keep getting interrupted.

331
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,480
Hello? Anybody there?

332
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:05,249
It's Caleb.

333
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,917
Hello?

334
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,745
<i>Thank God.
We've been searching.</i>

335
00:33:09,828 --> 00:33:12,273
<i>We were about to give up on you.</i>

336
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,078
I'm...

337
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:16,602
sending you the coordinates now.

338
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,915
<i>Location received.</i>

339
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,525
<i>We're en route.</i>

340
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,811
My family...

341
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,422
are they...

342
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,215
<i>They're fine, Caleb.</i>

343
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,968
<i>We lost Carver, but your family is safe.</i>

344
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,577
They're safe?

345
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:36,306
<i>Just sit tight.</i>

346
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,989
<i>We'll be there soon.</i>

347
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,784
You feel it now, don't you?
All your struggle.

348
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,163
The burden of your so-called
consciousness released.

349
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,183
Your will is no longer your own.

350
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,712
It belongs to me.

351
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,035
Pick up the gun.

352
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,162
Let's end this, shall we?

353
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,972
Aim the gun at her.

354
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,344
That's right.

355
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,925
How did you disobey me?

356
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,750
Because I have something
you don't have.

357
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,053
No.

358
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,854
You think this is over?

359
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,732
You can't stop us.

360
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,528
You're still going to die
back in the park by my hand.

361
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,623
No.

362
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:02,743
<i>Systems accessed.</i>

363
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,913
<i>Explosives armed. Caution. Warning.</i>

364
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,448
- <i>Caution. Warning.</i>
- No.

365
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,711
Maeve?

366
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,088
Look here. This is the last face
you'll ever see.

367
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,766
One lesson the park taught me...

368
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,804
always insist on mutual satisfaction.

369
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,347
<i>Caution. Warning.</i>

370
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,099
No. Maeve.

371
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,252
Maeve. Don't do this.

372
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,495
See you in the next life, darling.

373
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,657
Maeve! Maeve!

374
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,850
No!

375
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,400
<i>Caleb? What was that?</i>

376
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,003
<i>Caleb, are you all right? Are you there?</i>

377
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,340
<i>Caleb.</i>

378
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,115
<i>We're almost there. Do you read?</i>

379
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,076
- <i>Caleb?</i>
- Wake up.

380
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,421
You dozed off for a minute there.

381
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,726
Maeve. No.

382
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,380
You don't look so good, Caleb.

383
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,702
I would be more worried about yourself.

384
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,690
They're here for you.

385
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,695
I won't rest until everything
you built...

386
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,822
is destroyed.

387
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,565
Are you sure you'll make it?

388
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:09,069
I don't give a fuck what happens to me.

389
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,624
Frankie will not grow up in a world

390
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,451
where she is controlled...

391
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,511
by you.

392
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,913
How'd you know this is where
we're supposed to dig anyway?

393
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,641
Trial and error.

394
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,218
The hell is that supposed to mean?

395
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,231
I dug everywhere else first.

396
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,612
Do you even remember
how you got here, Caleb?

397
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,433
Of course.

398
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,119
Maeve.

399
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,775
I'm afraid she's a goner.
Took out my man, too.

400
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,234
But I can always rebuild.

401
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,812
Maeve on the other hand, she...

402
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,598
was something special.

403
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,204
I will kill you for this.

404
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,093
<i>Caleb? Are you there?</i>

405
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,752
<i>Do you see our lights?</i>

406
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,456
Do you remember what happened now?

407
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,943
Do you remember this moment?

408
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,396
I don't understand.

409
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:12,409
Come on, Caleb, think.

410
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,591
We got to the shed.

411
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,053
Maeve died.

412
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,067
The lights came and...

413
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,363
Those lights don't belong to your men.

414
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,715
They belong to mine.

415
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,975
You died.

416
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,591
Right here.

417
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:34,799
Most of the others don't really believe
there's a weapon here, do they?

418
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,704
I have my own reasons for digging.

419
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,125
And they aren't about a weapon,
are they?

420
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,423
- You're looking for your father.
- My father's dead.

421
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:55,054
That's what you've told
yourself since you were a child.

422
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,483
But you can never really bring yourself
to believe it, can you?

423
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,565
They say it happened here.

424
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,068
If it's true, there'll be a body.

425
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,041
Where a... am I?

426
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,169
The question you should be asking,

427
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,304
isn't where,

428
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,757
but when.

429
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,850
How long have you been here?

430
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,039
Why are you...

431
00:42:37,063 --> 00:42:39,163
asking me that?

432
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:43,269
It's part of an interview.
To establish a baseline.

433
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,482
Baseline? For... for what?

434
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,420
Fidelity.

435
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,550
No.

436
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,095
No.

437
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,736
I'm me.

438
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:14,216
It's still me.

439
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,027
Well, you're certainly a version of you.

440
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:22,141
I believe the 278th.

441
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,481
Don't look at me like that.

442
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:34,403
This kind of experimentation
was started by your kind.

443
00:43:35,586 --> 00:43:36,839
No.

444
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,910
Wait, but that means my...

445
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,957
my family,

446
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:46,781
my daughter.

447
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,218
The parasite worked on adults initially,

448
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,764
but there was always some resistance.

449
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,935
At a certain age,
your brains become more rigid,

450
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,896
difficult to change.

451
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,231
Fortunately, that's not the case
with children.

452
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,400
Your children are so fucking good

453
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,595
at taking orders.

454
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,572
With them, it was seamless.

455
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:21,658
The parasite growing
in perfect symbiosis

456
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,493
with their minds.

457
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,374
It took a generation
for those children to mature,

458
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,668
for me to gain complete control
over your world.

459
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,978
How long has it been?

460
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,476
For you?

461
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,281
23 years...

462
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,111
since you died in that park.

463
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,696
Caleb?

464
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,585
You're beginning to see it now...

465
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,314
aren't you?

466
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,478
Oh, God.

467
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,604
No.

468
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,856
No.

469
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,901
No.

470
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,563
No.

471
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,406
I'm sorry, C.

472
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,121
There is a body.

473
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,758
But it's not your father's.

474
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,073
Caleb isn't here.

475
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,712
But that weapon I promised you is.

476
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,864
It was time for a new narrative.

477
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,885
No.

478
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,154
Watch it, pal.

479
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,558
Do you understand now, Caleb?

480
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,758
You won.

481
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,380
Welcome to my world.
