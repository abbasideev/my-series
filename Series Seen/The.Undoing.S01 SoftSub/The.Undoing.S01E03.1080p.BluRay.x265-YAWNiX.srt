<i>My name is Grace Fraser.</i>

15
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,990
My husband has just broken in.

16
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,367
He's a fugitive. He's wanted for murder.

17
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,720
- I didn't do it.
- His name is Jonathan Fraser.

18
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:02,708
I'm at 361 Beachway, Beachway Drive,
and I'm fucking terrified.

19
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,002
I need you to get here quickly.

20
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:06,919
Please.

21
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,448
Mm.

22
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:36,134
So, he didn't call first.
He just showed up.

23
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:38,470
That's right.

24
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:42,307
And you called 911 approximately
five minutes after he arrived.

25
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:43,433
- Yes.
- Correct?

26
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:45,477
More or less.

27
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:48,563
Is there a reason you're not believing me?

28
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:52,484
'Cause that's what it feels like right now.
You don't believe me.

29
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,488
You said he grabbed you by the throat?

30
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,949
He put his left hand over my mouth.

31
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,494
He put his right hand
behind the back of my neck.

32
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,413
- Okay.
- And...

33
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:08,083
- It's okay. I'll take it from here. Go.
- All right. Yeah. Yep. Yep.

34
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:19,761
Were you afraid?

35
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,269
I was terrified.

36
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,771
Because you thought
that he might harm you?

37
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:30,897
I don't...

38
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,567
- I mean, I wouldn't rule it out.
- Kill you?

39
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,861
God, why would you be asking me
these questions?

40
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:38,697
- Why are you asking me this?
- We're investigating a crime.

41
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:41,866
He assaulted you.

42
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,661
I'm just trying to assess
the severity of the assault.

43
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,371
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,958
The DNA results came back.

45
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:55,422
- And?
- The daughter is his.

46
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:13,147
Okay.

47
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,057
- Last name?
- Fraser.

48
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:31,935
- Last name?
- Lopez.

49
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,105
- Last name?
- Hernandez.

50
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,108
Last name?

51
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:42,654
<i>Things are very fluid,
but what we can confirm is that Dr. Fraser</i>

52
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,699
<i>is scheduled to be arraigned
at the New York County Supreme Court.</i>

53
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:48,910
<i>We are also now learning
that the victim was an artist</i>

54
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:53,039
<i>and that her sculpting hammer was
discovered to be missing from her studio.</i>

55
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:56,626
<i>Police are now considering this
as the possible murder weapon.</i>

56
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,713
<i>You'll remember that Elena Alves
was found bludgeoned to death,</i>

57
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,774
<i>- having been found there by her own...</i>
- Henry.

58
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,633
Can you turn that off, please?

59
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,014
- Henry, turn it off.
- What?

60
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,308
Turn it off! Please.

61
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:18,440
- God.
- Does he have a lawyer?

62
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:24,529
I'm hearing he has a public defender.

63
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,034
Probably hasn't got much money.
He hasn't been working.

64
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,706
- What about you, money-wise?
- I'm fine.

65
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,045
He did drain our bank account some, but...

66
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:21,002
<i>Hey.
So, what's happening?</i>

67
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:24,130
He'll be charged, they'll enter a plea,
and it'll be over.

68
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:25,340
It'll all go pretty quickly.

69
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,384
Do you know who his attorney is?

70
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:31,304
No, I do not. My grapevine is
a bit limited on the criminal side.

71
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:33,515
But, Grace, I don't know
what you've been reading.

72
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:36,434
I don't know what you've seen,
but I am telling you,

73
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:39,020
you need to hire your own attorney.

74
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:40,939
The prospect of you knowing,

75
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,233
- possibly aiding and abetting...
<i>- What?</i>

76
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:44,651
Harboring a fugitive!

77
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,112
I didn't do that. I'm not...

78
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,780
<i>Well, even so,
this is what they do.</i>

79
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,157
<i>The police will want
to secure your cooperation.</i>

80
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:53,618
<i>Leverage is leverage.
I'm telling you.</i>

81
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm here. I will call you
on the other side, okay?

82
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,206
Okay.

83
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,510
Jesus.

84
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,105
- Hey.
<i>- Hi. It's a madhouse.</i>

85
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:24,733
I can't see over there. It's too... Oh.

86
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:28,069
Oh. He's got "The Badger."

87
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,071
<i>- Who?</i>
- For his attorney.

88
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,740
Robert Adelman. He's a public defender.

89
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:35,702
He's good, but he's not great.
He just chews and gnaws.

90
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,203
They call him "The Badger."

91
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,539
Catherine Stamper's prosecuting.
We actually...

92
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:42,292
We interned together for a hot minute.

93
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,003
She's a heavy hitter.
She's here in person for the arraignment.

94
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,755
It means they're not messing around.

95
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:48,714
Oh, Jesus.

96
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:51,635
Her husband is death-glaring me.
You'd think I killed her.

97
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,137
<i>- Who's he with?</i>
- I don't know.

98
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,889
With his mother or something.

99
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:59,267
What? Okay.
No, I have to get off the phone.

100
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:00,852
Okay.

101
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,398
<i>All rise!</i>

102
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:09,319
The criminal court of the city of New York
is now in session.

103
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:12,447
The Honorable Layla Scott presiding.

104
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,073
Please be seated.

105
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:19,370
I have allowed television cameras
into this room for today only.

106
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:21,539
I am making a public interest exception,

107
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:25,293
pursuant to my authority
under local civil rule 1 point 8.

108
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:29,088
However... However,
this courtroom will not become a circus.

109
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:32,050
I don't want to see
anybody talking on phones,

110
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,552
Snapchatting, Instagramming,

111
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,180
or any of the other social media nonsense.

112
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,974
We're going to call the case,
bring in the defendant,

113
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:42,393
arraign him in accordance
with the duly-promulgated rules

114
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:44,229
of procedure of this courtroom.

115
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,397
I hope I have made myself
abundantly clear.

116
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:47,439
Go ahead.

117
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,403
Docket number 62333.

118
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,990
<i>The People of the State of New York
v. Jonathan Fraser.</i>

119
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:58,117
Count one, murder in the first degree.

120
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,161
Count two, aggravated rape.

121
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,497
Robert Adelman
for the defendant, Your Honor.

122
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,667
At this time,
we'll waive reading of the charges

123
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,754
and enter a plea of not guilty
for all charges. We also ask...

124
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,006
Catherine Stamper for the people,
Your Honor.

125
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,842
We oppose bail.

126
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:16,052
This was a heinous and violent crime...

127
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,972
My client has
long-standing roots in the community...

128
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:21,534
The defendant has already
demonstrated himself to be a flight risk.

129
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:23,994
- Cures cancer, no record.
- He fled the jurisdiction.

130
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,520
Not so much as a parking ticket.

131
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,273
Well, murder and rape.
He hit the ground running.

132
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:31,234
Objection. Ask for sanctions.

133
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,906
Ten million bond, 2 million cash.

134
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,367
Take the defendant back into custody.

135
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,536
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

136
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,497
- Next case.
- Docket number 62432.

137
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,750
<i>People of the State of New York
v. Matthew Tinker.</i>

138
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,602
He looked scared.

139
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,521
Dad.

140
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:58,821
Move it!

141
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,824
Straight ahead. Let's go!

142
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:04,661
Yo, murder man!

143
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,540
Yeah, hey. I'm gonna fuck you up!

144
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,428
How we doing?

145
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,766
- It's been nearly a week, so...
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

146
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:28,810
First things first.

147
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,397
Don't be talking to nobody in here.

148
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,067
The franchise is populated with reprobates
looking to improve their plight.

149
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,404
Any information they can glean from you
might reap dividends.

150
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,407
- And not to you.
- Well, I would only tell them I'm innocent.

151
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,535
Innocent is good. Saying nothing is better.

152
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:50,873
So, can you get me out of here?

153
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,126
With money for bail, yes.

154
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,045
With... With my persuasive skills...

155
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,213
more of a challenge.

156
00:13:58,214 --> 00:13:59,799
Now, you own your own home?

157
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,385
The one in the fancy building
I seen on the news?

158
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,387
I own it jointly with my wife.

159
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:06,597
Ah.

160
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,769
I am innocent.

161
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:17,817
Do you care?

162
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,611
Not really.

163
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:25,742
Truth be told, I prefer my clients guilty.
Takes the pressure off.

164
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:30,830
I should say,
having read the police report,

165
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,708
I would be very surprised
if you were innocent.

166
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,336
In fact, it'd be difficult for an innocent man
to present more guilty.

167
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,464
Unless, of course, he was stupid, which...

168
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:42,508
I'm figuring you're not
since you cure cancer and all.

169
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,637
Back to me, please.

170
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,603
You know, I should say up front
that in my experience,

171
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,396
doctors tend to be assholes.

172
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:59,484
The reason they tend to be assholes is
because they get to be.

173
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,277
They're doctors.

174
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,362
My point is...

175
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,783
you don't get to be one anymore.

176
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:20,588
I would be very grateful
if you could arrange for me to see my wife.

177
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,664
Hey.

178
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:56,916
Dr. Fraser.

179
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,794
Thanks for coming.
I'm Robert. Robert Adelman.

180
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,546
- Nice to meet you.
- Please.

181
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:05,883
This all must be a terrible hardship
for you and all, so...

182
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,885
My sympathies on that.

183
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,138
Hi. Can I get you anything?

184
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:12,765
Um... No. I'm fine. Thank you.

185
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,644
Your husband seems

186
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:20,982
pretty convinced that you would vouch
for his innocence.

187
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:23,609
I won't.

188
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,362
I can't.

189
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:30,491
Oh, okay, then.

190
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:38,249
You strike me as a wife suffering from PTB.

191
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:40,710
Excuse me?

192
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,838
Post-Traumatic Betrayal.

193
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,340
- I kind of coined it myself.
- Yes.

194
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:47,925
- So, it's not a real disorder.
- No.

195
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:50,428
It means a fucked-over person,

196
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,638
in the immediate aftermath
of being fucked over,

197
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:56,267
often believes the fucker-overer
to be capable of anything.

198
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,894
Including murder.

199
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:00,563
So, my question to you,

200
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,441
before you got wind
of the fact that he was unfaithful,

201
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,776
your pre-fucked-over impression of him.

202
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,740
Did he strike you
as a person capable of committing

203
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:12,408
this kind of mayhem?

204
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:15,119
If he did, do you think
I'd be married to him?

205
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:18,372
My specialty is reading people.

206
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:20,958
It's the best tool in my kit. I just...

207
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,421
Getting a feel for a person.

208
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,177
I'm thinking
your husband is a bit of a dick.

209
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,638
But not a killer.

210
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,975
And what do you think?

211
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:41,938
I don't know what I think.

212
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:06,337
<i>I wouldn't go anywhere
near the son of a bitch.</i>

213
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,634
- Don't tell me you're considering it.
- I feel like I owe it to Henry.

214
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,846
To allow for his father
to be innocent, don't I?

215
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,348
No, you do not.

216
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,559
I just need to get a semblance of the truth.

217
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:23,813
What makes you think
you will get the truth from him?

218
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:48,962
Hey.

219
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:58,723
You think he did it, don't you?

220
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,274
No, baby.

221
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,110
No, no.

222
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:13,779
No.

223
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,077
No. Henry, Henry.

224
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,832
It'll be all right, Henry.

225
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,465
She's coming out.

226
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,926
Did you know? Did you know...?

227
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,014
Is he guilty?

228
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,267
How do you feel
about the betrayal?

229
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:45,561
Did he do it?

230
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:50,251
<i>Move it! Let's go!</i>

231
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:53,504
Move it. Let's go!

232
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,340
Move it!

233
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:42,011
Thanks for coming.

234
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,265
How's Henry?

235
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:50,478
Um...

236
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,024
How do you think he might be?

237
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,157
Look, I don't know what the purpose
of this conversation is,

238
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,034
but you wanted me to come and I'm here.

239
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,786
Well, it's not to convince you
that I'm a good husband.

240
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,080
Or a good father.

241
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,794
You didn't just do this to me.
You did this to your son.

242
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,053
You have a daughter.

243
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,140
You have a fucking daughter.

244
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,187
Fuck.

245
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,197
Look, I...

246
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:46,534
I spoke about Elena,

247
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:49,370
uh, being obsessed with me. Yeah?

248
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,453
She was.

249
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,456
She was not a well person.

250
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:54,875
Grace, you have to help me.

251
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,879
The whole world thinks I did this.

252
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:03,050
My only chance is for people
who know me to come forward.

253
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,929
To help you? You actually think
I'm gonna help you?

254
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,806
You know my heart. You know my heart.

255
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,560
I understand that you can
no longer trust me to be

256
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,395
the man you thought I was. I get that.

257
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,231
But you certainly know
that I would never take a human life.

258
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,524
You know that.

259
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,863
I don't know anything.

260
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:28,909
My heart wouldn't allow it.
Nor would my ego. You know...

261
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,079
I didn't...

262
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,332
I didn't do it.

263
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:40,254
Whatever my faults
and my transgressions...

264
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,381
My love for you...

265
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,676
For Henry...

266
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,973
Can you bring him? Please, bring him.

267
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,269
Please, Grace.

268
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,646
He's gotta hear from me.

269
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,441
He needs that.

270
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,164
<i>Sideways.</i>

271
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,458
<i>Perfect. And back again.</i>

272
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,585
<i>Very good.</i>

273
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:24,256
Which other animals have funny walks?
The batfish, body like a tennis racket.

274
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,693
<i>They use their flap-like fins
for walking slowly on the sea bed.</i>

275
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:27,760
So, it's this...

276
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:31,972
Yeah. Perfect.

277
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,282
Thank you.

278
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,661
Thank you. Thank you.

279
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,205
I appreciate it.

280
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,541
- I appreciate you taking the time.
- I'm really not comfortable with this.

281
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,295
- No, I understand.
- I signed a confidentiality agreement,

282
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:05,964
and, uh, I'm risking my job
even talking to you.

283
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,091
You're...

284
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:11,095
You're a good friend to him.
You are. You were.

285
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,889
If you're expecting me
to actually help him at this point,

286
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,725
- that after everything that just...
- No. I would never expect that.

287
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:19,061
If... If he were guilty.

288
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,813
- Which he is.
- And if he's not?

289
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,315
Come on, Grace.

290
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:26,610
He's not who we thought he was.
I think we can at least acknowledge that.

291
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:29,571
What do you know about the victim?
Elena Alves?

292
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,120
I know she had a son.

293
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:39,123
A 7-year-old boy with a Wilms' tumor.

294
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:41,750
Jonathan was his doctor.

295
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:47,297
They weren't discreet.
They weren't even trying to be.

296
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,508
He got warnings. Didn't seem to matter.

297
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:53,595
He wanted her, and he was willing
to risk everything.

298
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,847
Which he clearly did.

299
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,766
Well, he says that she wasn't well.

300
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,602
He says that she was obsessed with him
and that she was...

301
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,644
I wouldn't know.

302
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,567
If she was
the obsessive-compulsive type...

303
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,149
- Yeah, then what?
- I admit,

304
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,025
- I'm clutching at straws here.
- Grace,

305
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,194
- Jonathan cultivated it.
- Please.

306
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,865
People becoming obsessed with him?
He... He fed off that.

307
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,200
His patients loved him.
The parents, of course.

308
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,953
The parents worshiped him.
He was saving their children.

309
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:22,082
He thrived on being the center
of intense emotion,

310
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,961
in a very narcissistic and unhealthy way.

311
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,130
It's like he never got
the God-complex memo.

312
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:31,759
In fact, actually, sometimes I think
it wasn't even about the patient.

313
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,427
It was about the emotion coming at him.

314
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,138
He cared about his patients. He did.

315
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,973
- I saw it.
- Yeah. Maybe.

316
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:41,059
- I did. He cried for them. He would...
- Yeah. Maybe.

317
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,145
They say psychopaths can't work
in a hospital.

318
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,606
Psychopaths? He's not a psychopath.

319
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,056
Hey.

320
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,852
Did you see Jonathan?

321
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,854
- Yeah.
- How was it?

322
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,774
- I'll tell you later.
- Yeah, of course. Sorry.

323
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,586
It's called hero worship.

324
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:51,672
Excuse me?

325
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,134
People falling in love with their saviors.

326
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,721
It's mostly a woman who is affected and...

327
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,307
the objects of the delusion are doctors.

328
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,601
Firefighters. Policemen.

329
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,273
It's also called rescue romance syndrome.

330
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:12,901
- Sounds like a load of crap.
- Well, it isn't.

331
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:14,903
What has it got to do with anything?

332
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:18,740
She fell in love with the doctor
who saved her kid's life.

333
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:20,909
What has that got to do
with him killing her?

334
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,829
According to Jonathan,
she took it to extremes.

335
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:24,912
And?

336
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,334
Crazy people do crazy things.

337
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:32,421
Are you serious?

338
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:37,467
Are you now believing
that Jonathan is innocent?

339
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,929
I'm just open to the idea.

340
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:48,562
And are you open to the idea of you
and Jonathan getting back together?

341
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:55,027
No. Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous. It's your move.

342
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,110
Hmm.

343
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,496
He came to me for money.

344
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,791
Excuse me?

345
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,297
He said you were worried
about paying for Reardon this year.

346
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,382
That you thought
you might have to take Henry out.

347
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,593
- That's not true.
- Yeah, I know.

348
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:24,932
I told him it would not be in Reardon's
best economic interest to lose Henry.

349
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,559
And he said, yeah, but you were worried
about finances overall

350
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,145
and that you would never come
to speak to me about it.

351
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,563
And I knew that to be true,

352
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,650
so that when he asked me
not to say anything to you...

353
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:45,994
How much did you give him?

354
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,585
Five hundred thousand dollars.

355
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:59,633
But I thought I was helping you and Henry.

356
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,719
I mean, I know how private you are, Grace.

357
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,472
I knew that you would not come to me.

358
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:08,350
I mean, I was actually grateful
to that son of a bitch.

359
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,728
I even thanked him
for giving me the opportunity to...

360
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:16,858
I'm...

361
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,406
I am so sorry.

362
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:25,450
I...

363
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,828
I should have told you.

364
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,749
I mean, if I had,

365
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,211
maybe that woman would be alive today.

366
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:48,682
God...

367
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,231
Oh, dear.

368
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,343
This isn't gonna be easy.

369
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:08,804
You keep saying that.

370
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,597
- Hey. Come on...
- Mom.

371
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,557
- Hey, put that down.
- Mom. Mom!

372
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:15,267
Mom.

373
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,144
I'll be fine.

374
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:19,355
Okay?

375
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,503
- Name?
- Henry Fraser.

376
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,339
- Name?
- Grace Fraser.

377
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:45,674
Over there.

378
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,051
Name?

379
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,929
Out and around the corner. Name?

380
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,391
Over there.

381
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,226
Name?

382
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:58,853
Name?

383
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:04,234
Hey. Hey, hey.
No touching. Let's go.

384
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,528
Bye, baby.

385
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,574
Henry, you all right?

386
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:12,868
Yeah.

387
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:14,535
Yeah.

388
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,115
Well...

389
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,119
another fine mess I've gotten you into.

390
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:00,998
Yeah.

391
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,339
- How are you? How's school?
- Fine.

392
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,925
Violin? Rosenbaum?

393
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,219
What's the latest on him?

394
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,183
- Did you kill her?
- No.

395
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:22,854
You were fucking her.

396
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,066
Okay.

397
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,026
Well, it's straight to the net
with that one.

398
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,028
- Were you?
- Uh...

399
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,199
Yeah. We were romantically involved. Yeah.

400
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,202
So, you don't love Mom anymore.

401
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,578
Yeah, of course I do.

402
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,707
I love her and you more than anything.

403
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,085
And I always will.

404
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,170
I fucked up.

405
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:50,340
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

406
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,844
I, um, allowed myself to be persuaded

407
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,138
that a person desperately needed me

408
00:34:57,222 --> 00:35:01,226
because her child was very sick
and I could help him recover.

409
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:06,356
And I let that be a reason
to lose my strength of character.

410
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,986
I was very sorry for her,
and I think that, uh...

411
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:16,700
My wanting to help overwhelmed me, so...

412
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,953
And then, after everything,

413
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:23,957
instead of being grateful
for everything I'd done

414
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,542
for her and for her son,

415
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,961
she became unsound.

416
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:29,796
Threatening.

417
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,467
It got to the point where I felt
she wanted to destroy us,

418
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,721
as a family,
so I went to confront her about that.

419
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,515
And that's it.

420
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,226
That's all I did.

421
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:48,898
Why did you run,

422
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:50,734
if you're innocent?

423
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,444
Well, I ran because I...

424
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,740
I was scared. I knew how it looked.

425
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,908
And I was selfish.

426
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,660
In that moment, I was completely selfish.

427
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:03,830
I thought only about myself
and what might happen to me.

428
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:06,958
And then, uh...

429
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,212
I thought about you. Mom.

430
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:15,342
So, I came back,
which may have been selfish again.

431
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,761
But, you see, I wanted my family back.

432
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,639
We're never gonna be a family again.

433
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,977
Well, I desperately hope we will be.

434
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,563
Come here. Come here.

435
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,359
Hey. No touching.

436
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:33,693
Let's go.

437
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,737
It's okay.

438
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,533
- All right.
- Come on, Henry.

439
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,542
- Mom. Please.
- Hey.

440
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,465
Hey. Hey.

441
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,006
Hi.

442
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,720
You mentioned Haley Fitzgerald.

443
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,477
- For you?
- For him.

444
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,650
There is a certain stigma attached
to a public defender.

445
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,156
You have always had an unlimited capacity

446
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,492
to see the humanity in a person.

447
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,536
To have an affair,

448
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:08,455
that's human.

449
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:13,626
To strike at someone
in an act of passion or anger,

450
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,295
that's human.

451
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,007
But to bludgeon someone to death

452
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,760
and keep on bludgeoning them
long after they are dead,

453
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:25,263
that is a monster, Grace.

454
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,098
That is a monster.

455
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,766
He's not that monster.

456
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,060
- Hmm.
- He's...

457
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:35,106
He can't be.

458
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:37,524
He...

459
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,614
He's not that monster.

460
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:46,534
Dad, he's not.

461
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:04,427
I'll arrange for you to meet
with Haley Fitzgerald.

462
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:16,064
Take the right hand.

463
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,275
Come on.

464
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,403
It makes me miss Mom.

465
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,448
Please.

466
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,289
Stop.

467
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,312
Lots of shit on you on the Google.

468
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:59,399
You got the guards, everybody talking.

469
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,318
Hey, what's it like to be so famous?

470
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:07,949
Come on.

471
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:10,410
You probably got book deals
and shit, right?

472
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:13,288
Hey, if I can get my hands on a pen,

473
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,499
you think you can sign some shit for me?

474
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,209
Take your fucking hand off my...

475
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,669
Take my fucking hand off you?

476
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,754
You gonna be an asshole
about things now?

477
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:23,506
Take your fucking hands off me!

478
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,530
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

479
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,003
Haley Fitzgerald.

480
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,799
Grace Fraser.

481
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:50,635
- Thank you for seeing me.
- It's my pleasure.

482
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,188
Please take a seat.

483
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,899
I've read the police reports.

484
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,152
I'm curious as to why you'd want
to help this man.

485
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,907
Well, for my son,
should his father be innocent.

486
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,368
And should he be guilty,

487
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:17,829
thinking of your son,

488
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:20,832
which side do you want to err on?

489
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:25,670
If you would just take a look at the case...

490
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:26,753
I have.

491
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:29,674
The evidence isn't good.

492
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,093
Add to that, he's got a truth problem.

493
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:36,222
Are you saying that, um,
the case can't be won?

494
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,015
I'm not saying that at all.

495
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:41,978
I never underestimate
the state's ability to fuck things up.

496
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:45,314
I can win almost any case, Grace.

497
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:48,985
What I cannot do is wave a wand
and make everything better.

498
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:54,615
If he killed her,
I can't make him innocent.

499
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:58,828
- I can't make him faithful.
- I know that.

500
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:00,204
- Do you?
- Yes.

501
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:03,791
Many clients think I can undo everything.

502
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,501
Wipe the slate clean.

503
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:08,171
You sound like me talking to my patients.

504
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,298
I understand that you're
a very good therapist.

505
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,925
You've probably fixed
more than a few marriages.

506
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:14,469
That's not my skill set.

507
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:18,181
People hire me to create muck.

508
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:24,395
Muck up the state's case,
so they can't meet their burden.

509
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:29,150
That's what I can give you
and your husband.

510
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:32,570
Muck.

511
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:42,955
Mr. Reinhart?

512
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:49,128
Detective Joe Mendoza. NYPD.

513
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,300
I'm sure you are, dear boy.

514
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,180
I got a feeling
your daughter is hiding something.

515
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:05,645
Whether she's withholding,
tampering with...

516
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:08,648
or falsifying evidence,

517
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:11,192
for all we know,

518
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:14,111
she's an accomplice.

519
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,156
You're her father.

520
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,160
Could use some good advice.

521
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:23,411
A voice of reason.

522
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,289
Or better, I think,

523
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:29,126
that I be the voice of reason for you,
detective.

524
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,671
My daughter has neither committed a crime,

525
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:33,506
nor obstructed justice.

526
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:36,092
I recognize that in the particular,

527
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:39,637
justice is open
to subjective interpretation,

528
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,141
and I would not deem to presume
what your version of it is.

529
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:47,478
Mine is very specific.

530
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:50,857
And if you'd like to know what it is,

531
00:44:51,983 --> 00:44:53,109
get a warrant.

532
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,032
Shit. Fuck. Watch out.

533
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,328
Ms. Fraser.

534
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:46,871
My name's Fernando Alves.

535
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:48,873
And I'm sorry to intrude.

536
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,666
Can we talk?

537
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:56,631
No.

538
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,842
No, that's not a good idea.

539
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:01,636
Why not?

540
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:07,892
Because it's not a good time, Mr. Alves.

541
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:10,937
Your husband killed my wife.
When would be a good time?

542
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:19,153
I've been informed
you've been asking about her.

543
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:22,073
I was told she wasn't well.

544
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:26,953
If you have any questions, who better
to answer them than her husband?

545
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:31,082
Unless maybe yours.

546
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,503
Are you trying to intimidate me, Mr. Alves?

547
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:41,467
- My wife has been murdered.
- Yes.

548
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,261
And the idea
of her character being attacked...

549
00:46:44,345 --> 00:46:46,305
I'm very sorry for your loss, sir.

550
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:48,349
I cannot fathom your grief.

551
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:52,228
But I also find it very hard to believe
that my husband could have taken her life.

552
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:57,108
Because he was such a fine person.

553
00:46:58,901 --> 00:46:59,901
Huh?

554
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:03,239
My son had cancer.

555
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:05,658
I put him into your husband's care.

556
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,243
He fucked my wife.

557
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:10,913
What kind of doctor does that?

558
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:13,708
What kind of mother ends up
fucking her child's oncologist?

559
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,960
I'm under a lot of pressure right now.

560
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,588
And I've reached the point
where I'm not taking shit from anyone.

561
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:24,552
Mr. Alves, were there other men?

562
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:28,973
Were there other men?

563
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:31,392
- Were there?
- No.

564
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,021
No, there were no other men.

565
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:37,940
Was your wife being treated
for psychological disorders?

566
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:39,275
None of your fucking business.

567
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,028
My son's father has been charged
with murder.

568
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:45,406
So, whatever secrets your wife had,
whatever secrets you have...

569
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:49,910
Whatever secrets you continue
to harbor for her,

570
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:51,495
it's my business.

571
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:52,997
I will make it my business.

572
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,542
Be very careful, Dr. Fraser.

573
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:03,776
<i>Did he threaten you?</i>

574
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:09,198
Not directly but he has been following me.

575
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:12,660
Following you?

576
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:14,537
Stalking me.

577
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,582
All right, so you're here
to file a complaint.

578
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:24,755
I'm here to ascertain exactly
what was Fernando Alves's alibi.

579
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,675
- It's not something we can disclose.
- And why is that?

580
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:29,342
Dr. Fraser...

581
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,429
Have you categorically ruled this man out
as a suspect?

582
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:37,643
Have you?
I mean, he suffers from anger issues.

583
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:40,688
- I could detect that in the first meet.
- Yeah, he's in shock.

584
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:43,858
It would be understandable
if he was angry, don't you think?

585
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:47,945
His wife cheated on him,
then she was murdered.

586
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,991
Those are the kind of things
that piss husbands off.

587
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:54,117
He had motive.

588
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:55,536
He had opportunity.

589
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:56,954
He had access.

590
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,581
He's hiding something.

591
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:01,250
Mm-hm.

592
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:03,335
What tells you that?

593
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:09,425
Twenty-plus years
of psychological training.

594
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,052
You read his mind.

595
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:17,033
Mrs. Fraser,
we have no reason to believe

596
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,767
that Fernando Alves is a suspect.

597
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,936
Are there security cameras
from inside the building?

598
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,081
Do you have video footage
of people coming and going that night?

599
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,482
Again, we are not at liberty
to disclose that.

600
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:27,943
But you're at liberty to interrogate me?

601
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:31,280
Disclosing and weaponizing
every last informational nugget

602
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:33,115
to emotionally terrorize me?

603
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,785
You're at liberty
to approach my father? I mean...

604
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:39,914
There must be video surveillance.

605
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:43,292
Are you telling me
that my husband was the only person

606
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,419
to enter that apartment that night?

607
00:50:45,961 --> 00:50:48,422
Because if that's the case,
I want to know

608
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:51,091
because it will better enable me
to walk away from him

609
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:53,010
and never, ever look back.

610
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,346
Just... Just fucking tell me.

611
00:50:57,556 --> 00:51:00,493
All right. There were no security cameras
in the building. It's an old building.

612
00:51:00,517 --> 00:51:03,812
But on the street.
You have cameras everywhere in this city.

613
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:07,066
Yeah, there was a...

614
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:10,778
There was an active camera
a block away from the scene.

615
00:51:10,861 --> 00:51:11,861
And?

616
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,530
And?

617
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,913
What is it? What?

618
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:36,428
There was only
one image captured

619
00:51:36,512 --> 00:51:37,888
that we deemed to be relevant.

620
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:44,561
What is it?

621
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:47,272
What?

622
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,650
What is this?

623
00:51:58,659 --> 00:51:59,785
What is this?

624
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:01,453
This is you.

625
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:04,331
Near the scene of the crime

626
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:06,750
and around the time
Elena Alves was murdered.

627
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,295
I was walking. I mean, I...

628
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:11,630
- Mmm.
- This isn't...

629
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:13,590
I was walking. I take walks. I didn't...

630
00:52:13,674 --> 00:52:15,843
I didn't even know where she lived. What...?

631
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:18,721
Are you suggesting that I'm a suspect? I...

632
00:52:19,555 --> 00:52:21,807
Fernando Alves was not
near the scene that night.

633
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,435
The only people of relevance
that we can place

634
00:52:24,518 --> 00:52:26,520
in the area, around the time,

635
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:29,690
are you and your husband.

636
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:38,699
Exactly how well
did you know Elena Alves?

637
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:46,723
