Jonathan Fraser?

<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:03,959
I'm... I'm sorry, I, um...

23
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,042
Sorry.

24
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:20,642
Did you hear from Dad today at all?

25
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,519
Uh, not since this morning when he left.

26
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:25,897
You saw him before he left, at 5 a.m.?

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,816
Yeah. He came in to say goodbye.

28
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,569
Did he say anything else?

29
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:32,821
I think he just said, "Bye," and then...

30
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,657
And then he kissed me on the forehead...

31
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,453
and left, I was half asleep.

32
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:41,913
He didn't say anything else?

33
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,124
Probably that he loved me?

34
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,210
What's wrong?

35
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,713
Does he usually do that
before he leaves on a trip?

36
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,548
Say goodbye?

37
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,718
No, come into your room
while you're still asleep.

38
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,762
Doesn't he usually say goodbye
the night before?

39
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:57,845
Um...

40
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,059
Mom, you're acting strange.

41
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:05,437
Well, it's just, I haven't heard
from him all day.

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,023
I mean, I know
he has two presentations to give,

43
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,775
and he's probably busy, but I'm just...

44
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,359
Text him.

45
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:12,944
He left his phone.

46
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,364
He left his phone?

47
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,447
Mm-hm.

48
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,492
Do you know his code?

49
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,251
No.

50
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:33,924
How did he seem this morning?

51
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,468
He seemed like Dad.

52
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,347
He came into your room, he said goodbye,

53
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,099
maybe told you that he loved you,

54
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,308
and then he left?

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,603
What's going on?

56
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,687
No...

57
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,941
Nothing, honey. I'm just...

58
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:55,444
Um...

59
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,407
Nothing, it's nothing.

00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:19,195

<i>The community of the tony Upper East Side

63

66
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:34,067
<i>last night after

67
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:37,070
<i>It was her 10-year-old son
who found the victim</i>

68
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:39,906
<i>dead in her blood-strewn art studio
this morning.</i>

69
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,742
<i>Cause of death hasn't been confirmed,
but we're told</i>

70
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:45,996
<i>the victim was struck multiple times
with a blunt instrument,</i>

71
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,956
<i>suffering numerous abrasions</i>

72
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,079
<i>and lacerations to her skull.</i>

73

<i>One officer called it...</i>

74
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,670
- Hey. Mm-hm.
<i>- Are you seeing this?</i>

75
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:54,753
It's all over.

76
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,215
Mentioning Reardon, it's just...

77
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:58,925
It's beyond awful.

78
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,553
I just can't stop thinking
about that woman.

79
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,054
I know.

80
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:04,848
<i>And the children, my God.</i>

81
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:11,188
You know what? I've got Amanda
on the other line. I'll call you back. Okay.

82
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,077
Mom.

83
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:28,205
Oh, God.

84
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,288
What?

85
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,999
You scared me.

86
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,335
- Don't do that.
- I said, "Mom."

87
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,420
What's wrong with you?

88
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:40,675
I don't know where your father is.
He's not returning calls,

89
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,677
he's not returning my e-mails, nothing.

90
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,846
And that doesn't make any sense.

91
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,558
Is it possible
that he just doesn't have Internet?

92
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,147
He's at a medical conference, Henry.
He has Internet.

93
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:59,277
All right. So, he's usually terrible
about checking in, right?

94
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,905
You guys fight about it all the time.

95
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,368
And he usually has those dinners
after the conference.

96
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,119
If he's at the dinner,

97
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:10,288
but if he doesn't have his phone,

98
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:12,541
then how is he gonna
communicate with you?

99
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:14,626
- Or maybe he's on the plane.
- Henry...

100
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,672
'Cause he did say
he might get back earlier, right?

101
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:22,133
- You're right.
- Yeah.

102
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:24,803
- So, don't worry.
- He's on the plane. He's flying back to us.

103
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,822
- Don't worry. It's fine.
- Exactly what you're doing...

104
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,768
Hello? Hello?

105
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,104
Jonathan?

106
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,315
Hello?

107
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:47,742
Hung up.

108
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:52,414
Somebody tried to call him,
heard your voice...

109
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,501
thought, "Wrong number,"
and hung up. Okay?

110
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,437
<i>Sometimes I just,
I feel...</i>

111
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:17,731
<i>I feel...</i>

112
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:18,816
Overwhelmed.

113
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,943
And, um...

114
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:23,737
lost.

115
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:56,496
We are live in front of the Reardon School
where the son of victim...

116
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,169
Is this 'cause of the dead mom?

117
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,295
- Grace!
- We need to move quickly.

118
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,681
Grace!

119
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,099
- Oh, Sylvia!
- Hi.

120
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:19,352
- Hi! I know.
- Oh, my God, can you believe this?

121
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:22,230
Have you ever seen
such a clusterfuck? Sorry.

122
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,400
A caravan of concerned mothers.
God forbid they let the nanny

123
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:28,153
bring their child to school
on such a momentous occasion.

124
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,779
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:31,489
Alexis Young, Grace Fraser.

126
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:33,658
- She's a second-grade mom.
- Oh, hi.

127
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:36,411
- Hi. I've been told you're a therapist?
- Yes, I am.

128
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:39,289
I don't mean to be schnorring
free medical advice,

129
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:42,125
but my little Kimberly is already anxious
to begin with,

130
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,879
and this is our first school murder,
and I just was wondering if there were,

131
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,964
you know, any techniques
you could recommend.

132
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:51,342
- I'm gonna head in.
- Sure. I'll see you this afternoon.

133
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,094
Did you guys hear?

134
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,263
The husband suddenly
just turned himself in.

135
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,640
- What?
- Turns out that I actually met him once.

136
00:09:57,724 --> 00:09:58,933
He gave me a bad feeling.

137
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,228
- You met him, when?
- Hello, Alexis, hi.

138
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,272
Well, I didn't realize
he was a parent at first.

139
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,399
I thought, you know,
he worked for the school.

140
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,043
- Excuse me, ma'am!
- I think I told him

141
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,445
we were out of paper towels
in the ladies' room.

142
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,697
I haven't heard anything
about him turning himself in.

143
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,533
I wonder if this is connected
to what happened at the benefit.

144
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,619
What? What happened at the benefit?

145
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:20,789
Oh, come on. She had
at least ten men inhaling her.

146
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,999
- Oh, please.
- I don't think that's insignificant.

147
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,793
It might help them figure out who did it.

148
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,979
What do you mean, "who did it"?
Of course, it was the husband.

149
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,088
First he vanishes,
and now he's turned himself in.

150
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,882
It's always the fucking husband.

151
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,343
Well, he didn't vanish. That was fake news.

152
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,898
I have to go,
so I'll see you this afternoon.

153
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,661
Hey.

154
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,997
- Did Jonathan call?
- No.

155
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:12,340
Would you give Stuart a call?
Dr. Rosenfeld at the hospital.

156
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,092
See if he's heard from him?

157
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,136
I think the secrecy was a part of it.

158
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,264
Maybe even a big part.

159
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,433
But I think I was trying
to break free of myself.

160
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,185
How so?

161
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,147
I've always been so righteous.

162
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,192
Living by my good values.

163
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,862
Oppressed by them.

164
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:40,368
I think what I did was more
about me rejecting myself than Michael.

165
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:42,912
I'm timid.

166
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:44,831
I'm safe.

167
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,251
Part of me wants to be dangerous.

168
00:11:58,928 --> 00:11:59,928
Hello?

169
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:03,308
<i>You've been chosen
for a trip to the Caribbean! Press five...</i>

170
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:55,442
Stuart.

171
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:58,029
Grace!

172
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,949
Hi, um, did my assistant call you?

173
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:02,617
Ah, I'm not aware.

174
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Um...

175
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,204
Have you heard from Jonathan?

176
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,541
I haven't.

177
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,380
He went to Cleveland
and he didn't take his phone, and I...

178
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:18,257
I haven't been able to reach him,
and I'm getting worried.

179
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:19,801
What's in Cleveland?

180
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:21,927
The conference.

181
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,553
The conference?

182
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,558
Pediatric oncology
at the Cleveland Clinic.

183
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,935
Ah, uh, I knew nothing about it.

184
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,648
- I really can't talk.
- The confer...

185
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,942
What do you mean, you can't talk?
Can't talk about what?

186
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,069
- I'm really late for a meeting.
- Stuart, please!

187
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:41,239
I cannot talk. I am constrained.
There are strict terms.

188
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,825
Strict terms? What strict terms?

189
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,035
- I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty.
- What?

190
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:48,663
- Please, it's me. It's Grace.
- I'm sorry. Grace, I'm sorry.

191
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,194
Oh, that's disgusting.

192
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:39,547
- Is he back yet? Dad. Is he back yet?
- What?

193
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,590
No.

194
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,509
- No.
- What?

195
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:45,928
Let's go. We're gonna be late for Grandpa.

196
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:57,189
Come on.

197
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:07,033
- Good evening, Mrs. Fraser.
- Good evening.

198
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,453
- Hey. Thank you.
- Thank you.

199
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,751
- Hi, Henry!
- Hi, Grandpa.

200
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,837
Grandma's made some penne marinara
especially for you.

201
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:26,761
<i>So, that's all
Dr. Rosenfeld told you?</i>

202
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:28,303
<i>Yeah.</i>

203
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,348
Hmph.

204
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:32,934
And you?
What are you telling yourself?

205
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,852
I don't know what to tell myself.

206
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:39,649
He didn't just leave his phone behind.
He arranged to be unreachable, Dad.

207
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:47,573
How have things been
between the two of you?

208
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:49,200
How have they been?

209
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,743
It's not a trick question, Grace.

210
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,621
We've never been better.

211
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:58,668
- Mmm.
- This doesn't make any sense.

212
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:01,170
I'm having a hard time
functioning right now.

213
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:03,840
But you have to.
You have a son to look after.

214
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:08,469
- Irma?
- Excuse me, Dr. Fraser.

215
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,353
- Yes?
- There are two police officers waiting

216
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,806
for you in the lobby.

217
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,810
I see. No, Dad. I will take care of it.

218
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,229
I need to take a walk anyway.

219
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,407
Thank you for coming down.

220
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:33,077
Can we have a word
in a more private environment?

221
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,372
Well, my family is upstairs.

222
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,124
Could we go down to the office, then?

223
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,084
To the police station?

224
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,923
Are you arresting me?

225
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,176
Why would we be arresting you?

226
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,178
We just wanna get
more information,

227
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:51,929
it's easier if we do it there.

228
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,183
All right.

229
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,163
<i>Why would you go with them?</i>

230
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:01,898
Because it's the straightest line
to what's going on.

231
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,275
<i>You should have a lawyer.</i>

232
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:08,487
I don't think that's the case,
but if... If it makes sense...

233
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:10,281
Oh, for God's sakes, child.

234
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,409
<i>Thanks for watching Henry.
I'll call you when I know more.</i>

235
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,286
Grace, this is a terrible idea.

236
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,455
I said I'll call you when I know more.

237
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,627
Everything okay?

238
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:30,885
I didn't really know Mrs. Alves.

239
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,889
We can talk when we get there.

240
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,151
Right this way, please.

241
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,491
This door here.

242
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,159
Hey! Hey!

243
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,119
Right in here.

244
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,001
Can I get you a coffee or something?

245
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,085
Um...

246
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,587
No.

247
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,548
No, thank you. I'm fine. This...

248
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:10,883
It looks a little...

249
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:13,552
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

250
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:14,929
I wouldn't have thought so.

251
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:16,681
We're just gonna talk.

252
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,789
All right.

253
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,709
Ahem.

254
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:48,587
Um...

255
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:50,923
All right. Ahem.

256
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,592
Dr. Fraser.

257
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,845
Where is your husband?

258
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,099
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

259
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,767
Is he in your apartment on East 63rd?

260
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:04,895
- No, of course not. He...
- Why "of course not"?

261
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:06,814
Because I told you. As far as I know,

262
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,608
he is at a medical conference,
and if he were here in the city,

263
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:11,319
he'd be at work, but he's not here.

264
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,321
- And work would be where?
- Um...

265
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,365
Price-Norbury Memorial Hospital.

266
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:20,827
Hm.

267
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,418
Dr. Fraser...

268
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:30,963
your husband has not worked

269
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,425
at Price-Norbury Memorial Hospital
for a long time.

270
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:42,141
You didn't know this?

271
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:45,435
What?

272
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,148
According to Dr. Sharp,
Dr. Jonathan Fraser's

273
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,525
employment was terminated
nearly three months ago.

274
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,779
You were not aware of this?

275
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,326
You're saying that

276
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,912
you were not aware of this
until this very moment?

277
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,956
I was... I was not aware.

278
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,377
I spoke to a doctor earlier today,

279
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,379
who wasn't forthcoming with information,

280
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,756
- but I was not aware...
- What doctor was that?

281
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,135
Um, Stuart. Stuart Rosenfeld.
Dr. Rosenfeld.

282
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:22,056
And did Dr. Rosenfeld tell you that
your husband's termination followed

283
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,850
three earlier disciplinary actions
at the hospital?

284
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,109
I want this to stop.

285
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,027
Are you hiding your husband?

286
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,822
No! I'm not hiding my husband.

287
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,282
I told you, I thought
he was at a medical conference.

288
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:44,203
He said to me that he was going
to a medical conference in Cleveland.

289
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,664
- Then he's not in your apartment.
- I told you.

290
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,249
He's not there.

291
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,667
His phone seems to be,

292
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:51,502
according to Verizon.

293
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:56,048
Yes. Yes, his... His phone is there.

294
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:58,693
- That's a detail you might've mentioned.
- You didn't ask me where his phone was.

295
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,717
You asked where he was.

296
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,720
- Right. Right.
- He forgot his phone at home.

297
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:04,306
I mean, it's not the first time
that he's done that.

298
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,184
And I found the phone last night,
and that's why it...

299
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:08,519
I don't know where he is

300
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,855
because he forgot his phone and I can't...

301
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:13,732
I can't call him.

302
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,194
- That makes sense to you, hm?
- No.

303
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:21,991
No, nothing about this entire day
makes any sense to me.

304
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,744
Dr. Fraser, do you know why
your husband was fired?

305
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,835
I suspect you figure that we do.

306
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,422
Are you not even curious?

307
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,970
Yesterday, we obtained the records
from Price-Norbury Memorial Hospital.

308
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,933
- You obtained confidential records?
- Yes, yes.

309
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:47,558
Yes, as a result of a court order
filed yesterday morning.

310
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,478
This is fucking bullshit.

311
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,646
This is bullshit. This is fucking...

312
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,731
This is bullshit.

313
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:57,610
In June of last year,
a full disciplinary hearing

314
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:00,988
alleged inappropriate contact...

315
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,366
with a family member of a patient.

316
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:09,288
I don't know what any of that means, but...

317
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,041
- I'm...
- But what?

318
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,670
It's cancer. It's children's cancer.

319
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,592
My husband's a warm, warm man.

320
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,845
He's not some asshole who walks
into a room and pronounces

321
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,306
that your child is gonna die
and then walks out the door.

322
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,809
He is a very caring man,

323
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,480
and maybe he has touched someone,

324
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,233
maybe he hugged someone

325
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:41,654
because he cares,
and that does not mean that he's some...

326
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:47,242
Okay.

327
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,996
I'm gonna tell you the name of the patient.

328
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:54,375
No. No, no, no.

329
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,353
- I can tell you the name of the patient.
- It's private.

330
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,605
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know the patient's name.

331
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,757
It's private information, it's confidential,
and I don't want to know.

332
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,343
- I don't want to know.
- You don't want to know...

333
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:07,054
or you already do know?

334
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,102
Your husband's patient...

335
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,480
was Miguel Alves.

336
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,318
Diagnosed with Wilms' tumor.

337
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,155
Miguel's mother...

338
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:29,201
Elena Alves.

339
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,751
So, you'll forgive me
for asking, Dr. Fraser,

340
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,461
but I'm going to be seriously pissed off

341
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:42,232
if you keep telling me your husband's
at a fucking medical conference,

342
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,259
in fucking Cleveland,
that he forgot his fucking phone!

343
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,095
Don't protect him.

344
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:52,016
Wherever Jonathan is,
we're going to find him.

345
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,268
So, if you know something,
this would be the right time

346
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,191
- to tell us what it is.
- This is what I know.

347
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,230
I'm sitting here in a room
with two detectives

348
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:01,567
who are treating me
very much like I'm a suspect,

349
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,528
trying to illicit
incriminating responses from me,

350
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,531
in a grossly custodial setting.

351
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,579
So, you either read me
my Miranda rights right now...

352
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,916
or tell me I'm free to go.

353
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,658
- Are you still with them?
<i>- No.</i>

354
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,370
<i>- I just left.</i>
- Are you all right?

355
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,167
Grace, what the devil's going on?

356
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,337
They were asking me a lot of questions,
aggressive questions.

357
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:06,715
I'm guessing there's still no word
from Jonathan?

358
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:13,806
No.

359
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:17,226
Guess it's safe to assume
he's not in Cleveland.

360
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:20,729
<i>Now, you and Henry,</i>

361
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:22,981
you stay here with me tonight.

362
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,108
Yes.

363
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:27,027
<i>Grace, did you hear me?</i>

364
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,987
Yes. I just need to go back
to the apartment.

365
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,614
I have to get some clothes,

366
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,449
<i>some things for Henry.</i>

367
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,868
I'll see you when you get here.

368
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,745
Yeah.

369
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,769
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

370
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,672
Good morning, Mrs. Fraser.

371
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,531
<i>Police are focusing
on events transpiring</i>

372
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,432
<i>at a Reardon School fundraiser</i>

373
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:10,602
<i>where the victim, Elena Alves,
was last seen alive.</i>

374
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:13,105
<i>- Several witnesses described Mrs. Alves...</i>
- Morning, Henry.

375
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,499
<i>- ...as visibly upset.</i>
- Morning, Grandpa.

376
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,858
<i>Though other partygoers dispute
that account.</i>

377
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,194
<i>Early suspicion was on
the victim's husband,</i>

378
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,114
<i>but we're now learning his whereabouts
have been accounted for.</i>

379
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,325
Do the police think he killed her?

380
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,076
No.

381
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,663
They wanna talk to him.

382
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:32,374
As do I. As do you.

383
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,457
So...

384
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:36,837
Why did they take you
into the police station?

385
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,633
Because he knew her.
He was her child's doctor,

386
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:45,512
- and I knew her, and...
- It's not a crime to know somebody.

387
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,305
No. No, it's not.

388
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,933
- So, they think he killed her.
- No!

389
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,519
- Well, why else all of this, then?
- I don't know.

390
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:54,937
I don't know.

391
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:01,987
Excuse me! Excuse me, ma'am!

392
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,582
Wow, I can't believe she'd...

393
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,461
I see they're putting you to work, Jennifer.

394
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,214
- Hi, Mrs. Hartman.
- Go on in.

395
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,260
God, what was that?

396
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:26,428
I'll be right back.

397
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,099
- Morning, Henry. Morning, Grace.
- Morning, sir.

398
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,727
- God, this is...
- Indeed. It's quite something.

399
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,188
Henry, why don't you head up
to class? Huh?

400
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,981
- Yes, sir.
- Are you okay?

401
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:40,025
- Yeah. Mom, I'm fine.
- You sure?

402
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,406
Robert, what...? What's going on?

403
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,576
What is going on is, I am trying
to get us through a crisis.

404
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:51,536
- Grace...
- All right.

405
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,955
I don't think you should be here.

406
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,748
What?

407
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,126
I think, for the good of everyone,

408
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,462
you don't need to be here.

409
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:12,057
- What did they tell you?
- I want you to know...

410
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,683
this is a safe place for Henry.

411
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,661
- And if he needs to come to my office...
- What the...?

412
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:19,022
...at any time, he can come.
At recess or after school.

413
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,440
If anyone says anything to him,

414
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:22,692
- he should come see me right away.
- It's not true.

415
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:23,985
It's not true.

416
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,946
Whatever they said to you. Wha...?

417
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,405
- Listen to me.
- Robert, come on.

418
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,157
The teachers will be looking out for him.

419
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,910
I have spoken to all of them.
He's a Reardon student,

420
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,787
- and I take that very seriously.
- Really?

421
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,413
You're really doing this to me?

422
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,290
My advice to you...

423
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,461
is you send someone else
to pick him up this afternoon.

424
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:50,804
- Grace.
- Sylvia.

425
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,264
I have a cab. Come on.

426
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,849
- What...?
- Come on.

427
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,810
Ma'am!

428
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:02,899
Okay.

429
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:04,651
Okay.

430
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,362
What are people saying?

431
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:08,613
I...

432
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,824
- Tell me.
- It's...

433
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,411
Just a water, please, and some privacy.

434
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,954
- Thank you.
- Tell me.

435
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,293
The word is that Elena's husband
evidently has an alibi.

436
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,589
The attention now seems
to be focused entirely on Jonathan.

437
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,222
So, he knew her? Elena?

438
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,643
Well, Miguel was his patient, so...

439
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,355
Well, it was her.

440
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,026
What?

441
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,697
He hired me. A few months ago.

442
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,784
Jonathan hired you?

443
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,161
As his lawyer.

444
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,414
I told him that employment law wasn't
my expertise, but he...

445
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,333
He insisted.

446
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,628
He signed a document hiring me
to formally represent him.

447
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,466
There was going to be
a disciplinary hearing at the hospital,

448
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,301
involved the mother of a patient.

449
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:15,931
He wanted my advice.

450
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:18,934
So, why didn't you tell me?

451
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,895
I didn't know, for sure,
whether you knew or not, and...

452
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,022
Grace, it was...

453
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:28,818
- It was privileged. It's still privileged.
- What happened?

454
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,697
I looked over the paperwork
that he brought me.

455
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:35,283
There was a lot there. A lot.
More than enough to fire him.

456
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,453
He insisted that he was innocent
of the charges.

457
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:44,000
That it was all being manufactured
by this crazy woman.

458
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,126
Really?

459
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,046
He called a week later to say
the accusations were dropped.

460
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,423
That the hospital found
the woman's claims were baseless.

461
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,342
He thanked me for my time.

462
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,681
And I just, I assumed that it went away.

463
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:58,848
But it didn't.

464
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,478
They fired him.
They kept it completely confidential.

465
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:07,816
I'm sorry, Grace.

466
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,151
I am. I'm really sorry.

467
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:15,490
My advice...

468
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,410
Not that you're asking.

469
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,791
...if you do learn where Jonathan is,

470
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,460
tell the police.

471
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,106
The sooner you make it clear
you're not involved,

472
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,425
the better you'll be treated by everybody,
police and media included.

473
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,970
Grace, you need to get out of here,
you and Henry.

474
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:40,515
Once they find Jonathan,
this story will explode.

475
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:45,145
You need to be somewhere else
when that happens.

476
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,458
So?

477
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,002
Nothing new.

478
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,714
You need to get protection
for yourself, Grace.

479
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:58,301
You think you can handle everything
on your own, alone.

480
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:00,595
This is bigger than you.

481
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,390
It's bigger than me, for chrissakes.

482
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,934
You should get out of town.

483
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,685
You should go to the beach house.

484
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,646
Look, I have patients.

485
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:11,856
Henry has school.

486
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,609
I'm gonna call Haley Fitzgerald.
You have to have a lawyer.

487
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,319
I don't want a lawyer.

488
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:21,323
Grace,

489
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:26,413
your husband is the lead suspect

490
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,456
in a murder investigation.

491
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,391
Excuse me.

492
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,786
- Excuse me, I live here. Yes, I do.
- You live here?

493
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,229
- Excus... I live here.
- Hey, hey, you can't come in here.

494
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,897
- You got some ID?
- Uh...

495
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,108
Come on. Let her through,
let her through. Come on.

496
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,318
What is going on?

497
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,206
Do you have paperwork for this?

498
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,041
Of course. Paul, the warrant.

499
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,168
Here you go.

500
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,689
So, you think
my husband killed this woman?

501
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,276
The search might take a bit.

502
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,571
You got somewhere else to go?

503
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,991
You don't need to worry
about me, detective.

504
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:47,327
Well, believe it or not,
it's kind of my nature.

505
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:48,952
To worry about people.

506
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,001
Where is his phone? We can't find it.

507
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:04,843
Thank you.

508
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:06,596
You guys need
a hand down here?

509
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,058
I really am sorry
about all this.

510
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,434
Why are you taking...?

511
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,853
Why are you taking his...? His hairbrush?

512
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:17,500
We're taking a number of things
that might help our investigation.

513
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:18,525
That's all.

514
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:21,694
I could be wrong,
but I think that you wanna help us.

515
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,863
I think that, at this point,

516
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,533
you're more angry at him than you are at us.

517
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:30,537
- And you're right to be.
- Please, don't fucking patronize me.

518
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,765
- No, that's not my intention to do that.
- I can't... Don't.

519
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,141
- I don't patronize people.
- Don't...

520
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:38,044
I've just seen this type
of situation one too many times.

521
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,965
Husbands who have kept their wives
in the dark about a lot of things.

522
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,677
And when I'm in the picture,
there's some fraud or a robbery.

523
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:48,346
Sometimes, a murder.

524
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:50,598
I'm sorry.

525
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,104
We need the hairbrush for DNA.

526
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:58,356
For a couple of reasons.

527
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,066
The crime scene...

528
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,318
and also...

529
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,570
Also what?

530
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,366
- What?
- Paternity.

531
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:10,910
They have a baby.

532
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:14,205
Mr. Alves is demanding a paternity test.

533
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,209
He insists he's not the father.

534
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:12,805
<i>Please.</i>

535
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:14,515
<i>Please.</i>

536
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,319
Oh! God.

537
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,155
Henry, you scared me.

538
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,032
Mom.

539
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:16,869
Mom, I don't wanna be here.

540
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:18,371
I know, but we're here.

541
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,415
- For how long?
- For as long as it takes.

542
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:21,916
That's not an answer.

543
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:25,002
When the police
and the media stop congregating

544
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:28,798
outside our apartment and your school,
that's when we'll go back.

545
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,467
- We'll go back when things...
- When they what?

546
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:35,680
- When they what? Go back to normal?
- Come on, Henry.

547
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:39,392
- Mom.
- Henry, come on.

548
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:40,893
I'm trying. I'm trying.

549
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:42,311
By running away.

550
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:44,105
That's bullshit, Mom.

551
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:45,440
There's no hiding.

552
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:49,609
Henry.

553
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:49,896
Come here.

554
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:51,566
Come here.

555
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,919
Don't scream! Don't scream.

556
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,671
Don't scream, don't scream. It's me.

557
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:38,798
I didn't do it. I didn't kill her.

558
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:40,091
I did not kill her.

559
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:44,637
We were romantically involved,
but I didn't kill her.

560
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,763
I'm so sorry.

561
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,933
I'm so sorry, my Grace.

562
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:50,059
I'm so sorry.

563
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:56,273
I'm gonna take my hand away,
and you're not gonna scream.

564
00:46:56,774 --> 00:46:57,774
There.

565
00:46:58,275 --> 00:46:59,275
There.

566
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:01,278
I didn't do it.

567
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:03,406
I didn't kill her.

568
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:06,367
- I'm calling the police.
- Give me two minutes.

569
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,619
You're going to give me two minutes
before you do that.

570
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:11,247
- I gave you my whole life.
- Grace.

571
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,332
- No. Get your fucking hands off me!
- Grace!

572
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:16,127
- Or I will. I will scream.
- Grace. I didn't...

573
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,004
You can hate me as much as you want,

574
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:20,548
but Henry needs to know
his father's not a murderer.

575
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:21,674
He's gotta believe in me.

576
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:24,719
I will never, ever let him believe in you.

577
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:27,513
Look, here's what happened.

578
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:29,347
I had an affair.

579
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:31,934
She became obsessed.

580
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:35,479
With me, with my life, and then with you.

581
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,566
First it was all about getting
her boy into Reardon,

582
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:41,986
which I helped with 'cause I thought
it was about his education, but it wasn't.

583
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:43,821
It was about encroachment.

584
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:45,448
She was fucking possessed.

585
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,283
She was possessed.

586
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:49,702
When I heard she'd got herself
on your auction committee

587
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:51,704
and then joined your gym, I was scared.

588
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:54,540
I was scared for us as a family.
I was scared for you.

589
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,792
At the night of the fundraiser,
I went to confront her.

590
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:59,545
- I told her that had to stop...
- You snapped?

591
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:01,254
We argued.

592
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,174
We fought.

593
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:09,764
We had sex. I left. I walked the streets.

594
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:12,099
I went to a bar to collect myself, then I...

595
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:16,103
I went back to confront her again,
and she was fucking dead.

596
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:19,482
She was dead.
There was no sign of anyone.

597
00:48:19,565 --> 00:48:22,777
I panicked. I totally fucking panicked.
I lost my head.

598
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,446
- Shock took hold of me...
- You came home.

599
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:28,074
You crawled into our bed,

600
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:30,201
and I held you.

601
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:32,119
I held you.

602
00:48:33,204 --> 00:48:35,081
And I broke for you.

603
00:48:35,164 --> 00:48:37,249
And we made love, Jonathan.

604
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,085
We made love.

605
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:41,545
And I thought you'd lost a patient.

606
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:43,881
How can I ever believe you?

607
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,883
Because you're a fucking liar.

608
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:47,384
You're a liar.

609
00:48:47,468 --> 00:48:49,261
You've been pretending to have this job

610
00:48:49,345 --> 00:48:51,347
- you didn't even have.
- No. That's all part of...

611
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,475
- What, are you...?
- It's part of the same big deception.

612
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:57,978
I lost my job 'cause of this woman.
I lost myself.

613
00:48:58,062 --> 00:49:01,357
She got hold of me, Grace.
She got hold of every fucking part of me.

614
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,067
But I didn't kill her.

615
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:05,319
I did not...

616
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:07,404
Dad?

617
00:49:08,197 --> 00:49:10,366
- Dad?
- Come here. Come here.

618
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,501
My name is Grace Fraser.

619
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:23,295
My husband has just broken in.

620
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,048
He's a fugitive. He's wanted for murder.

621
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:29,844
His name is Jonathan Fraser.
I'm at 361 Beachway...

622
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:32,054
Beachway Drive. And I'm fucking terrified.

623
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:34,557
I need you to get here quickly.

624
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:36,766
Please.

625
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:44,790
