00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,778
<i>I lost someone I love.</i>

17
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,074
<i>So, you still say
you didn't kill her?</i>

18
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,660
<i>Well, I say that
because I did not kill her.</i>

19
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:59,871
<i>You loved this woman.
You knew her. You knew her life.</i>

20
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:03,458
<i>Do you have some idea who did?</i>

21
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,174
I do, yeah.

22
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,223
How you doing, Henry?

23
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,351
- Good, thanks, sir.
- Yeah?

24
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,377
Why were you there that night?

25
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,089
Outside her apartment?

26
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,093
Because I was walking.

27
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:58,513
Like I always do. I didn't know where
I was. I've told you this many times.

28
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:01,099
It is just such a coincidence,
isn't it, that...

29
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:04,644
I was having an affair with her,
and you were there.

30
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,855
- Just as I was, or just had been.
- Oh, my God.

31
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,691
What are you asking me?

32
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,026
Were you following me?

33
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:16,907
Was I following you?

34
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,118
Were you?

35
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,246
Were you following me?

36
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,142
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Were you following me, Grace?

37
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,209
Don't you dare say that...

38
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,252
- You Jonathan Fraser?
- Excuse me.

39
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:30,897
- Can we take a selfie with you?
- This is wild!

40
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,506
- Johnny! Right here!
- No. No.

41
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:34,149
- Quick selfie.
- No. No. Come on.

42
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:35,217
- This is...
- Grace!

43
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,635
Grace!

44
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,569
How are we doing?

45
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,698
What's going on?

46
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:01,785
Um...

47
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,080
I think we're both, um...

48
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,626
A little pre-trial nerves, that's all.

49
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,340
Look, they have a strong case.
No question.

50
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,634
But it's circumstantial.

51
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,386
Nobody saw anything.

52
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:23,557
They don't have a murder weapon,
and some of the science actually helps us.

53
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,600
Their case is vulnerable.

54
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:27,018
So you keep saying,

55
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,604
um, although with a little more
anxiety each time you say it.

56
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,148
Here's my question.

57
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,233
What's our case, Haley?

58
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,861
Because I don't really have
clarity on that.

59
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:40,740
Our defense is wait and see.

60
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:43,034
I told you. It's fluid.

61
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:46,288
Fluid. Okay, great.
That gives me great confidence. Thank you.

62
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:49,583
It depends on what they throw at us.
Okay. Let's break it down.

63
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,878
Our case is you.

64
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,213
You say you didn't do it.

65
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,466
Explain why you ran.

66
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:01,470
And our case is you.

67
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:03,722
You say, "Believe what he just said."

68
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:07,517
I can't imagine that the word of a
devoted wife would carry much weight.

69
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,102
Are you devoted, Grace?

70
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:11,437
I'm here.

71
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:15,192
Under the circumstances,
I think I deserve a medal.

72
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,908
We have seven women on the jury.

73
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:29,331
These five are educated,
working professionals.

74
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,833
Just like you.

75
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,922
These two have been cheated on
by their husbands.

76
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:40,716
Just like you.

77
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:43,887
And then there's this guy.

78
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:48,099
He knows better than most
that infidelity doesn't mean murder.

79
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,101
He's having an affair himself.

80
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:54,105
- How could you possibly know that?
- I know all these people.

81
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:58,151
We piggyback on the algorithms
of both Amazon and Google.

82
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:01,029
I know where they go shopping,
Where they go to eat,

83
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,323
where they go on vacation. We know it all.

84
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:06,326
We're already targeting their
Instagram and Facebook accounts

85
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,954
- with pro-defense news feeds.
- Is that legal?

86
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:14,918
It's gray enough to get away with.
We do have one little problem.

87
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,088
The same question keeps coming up
in all our focus trials.

88
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:21,299
If you didn't do it, then who did?

89
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:25,554
We need to offer up another suspect.

90
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,099
Whoa.

91
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,352
Well, what about his alibi?

92
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,187
Oh, it stinks. I can nick it.

93
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,484
Take his hand, would you please?

94
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,655
I mean, now.

95
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,657
- Why?
- Because I said so.

96
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:49,286
Do it.

97
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:07,429
Feel his hand.

98
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:10,557
Feel hers.

99
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,268
Feel together.

100
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,773
If you two don't feel it,
neither will the jury.

101
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,488
I'm not feeling that.

102
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,699
What is the point of this?

103
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,577
The point is that you two
need to be one in the room.

104
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,872
In effect, you'll be giving testimony
every single day.

105
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,874
Every single minute of this trial.

106
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,919
The jurors will be studying you for signs.

107
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:41,421
Is he human?

108
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,423
Does she believe him?

109
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:45,842
Does she still love him?

110
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:52,349
They will constantly
be taking measure of you.

111
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:55,185
Individually, and jointly.

112
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:27,258
<i>Look, juries don't like
to convict good-looking people.</i>

113
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,886
<i>They certainly don't like
to imprison doctors,</i>

114
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,930
<i>and they don't like
to punish the wealthy.</i>

115
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:35,058
<i>As much as we think we like
to stick it to the rich,</i>

116
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,351
<i>in the end, we don't.</i>

117
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,311
<i>We never do.</i>

118
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:41,874
<i>The idea that jurors don't
come into this with preconceived notions,</i>

119
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,858
<i>that's just preposterous.</i>

120
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,735
<i>This case has been
so well-reported,</i>

121
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,530
<i>I might go as far as to say
that these jurors are liars.</i>

122
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,907
<i>I mean,
to get on this panel,</i>

123
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,828
<i>they would have had to have declared
that they know nothing about this case.</i>

124
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:55,911
<i>Does anybody...</i>

125
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:01,042
- It's just entertainment.
- Which you need to be a part of.

126
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,798
The jury will know who you are.

127
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,388
Haley says that they notice everything.
Your presence. Your reactions.

128
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,639
- It all matters.
- Grace.

129
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:18,393
You're doing this for your grandson.

130
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,270
I will be at your side,

131
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:22,480
tomorrow and beyond.

132
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:27,402
But the idea that this best serves Henry

133
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,281
is absolute nonsense.

134
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:37,662
Murderer or not, Jonathan must be kept
as far away from your son as possible.

135
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:14,199
FiveThirtyEight is reporting an 83 percent
chance of conviction this morning,

136
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:16,242
down three points from just yesterday...

137
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:43,144
Plans for a last-minute
plea deal either never materialized,

138
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,813
or were squashed.

139
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,867
How is Grace doing?

140
00:10:57,951 --> 00:10:59,869
Are you speaking to your son-in-law?

141
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,412
Come on, Henry.

142
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:17,262
Take all the metal
out of your pockets, please.

143
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:28,982
Thank you.

144
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,317
Next, please.

145
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,372
Step up.

146
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:47,208
Take all the metal
out of your pockets, please.

147
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:25,246
Murder is ugly business.

148
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,081
I must warn you,

149
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,961
whatever you've heard,
whatever your predispositions,

150
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,589
this one...

151
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,342
It's worse than you think.

152
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,594
The evidence will show

153
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,805
that Jonathan Fraser was having an affair
with the victim.

154
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:46,559
That he went to the victim's studio

155
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:50,813
on the night of January 8th, 2019.

156
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:54,817
That he sexually penetrated her.

157
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,697
That he then violently, savagely,

158
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,908
beat her to death.

159
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,080
He then fled the scene
and went into hiding,

160
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,540
before he was captured.

161
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,587
Elena Alves was bludgeoned so badly,

162
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,047
so viciously,

163
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:20,301
she was unrecognizable
to her own husband.

164
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:26,349
She was first discovered
by her 10-year-old son,

165
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,642
Miguel.

166
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:32,313
She was hit with a blunt instrument
11 times.

167
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,274
The medical examiner found
that the wounds inflicted

168
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,944
were consistent with a sculpting hammer,

169
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:40,363
which belonged to the victim.

170
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:44,033
A hammer which was never found.

171
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,965
It could have been a hammer like this one.

172
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,479
He turned her skull into mush.

173
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,024
He just kept hitting.

174
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,901
And hitting.

175
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,488
And hitting.

176
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:25,700
And hitting.

177
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,507
He just kept hitting.

178
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,052
And hitting.

179
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:47,137
And hitting.

180
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,020
It's worse than you think.

181
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,799
Such a beautiful, vibrant woman.

182
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,433
When bad things happen to good people,
we want answers.

183
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:35,228
We want closure. We want a conviction.

184
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:38,397
My client is the only option.

185
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,609
That's why the investigation
was so limited.

186
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:45,613
It wasn't sloppy, or lazy, or negligent.

187
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,991
It was specifically
and intentionally narrow,

188
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:51,828
precisely because evidence
of other suspects

189
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:54,580
would compromise their one shot
at a conviction.

190
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:00,670
My client made love to Elena Alves,

191
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,421
on January 8th.

192
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,967
His DNA, semen at the scene.

193
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,929
He guarantees reasonable doubt
to any other defendant,

194
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,723
so we're not even gonna look
for other possibilities.

195
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,601
He's the only one we can get.

196
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:22,608
Somebody else hit Elena Alves
with that sculpting hammer,

197
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,653
11 times, like the prosecutor said.

198
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,072
It continued after she was dead.

199
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,783
That's rage.

200
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,161
That's hatred.

201
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,663
Please.

202
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,416
A lot of hatred.

203
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,586
A crime of passion.

204
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,131
Primal fury.

205
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,385
We have to wonder.

206
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,055
Fernando Alves had motive.

207
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,891
He had opportunity. He was there.

208
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,518
Is he the killer?

209
00:16:58,144 --> 00:16:59,896
Can we know for sure?

210
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,564
No.

211
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:03,773
Why?

212
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,070
In part, because he was never
really investigated.

213
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:09,363
Why?

214
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,202
Because his semen was found
inside the victim?

215
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,207
He's the only one we can get.

216
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,083
It shall be him.

217
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,378
It's not.

218
00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:00,706
<i>The problem is, once the
defense comes up with its own theory,</i>

219
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,085
<i>the jury expects that they're gonna have
some evidence behind it.</i>

220
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,462
<i>And the idea that
the husband did this,</i>

221
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,798
<i>there's no evidence for that,
as far as I know.</i>

222
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,822
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

223
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,565
Hello?

224
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,322
Hey.

225
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,115
Hey.

226
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,119
How was your day?
Anything interesting happen?

227
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,957
<i>I don't really have
anything to say. I'm...</i>

228
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,627
Just sitting here in the quiet.

229
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:11,670
It's a bit oppressive.

230
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,756
I'm a bit lonely.

231
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:16,175
<i>How's the boy?
Is he all right?</i>

232
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,429
Yeah. I mean...

233
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:24,809
I'm gonna have to take his iPhone away,
because he's...

234
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:29,146
He's devouring all the coverage,
and I...

235
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,314
Well, good luck with that.

236
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:34,026
I tried it once, and he turned into
that kid from <i>The Exorcist.</i>

237
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,237
<i>I was so scared,
I gave it straight back.</i>

238
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:42,618
Don't suppose you'd like
to come over for a cup of tea?

239
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,997
Boat of Frosties?

240
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,210
<i>I could rustle up some</i>
"oeuf à la <i>Jonathan."</i>

241
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,337
No.

242
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,719
I do realize how brutal today was. Um...

243
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:04,807
Not least because,

244
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:08,519
well, there you are, the most private
person on the face of the earth,

245
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,021
who goes for walks to disappear,

246
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:14,108
thrust into the middle of
that God-awful circus. I'm sorry.

247
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:15,442
Mm-hm.

248
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,030
<i>But I do think, I think we can get
our anonymity back.</i>

249
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,283
<i>Just a question of planning.</i>

250
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:26,579
<i>I think we should let ourselves go,
and get really alarmingly fat.</i>

251
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:27,662
<i>Stop grooming.</i>

252
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:31,667
I think you should wear extremely frumpy
tweed skirts.

253
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,210
In fact, we both should.

254
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:36,964
<i>I, I think we could have
a very peaceful old age.</i>

255
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,047
Mm.

256
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:44,013
<i>Tragic, isn't it? That was
my biggest fantasy when we met.</i>

257
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,891
<i>Getting old with you.</i>

258
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,436
<i>Doing all the,
you know, old stuff.</i>

259
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,938
<i>All the puttering around
the garden,</i>

260
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,192
<i>and being spiteful
about young people.</i>

261
00:21:57,902 --> 00:21:59,403
<i>Joining a book club.</i>

262
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,655
But we did that.

263
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,325
You got kicked out.

264
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,913
<i>I was kicked out
because I was honest.</i>

265
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,122
<i>The book was crap.</i>

266
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,298
<i>You still there?</i>

267
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,009
Yeah, yeah. Do you remember those
long phone calls?

268
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,053
Even when we had nothing to say,
we just...

269
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,388
We didn't hang up. What was that about?

270
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,557
I remember.

271
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,017
<i>Yeah.</i>

272
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:32,895
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

273
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,814
Yeah, okay. Bye.

274
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,818
Wait, um... Hang on...

275
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:41,737
I love you.

276
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,565
Hey.

277
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,666
Henry.

278
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,459
My God, you scared me.

279
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,545
- What are you doing?
- Sitting.

280
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,839
Where were you?

281
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,803
Why are you sitting here?

282
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,559
- What is it?
- I couldn't sleep in my bed.

283
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,274
Were you thinking about it all?

284
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,027
- Yeah.
- We've survived so far.

285
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,613
And we'll survive the rest. We will.

286
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:18,620
What is it?

287
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,497
What's wrong?

288
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:23,083
Something's wrong. I can tell.

289
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,294
No. No.

290
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,504
I'm fine.

291
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,676
No, you're not.

292
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,221
I saw them.

293
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,020
- Hmm?
- I saw them together.

294
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:45,230
At school.

295
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:07,169
Okay.

296
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,129
<i>I should have told you.</i>

297
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,426
<i>If I'd told you, maybe it wouldn't
have happened.</i>

298
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,138
<i>Maybe Miguel's father,
or somebody else who was jealous,</i>

299
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:19,640
<i>maybe if, if...</i>

300
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:20,849
Maybe they found out.

301
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,077
- Maybe if I told you...
- You had nothing to do... No.

302
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,063
- Then they wouldn't have...
- Shh. Would you just listen for a minute?

303
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,524
You had nothing to do
with what happened to Miguel's mother.

304
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,485
- You can't say that.
- You could never have put... I can.

305
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,986
No, but Mom, I saw them.

306
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,405
And that must have been very hard for you.

307
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,866
They weren't doing anything.

308
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,619
I mean, they weren't kissing,

309
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,913
or anything, but...

310
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,041
I just knew,

311
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,252
when I saw them.

312
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:53,841
I knew. And when he saw me,

313
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,759
he just smiled.

314
00:27:58,428 --> 00:27:59,972
<i>Like it was nothing.</i>

315
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,309
<i>He saw that I saw.</i>

316
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,479
<i>He knew that I knew.</i>

317
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,941
Well, he put you in a terrible position.

318
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,235
A position no child should ever be in.

319
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,409
- I wanted to tell you.
- Mm-hm.

320
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,619
I wanted to tell you, but...

321
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,663
I just...

322
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,959
I felt like he trusted me.

323
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,336
It's all right.

324
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,358
You let him see.

325
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,737
You let him see you with her.

326
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,572
At his school.

327
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,407
And you know that he saw you.

328
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,617
- You know he did,
- No.

329
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,703
and he fucking worships you.
He would do anything for you.

330
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,246
Anything. You know that.

331
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,707
No more lies, Jonathan.

332
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,459
I got it. Yeah. Yeah.

333
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:14,671
- Jonathan. At school...
- Grace, Jonathan.

334
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,008
We're about to take on the lead detective.
He needs to be my focus,

335
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,053
- and he needs to be yours.
- What, I'm meant to go out there now?

336
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,263
- And sit out there like this?
- Listen to me.

337
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,099
- Haley.
- Jonathan, why?

338
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:28,852
- You did that to our son.
- Jonathan.

339
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:35,567
We got to the scene at 8:57 A.M.

340
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,655
Nine minutes after
the husband made the 911 call,

341
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:43,408
and about 30 minutes
after the body was discovered by the son.

342
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,661
And what did you find?

343
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,413
We discovered a woman, deceased.

344
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:51,583
Her head badly lacerated,
her skull crushed.

345
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,836
Identified as Elena Alves by her husband.

346
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,757
Though any facial recognition
was difficult to discern.

347
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:03,136
Yes. I'd like to show you
a series of photographs.

348
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,566
I'm sorry, I can't...

349
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,115
Do these photographs fairly and accurately
represent the crime scene as you found it?

350
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:28,996
They do.

351
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,123
Thank you.

352
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:45,929
- Order in the court.
- It's okay. It's okay.

353
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,557
The forensic evidence you spoke of,
detective.

354
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:51,351
My client's sperm, saliva,
and skin fragments.

355
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,187
They could all be
the product of Jonathan Fraser's

356
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,148
and Elena Alves' having sex. True?

357
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,317
That would not explain her crushed skull.

358
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:00,610
No, it wouldn't.

359
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,321
And yet, when asked by Ms. Stamper

360
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,532
to give evidence as to
who crushed that skull,

361
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,953
the evidence you gave
to incriminate my client is...

362
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,874
- Sperm, saliva, and skin fragments.
- And his bloody footprints.

363
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,418
Which he could have left
if he'd returned to the scene

364
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:20,047
- after she was killed.
- And the fact that your client fled.

365
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,090
Yes, he fled.

366
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,928
I suppose when we have
two people come upon the scene,

367
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,597
one flees, the other doesn't,

368
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,808
it's usually the one who flees
who gets put on trial.

369
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,562
- It's not as simple as that.
- In this case,

370
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,146
it is.

371
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,817
There were no eyewitnesses to this crime.

372
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:45,030
No security cameras in this building
to monitor the comings and goings,

373
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,199
to see if anybody else came or went.

374
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,868
- There were not.
- The footprints,

375
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,996
fingerprints, and saliva
found at the scene,

376
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,581
belonging to two people.

377
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,750
My client, and the husband.

378
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:00,253
Fernando Alves went
to the scene after his son alerted him.

379
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,797
He went to his wife's aid.

380
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,632
- He tried...
- His DNA. The DNA

381
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,967
that belonged to the husband,
Fernando Alves.

382
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,804
You cannot scientifically
exclude the possibility

383
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:12,182
it was left the night before. Can you?

384
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,438
- Did you not hear my question, detective?
- I did. I did hear your question.

385
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,274
And I also heard your opening statement.

386
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:22,859
It was offensive.

387
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:27,572
We don't stick our heads into sand
in order to jam through quick convictions.

388
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,533
An innocent person got slaughtered.

389
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:33,995
Our intent was to find out who did it.
Our only pursuit here was the truth.

390
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:39,167
- However much that disappoints you.
- And the truth is that man's DNA...

391
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:40,293
He had an alibi.

392
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,462
- A man with motive.
- His son was with him.

393
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:45,715
They were together at the family apartment
over 10 blocks away.

394
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,634
His 10-year-old son.

395
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:49,678
He was awake the whole time?

396
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,474
There are cameras
in and outside the building

397
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,434
that would have shown if Mr. Alves left.

398
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,603
Cameras in the back, as well as the front?

399
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,981
He could have gone out the back.

400
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,774
There is no evidence,

401
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,985
either by security cameras,

402
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:08,697
street cameras, or eyewitness accounts,

403
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,742
that place Mr. Alves
on or around the scene that night.

404
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:17,455
Street cameras, however,
did capture your client.

405
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:24,921
Anybody else?

406
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,007
No.

407
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:47,152
- Where was this taken?
- A full block away.

408
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,821
- From the scene?
- Yes.

409
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,156
At what time?

410
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,241
A little past 9:30 p.m.

411
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,619
- The night of the murder?
- Yes.

412
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,248
A block from the scene,
and at the time of the murder.

413
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,835
Who is this in the picture? Do you know?

414
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,670
Grace Fraser.

415
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:08,632
The defendant's wife.

416
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:12,135
The defendant's wife.

417
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:15,680
Near the scene, at around the time.

418
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,851
- Gee...
- Are you suggesting she killed her?

419
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,020
I'm actually not.

420
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,607
What I am suggesting
is that you just lied.

421
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,945
I'm suggesting that you had evidence
of another person, one with a lot of motive,

422
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:33,281
being at or near the scene
around the time of death,

423
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:35,659
and you never bothered
to question her as a suspect.

424
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,202
We absolutely questioned her.

425
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,411
As a suspect?

426
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,913
You gave her Miranda?

427
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,418
Did you advise Grace Fraser
of her Miranda rights

428
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,295
before questioning her as a suspect?

429
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,839
We did not.

430
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:52,759
Wouldn't that be the law

431
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,553
if you considered her to be a suspect,
to read her her rights?

432
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:59,724
It would be, if she was a suspect.
But she wasn't.

433
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:05,021
We had security cameras
capturing her walking.

434
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:06,940
Continuing on.

435
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:11,236
We had and still have no reason to believe
she ever entered the dwelling,

436
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,613
nor there was any of her DNA present.

437
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,201
If her DNA had been present,
you would have considered her a suspect?

438
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,453
Of course. But it wasn't.

439
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,123
His was.

440
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,960
Did you ever read Fernando his rights?

441
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,422
You made an exception for Fernando Alves.

442
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,716
Was it because admitting
your suspicions of him

443
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,177
might weaken your chances of getting him?

444
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:48,273
Fernando Alves had an alibi.

445
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:54,446
Yes. His sleeping son.

446
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,588
<i>- Dad.
- Yeah.</i>

447
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:14,424
They're calling the detective
a squirmy worm.

448
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:17,469
They're saying, like,
"Can't make the prosecutor feel good

449
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,929
having your whole case
ride on a squirmy worm."

450
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:22,432
Turn the phone off. Turn the phone off.

451
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:24,225
Just turn it off. Thank you.

452
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,129
It's not often that we get
to eat together, the three of us.

453
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:29,313
Here we are.

454
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,195
He'll pour it. Thank you.

455
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,571
Thank you.

456
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,741
Did you know she was gonna do that?

457
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:41,409
Pull up that picture?

458
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:43,536
I did.

459
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,500
And you're okay being a suspect?

460
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,295
I'm not a suspect.
That was Haley's point. That...

461
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,923
They should have taken
a more serious look at me,

462
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:57,592
just as they should have
taken a more serious look at Mr. Alves.

463
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:00,553
And they didn't. They just had tunnel vision
for your father.

464
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:08,103
So, Hen, your mom told me
that you saw me and...

465
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:17,612
Me and Elena Alves at school.

466
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,533
And I'm really sorry about that.

467
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,827
I behaved incredibly badly.

468
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:28,415
It was repugnant of me
to allow you to witness anything.

469
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:32,877
I think we're gonna win.

470
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,380
Do you?

471
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,426
I don't know.

472
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,307
Thank you.

473
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:52,772
I don't...

474
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,733
I don't know but I think we might
have made a colossal mistake.

475
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:59,779
I think Mr. Alves is obviously
very sympathetic,

476
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,240
and there's no real evidence
to show his guilt. So...

477
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,164
Did you mean what you said?

478
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:12,709
If we survived this far,
we can survive anything?

479
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,793
I said that?

480
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,837
- Last night.
- Oh.

481
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:20,675
If we can survive this trial,
I think this family can survive.

482
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:23,178
- All right... Well, I...
- Don't you?

483
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,263
- We need to talk about that another time.
- No.

484
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,514
I want to talk about it now.

485
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,367
No, we're not talking about it now.
It's not the time.

486
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:31,519
You tell your patients
that marriages can go on,

487
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:33,188
- even after somebody cheats.
- Come on.

488
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:36,816
You tell them that marriages
can even sometimes grow stronger.

489
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,735
- Is that a lie?
- I said, it's not the time.

490
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,321
- Is that a lie, or do you believe that?
- Henry, stop. Shush.

491
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,490
You would never cheat again. Would you?

492
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:45,700
- No. No.
- You would never cheat... See?

493
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:46,993
- See?
- Henry.

494
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,590
We can still be a family.

495
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:04,594
You know, we could even get a dog.

496
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:05,928
Finally.

497
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,974
I'll take care of it, so you won't
have to worry about what happened before.

498
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,017
What do you mean?

499
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,230
What do you mean?

500
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,736
I asked you a question.

501
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:23,737
What do you mean?

502
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,617
Mom told me about the dog thing.

503
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,994
About your family blaming you.

504
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,589
Well, she shouldn't have done that.

505
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,891
You know, I'm gonna get some air.

506
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:53,893
What did I say?

507
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,478
Mom, what did I say?

508
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,689
It's all right. Just wait here.

509
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,321
Jonathan.

510
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,324
Jonathan!

511
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,292
I'm sorry. It was just
the stress of it all. I...

512
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,752
Taking its toll, I suppose.

513
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:22,255
I don't believe you.

514
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:29,971
What was that about?
Jonathan, what was that about?

515
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,978
I didn't kill the family dog.

516
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,148
We never had a dog.

517
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,860
I had a sister. I...

518
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:48,281
I killed the family sister.

519
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,243
What?

520
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:54,954
Katie.

521
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:58,333
Katie the Kitten, we called her.

522
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,501
I was babysitting her.

523
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:04,005
I was 14. She was 4.

524
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:05,715
And...

525
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,301
Somehow she sneaked out of the house

526
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:12,430
while I was in the kitchen making
a cheese and tomato sandwich.

527
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,394
I heard the sound of the brakes,

528
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,438
and then another sound,

529
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,692
that I will never get out of my head.

530
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:30,198
Your sister got hit by a car?

531
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,367
It was your sister?

532
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,787
You should add that to my list of lies.

533
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,915
Except I also tell myself this one.
You know, that it wasn't my fault.

534
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,211
That it was just an unfortunate thing,

535
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:45,546
but, of course, it was my fucking fault,

536
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:50,218
because Katie the Kitten was put
under my charge.

537
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,012
And she...

538
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,848
And she got hit by a car
when I was making myself a snack.

539
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:05,233
- How is it you have never told me this?
- Because we don't talk of it.

540
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,402
You know. Ever.

541
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:09,070
Ever.

542
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:13,533
It's probably...

543
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,160
why I went into pediatric medicine.

544
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:17,995
I don't know. You're the shrink.

545
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,998
You know better than me,
but I will tell you this.

546
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:23,167
Every patient I treat,

547
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:24,669
every single one...

548
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,548
is little Katie.

549
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:34,679
Yeah.

550
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,420
All this time, he was carrying that burden
and I never saw.

551
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:10,715
In your professional opinion,

552
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:13,259
is a past trauma like that

553
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:19,474
likely to render a person
more compassionate?

554
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:22,477
Or more psychotic?

555
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:31,027
I tried calling his mother.

556
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,782
A few times.

557
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:37,700
And she never returned.

558
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:42,914
Even his family doesn't want
to have anything to do with him.

559
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,431
Turn, please.

560
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:04,519
Thank you.

561
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,898
Turn, please.

562
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:14,821
Thank you.

563
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,075
Morning.

564
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:23,078
Turn, please.

565
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:30,920
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

566
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:39,637
Turn, please.

567
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:47,270
After she hadn't come home,

568
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:51,440
or replied to any of my calls or texts,

569
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:55,361
my son Miguel, he went to check on her.

570
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,989
I thought he'd gone to school.

571
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:00,575
I was just having a busy morning
with the baby.

572
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:03,870
She wasn't there,
so I told him to just go on.

573
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:08,291
See himself to the bus. And he didn't.

574
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:11,294
He went to see his mom.

575
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,464
He went to the studio.

576
00:45:15,548 --> 00:45:16,549
<i>Yes.</i>

577
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:18,843
<i>And then you went there?</i>

578
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:20,302
Yes.

579
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:22,388
After he'd come back.

580
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:24,265
He was...

581
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:26,475
Crying, screaming.

582
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,936
- And so you went there, and...
- Yeah.

583
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,272
What did you find?

584
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:39,322
It's...

585
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,241
Elena.

586
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:44,410
My wife.

587
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,081
<i>She was just lying there.</i>

588
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:51,751
There was just blood everywhere.

589
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:56,589
Her face, head. They were like mush.

590
00:45:58,382 --> 00:46:00,426
So, you called the police?

591
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,346
Yeah. I called the police, and...

592
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:07,683
Ambulance.

593
00:46:09,727 --> 00:46:10,811
Thank you.

594
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:25,826
Mr. Alves.

595
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:31,499
I cannot imagine your pain, sir.

596
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:33,000
That's a lie.

597
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,461
I'm sorry?

598
00:46:37,672 --> 00:46:39,382
You feel nothing for me.

599
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:42,093
Or my pain.

600
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:45,179
You tried to blame me.

601
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,099
I actually didn't.

602
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:49,892
I simply tried to point out

603
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:52,103
that you cannot be eliminated
as a suspect.

604
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:54,438
That others cannot be eliminated.

605
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:57,108
For that, you should direct
your contempt to the police. Not me.

606
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:59,360
- Objection.
- Sustained.

607
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,614
See, my wife is dead,
and you're just...

608
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:05,950
playing games.

609
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:08,661
That's it.

610
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:11,580
You disgust me.

611
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:16,919
I don't mean to incite your rage.

612
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:21,716
You spoke of your love of Elena.

613
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:23,551
You loved her very much.

614
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:27,430
- She was everything to me.
- I'm sensing that.

615
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,017
But you weren't everything to her.

616
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:34,437
And there were other men.

617
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,856
- Including my client.
- No, no, no.

618
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:40,234
There were no other men.
He was the only one.

619
00:47:40,317 --> 00:47:42,361
- How can you know that, sir?
- Well, because I do.

620
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:45,531
Did you know that she was
romantically involved with Jonathan?

621
00:47:54,415 --> 00:47:57,418
Elena was able to keep
part of herself from you.

622
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,587
Maybe that's why she kept
a separate apartment.

623
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,923
- To keep part of her separate.
- No, that's not what that was.

624
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:06,510
That was an apartment for her art,
because she was an artist, and...

625
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:09,221
<i>And she needed to focus
and she needed to work.</i>

626
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:11,682
<i>That's what that apartment was for.</i>

627
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:15,186
It wasn't just for her art.

628
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:17,938
She'd been using it to have an affair
with my client.

629
00:48:20,149 --> 00:48:22,318
<i>Did you know, sir?</i>

630
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:27,114
Did you know, sir?

631
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:28,699
Not at first.

632
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:31,994
But at some point?

633
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:38,334
And at some point, you learned that
your daughter...

634
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:42,338
That my client was the biological father.

635
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:46,759
That must have been
an awful thing to learn.

636
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:54,266
Forgive me, but I have to ask.

637
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,686
Was your wife receiving
any psychiatric treatment?

638
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:58,813
Objection.

639
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:01,148
- Overruled.
- Was she?

640
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:05,986
- Yes.
- What for? Do you know?

641
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:08,781
You are vile.

642
00:49:10,116 --> 00:49:13,035
My question only goes
to who else could have possibly done this.

643
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:15,579
We cannot rule out that she saw other men.

644
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:20,501
That maybe one such man
had the capacity for explosive jealousy,

645
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:22,128
- or violent rage.
- Objection!

646
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:25,291
These are the very questions
you'd want the police asking, am I right,

647
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:27,150
- to find out who did this?
- Your Honor...

648
00:49:27,174 --> 00:49:29,894
- He did this! He did this!
- Your Honor, may I approach...

649
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,304
Mr. Alves,

650
00:49:33,222 --> 00:49:36,517
- are you receiving any psychiatric help?
- Objection!

651
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,496
- I don't mean to be insensitive.
- Well, you're doing a great job of it.

652
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,080
You have put this witness on the stand.

653
00:49:41,147 --> 00:49:43,315
- Your Honor, may I approach?
- It's cross-examination.

654
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:45,776
Mr. Alves, what you have
to be going through,

655
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,738
- are you getting any help?
- Your Honor...

656
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:56,537
How do you think it's going?

657
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,289
Your objective opinion?

658
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,041
Look, to... To me,

659
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:03,836
It's more likely than not that...

660
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:06,505
That Jonathan did it.

661
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:10,801
<i>But more likely
isn't the standard.</i>

662
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:13,179
It's beyond all reasonable doubt.

663
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:14,721
That puts you ahead.

664
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:18,226
<i>That, and he has the best attorney
money can buy. So...</i>

665
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:22,980
Grace, I...

666
00:50:25,524 --> 00:50:27,735
I probably shouldn't ask you this, but...

667
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:32,990
What are you actually thinking?

668
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:39,121
Yeah. You shouldn't ask that.

669
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,008
Another reason I couldn't have done it.

670
00:51:37,888 --> 00:51:39,098
I loved her.

671
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:43,060
Quite madly.

672
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:49,400
Not something
I could say to Grace, you see.

673
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:53,737
It didn't diminish my love
for my wife. It was just, uh...

674
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:57,532
Different.

675
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:02,037
It's going well,
but you'll need to testify.

676
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,290
We need to account for why you fled.

677
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:05,624
Only you can do that.

678
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,168
Don't pretend to be honest,
because you've told too many lies.

679
00:52:08,252 --> 00:52:10,337
Don't pretend to be a good husband,
a decent father,

680
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:13,841
because you are arguably neither.
We don't need to give them a good man.

681
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:16,343
Just someone who didn't commit murder.

682
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:57,676
Janet.

683
00:52:58,385 --> 00:52:59,386
Hello.

684
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:00,888
<i>Grace.</i>

685
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:06,018
- What time is it there?
<i>- It's 4:00 a.m.</i>

686
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,729
<i>I couldn't sleep, so,</i>

687
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:11,982
<i>I thought I would use the time
to return your call.</i>

688
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,275
Well, thank you.

689
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:16,653
Thank you. I'm sorry it's...

690
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,240
been so long since we've...

691
00:53:20,324 --> 00:53:22,159
<i>Since the wedding, Grace.</i>

692
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:24,787
<i>We haven't seen each other
since the wedding.</i>

693
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:29,166
<i>Jonathan's doing, I realize.</i>

694
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,793
<i>How is he?</i>

695
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:33,462
<i>I can't imagine well.</i>

696
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:36,298
No. None of us are doing great, so...

697
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:38,384
<i>- Is.</i>
- I'm sorry?

698
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:41,136
<i>None of us is doing great.</i>

699
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,680
<i>"None" is a contraction of "not one."</i>

700
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:44,764
<i>It's singular.</i>

701
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:48,727
<i>The verb is singular.</i>

702
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:52,648
<i>And, uh, Henry.</i>

703
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,360
<i>He must be looking
like a grown man by now?</i>

704
00:53:57,653 --> 00:53:59,196
He's getting there.

705
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:04,243
I've sent you some pictures, but...

706
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:07,371
<i>Grace, I don't blame you.</i>

707
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:14,336
<i>It was Jonathan's decision
to no longer be part of his family.</i>

708
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:18,465
<i>A decision he made long before
he met you.</i>

709
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:22,010
Well, I'm just trying to piece
everything together right now.

710
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:23,637
You can probably understand.

711
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:25,347
<i>Yes, I can.</i>

712
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:32,104
I just learned that Jonathan
had a younger sister.

713
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:35,482
Katie.

714
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:39,153
And that he feels responsible
for her death.

715
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:42,781
<i>As he should.</i>

716
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:44,992
<i>He was responsible.</i>

717
00:54:46,285 --> 00:54:51,081
<i>He allowed a 4-year-old
to wander out onto a busy street.</i>

718
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,710
<i>Where she was struck dead.</i>

719
00:54:57,629 --> 00:55:00,048
That must have been unspeakably awful.

720
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:04,845
<i>- It was.</i>
- Janet, um...

721
00:55:05,596 --> 00:55:08,515
The grief and the guilt, and... And...

722
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,559
Jonathan growing up with that.

723
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:13,103
Did he ever get professional help?

724
00:55:13,187 --> 00:55:14,354
<i>He did not.</i>

725
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:18,400
<i>He suffered from neither.</i>

726
00:55:19,776 --> 00:55:21,904
<i>No guilt, no grief.</i>

727
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:25,157
<i>We kept waiting for it.</i>

728
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,744
<i>We surrounded him
with family support,</i>

729
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:34,666
<i>certain that once the shock wore off,
the suffering would begin.</i>

730
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,295
<i>But it never did.</i>

731
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:44,468
<i>Jonathan doesn't know
how to suffer.</i>

732
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:49,556
<i>After his sister was killed,</i>

733
00:55:50,974 --> 00:55:53,352
<i>he never even said
he was sorry.</i>

734
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:58,774
<i>After his sister was killed,
he never said another word about it.</i>

735
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:03,111
<i>He just went on living here,</i>

736
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,073
<i>until he was old enough
to leave,</i>

737
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:08,825
<i>and never come back.</i>

738
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:12,246
<i>Which is what he did.</i>

739
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,920
<i>Her name was Katie,
and he was responsible...</i>

740
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:22,673
<i>That he allowed her to wander...
She was 4. Out of the house...</i>

741
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:25,759
And that after, he suffered
neither guilt nor grief.

742
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:28,262
<i>Grace,
I want to be very clear.</i>

743
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:31,139
<i>I want to understand
exactly what you're telling me.</i>

744
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:33,267
<i>You're saying that Jonathan's mother</i>

745
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:37,312
<i>said he suffered
from neither guilt, nor grief.</i>

746
00:56:38,522 --> 00:56:42,568
In essence, his own mother
identified him as a sociopath.

747
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:46,487
Yes.

748
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:49,950
Jesus.

749
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,974
