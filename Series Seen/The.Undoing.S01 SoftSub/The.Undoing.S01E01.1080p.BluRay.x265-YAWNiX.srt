00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,654
<i>Why hasn't she come back?</i>

17
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,156
Mm-hm.

18
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:19,659
It's crap. It's...

19
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,703
- Could you turn that down a bit? Please.
- What?

20
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,373
I'm trying to concentrate
on a very delicate operation.

21
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,291
Blenders don't have volume control.

22
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,877
That's a pathetic excuse.
Just turn it down, anyway.

23
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:31,963
- Dad.
- Yeah?

24
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,716
I did some research last night.

25
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,758
Yes?

26
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,261
On golden doodles.

27
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,513
- Oh, God...
- And they don't shed.

28
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:41,223
- They're hypoallergenic.
- No, no.

29
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,866
- They're really, really cute.
- Listen, Hen. We're not having...

30
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,061
- Tell him. It's the dog thing again.
- But why, Dad?

31
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,438
We can't have a dog
because, as I've said before,

32
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:50,357
all dogs make my throat close up,

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,609
so no air gets to my lungs,
which makes me die.

34
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,361
So, it's undesirable.

35
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:55,695
- But...
- Think of another pet.

36
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,823
You can have a cat or a hamster.

37
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,699
I don't know what kids have these days.

38
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,326
Have a vampire bat.

39
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:05,664
- Is that a promise?
- Yes. That is a promise.

40
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:09,626
Like the promise of a road trip, too?

41
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,044
Just you and me?

42
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,088
That's a low blow. That will happen.

43
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,251
- Will it?
- It will happen.

44
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:15,841
Shit, my violin!

45
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,153
- Help me, please. I don't know why.
- What is going on?

46
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,262
I'm suddenly 6 years old.

47
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:24,349
Oh, God. All right. Why the tie, hmm?

48
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:26,393
Not another funeral?

49
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,146
- It's The Turd's idea.
- Oh.

50
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,524
And no, no. Not all my patients die, anyway.

51
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,486
Why are you so dressed up?
What's his name?

52
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,573
Ladies' tea. Planning the fundraiser.

53
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:42,617
Oh, the school auction.
Did I mention I'm not going?

54
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,495
- Oh, did I mention you are?
- I think you'll find I'm not, my love.

55
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,873
Isn't it enough
we give them tons of money?

56
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,183
We actually don't give them money.

57
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:51,168
- Your dad does, which is sweet of him.
- Uh-huh.

58
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,670
Reminds me, we have dinner with him
next Thursday.

59
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:56,256
Right. So, I have Reardon
and your dad in the same week.

60
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,676
I'm just the luckiest girl in New York.

61
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,927
Don't you like Reardon?

62
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,388
Well, do you like Reardon?
You like your school?

63
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:04,473
- Yeah.
- Hey.

64
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,849
Then I love it. Kiss your mom.

65
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,225
- We have to go.
- Mom...

66
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:09,909
- No, I'm not kissing Mom. You do it.
- You need to clean this up.

67
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:13,398
- I'm not doing this every single morning.
- I know, I want to kiss you. I like this.

68
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:14,983
Yeah. Right.

69
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,693
- Henry? Henry?
- What?

70
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,696
No more smoothies.
You never, ever clean up...

71
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,591
All right,
here's a question and don't lie.

72
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:24,576
Did you, in fact,
practice that thing at all this week?

73
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,827
Because I heard nothing.

74
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:26,995
No, I practiced.

75
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,205
- Really?
- Yeah. I swear.

76
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,043
Do you know,
he doesn't even think I'm any good.

77
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,294
Mr. Rosenbaum.

78
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,338
He actually said that, did he?

79
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,507
No. It's not that he says it.

80
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,758
It just...

81
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,636
He used to say a lot more good stuff.

82
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:45,555
I mean, sometimes with the looks
he gives me,

83
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,098
like, I think he wants me to quit.

84
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:50,101
Well, is it possible that,
as your mom might say,

85
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,145
you're actually projecting that sentiment.

86
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,314
Because somewhere deep down,

87
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,984
in the bowels of your teenage psyche,
you actually want to give it up.

88
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,611
I don't want to give up.

89
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,905
- I love violin.
- Okay, well, that's great, then.

90
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,865
You know, Rosenbaum,
he's an unhappy man.

91
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,408
It is never a good idea

92
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:08,495
to take measure of ourselves
through the eyes of the joyless.

93
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,789
Well, you can be joyless.

94
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,876
- Beg your pardon?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,462
You can be joyless when you're stressed.

96
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:18,880
Do I seem stressed a lot?

97
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:20,506
Some.

98
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:22,092
Lately.

99
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:25,345
Ah. Brilliant. Well, now I'm...

100
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,597
Now I'm stressed
about being stressed, so...

101
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,808
- thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

102
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,435
You don't play your violin
for Rosenbaum, anyway.

103
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,397
You owe him your respect
and your hard work, but in the end,

104
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,148
your relationship with song

105
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:39,526
is between you and your music.

106
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,820
- Got it.
- Great. And you're brilliant, okay?

107
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,071
So, fuck Rosenbaum.

108
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,364
I'm telling Mom you said that.

109
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,492
Take your violin and shove it up
his Rosenbaum cheeks, okay?

110
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:48,576
Dad...

111
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,724
- Morning.
- Good morning.

112
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,478
Rebecca Harkness has arrived
way too early.

113
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,063
Oh, great.

114
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,191
- It doesn't make any sense to me.
- Huh.

115
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,569
One minute, he's attentive, loving.

116
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:25,405
The next minute he's borderline abusive.

117
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:29,034
I got both swings last night.
The full pendulum.

118
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:32,912
And fucking forbid I call him bipolar.

119
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,915
I mean, fucking forbid!

120
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,794
So, you're back to thinking
that he's, um... That he's bipolar.

121
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,921
I don't know. The mood swings...

122
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:44,131
What do you think?

123
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,344
Well, I don't know him.

124
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,347
- I only know you.
- Meaning?

125
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,687
- Do not give me that look.
- This is your third marriage. Isn't it?

126
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,773
So, what, we're keeping score?

127
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,441
No. No, I'm just...

128
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:03,735
I'm not doing that.

129
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,279
Okay, this is going somewhere,
and I'm not exactly sure where,

130
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,948
other than a direction not in my favor.
So, just say it.

131
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,244
- Say it! I pay you. Say it.
- Re...

132
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:15,246
Rebecca.

133
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,836
I have met few people
more discriminating than you.

134
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,216
You read 100 Yelp reviews before choosing
someone to install your carpet.

135
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:30,845
Am I right? You try on 20 pairs of shoes
before making a choice.

136
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,014
You do background checks
on your hair colorist.

137
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:34,974
You did a background check on me,
no doubt.

138
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,435
You vet everything. Everything.

139
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,519
Which is fine.

140
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,563
- I mean, that's appropriate.
- But?

141
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:43,316
But an attractive man comes along...

142
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:46,861
and shows an interest in you,
and judgment be gone.

143
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,613
That is not what is happening.

144
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,532
I mean, the day that you met Kevin,

145
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,826
you floated into this office.

146
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,704
It was an appointment that was made
to deal with the anguish

147
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:56,996
of husband number two,

148
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,582
only to declare that you'd met
husband number three.

149
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,251
So, I'm saying...

150
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,379
maybe it's possible...

151
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,842
that you're less of a victim
of Kevin's moods than you are of your own.

152
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,844
So, excuse me, this is my fault?

153
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,513
- No.
- It is. You're blaming me.

154
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,141
I'm not blaming you.
I'm just saying there's a particular

155
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,934
type of person that you want to be with,

156
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,561
and maybe you're a little too quick

157
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,896
to see that person in the men that you meet,

158
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,065
instead of seeing what's actually there.

159
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:30,363
<i>Oh, well,
I'll probably never see her again</i>

160
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:33,032
<i>because they hire you
to give them the hard truths,</i>

161
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,618
<i>and then they fire you
for delivering them.</i>

162
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:37,537
Well, so just up your prices.

163
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,457
The more exclusive you seem,
the more she'll come begging.

164
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,833
Wow.

165
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,377
I have some bad news. The, um...

166
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:49,048
The dress code for the fundraiser
is fancy-glam.

167
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:50,425
I'm not wearing a tux.

168
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,510
<i>Listen, this is
for Henry's school.</i>

169
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:56,931
If I can tough out a ladies' tea,
you can stomach one fundraiser.

170
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:57,973
For Henry.

171
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:00,478
I will do it.
But not for Henry's school.

172
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,853
I will do it for you.

173
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:03,687
Because you're hot.

174
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:06,566
Anyway, I'm here. Okay?

175
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,568
Later, smart-ass.

176
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,819
Yeah, later. Bye.

177
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,285
- Come in.
- Hi.

178
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,080
- Let me take your coat.
- Yes.

179
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:24,375
They're waiting for you upstairs.

180
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,379
Hello!

181
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:30,215
- Sorry I'm late.
- Not a problem.

182
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,135
- We have a new mom. A scholarship.
- Oh.

183
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,282
She brought her infant.
She's changing her in the bathroom.

184
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,848
You look fabulous.

185
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,451
- Oh, hi, Grace.
- Hi.

186
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,060
Is she, uh, on the committee?

187
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,978
Wants to be an involved parent.

188
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,855
Hi. Hi, hi. Sorry.

189
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:48,149
- Hey.
- Thanks.

190
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,276
Did any of you even know
that she was coming?

191
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,570
I mean, I'm usually the first one
to learn of anything.

192
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,113
People can't wait to tell me stuff.

193
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,366
Because you're so quick
to disapprove.

194
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,951
Well, exactly.

195
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,763
- We should get going here.
- Sorry.

196
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:05,041
Somebody's a bit nervous.
She's back to being the auctioneer.

197
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,853
- You got the guy from Sotheby's.
- No, he dropped out.

198
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,380
- We'll be fine. I've done this before.
- Hi.

199
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,965
Hi. Hi.

200
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,925
I'm Grace Fraser.

201
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,177
Elena Alves. Nice to meet you.

202
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,137
- Hi.
- Elena has a boy in fourth grade.

203
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,889
You said his name was Miguel?

204
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,559
- Yeah, yeah.
- Your baby's gorgeous.

205
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,269
- Thank you.
- Hello. Boy or girl?

206
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:25,728
Girl. Teresa.

207
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:27,272
Oh. Teresa.

208
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,607
- I love your eyelashes.
- Okay, come on, folks.

209
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:30,942
The auction's tomorrow.

210
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,777
Thank you so much for letting me join.

211
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:35,905
Are you kidding?
We're happy to get all the help we can.

212
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,533
That you even have the time with two kids.

213
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,535
I have twins, so regret it.

214
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,703
Jolene!

215
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:44,914
I mean, they're so much work, right?

216
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:48,793
Okay, let's, uh...
Let's rank the items.

217
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,712
- Yes.
- We'll start with the least expensive.

218
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:54,007
Work our way up to the... The big tickets.

219
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,717
There's a lot of stuff here.

220
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,928
Well, we have over 200 people
confirmed coming, that's a record.

221
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,598
Thanks to the Spensers lending us
their home.

222
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,558
I did a walk-through yesterday.
Oh, my God.

223
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,893
Did you see the David Hockneys?

224
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,769
Two, on facing walls in the dining room.

225
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,606
- And what about Suki's closet?
- Oh, I'll get there.

226
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,107
Maybe Monday night, with any luck.

227
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,191
Yes!

228
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,068
Okay, let's do this.

229
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:17,697
Okay, we got four separate stays
in the Hamptons.

230
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,074
A pair in Vale and Aspen.

231
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,410
A cooking lesson at Tribeca for eight.

232
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:23,995
You never know how much those go for.

233
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,718
Stem-cell face-lift.
Does anybody really believe in those?

234
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,459
Kathy Sennot got one.
Did not work.

235
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,085
We have a bunch of consults.

236
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:33,606
A college admissions counselor.
A pre-school admissions counselor.

237
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,341
A genealogist that'll come to your house.
That could actually go.

238
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,927
I don't see any artists.
Where are the artists?

239
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,405
Are you saying
we can't scratch up one lousy playwright

240
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:42,972
in all of New York City?

241
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:45,475
Grace, maybe you could donate
a therapy session.

242
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,560
I am not doing that. That is not happening.

243
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,146
Why not? "Do I hear $500
on saving your marriage?"

244
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,649
Uh, 500, and I will throw in my husband.

245
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:54,335
Grace, you know
what would be awesome?

246
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,194
I think Jonathan would be a huge get.

247
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:57,987
You want to auction Jonathan?

248
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,531
- Well...
- Yes! I'm putting him up.

249
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,700
Grace's husband is a doctor.

250
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,702
- He was featured in <i>New York</i> magazine.
- Oh.

251
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:07,705
He's an oncologist, Sally.
Who's gonna bid on cancer?

252
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,793
A private, after-hours tour
at the Guggenheim.

253
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:15,046
They're doing the Salon de la Rose Croix.

254
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,882
You know, I was just there
on Tuesday for the Chagall exhibit.

255
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:20,593
I swear, I actually felt light-headed.

256
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,261
I don't really get Chagall.

257
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,014
I mean, who doesn't get Chagall?

258
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:27,517
Me. One minute he's a modernist.

259
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,436
Then it's stained glass.
The guy's all over the place.

260
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,690
If he were alive today,
they'd put him on Prozac...

261
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,670
Hey. Hold on.

262
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,299
Tell me that wasn't odd. My God.

263
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,927
She was just feeding her child.

264
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,013
Oh, no. No, no, no.

265
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:07,181
There was definitely
something more going on.

266
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,350
- Excuse me. Like she was...
<i>- Like what?</i>

267
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,437
Point! Point your foot!

268
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,898
Like she was being passive-aggressive
about it. You didn't get that?

269
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,109
No.

270
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,319
You know, I've seen her
at the school before.

271
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,865
<i>Sitting across the street
on one of those benches.</i>

272
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,914
<i>After she drops her son off,
she just sits there.</i>

273
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,542
<i>With the baby?</i>

274
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:37,062
<i>Now with the baby.
When she was pregnant,</i>

275
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,047
she wouldn't even be reading a book.

276
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,925
I feel like telling her, "You live in New York.
It is a crime not to be frantically busy."

277
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:45,470
Who just sits around quietly?

278
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,473
What an unfathomable state of being.

279
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,599
Albeit with...

280
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:52,852
spectacular breasts.

281
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:56,647
- <i>Oh, my God. They were beautiful.</i>
- You're bad.

282
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,567
Up, up, up, up, up, up.
Tall. Get your...

283
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,028
Don't let your... Shoulders down.
Shoulders down.

284
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,238
Stop smiling. Stop smiling!

285
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,932
Elena, what's wrong?

286
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,234
<i>It was hostile.
It just was.</i>

287
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,112
But I don't blame her.
I mean, we were talking about art.

288
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:47,073
We were talking about money.
It was pretty vulgar.

289
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:51,452
And she was just trying to say, hey,
here I am, I'm a real, real woman.

290
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:54,163
I'm a real mom. I'm struggling, and...

291
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:55,205
I don't know.

292
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,376
Sometimes I think
we should move out of the city.

293
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,797
Said the most New York person
I've ever met in my life.

294
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,591
No, but don't you worry sometimes

295
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:07,677
that you're raising your son in a bubble?

296
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,930
I thought that was the whole essence
of modern parenting, isn't it?

297
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,432
Keep them protected from reality
for as long as possible,

298
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:16,561
so that when they finally emerge,
they can't cope and end up self-harming.

299
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,896
- I thought we were doing really well at that.
- Well...

300
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:22,066
Wow. What about Schenectady, huh?

301
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:25,570
I hear nice things about Schenectady.

302
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,905
It sounds horrible. Even phonetically.

303
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,075
So, is this a serious conversation?

304
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,201
Yeah.

305
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:37,331
Yep. Manhattan is a lonely place.
I mean, when you think about it,

306
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,667
we don't have a lot of close friends.

307
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,878
Well, that's only 'cause we hate everyone.

308
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:44,881
You hate everyone. I don't.

309
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,383
I wouldn't call us isolated.

310
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,511
Our days are stuffed
with people and their problems.

311
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:53,264
I mean, we're right up close with them
at their most vulnerable.

312
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,391
It's not a conventional social life,

313
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,435
but in terms
of meaningful human interaction,

314
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:58,936
I would say we did very well.

315
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,396
Mmm.

316
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,649
- I don't like you being lonely.
- Well...

317
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:07,069
You lonely in there?

318
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:09,989
Would you like some company?

319
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,744
Would you like to be washed, Grace?

320
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,829
Dr. Fraser, with his magic hands.

321
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,874
- God!
- Shall I get my rubber gloves?

322
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,126
- Come on. Come in.
- I'm coming, Grace.

323
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,150
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

324
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:14,178
Grace?

325
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:15,471
Hi.

326
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:17,974
Elena.

327
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,101
We met at the fundraiser committee.

328
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,645
- Yes, yes. Of course.
- How are you?

329
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:26,816
- I'm... I'm well.
- Good.

330
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,903
Thank you so much
for making me feel so welcome.

331
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,698
Like, the other women...

332
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,701
I don't know, I felt like an intruder.

333
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,745
But you made me feel at home. So...

334
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,039
Thank you.

335
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:45,084
Well, I know that, um...

336
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:47,878
everybody is very happy to have you there.

337
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:49,964
We need all the help we can get.

338
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:56,512
How can I help?

339
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:01,392
'Cause nobody actually
made me do anything.

340
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,769
Um... I suppose...

341
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,149
Because most of the work
was already done, and...

342
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,819
And you were occupied
with your sweet baby.

343
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:12,902
Yeah.

344
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,489
But I want to be a part of it.

345
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:17,908
At school.

346
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:20,745
I really do.

347
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
I know.

348
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,209
I really do.

349
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,018
She was just standing there.

350
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:45,602
Naked.

351
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:48,773
Yeah?

352
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:52,276
I'm all for women being comfortable
with their bodies,

353
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,861
but it was...

354
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,739
- Weird.
- Good weird?

355
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:01,452
Were you a little bit aroused?

356
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,080
- No.
- Oh, Christ. We're nearly there.

357
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:07,833
The sooner we can get out, the better.
Look, I've got that early flight to Cleveland.

358
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,835
When do you get back?

359
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,546
Possibly tomorrow night,
if I can get away,

360
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,174
but, you know, I do hate to forfeit
my Hyatt reward points.

361
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,927
That's how you get
the complimentary breakfast, Grace.

362
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:19,678
Okay, here we are.

363
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,847
Slump, dread, sob.

364
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,308
- Despair.
- Look at me.

365
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,850
Mmm.

366
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,355
I'm very proud of my wife. Come on.

367
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,490
Oh, Christ. They're coming.

368
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:40,908
Hold the elevator!

369
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,535
Oh, sorry. Sorry!

370
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,705
- Couldn't face it.
- You're so bad.

371
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,544
Profound and existential dread.

372
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,929
- Hi. May I take your coat?
- Thank you.

373
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,347
Thank you.

374
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,144
Thank you.

375
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,945
- Champagne?
- Thank you.

376
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,239
Thank God. Thank you.
I love you very much.

377
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:24,577
I thought there was gonna be some glam,
I didn't think this much.

378
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,997
Can we hide?

379
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,624
Let's go and pretend to be interested
in those Hockneys, hm?

380
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,585
No, we're stuck here for a bit.

381
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,463
We have to have cocktails
with the headmaster first.

382
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:37,298
- Come on. Robert.
- Christ.

383
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,716
- Grace.
- Hi.

384
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,342
- Jonathan.
- Hey.

385
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:41,802
Thank you both so much for coming.

386
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,179
- There you are.
- It's a...

387
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,763
- Hello.
- Dad.

388
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,015
Franklin.

389
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,184
Such an honor and a privilege, sir.

390
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,643
You left out thrill.

391
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,729
Yes, I did.

392
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,190
Well, thank you for coming.

393
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,858
I'm not coming. I'm going.

394
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,944
- Really? Now?
- I've been on the silent auction.

395
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,155
I'm apt to win one of Henry Ford's

396
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,532
- original dipsticks.
- Mmm!

397
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:06,535
I would like to be long gone
before that happens.

398
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,287
- Jonathan.
- Franklin.

399
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,413
You're looking well.

400
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:12,500
I am? Very surprising, thank you.

401
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,252
- Dinner Thursday?
- Absolutely.

402
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:16,336
- Hello.
- Hi.

403
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:18,547
- Hi. Hi, hi.
- Hello, darling.

404
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,300
- Jonathan.
- Franklin.

405
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,177
You're not gonna fucking believe this.

406
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,970
- What?
- They're not even here.

407
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:26,597
- Who?
- The Spensers.

408
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,517
- Oh.
- What, you don't think that's rude?

409
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,644
We could take it as rude. Or it could be:

410
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:36,190
"Well, we're gonna be out of town,
happy to let you use our palace."

411
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,359
Can't you ever just be not nice?

412
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,152
Oh, she can, I promise you.

413
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:41,904
You hear those fucks didn't show?

414
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,490
It's a fabulous turnout.
I was worried people wouldn't show,

415
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,534
and it seems that absolutely
everybody is here,

416
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,035
so we can relax.

417
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:50,286
There she is.

418
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,749
Oh, our lactator-in-chief.

419
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,792
She looks a bit uncomfortable.

420
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,961
That's the mom
I was telling you about.

421
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,713
- Oh, that's her? The nudist?
- Mm-hm.

422
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:00,881
I want those boobs.

423
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:04,593
We should go talk to her.
She must be feeling so awkward.

424
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:07,096
Actually, she seems okay.

425
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,473
Mmm, maybe better than okay.

426
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:12,619
- Am I missing something?
- Look at the men.

427
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,228
Like Pavlov's dogs.

428
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,897
Grace, I think she might be looking at you.

429
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,275
Really? Is she?

430
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,736
Uh, yeah. I think she is.

431
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,323
Well, here you all are. I think
they'd like to get started. It's bidding time.

432
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,677
- Start herding the people.
- All right. Here we go.

433
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:29,701
Come on.

434
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,329
Is that enough? We've put in an appearance.

435
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:33,581
- Would you stop?
- Can we go?

436
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,584
Hey. I'll make it up to you later.

437
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,254
Make it up to me now. Let's find a room.
They must have a few.

438
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:43,465
- You're so bad.
- Come on. In Suki's closet.

439
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:46,135
- In Suki's clothes. Both of us.
- Stop!

440
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,387
Make an Englishman happy. Come on.

441
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:50,763
All right.

442
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,906
- You know what I love about this?
- What?

443
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:57,271
You could never tell they were rich.
It's all so classy and understated.

444
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,898
Hi. We're ready to start.

445
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:01,442
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

446
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,236
I'm Sally Mayberry,
head of the auction committee

447
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,488
for our wonderful Reardon school!

448
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:13,912
We have a positively fabulous afternoon
in store for you.

449
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,206
Now, some of you might be thinking:

450
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,335
"Don't I already pay enough in tuition?"

451
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,295
Damn right!

452
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,464
Yes. Of course you do.

453
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,090
Yes, I feel the same way.

454
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:27,468
But it is our responsibility

455
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,595
to make sure that Reardon can accept

456
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,472
the students it wants to accept,

457
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,891
and that those students are able to attend,

458
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,851
despite their financial circumstances,

459
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,228
ensuring that the name Reardon is always

460
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,190
synonymous with diversity!

461
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,026
Hear, hear!

462
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:47,905
And of course, we have to make sure
that our teachers are so well paid

463
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,115
that we do not lose them to other schools.

464
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,785
We love our teachers at Reardon!

465
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,913
- Just not enough to invite them to the party.
- Shoosh.

466
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,999
Okay, now, Diane Porter is gonna
start the party.

467
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,125
Let's go!

468
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,756
Before we turn
to our scheduled items for bid,

469
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,217
observe.

470
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:12,012
This may look like an ordinary glass
of tap water,

471
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:13,931
but it is much more than that.

472
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:17,685
This is very special water

473
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,896
that will serve to prime the pipes

474
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,315
to your generously deep pockets.

475
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,236
What is the value, you may ask,

476
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,113
of an ordinary glass of tap water?

477
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,489
That depends.

478
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,867
What is the value
of your children's education?

479
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,037
The value of his or her teachers?

480
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,790
The opportunity of the less fortunate

481
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,210
to enjoy the privilege of your offspring?

482
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:48,382
Who will bid 1,000 dollars

483
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,051
for this glass of water?

484
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:54,263
Who is gonna stand up and clang that bell?

485
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:55,514
One thousand!

486
00:25:55,597 --> 00:26:00,060
One thousand dollars!
Thank you. Money for our kids.

487
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,730
- Two thousand!
- Two thousand!

488
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,065
Three thousand, thank you, ma'am.

489
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,276
Five thousand, right there!

490
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,528
- Eight!
- Eight thousand, right here!

491
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,531
- I bid ten!
- Ten thousand!

492
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,284
Ten thousand!

493
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,292
Elena. Sorry...

494
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,002
- I...
- Sorry.

495
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,006
Are you okay?

496
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,398
I'm sorry.

497
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:53,489
'Cause sometimes I just feel...
overwhelmed.

498
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,618
And lost.

499
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,412
- Mm.
- Like...

500
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,083
Do you ever feel that?

501
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,087
If you ever want to talk...

502
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,549
for free... Uh...

503
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:15,718
- I apologize.
- Don't...

504
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,596
I didn't mean it to sound like that.

505
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,640
But if you do ever wanna talk...

506
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,102
You're so kind.

507
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,229
Thank you.

508
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,315
And, please, don't be intimidated.

509
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,193
The parents at Reardon
can be a little, um...

510
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

511
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:35,947
But...

512
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,993
most of them are very kind. They're...

513
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:43,664
They are nice people. Kind people. And...

514
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,582
But you are the most kind.

515
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,460
It's true.

516
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,046
I feel it.

517
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,224
All right, our next item,

518
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,309
Knicks tickets. Wow.

519
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,770
You can rub elbows with Spike Lee.

520
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,730
Pitch him your idea for a new movie.

521
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,775
Hey, you never know.
They might even win the game.

522
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,004
All right. Who's gonna take
these tickets off my hands?

523
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,573
Let's start the bidding at 1,500.

524
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,634
- Thank you.
- Fifteen hundred, right here!

525
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:20,951
Two thousand, in the front.

526
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,078
Twenty-five hundred. Do I hear 3,000?

527
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,204
Three thousand over here.

528
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,664
- Thirty-five?
- Yeah.

529
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,600
- Four thousand, near the piano.
- Right here!

530
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,918
Six thousand dollars!

531
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:33,130
- Going once, going twice...
- Elena?

532
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,299
Oh, hi.

533
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:38,218
I'm going home 'cause I forgot to pump

534
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:39,928
and it's getting a bit uncomfortable.

535
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,972
Well, I have a car.

536
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,141
My driver could take you, if you want.

537
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,144
- Oh. Oh, no, I'm...
- Please.

538
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:51,523
I'm in Harlem,
so it'll be faster to take the subway.

539
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,318
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

540
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,320
But thank you.

541
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,576
Oh, hey. It's all right.

542
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,334
Thank you.

543
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:12,794
For your kindness.

544
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,563
Do I hear 80? Eighty thousand?

545
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,690
Gentleman in the front. Ninety?

546
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,276
Ninety thousand. If we reach 100,000,

547
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,779
we'll donate a C-class to a child in need.

548
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:42,950
So, what was all that?

549
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,118
What's going on with you and the nudist?

550
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:49,957
Oh, she was upset, and she just, um...

551
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:54,044
I suggested she use our car,
but she didn't want to, so...

552
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,213
You are a very nice person.

553
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,296
Come here.

554
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:00,968
I love you.

555
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,691
- Thank you so much!
- I love you.

556
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,012
It's been an incredible evening!

557
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:07,140
You raised so much money
for a good cause! Thank you.

558
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:15,315
We're good?

559
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,154
- Well, you're not gonna be happy.
- What?

560
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,281
- I just got paged.
- Mm-hm.

561
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,326
Shelby McGibbon's lungs
just filled up with fluid.

562
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,495
Go.

563
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,872
You want to come?
Legitimate excuse to duck out early.

564
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:34,334
- The driver could drop me at the hospital?
- Oh, I can't. I'm on the committee.

565
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:36,003
- Go. Go, go. Take the driver.
- Really?

566
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,255
- I'll Uber.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll call.

567
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,722
- Where's he going?
- Emergency. One of his patients.

568
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:50,017
Honestly, staring down cancer
every day with children,

569
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,893
maintaining a sense of humor all the while.

570
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,186
How does he do it?

571
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,730
I wonder myself.

572
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,526
<i>Ten dollars.</i>

573
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,570
<i>Yep.
You have my solemn word.</i>

574
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,197
<i>You can trust me.
I'm a doctor.</i>

575
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,908
<i>Ten bucks
if I beat leukemia.</i>

576
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,533
Yeah.

577
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:53,663
I mean, if you prefer,
I could give you a whole talk about, uh...

578
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:57,667
you know, being brave and fighting
and all that sort of stuff.

579
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,545
But I do find, generally speaking,
money works best.

580
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,548
How about 10 dollars,

581
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,218
and when I apply to medical school,

582
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:09,012
you write my recommendation.

583
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,972
I don't know. I don't know, Shelby.

584
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:14,810
I'd have to see your transcripts
because I can't recommend just anyone.

585
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:16,603
You could be awful.

586
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,315
Am I going to die?

587
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,319
You're not gonna die.

588
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,240
If you die, I'll kill you.

589
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:58,687
Hey.

590
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,360
Did everything go okay?

591
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,122
Oh, no.

592
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,749
I'm so sorry.

593
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,921
- Honey.
- Yeah.

594
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:27,757
Fuck.

595
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:31,886
Oh.

596
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:43,732
Hey.

597
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:40,746
Where is she?

598
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,123
She's in her studio.

599
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,085
Why hasn't she come back?

600
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,587
She's working, okay?

601
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,299
You think you can take yourself
to school today?

602
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,218
Catch the bus outside?

603
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:54,427
Yeah.

604
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,805
Go get your things. You're gonna be late.

605
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,180
- Henry?
- Uh-huh.

606
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,099
Come on. Have you eaten?

607
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,893
- Yeah.
- We got to go 'cause I'm, uh...

608
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,104
I'm late, and I got an early session.

609
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,648
- Quick! Put those books away.
- Yeah. Okay.

610
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
Mom.

611
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,698
I don't think
Dad is actually allergic to dogs.

612
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,074
I think he just says it.

613
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:01,995
Yeah. You're right.

614
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,622
It's not about being allergic.

615
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:08,293
He would never want me to tell you this,
so don't say anything, all right?

616
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:09,376
Okay.

617
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,964
But when he was younger,
he was actually your age,

618
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,259
he was home alone,
he was taking care of the family dog,

619
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:17,761
it got out of the house...

620
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:20,889
and it was hit by a car and killed.

621
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,434
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

622
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,645
I mean, it was very traumatic for him.

623
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:31,316
And it was actually made worse
because his parents...

624
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,570
- blamed him for it.
- What?

625
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:38,365
Yeah. That's why he hates talking about it.

626
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,077
What kind of dog?

627
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,913
Um... What kind of...

628
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,206
I think it was...

629
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:48,083
It was a small dog.

630
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,501
That's what I know.

631
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,504
Anyway, I honestly don't think
he's ever gotten over it.

632
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,424
Quick. Put everything away,
would you? Let's go.

633
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,843
- Put your coat on. It's freezing outside.
- All right.

634
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,392
<i>At some point,
you are gonna have to talk about it.</i>

635
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,435
The why of it all.

636
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,938
It had nothing to do with us. Or you.

637
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,398
- Bullshit!
- Here we go.

638
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,941
So, what was it about, then?

639
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,109
Just sex?

640
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:17,570
If I had a clue, I wouldn't be here
paying these criminally high rates.

641
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,489
We are paying these criminally high rates.

642
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,741
That's just a bit deflective,
isn't it, Joseph?

643
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:25,578
Is it possible that you were drawn
to the secret of it all?

644
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,456
Maybe more than you were
to this other man, Dennis?

645
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,542
The affair got to be yours alone?

646
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,837
Michael couldn't know about it,
so he couldn't micromanage it?

647
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,756
I don't think that's it.

648
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,574
I'm sorry. Are we keeping you
from something?

649
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:48,560
I apologize. This is my son's school.

650
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,688
It is programmed for emergencies only,
so I do have to take it.

651
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,406
Now, you said you knew Dennis
when you were single

652
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:02,866
but never had sex with him then.

653
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,534
I wasn't even attracted to him then.

654
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,161
No one was. He's not attractive.

655
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,204
- Okay.
- Exactly. Then what changed?

656
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,124
Part of the thrill of adultery is that

657
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:15,587
it exists in the shadow
of a primary relationship.

658
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,882
It's the clandestine part of it
that provides much of the erotic jolt.

659
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:20,884
Could that have been it here?

660
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:21,967
The lie?

661
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:27,307
What about the fear of getting caught?

662
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,977
Maybe you wanted to get caught.

663
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:32,895
Why would I want that?

664
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,273
To show Michael
that he can't control you after all.

665
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,487
I think this is more about Michael
and your marriage

666
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,448
than it is about this other man.

667
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,957
He doesn't always love
when other people are right.

668
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,088
So, you wanted to get caught.

669
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,010
I think I better check on him.

670
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:08,681
So, we're gonna try
and get the new protocol

671
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,893
for the pro-bono work in place
as soon as possible.

672
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,987
- Sylvia?
- Just a sec.

673
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,824
It's my daughter's school. Excuse me.

674
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:28,677
- Excuse me.
- Sylvia, can it wait?

675
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:29,744
Two minutes.

676
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,248
- Is this going to affect...?
- Did you hear?

677
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:34,915
What?

678
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,378
The school's, a family...
It was a family tragedy?

679
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:39,837
<i>- A fourth grader?</i>
- Grace.

680
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:45,260
It was Elena.

681
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:47,678
<i>What?</i>

682
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:50,181
She was found dead.

683
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,101
What?

684
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,312
<i>Well, didn't you get
the school alert?</i>

685
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,398
Yes. What happened?

686
00:39:58,481 --> 00:39:59,816
There's been no official word.

687
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,735
- At first I heard...
- aneurysm, but...

688
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:05,655
<i>What the school
is being told is that...</i>

689
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,157
<i>she was murdered.</i>

690
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,414
What?

691
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:16,916
<i>- I know.</i>
- Oh, my God.

692
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,045
And, apparently her son,
the poor thing, discovered her.

693
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,172
God, this is awful, um...

694
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:27,176
What do they know?
Do they know who did it?

695
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,763
No. Nobody seems to really know...
anything.

696
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:34,183
<i>- I cannot bear it. That poor woman.</i>
- I know.

697
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:36,144
And that poor little boy. It's...

698
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,646
You know, they're looking for the husband.

699
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:42,191
They are.
Evidently, they were having problems.

700
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,985
It's always the fucking husband.

701
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:45,987
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

702
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,698
<i>Letting his own son discover
his mother like that?</i>

703
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:49,741
Oh...

704
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:51,886
You know what, actually,
I'm right in the middle of a meeting,

705
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:53,703
so I'm gonna call you later
when I know more.

706
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:54,787
<i>Yeah.</i>

707
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:06,633
Did I do something wrong?

708
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:10,511
- No. I just...
- You seem unnerved.

709
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:12,472
- Really?
- Yeah. Just...

710
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,723
Do I unnerve you?

711
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:17,517
No.

712
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,895
Well, you would tell me?

713
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:20,980
If I did something wrong.

714
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,982
You didn't do anything wrong.

715
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,026
- Okay?
- Okay.

716
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,536
<i>How well
did you know Elena Alves?</i>

717
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,581
Not very well,
but she had just started, uh...

718
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,626
She was part of the auction committee.
I arranged to have her participate.

719
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,086
She was a scholarship mom.

720
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:44,712
I've only met her a few times.

721
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,565
- In the schoolyard.
- Do you remember what time

722
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,466
- you left the fundraiser?
- What time I left?

723
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,594
I think, uh, I was home by 11.

724
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,721
And what time did you learn
something had happened?

725
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,157
The school sent out an alert.

726
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:57,975
An alert that went out from the school
on all of our phones.

727
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:00,103
- Did you know Elena Alves?
- No, we'd met.

728
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:01,479
- Mm-hm
- I didn't know her.

729
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:05,358
The most time I've ever spent with her
was at a meeting recently at Sally's.

730
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,836
Do you know if Miguel took the bus,
or did somebody come pick him up?

731
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,279
Well, normally his mom comes
to school to pick him up.

732
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,949
- Did you know Miguel?
- Yeah, we were in math together.

733
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,992
Okay. Did you say
you knew Miguel as well?

734
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:16,956
Yeah, sometimes we played together
after school.

735
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:19,539
And did everything seem okay lately?
He's... He's okay lately?

736
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,569
<i>Hello, this is Jonathan Fraser.
I can't answer your call right now,</i>

737
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,846
<i>but I will get back to you
as soon as possible.</i>

738
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,141
<i>If this is a medical emergency,
please call 911</i>

739
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,976
<i>or go to the emergency room.</i>

740
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,938
Hi, sweetheart. It's... It's me, um...

741
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:47,442
Can you give me a call
'cause something came up at school.

742
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:50,278
Everything's fine. Henry is fine, but I...

743
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,115
I just... I just want to fill you in, um...

744
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,618
I hope Cleveland is good.

745
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:59,495
- I love you...
- Mrs. Fraser.

746
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,749
I'm Detective Paul O'Rourke, 23rd precinct.

747
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,084
Oh, my God. What happened? Is it my son?

748
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:07,795
No, it's not about your son.
I'm sorry if we frightened you. We...

749
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,338
We do that sometimes.

750
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:10,590
Right, um...

751
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:13,217
I'm Detective Joseph Mendoza. NYPD.

752
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:14,594
We just wanna talk for a minute.

753
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:16,429
Can you please just tell me what happened?

754
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:19,682
Well, the mother of a child
who attends your son's school was killed.

755
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,206
- I'm sure you heard of that.
- Yeah.

756
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:22,661
- Yeah.
- The school sent out a message.

757
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:24,979
- I'm so sorry. I just...
- No, no. No need to apologize.

758
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:26,481
- I got two kids.
- Right.

759
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:28,816
We just want to ask a few questions,
if that's okay.

760
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:30,817
Of course.

761
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:39,410
I didn't know it was Mrs. Alves
until, um... Until I spoke to a friend.

762
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:41,788
- And who was the friend?
- Um...

763
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:43,706
Sylvia Steinetz.

764
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,793
She and I are part of a committee
at the school that we serve on.

765
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:48,753
- The, uh, auction committee?
- Mm-hm.

766
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:50,254
She just joined.

767
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,649
And what time
did you learn of her death?

768
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:54,801
Hmm, let me check my phone.

769
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:01,349
Uh, at 2:46 p.m.

770
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:03,684
- From, uh, Sylvia Steinetz?
- Yes.

771
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:06,479
Is that important? What time I got the call?

772
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,898
Well, you're a shrink, right?

773
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:11,484
You only ask the important stuff?

774
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:16,405
She wasn't, um, a patient of mine,
Mrs. Alves.

775
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:17,949
She was a... She...

776
00:44:18,032 --> 00:44:19,826
I mean, I wasn't treating her.

777
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,285
How well did you know her?

778
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:25,665
Uh, not well. As I said, she'd only
just joined the committee.

779
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:27,583
And you saw her last when?

780
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:30,378
I saw her last night, at the benefit.

781
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:32,964
And you didn't talk to her
after that?

782
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,005
No.

783
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:38,554
Did you notice anyone
Mrs. Alves might have spoken to?

784
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:46,394
I mean, there were just some men
who were paying her special attention.

785
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:48,497
What do you mean, special attention?

786
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,815
No, I mean, the special attention

787
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:53,234
that men sometimes pay to a woman.

788
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:56,946
And what about Mrs. Alves' husband?

789
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,448
Was he there last night?

790
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,284
Not to my knowledge.

791
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:04,453
I mean, I never met him, so...

792
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,210
Do you suspect the husband of this?

793
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:14,171
Right now, we're just, uh, gathering facts.

794
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:18,092
Would it be possible for us
to speak to your husband?

795
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:21,220
Um... Well, um, why?

796
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:23,973
Well, he might have seen something.

797
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:27,184
Oh. No. No, he didn't.

798
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:30,313
So, you've spoken to him
since this news came to light?

799
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:32,398
No, but anything that he would have seen,

800
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:34,251
- I would have seen, so...
- Where's your husband now?

801
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:35,610
He's in Cleveland.

802
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:37,987
He's at an oncology convention.

803
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,238
Where's he staying?

804
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,866
- I think at a Hyatt or something.
- When did he go there?

805
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:43,659
Uh, this morning.

806
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:45,494
Early.

807
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:47,997
- Mom?
- Henry.

808
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:51,626
- Um, orchestra ran over.
- Mm-hm.

809
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:54,587
- What's going on?
- I'm just talking to these men.

810
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,381
Could you go to your room,
and I'll, um... I'll be up in a minute.

811
00:45:57,882 --> 00:46:00,134
- I'll make you a snack.
- Is everything okay?

812
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:04,388
Yes. Yep. Everything's fine.
I just need you to go upstairs,

813
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,641
and, um, I'll be right there.

814
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:09,936
Off you go. I'll be right there.

815
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:11,145
- Okay.
- Good.

816
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:15,733
Go on.

817
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:20,029
Did your son know the Alves boy?

818
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,156
Um... No.

819
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:23,950
No. I mean, they're...

820
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:25,952
They're in different grades.

821
00:46:26,035 --> 00:46:28,329
Yeah, but it's kind of a small school,
isn't it?

822
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:30,081
That's what I read on the website.

823
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:33,000
Small school, individual attention.

824
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:35,670
That's why it costs the big bucks, right?

825
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:40,883
What is the tuition there?

826
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:44,303
- How much do you pay?
- Um...

827
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:46,347
It's...

828
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,600
50,000 dollars a year.

829
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:51,936
Fifty grand. How do you think
they could afford that?

830
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,019
The Alveses?

831
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,524
I mean,
I think it was a scholarship.

832
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,444
But I don't really have
any knowledge of, uh,

833
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:03,239
the Alveses' financial circumstances.

834
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:07,243
Are we upsetting you, doctor?

835
00:47:10,371 --> 00:47:13,708
If there's anything,
anything else I can do...

836
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:15,417
Sure.

837
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:20,256
Here's my card. My cell phone.

838
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:23,009
If you can think of anything else.

839
00:47:23,092 --> 00:47:25,344
I will... I will give you a call.

840
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,220
Good.

841
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:30,057
Thank you.

842
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:31,892
Right. Thanks.

843
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,228
What was that about?

844
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:35,396
- What?
- The police.

845
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,773
- Henry...
- Are they here for the murder?

846
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:42,361
- Yeah.
- Oh, I saw it on my phone.

847
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,947
- Really?
- Yeah.

848
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:49,952
They mentioned Reardon.

849
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:53,914
Oh. Did you, um...?

850
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:55,166
Did you know the boy?

851
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:56,709
I think his name is Miguel.

852
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,504
I don't think so.

853
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:05,426
- Thank you.
- Kind of scary, huh?

854
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:07,219
This happening at your school?

855
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:08,637
How you feeling about it?

856
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:11,223
Did the father do it?

857
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:15,351
It's...

858
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:19,273
- It's too soon to know.
- Did you know her?

859
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:23,486
Um... Hm?

860
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,279
The mom who got...

861
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:27,155
Did you know her?

862
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:30,367
Not really. I mean, she was...

863
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:31,911
She was on the auction committee.

864
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:35,163
Was she nice?

865
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,207
Yeah.

866
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:39,460
Yeah, she was very nice. She...

867
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,755
She seemed a little sad.

868
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:49,553
<i>Where do you go
to school? You go to Reardon?</i>

869
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,056
Okay. What grade are you in?

870
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:55,643
- Fourth.
- Okay.

871
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:58,020
Do you like it?

872
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,189
It's all right.

873
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:04,151
So, you were gonna go to school,
but instead, you went where?

874
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:08,447
- My mom's studio.
- She's an artist?

875
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:13,494
I know it's hard.
We gotta find out who did this.

876
00:49:33,097 --> 00:49:34,890
- Hey.
- Hi.

877
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,986
Hey, honey, um, I'm sure
you're at some scintillating dinner,

878
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:50,156
but I really need you to call me
and talk about this school incident.

879
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,200
It's nothing bad with Henry,
but can you call me, please?

880
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:18,345
<i>Hyatt Regency at the Arcade.</i>

881
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:21,288

Yes.

883
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,668
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not seeing
a Jonathan Fraser.</i>

884
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,670

This is Jessica.</i>

886

<i>- Who is this?</i>

895

00:52:08,085 --> 00:52:09,128
Uh...

<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

904
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:33,402
