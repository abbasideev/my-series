You need to talk to me.

15
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,175
Now.

16
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,469
Now.

17
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:16,763
I found it at the outdoor fireplace.

18
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:23,562
- At the beach house?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,113
- In the fireplace?
- Yes.

20
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:36,116
<i>When?</i>

21
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,492
Just after we got there.

22
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,677
And why didn't you tell me?

23
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:06,813
Why do you think?

24
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,608
Do not answer my question with a question.

25
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,444
Why? Why didn't you tell me?

26
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,532
Because he killed her.

27
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,792
I didn't want him to get caught.

28
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,338
And you would have turned it over.

29
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,688
Please. Please.

30
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,741
It's Alves.

31
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,329
He had to have put it there.

32
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,038
Planted it.

33
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,501
How would he know to plant it there?

34
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:12,045
Maybe he followed us.

35
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,464
- Us?
- It was a place we went to.

36
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,091
Me and Elena.

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,094
In my family house?

38
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,138
- You son of a bitch!
- Dad. Dad. Dad!

39
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,806
- You fucking fuck!
- Stop it. Stop it!

40
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,017
- Jesus Christ.
- This could be a good thing.

41
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:29,354
Alves. His DNA could be all over that.

42
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:31,897
Do we get it tested?

43
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:33,525
This could exonerate me.

44
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,360
- Yes?
- It won't.

45
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,446
- Huh?
- It won't.

46
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:41,074
I ran it through the dishwasher.

47
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,911
- What?
- To protect you.

48
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:50,500
- I didn't kill her!
- Jonathan, shut up.

49
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,670
Henry, this is very important
for me to help your dad.

50
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,505
I absolutely must know the truth.

51
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,884
You found it in the outdoor fireplace?

52
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:00,010
Yeah.

53
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:01,844
When?

54
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,390
Just after we got to the beach house.

55
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,894
And you ran it through the dishwasher?

56
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:13,690
- Twice.
- Fuck.

57
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,775
- Okay.
- Look...

58
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:16,859
Nobody talk.

59
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,740
- Wait a minute. Henry...
- I said, nobody talk.

60
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,033
Um...

61
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:28,497
I have no knowledge
that that is the actual murder weapon.

62
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,582
I am not advising you what to do with it.

63
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,586
I also have no obligation
to alert the police.

64
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,923
Given that it has been run
through a dishwasher,

65
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:41,218
I have no reason to believe
that it will be of any evidentiary value.

66
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:43,141
- Well, of course it...
- Listen to me.

67
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:46,056
Should this hammer come to light,

68
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,141
it is game over.

69
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:51,144
It's one too many coincidences
to account for.

70
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,150
Add to that, Henry could be arrested
for obstruction of justice.

71
00:05:57,234 --> 00:06:00,028
No, they wouldn't arrest an innocent boy
for protecting his father.

72
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,821
They can, and they likely will.

73
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,031
They could arrest Henry?

74
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,075
They can blame Henry?

75
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:07,911
They can, and they will.

76
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:13,208
Add to that...
they would traumatize the shit out of him.

77
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:21,967
It is my advice...

78
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:27,973
It is my advice
that you do not turn it over.

79
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,058
Are you kidding me?

80
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:33,061
Franklin, you hired me
to defend your son-in-law.

81
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:36,439
All of you understand,
now is not the time.

82
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,024
We're in the middle of a trial.

83
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:42,571
We can tend to our ethical egos
once this is all over.

84
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:44,656
So, all right. What...

85
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:48,660
What should I do with it?

86
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:03,133
I can neither advise nor instruct you
to conceal or destroy.

87
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,595
That is not an answer, Haley.

88
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:13,268
I can neither advise nor instruct you
to conceal or destroy.

89
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:17,397
I need to talk to my wife.

90
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,817
Alone. Now.

91
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:23,320
Grace?

92
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Go to your room.

93
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,698
Wait in your room.

94
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,629
Could it be?

95
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,881
What?

96
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,385
Well, it's the only
other explanation, Grace.

97
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:49,679
What?

98
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:51,931
Well, I think you're asking yourself
the same question.

99
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:55,894
I mean, he knew about me and Elena.
Saw us at school.

100
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,813
Could have been very, very upset.

101
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:00,690
Traumatized more than we know.

102
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,692
I mean,
could he have gone there that night

103
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:03,985
for some reason, and...

104
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,739
seen me with her and, I don't know, just...

105
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,574
Are you actually asking me,

106
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:12,327
do I think our son beat a woman to death?

107
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:17,624
Well, he had the weapon.

108
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:19,376
- No. No.
- He had the weapon.

109
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,295
- No. It is not possible.
- He was carrying it around. Hiding it.

110
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,673
- No. No.
- He was hiding it for three months.

111
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:28,635
Why'd he put it through a dishwasher?

112
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,177
He...

113
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,681
He wants to protect you.

114
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:34,557
He believes you did it.

115
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,688
Everyone assumes they know their own kid.

116
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,531
- Are you actually...
- But maybe they don't.

117
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,775
Are you actually accusing our son...

118
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,212
- I'm not. I'm just thinking.
- ...of committing this crime?

119
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,276
- Do not...
- I'm thinking.

120
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,781
My mind is just fucking spinning,
that's all!

121
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,534
In despicable directions.

122
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,751
I need you to leave.

123
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,047
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
Hey.

125
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,022
Fuck you.

126
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,500
- Don't talk to me like that.
- You're accusing me of doing this.

127
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:27,986
I'm not. I'm not.

128
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,738
I fucking heard you!

129
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,865
No, no, no, Hen.

130
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,993
What you heard
was my mind running in a way

131
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,912
which at the moment
is completely bonkers.

132
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:40,749
It's out of control.
Sit down. Come on. Talk to me.

133
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,793
I'm under siege here. I'm under siege.

134
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:46,087
Everyone seems to think
I did this thing, and I didn't.

135
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,505
You blamed me.

136
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:52,677
That's not me in this.
That is a desperate man.

137
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:55,346
That's not the real Dad.
But I promise you this.

138
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,933
If I survive this ordeal,
and I fucking well will...

139
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,439
the real me will be back.

140
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,149
And the real us will be back.

141
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:13,323
And you and I will go on
the much-advertised Road Trip <i>Deux.</i> Yeah?

142
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,327
I love you, mate. I'm sorry.

143
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:21,831
Come here. I love you. I love you.

144
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:22,915
Come here.

145
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,188
Jesus Christ.

146
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:47,524
If that man goes free,

147
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,400
he will be in your life.

148
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:51,528
He will be in your son's life.

149
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,409
Good God, Grace.

150
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:01,871
You have always seen things so clearly,

151
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:04,415
seen exactly how they will play out.

152
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,878
How can you not see this now?

153
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:14,467
Oh, God.

154
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,348
I do see.

155
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,475
I'll fix this.

156
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,779
<i>To put the defendant
on the stand, it's risky,</i>

157
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:38,283
<i>and likely a sign Haley Fitzgerald feels
she has no choice.</i>

158
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,076
<i>On the other hand,</i>

159
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,205
<i>the doctor's prime-time news interview
was clearly compelling.</i>

160
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:47,876
<i>She may very well feel that her client
is the secret sauce to an acquittal.</i>

161
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,336
<i>One thing we know
for a certainty,</i>

162
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,172
<i>tomorrow promises
to deliver high theater.</i>

163
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,909
I'm not loving the vibe here, team.

164
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,410
We're fine.

165
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,494
Uh-huh.

166
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,918
Again, no emotion whatsoever.

167
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,002
Not even a hint.

168
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,422
Be inhuman. I get it.

169
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:36,925
Not my point.

170
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,426
What is your point?

171
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,846
My point is your every reaction
will be used against you.

172
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,349
If you wince, he's a monster.

173
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:46,267
If you smile, you don't care.

174
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:48,311
If you cry, you're faking it.

175
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,195
You, on the other hand, you hide nothing.
You let them see everything.

176
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,779
Yeah.

177
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,957
Chins up. Eyes down.

178
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:13,252
And hold fucking hands.

179
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:36,442
When you consider the totality
of all the circumstances,

180
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:38,319
together with some of the facts...

181
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:40,195
Uh...

182
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,077
They're awful.
I lied to my wife, which makes me a liar.

183
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,914
I was unfaithful, which makes me a cheat.

184
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,792
My semen was found inside the victim,

185
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,877
which makes me a suspect.

186
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,339
I deserve those labels.

187
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,969
But not murderer.

188
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:07,807
I didn't kill Elena.

189
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:11,436
We made love, I left,

190
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,229
I returned...

191
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:15,898
I found her dead.

192
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,693
But you understand our problem.

193
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,319
We only have your word.

194
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,322
And as you've admitted, you lie.

195
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:26,284
Well, there is no evidence
of me ever being violent.

196
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,619
Ever.

197
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,289
In fact, I have attempted
to devote my entire life

198
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,834
to what might be called
the antithesis of violence.

199
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:36,418
Healing.

200
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:39,338
As well as, I hope,
empathy and compassion.

201
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:44,469
I helped to heal
Elena and Fernando's son, Miguel.

202
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,596
Can we talk about that?

203
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,973
What was his condition?
Miguel's condition?

204
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,350
He had what's called Wilms tumor.

205
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,394
It's cancer of the kidney.

206
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:57,482
Most common among children,
and Miguel bore that statistical brunt.

207
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:58,858
What was his treatment?

208
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,778
He was unlucky
in that normal medical practice had failed.

209
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:02,861
I...

210
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:05,948
used to lead a team

211
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:11,245
that specialized in a procedure called
autologous bone marrow transplant.

212
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,499
It's a long and relatively new process,

213
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:17,585
but happily, it was entirely successful
in Miguel's case.

214
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,713
By the end, we'd all become quite close.
Cancer can do that.

215
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,382
There's been much discussion of...

216
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,595
my loving his mother.

217
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,224
But I also quite love him.

218
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,059
Miguel.

219
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:36,687
Yeah, he became like a son,
which is not advisable.

220
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:41,734
Um... pediatric oncologists
becoming too close to their patients...

221
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,529
well, it's a recipe for depression,

222
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,156
if not utter personal doom,

223
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,201
but, uh, I found I had no choice
more times than not.

224
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,621
And I certainly had no choice with Miguel.
He's...

225
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,124
<i>He's a remarkable young man.</i>

226
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,669
<i>You keep calling him a man.</i>

227
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,880
Yeah, he's a young boy.

228
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,967
But to fight the cancer he did,

229
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,928
with the ferocity he showed,

230
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:11,931
and the good humor,

231
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,143
there's a man in there, I assure you.

232
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,106
After the surgery,
during chemotherapy,

233
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,608
you often slept in his hospital room.

234
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,236
Well, as I say, I'd become very attached.

235
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,281
There were some touch-and-go moments,
and I wasn't gonna lose him.

236
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,117
I was very determined about that.

237
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,452
Um...

238
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,664
Another reason, of course, why...

239
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,377
Another reason what?

240
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,298
Well, he was like a son.

241
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,426
What was done to his mother...

242
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,519
I could never do such a thing.

243
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:01,022
Not to her, and not to him.

244
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:06,861
Thank you.

245
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:22,585
You discovered Miguel's mother
like this.

246
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:24,628
I did, yeah.

247
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,715
And when the police found her
the next morning,

248
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,384
when they came looking
to ask you questions,

249
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:31,969
uh, where were you then?

250
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,141
Near Lake George,
upstate New York, in a motel.

251
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,936
- How'd you get there?
- I drove.

252
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:41,603
Hmm.

253
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:52,573
You say you loved Elena Alves.

254
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:55,201
- Yeah.
- You discovered her like this.

255
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:58,913
May I ask you to look
at the screen, please?

256
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:01,749
Sir?

257
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:06,420
A woman you loved.

258
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,591
A woman whose son was like a son to you.

259
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:14,345
You didn't call the police
or an ambulance?

260
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,097
Well, first of all, I knew she was dead.

261
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,601
Yes, so, off to Lake George, then.

262
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:23,604
And I panicked, you see.
I panicked. I panicked. I panicked.

263
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:27,275
You panicked and went straight
to Lake George from the scene.

264
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:28,985
No, I went the next morning.

265
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,780
Oh, but where did you go that night?

266
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,907
- I went home.
- Sorry?

267
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:35,991
I went home.

268
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:39,161
And did what?

269
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,251
I went to bed.

270
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:48,629
You left your bludgeoned-to-death lover,

271
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:50,673
went home,

272
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,342
and went to bed.

273
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,595
I was terrified.

274
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,849
I was terrified of being blamed.

275
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:04,395
And that my infidelity would be exposed.

276
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:08,733
And I made a stupid decision.

277
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,236
But you're not a stupid man.

278
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,573
You're an acclaimed oncologist,

279
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:20,494
well versed in making life-or-death calls
under extreme stress.

280
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,663
The decision you made here...

281
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,041
was to flee.

282
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,418
I knew how it looked.

283
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,212
I knew how it looked then,

284
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,590
as I know how it looks now.

285
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,718
If not me, then who?

286
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,095
Well, it's not me.

287
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,765
I might be the easy answer,

288
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,767
but I'm not the right answer.

289
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,649
The, um, clothes you were wearing
that night,

290
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,110
a tuxedo, I believe.

291
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,446
What became of the tuxedo?

292
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,912
- I took it to the dry cleaner.
- You took it to the dry cleaner?

293
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,289
When?

294
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,460
On the way to Lake George.

295
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,470
You took it to the dry cleaner's
on your way to Lake George.

296
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:21,494
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

297
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,108
Henry?

298
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,191
Yeah?

299
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:26,162
I cannot fathom
how you're bearing up through all of this.

300
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:29,790
Are you okay?

301
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,041
Hmm?

302
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,048
I know how close you and your dad are.

303
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,180
Dad created this.

304
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:52,730
What do you think about what he said
about trying to fix this family?

305
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:56,400
Do you hope for that?

306
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,403
Do you hope for that?

307
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:04,909
You are answering a question
with a question again.

308
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,077
Yeah.

309
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,082
And I'd like you to answer first.

310
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,669
Do you hope for that?

311
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,219
I want what's best for you.

312
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:02,925
- Hi.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

313
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:06,929
Will you come for a walk with me?

314
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,514
<i>What, now, before breakfast?</i>

315
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:12,184
<i>Yeah, can you give me like 30?
That's when Rosana gets here.</i>

316
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,353
I need to talk to you,

317
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:17,064
and I need you to do something for me.

318
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:54,476
Why the same cop?
Why not call his partner?

319
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,021
Okay, Ms. Fitzgerald,
you've still got the ball.

320
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,355
Thanks, Your Honor.

321
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:00,858
At this time,
the defense would like to call...

322
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,411
Miguel Alves.

323
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,413
Your Honor...

324
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,082
He's on the witness list.
Yours, in fact.

325
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,627
This witness was never included
on our pretrial...

326
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,128
He's on your list.

327
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,088
And he's here, I suspect, as a prop.

328
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:28,052
If it gets too much,
I'll make it stop. Okay?

329
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,219
I'm here for you.

330
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,930
I'm sorry. Love you.

331
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,901
Do you swear that the testimony
you're about to give is the truth,

332
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,694
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

333
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:53,452
Yes.

334
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,995
State your name, please.

335
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,622
Miguel Alves.

336
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,708
Okay, Miguel. Have a seat.

337
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:07,383
Hi, Miguel.

338
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,177
I'm really sorry
to put you on the spot like this.

339
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,889
This has been all pretty terrible.

340
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,434
But nothing can be as bad
as losing your mom, I bet.

341
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,734
I see you looking at your dad.

342
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:29,321
And that's okay.

343
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:32,074
And I promise if any of this gets too hard

344
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,034
or too scary, you tell me, okay?

345
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,162
We can stop. We can take a breath.

346
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,915
Okay.

347
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,459
And I also promise
that I'll keep this very short.

348
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,670
I really only have two questions.

349
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,256
Or, I should say,
questions about two things.

350
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:49,257
First,

351
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,678
the night your mom died,

352
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,806
you were home with your dad?

353
00:25:57,433 --> 00:26:00,144
- And my sister.
- Where was your mom?

354
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,064
She went to a school fundraiser thing.

355
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,525
An auction.

356
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,611
She went to the auction?

357
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:15,033
Okay. Do you remember offhand
when you went to bed?

358
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,911
Around 9:00.

359
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,830
Nine o'clock?

360
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,874
You fairly sure?

361
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,378
That's my bedtime.

362
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:28,547
My father's really strict about it.

363
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,301
You have your own bedroom?

364
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,303
Yes.

365
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,472
And where
does your baby sister sleep?

366
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,182
In my parents' room.

367
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:41,310
So, you went to bed around 9.

368
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,520
Do you remember what time you woke up?

369
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,397
Six thirty.

370
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:47,775
I have an alarm clock for school.

371
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:49,692
Okay.

372
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,238
And between 9:00 when you went to bed,

373
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:55,574
and around 6:30 when you woke up,

374
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:59,703
did you get up or wake up in between?

375
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,875
No.

376
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,757
You were asleep the whole time?

377
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,301
I think.

378
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:18,430
I wake up sometimes
when I get thirsty or I need to pee.

379
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,391
Did that happen that night?

380
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,436
I don't think so.

381
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,563
But I can't really remember.

382
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,275
That's fair.

383
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,697
So, it could have been
that you slept the whole night through,

384
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:39,326
from around 9 to around 6:30. Right?

385
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,412
I guess.

386
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,039
Okay.

387
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,753
My next question is a little harder.

388
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:53,340
Did your mom and dad ever get upset
with each other?

389
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,384
Argue?

390
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,723
Sometimes.

391
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,562
Did they ever yell at each other
when they got upset?

392
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:08,938
Sometimes.

393
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,695
Scream?

394
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:23,954
Did they fight a lot?

395
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,508
- I don't know.
- Okay.

396
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:41,763
Had they been fighting
a little more than usual

397
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,308
shortly before she died?

398
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,559
I don't know.

399
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:51,148
Did it ever frighten you
when they would argue?

400
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:56,737
Miguel?

401
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:02,242
Did you ever tell anyone
that it was really scary

402
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,869
when your mom and dad fought?

403
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,627
I told...

404
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,131
one of my teachers.

405
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:19,592
Hey.

406
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,094
<i>Sorry.</i>

407
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,182
You know what?
Why don't we call it quits right here?

408
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,934
You did great.

409
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:28,936
Ms. Stamper?

410
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,522
I have nothing, Your Honor.

411
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,070
Thank you, Miguel.
You may step down now.

412
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,852
- Hey.
- Hi.

413
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,397
That was obscene.

414
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:15,564
I know.

415
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,651
Do you?

416
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,072
Really?

417
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:32,498
You okay?

418
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,918
Yeah. I'm fine.

419
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:36,752
And you?

420
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,562
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How dare you?

421
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,970
- Mr. Alves...
- You people are fucking vile!

422
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,781
- Officer!
- You cannot be here.

423
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:47,848
You should be ashamed!

424
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,267
- Don't make me call security.
- Come on, Fernando.

425
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,895
- Fucking vile!
- Officer!

426
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:56,273
Out! Let's go!

427
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:57,649
Not here.

428
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,485
- You okay?
- Are you sure?

429
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:03,822
So, now what?

430
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,658
Is that it? Do we...

431
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,367
Do we rest?

432
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,665
Or maybe we still go to Mendoza.

433
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,751
It's close.

434
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:18,294
No, it's good.

435
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:19,963
I like where we are.

436
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:27,596
What about me?

437
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:35,812
You've always said
I'm the most reliable narrator. I'm...

438
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,067
I'm willing to testify.

439
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,029
You said the jury will relate to me.

440
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,992
Grace.

441
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,455
I can't put your ambivalence on display.

442
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,706
Ambivalence?

443
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,709
I see.

444
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,589
I'm just gonna tell the truth.

445
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,385
But what is your truth?

446
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,346
I'm having a little trouble tracking it.

447
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,107
I don't believe you could have done this.

448
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,360
I'll say that.

449
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm willing to say that.

450
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,993
I'll testify to that.

451
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:41,795
Thank you.

452
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,259
Grace.

453
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:12,367
<i>To have an affair,
that's human.</i>

454
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:18,915
<i>To strike at someone
in an act of passion or anger,</i>

455
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,667
<i>that's human.</i>

456
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,714
<i>But to bludgeon someone to death</i>

457
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:29,384
<i>and keep on bludgeoning them
long after they are dead,</i>

458
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,928
<i>that is a monster, Grace.</i>

459
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,972
<i>That is a monster.</i>

460
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:42,105
Thank you for your kindness.

461
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:15,722
Do you swear that the testimony
you are about to give is the truth,

462
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:17,515
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

463
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,683
I do.

464
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,685
Please state your name
for the record.

465
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,812
Grace Reinhart Fraser.

466
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:24,481
Be seated.

467
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,490
Dr. Fraser.

468
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,284
May I call you Grace?

469
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,119
Yes.

470
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,329
You're a doctor.

471
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:42,499
- I am.
- Could you tell us your specialty?

472
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:45,168
I'm a clinical psychologist.

473
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,129
I have a PhD in psychology

474
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,465
that I got from Harvard University.

475
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,884
- And that's where you met your husband.
- It is.

476
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,512
We met in 2002.

477
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,306
And we were married in 2005.

478
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,017
You've been happily married.

479
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,395
Until recently, yes.

480
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,688
Yes.

481
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:08,441
I won't ask you to recite the events
that brought you here today.

482
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:11,695
I appreciate that.

483
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,947
You and your husband
are still together.

484
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,199
Yes, we are.

485
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:21,329
Prior to the night
that Elena Alves was killed,

486
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:25,041
did you know that she and Jonathan
were romantically involved?

487
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,583
I did not.

488
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:30,755
We've heard testimony of you
all being at a school fundraiser together,

489
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,966
and that he left early.

490
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,552
Why did he leave, to your knowledge?

491
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:42,767
My knowledge then was that he left
because of an emergency with a patient.

492
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:49,149
My knowledge subsequently and now
is that he left because... of her.

493
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,653
Her being Elena, the victim?

494
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,574
- Yes.
- He was in love with her.

495
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,951
Perhaps still is.

496
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,619
That must be difficult.

497
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,209
- Yes, it is.
- And yet you stand by him,

498
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,378
giving testimony on his behalf today.

499
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,130
Because he could not have done this.

500
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,091
How do you know that?

501
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,351
We've been married for 14 years.

502
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,811
We've been together for 17 years.

503
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,940
I've been able to intimately observe
who and what he is.

504
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,610
I'm a clinical psychologist.

505
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,278
I have an expertise in brain cognition.

506
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:37,405
I have a skill set
that allows me to read people.

507
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,282
To diagnose them, if you will.

508
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,204
You didn't know about his infidelity?

509
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,457
It's one thing to be fooled by his adultery.

510
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,251
To be duped by who
and what he fundamentally is...

511
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,586
And what is he?

512
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,422
He is...

513
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,094
Perhaps most profoundly,

514
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,637
I would say he's a healer.

515
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,516
He saves people's lives.

516
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,102
He cures children of cancer.

517
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:11,940
His whole esteem is inextricably bound up
with that.

518
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:14,526
Preserving human life.

519
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:18,405
The idea that he would take one
is simply untenable.

520
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:21,908
You would know,
as a psychologist,

521
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:26,287
that many law-abiding,
high-functioning people, including doctors,

522
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,790
have the capacity to snap.

523
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,630
I've never, ever observed Jonathan
to be violent.

524
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:42,429
Not even once.

525
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,556
He is a gentle man.

526
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,058
He is a man of empathy.

527
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,148
It is not within him

528
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,776
to do what he has been accused of.

529
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:00,613
Thank you.

530
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:16,546
You love him.

531
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:25,680
- I do.
- Is there anyone you love more?

532
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,890
My son.

533
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,894
- Henry.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

534
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:34,105
I cannot imagine his ordeal.

535
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:39,569
For a 12-year-old
to see his father accused of murder...

536
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:43,323
I bet you wish you could just wave a wand
for Henry's sake,

537
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,450
give his father back to him.

538
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,243
That's not what I'm doing here.

539
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:53,291
Are you familiar with the term
"confirmation bias"?

540
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,336
- Yes. Of course.
- What is it?

541
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:57,545
It's, um...

542
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,591
It's the tendency to see things

543
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,760
according to your own
preconceived notions.

544
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,346
The defendant is the love
of your life.

545
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:09,265
He's the father of your child.

546
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,351
To see him as a murderer...

547
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:14,771
My testimony has been truthful.

548
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:17,314
Really?

549
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:21,903
You testified that you've never known
your husband to be violent.

550
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:23,738
That was truthful?

551
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:25,782
Yes.

552
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,327
Has he ever grabbed you by the neck?

553
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,708
If you're referring, um...

554
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:39,045
If you're referring to the night
that he came to the beach house, that...

555
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,214
Yes, that is the night I'm referring to,

556
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,758
the night he broke into the beach house,

557
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,427
suddenly came up on you from behind

558
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,137
and grabbed you.

559
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,268
He wanted to talk to me, and...

560
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,313
he put both his hands on me,

561
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,358
and he wanted to prevent me from yelling

562
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:04,445
because he didn't want to scare me
and he didn't want to scare my son,

563
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:06,072
who was sleeping upstairs.

564
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,157
- And that's...
- But did you...

565
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:13,454
Did you tell Detective Mendoza
that you weren't sure he wouldn't kill you?

566
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:23,006
I mean, I was terrified in the moment,
and all of a sudden,

567
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,174
he was there, and...

568
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:27,927
I was startled.

569
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,556
So, the testimony
you gave earlier,

570
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,891
that your husband could never be violent,

571
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,018
that was incorrect.

572
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:39,647
My senses were overwhelmed
in the moment briefly by fear.

573
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:43,067
I quickly realized
I wasn't in any real danger.

574
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:48,615
You quickly realized that
before or after you called 911?

575
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,955
<i>My name is Grace Fraser.</i>

576
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,916
<i>My husband has just broken in.</i>

577
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,835
<i>He's a fugitive.
He's wanted for murder.</i>

578
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,378
<i>His name is Jonathan Fraser.</i>

579
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,797
<i>I'm at 361 Beachway,</i>

580
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:08,343
<i>Beachway Drive, and I'm fucking terrified,
and I need you to hurry.</i>

581
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:09,552
<i>Get here quickly.</i>

582
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:11,846
<i>Please.</i>

583
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,649
As I said, I was terrified.

584
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:24,567
I was terrified in the moment.

585
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:28,363
- I know my husband, and I know...
- You know his family?

586
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:30,531
- What?
- His family.

587
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:33,660
His mom. His dad. You know them?

588
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,577
Not well.

589
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,919
He's estranged from his family.

590
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:44,253
Estranged?

591
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:45,879
Do you know why?

592
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:48,216
There was an incident.

593
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,302
What kind of incident?

594
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:59,769
When Jonathan was 14,

595
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:02,814
he was babysitting his 4-year-old sister,

596
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:04,399
and she somehow got out of the house

597
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:06,609
and she was struck and killed by a car.

598
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:09,946
He was blamed by his parents.

599
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,950
And that's the source
of the estrangement?

600
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,201
Yes.

601
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:16,827
Yes.

602
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:21,082
Uh, did you ever talk to Jonathan's mother
or father about this?

603
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:22,333
I spoke to his mother.

604
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,584
When?

605
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,255
Recently. About a week ago.

606
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:30,591
And what did she tell you?

607
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:31,926
Objection. Hearsay.

608
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,761
Declaration against interest.

609
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,595
I'll allow it.

610
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:40,351
Please. What did she tell you?

611
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:42,603
Mainly just that. That, um...

612
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:43,813
That somehow,

613
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:47,900
the sister got out of the house,
and then the...

614
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:52,196
The tragedy happened.

615
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:59,537
Did she talk about Jonathan's trauma?

616
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,497
- Objection.
- Overruled.

617
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:07,712
What did the defendant's mother tell you
regarding the trauma he suffered

618
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:10,339
as a result of his sister's death?

619
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,508
She said that he suffered...

620
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,596
no trauma.

621
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:26,522
In fact, she told you Jonathan suffered
from neither guilt nor grief.

622
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,733
Isn't that correct?

623
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:30,234
Objection. This is hearsay.

624
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,945
It's a declaration against interest.
She's his mother, and...

625
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:34,669
There's been no showing of any support...

626
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:37,408
And also offering to impeach.
This witness testified under oath

627
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,036
that she knows the defendant
to be a person of empathy,

628
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,454
when she has reason...

629
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:44,332
- Your Honor!
- The objection is noted and overruled.

630
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,377
Yes or no?

631
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,297
The defendant's mother told you

632
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,467
that Jonathan suffered
neither guilt nor grief

633
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:58,012
in reaction
to his 4-year-old sister's death.

634
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,643
Please answer the question, doctor.

635
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:05,853
Yes.

636
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,271
No grief?

637
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:12,193
She kept waiting for it, but...

638
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:17,323
She said they surrounded him
with family support.

639
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:18,407
That they...

640
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,787
That they were certain
once the shock wore off,

641
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,247
the suffering would begin.

642
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,249
But it didn't. It never came.

643
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:30,127
Did she say anything else?

644
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:33,506
Uh...

645
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:36,384
It's just her opinion.

646
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,177
It's not necessarily what...

647
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:41,472
We can regard it as such.
Please answer the question.

648
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,184
What else did she say?

649
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:46,561
She said...

650
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:50,940
that it's her belief...

651
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,568
that Jonathan...

652
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:58,698
doesn't know how to suffer.

653
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:02,076
That he's not capable of remorse

654
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:03,785
or contrition.

655
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:23,973
Ever tell anyone
that you believed your husband to suffer

656
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:26,183
from narcissistic personality disorder?

657
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:28,227
- Your Honor, objection!
- Overruled.

658
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:31,022
Your Honor, in addition
to being prejudicial, this is irrelevant.

659
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:33,316
It goes to impeach. I'm sorry, Your Honor,

660
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,817
but this witness took the stand

661
00:45:34,901 --> 00:45:37,570
to vouch for the defendant,
for his innocence,

662
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:40,281
when in fact, she can vouch for neither.

663
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:43,701
- Objection!
- Overruled. Sit down, Ms. Fitzgerald.

664
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:46,078
Eyes to me, doctor.

665
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:47,163
Eyes to me.

666
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:51,167
You told your friend Sylvia Steinetz

667
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:56,547
that you believed your husband suffered
from narcissistic personality disorder.

668
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,300
It wasn't a professional diagnosis.

669
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:02,470
But your opinion, as his wife.

670
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:06,265
As a clinical psychologist.

671
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:13,648
What are the traits
of narcissistic personality disorder?

672
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:16,943
Grandiosity, mostly.

673
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:18,194
What else?

674
00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:23,449
What else?

675
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:26,369
Lack of empathy.

676
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,163
Lack of empathy.

677
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:34,335
So, your testimony that you knew him
to be a man of empathy,

678
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:35,795
that was a lie.

679
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,172
One you told us...

680
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:41,801
and one you told yourself.

681
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:43,678
Wasn't it?

682
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:48,557
- I don't know what you mean by that.
- Really?

683
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:52,061
Doctor, in your practice,

684
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:53,604
do you not tell patients

685
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:57,984
that sometimes they so want to believe
in their partners that they...

686
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:00,695
They choose to unknow things.

687
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:03,239
Unsee things.

688
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:06,117
That sometimes the truth

689
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,787
of who and what they married
gets distorted

690
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,706
by the desperation

691
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:15,126
of what they want to be married to.

692
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:19,338
That's a real phenomenon.

693
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:21,841
Isn't it, Dr. Fraser?

694
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:25,594
People being blind
to the reality of their spouses.

695
00:47:25,678 --> 00:47:29,098
You tell your patients that all the time,
don't you?

696
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:35,604
I know who and what I married.

697
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:47,073
Yes.

698
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,911
Yes, I think you do.

699
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,998
Your Honor, I move for a mistrial.

700
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:55,166
This is hearsay.

701
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:57,710
It's prejudicial beyond the pale.

702
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:00,421
It's unfair surprise and outrageous.

703
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:03,966
If she were a prosecution witness,
I might go for that, but she's not.

704
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,593
She's a defense witness.

705
00:48:05,676 --> 00:48:08,220
You put her up there.
The damage done here was done by you.

706
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:10,184
- You should know...
- Take your seat.

707
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:12,725
...most of what has been said
in the last ten minutes is a lie!

708
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:13,851
Take your seat.

709
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,985
You may step down now.

710
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:49,303
I so love you, Grace.

711
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:53,389
Grace?

712
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:55,558
Grace.

713
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:04,068
Well done, Haley. Well done.

714
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:06,695
She fucked us. She fucked us.

715
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:09,073
We'll move for a mistrial.

716
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:11,700
You won't. You tried that just now,
and he shut you down.

717
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:13,911
- It's over. She fucked us.
- Jonathan...

718
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:16,497
- And you let it happen.
- I let it happen?

719
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:21,335
Jonathan, she was with you.

720
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:23,546
She was in your camp.

721
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:25,005
And you lost her.

722
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:30,136
Because you didn't get rid
of the fucking hammer.

723
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:32,179
You hear that?

724
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:34,849
You didn't get rid of the fucking hammer.

725
00:49:35,808 --> 00:49:38,060
How stupid can you get?

726
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:00,249
<i>She absolutely did it on purpose.</i>

727
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:02,376
<i>She was in cahoots
with the prosecution.</i>

728
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,461
<i>If the prosecutor had called her,</i>

729
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:07,173
<i>the defense could have shut her down
on spousal privilege.</i>

730
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:09,383
<i>But because the defense
called Grace Fraser,</i>

731
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:10,843
<i>the privilege was deemed waived,</i>

732
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:14,263
<i>and she became fair game to impeach.
Brilliant.</i>

733
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,307
<i>The bombshell she dropped...</i>

734
00:50:19,977 --> 00:50:21,437
She took him down on purpose.

735
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,606
What'd you want her to do? Lie?

736
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:27,401
She could always
have turned over the hammer.

737
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:30,487
But that would have taken you down.

738
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:33,824
Goodbye, Reardon. Hello, juvenile hall.

739
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,454
You got a text.

740
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:41,123
The morality lesson is suspended.

741
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:24,059
<i>Bad news for gamblers.</i>

742
00:52:24,143 --> 00:52:27,521
<i>The oddsmakers in Las Vegas
have suspended any further betting</i>

743
00:52:27,604 --> 00:52:29,023
<i>on the trial's outcome,</i>

744
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:32,609
<i>as Dr. Fraser's conviction
seems all but assured.</i>

745
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:32,544
- Where's Jonathan?
- Hmm?

746
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:34,797
He's not here.
He's not answering my calls.

747
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,760
Have you heard from him?

748
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:38,675
Of course I haven't heard from him.

749
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,178
That son of a bitch. I warned him...

750
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,721
Henry didn't show up at school.

751
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:45,349
Didn't show up at school?

752
00:53:47,935 --> 00:53:49,311
Get the police, Haley.

753
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,274
Oh, darling.

754
00:53:59,196 --> 00:54:01,782
Dad, are we really going
for breakfast?

755
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:03,158
Give me the phone.

756
00:54:04,368 --> 00:54:05,368
Give me the phone.

757
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:07,328
Thanks.

758
00:54:09,123 --> 00:54:11,458
The look on your face is brilliant.

759
00:54:13,085 --> 00:54:14,128
It's going off, though.

760
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:16,630
Try to stay calm.

761
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:23,095
You can't do this, Dad.

762
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:25,097
I'm not really doing anything, am I?

763
00:54:26,223 --> 00:54:27,558
Going for a drive with my son?

764
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:34,481
<i>Your wife.</i>

765
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:38,109
She's great.

766
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:41,363
She's been so kind to me, you know?

767
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:46,034
I think we had a real connection.

768
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,328
We're having tea tomorrow,

769
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:50,747
with the kids, I think.

770
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:53,041
Henry could be great for Miguel.

771
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:57,087
<i>Like an older brother.</i>

772
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:03,886
You stay away from my family.

773
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,848
If you go anywhere near my family again,

774
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:10,100
either my wife or my son,

775
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:11,852
I will hurt you.

776
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,731
- I will fucking hurt you.
- You will never hurt me.

777
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:19,568
And you will never leave me, Jonathan.

778
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:27,075
So, go on, then. How's Rosenbaum?
How's his bum?

00:56:23,674 --> 00:56:25,676
I just thought
it'd be our last chance to do it.

801
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:28,929
Dad, come on.
We can't go on a road trip right now.

802
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:30,931

They're ten miles out.

827
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:44,296
Right. I say
it is very nearly fried-clam o'clock.

828
00:57:45,005 --> 00:57:45,963
Fried clams?

829
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:48,884
But not fried clams
as you know them, Earthling.

830
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:52,763
These are the fried clams
from the great Bollie's of Albany.

831
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:55,307
The best fried clams in the universe.

832
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,101
Dad, we can't go get fried clams.

833
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:00,187
You need to pull over and let me out.

834
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,649
They're Ipswich clams as well,
which means they're big fat bastards,

835
00:58:03,732 --> 00:58:06,109
- as any self-respecting clam should be.
- Dad! Jesus!

836
00:58:06,193 --> 00:58:07,819
So, why don't we just do this?!

837
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:12,907
Sorry.

838
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:17,329
Sorry.

839
00:58:18,622 --> 00:58:19,790
See, that can happen.

840
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,417
That can happen. We can just...

841
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,629
lose ourselves sometimes.

842
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:31,635
We become, you know, other.

843
00:58:32,636 --> 00:58:36,223
Could be panic or anger or...

844
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:39,184
Or love, sometimes.

845
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,354
We lose ourselves.

846
00:58:46,066 --> 00:58:48,694
But it doesn't undo
who we are in our entirety.

847
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:49,903
You should know that.

848
00:58:52,656 --> 00:58:53,656
You got that?

849
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:02,874
So, they're gonna say
that this is my legacy,

850
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:04,876
and they can go fuck themselves...

851
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,211
Sorry.

852
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:08,839
...because it's not my legacy. My legacy...

853
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:12,007
is you.

854
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:15,387
And my patients and your mum.

855
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:18,724
Yeah?

856
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:22,519
You murdered a person, Dad.

857
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:45,375
Really? Yeah? Yeah?

858
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:48,377
Really?

859
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:52,674
Please.

860
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:55,719
Please.

861
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:23,705
You murdered a person.

862
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,542
Not the real me.

863
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:34,549
Not the Dad you know.

864
01:00:51,525 --> 01:00:54,069
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.

865
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:55,779
Dad, stop!

866
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:03,012
- Dad, stop! Stop the car.
- Yeah, in a minute. In a minute.

867
01:01:03,036 --> 01:01:05,455
I want every last second with you,
my friend.

868
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:08,667
You have to stop.
You have to pull over and let me out, Dad.

869
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:12,712
Dad, please. Please.

870
01:01:12,796 --> 01:01:15,465
Every last second. Fuck them. Fuck them!

871
01:01:23,056 --> 01:01:26,351
- Dad, come on. You can't do this.
- This is nothing to be scared of.

872
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:28,270
- It's gonna make it worse.
- Shut up!

873
01:01:31,398 --> 01:01:33,441
Just, please, just let me out.

874
01:01:33,525 --> 01:01:34,525
Please.

875
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:01,261
Well, there it is. Dead ahead.

876
01:02:01,845 --> 01:02:04,306
That, my friend,
is the Wurts Street Bridge.

877
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:06,600
Once a thing of majestic beauty.

878
01:02:06,683 --> 01:02:08,894
Now... not so much, hmm?

879
01:02:10,145 --> 01:02:12,397
- What does that remind you of?
- Dad.

880
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:14,858
The light is red, Dad.

881
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:18,570
Dad, it's a red light. Dad. Dad!

882
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:22,197
Dad!

883
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:28,830
Please don't hurt my son.
Please don't hurt my son.

884
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:32,125
Dad, what the fuck are you doing?

885
01:02:33,335 --> 01:02:34,461
So, remember...

886
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:37,297
- Dad. Dad. Dad!
- ...it's you, my patients and your mum.

887
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,425
- That's my legacy. What's my legacy?
- Dad! Get back in the lane!

888
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:45,709
We gotta get down there.
Can you land this thing? Land it.

889
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:47,432
Dad.

890
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:49,267
Dad. Dad. Dad!

891
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,896
Dad! Dad! Dad!

892
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:55,315
Dad, no! No! No!

893
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:57,067
Dad, don't do this!

894
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,401
- Dad!
- No!

895
01:02:58,485 --> 01:02:59,945
- Don't run from it!
- No!

896
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:01,571
Don't run from it!

897
01:03:02,155 --> 01:03:03,865
Just get back in the car.

898
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,743
Can I get out? Can I open the door?

899
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:08,536
Get out, get out.
Open the door!

900
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,996
No! Stop!

901
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,334
- Dad!
- Jonathan, no!

902
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:17,087
- Ma'am, you can't... You can't go through.
- Stop! Stop!

903
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,672
- I love you.
- Jonathan!

904
01:03:18,755 --> 01:03:20,590
Henry! Stop!

905
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:24,803
Henry!

906
01:03:26,805 --> 01:03:28,098
Please!

907
01:03:29,182 --> 01:03:31,434
<i>Henry, I'm coming!</i>

908
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:37,147
<i>Stop!</i>

909
01:03:40,902 --> 01:03:42,195
Stop!

910
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:43,405
Look at me!

911
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:44,781
Jonathan, no!

912
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,492
Henry! Jonathan!

913
01:03:49,953 --> 01:03:50,953
Henry!

914
01:03:51,538 --> 01:03:52,538
Jonathan!

915
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:55,166
Henry!

916
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:58,003
- It's all right.
- Henry!

917
01:03:58,086 --> 01:03:59,754
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

918
01:04:01,214 --> 01:04:02,215
Grace, I'm sorry.

919
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:04,217
I'm sorry.

920
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:06,302
Grace, come here.

921
01:04:06,386 --> 01:04:08,346
Come here. Give me a hug. Grace!

922
01:04:11,975 --> 01:04:12,975
Henry!

923
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,730
- Run.
- Grace!

924
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:19,064
Henry!

925
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:22,193
Grace!

926
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:57,353
- All right, Henry.
- Ready to go, ma'am?

927
