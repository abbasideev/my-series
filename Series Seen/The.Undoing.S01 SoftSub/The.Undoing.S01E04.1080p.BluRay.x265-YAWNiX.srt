I was on one of my walks.

15
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,351
One of your walks.

16
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,272
<i>Yes.</i>

17
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,898
One of my walks. That's what I do.

18
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,817
That's how I ground myself. I walk.

19
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,903
<i>Is that really so difficult
to comprehend?</i>

20
00:02:31,987 --> 00:02:35,324
<i>That you happened to ground
yourself by walking within footsteps</i>

21
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:37,492
<i>of your husband's
bludgeoned-to-death lover.</i>

22
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:39,995
Yeah, it bumps me.

23
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,247
I'm not saying it's bad.

24
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,752
Perhaps I could suggest
that you killed her?

25
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,045
Did you?

26
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,379
Are you making a joke?

27
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,258
I don't make jokes. I'm not funny.

28
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,387
Luckily for you, not Jonathan,

29
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:00,724
the police have more images
of you grounding yourself,

30
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,061
walking, after the time of death.

31
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:07,439
You're no longer
on their radar as a suspect.

32
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,733
But they still think you're withholding.

33
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,525
Why?

34
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:16,448
Because it's what rich,
entitled people do when threatened.

35
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:19,826
They conceal the ugly truths,

36
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,495
to protect themselves,

37
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:24,331
their family units,
their places in society.

38
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,999
Their public image.

39
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:30,045
And they think they can get away with it,
because they're rich.

40
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,092
- I'm not withholding.
- Whether you are or not...

41
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:37,511
Eyes here, please.

42
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,472
Don't do it with me. Ever.

43
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,394
Anything else?

44
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:47,938
Apart from your grounding walkabout.

45
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,356
Any more secrets?

46
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,777
No.

47
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:59,783
Tell me more about Elena's husband.

48
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:02,119
You said that he struck you as volatile.

49
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:03,203
Very.

50
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,332
- How very?
- Just very.

51
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:12,212
That's not terribly specific.

52
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,257
Are we talking about
something more than that?

53
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:18,427
Come on.

54
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:24,141
Give it the old trained
clinical psychologist try.

55
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:26,184
Why are you testing me?

56
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,437
Because this case may come down to you.

57
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:33,775
And before I put you on the stand,
I have to kick the tires.

58
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,444
On the stand?

59
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:38,613
No.

60
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,450
No.

61
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:46,830
I'm not going on the stand.

62
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,055
You see Haley?

63
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,395
I don't like her.

64
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,730
So what?

65
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,774
You're not paying her
to be your friend, Grace.

66
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,068
Lawyers are like car mechanics.

67
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,070
You pay them to fix your problems.

68
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:24,201
- For bedside manner, I always have you.
- Oh, so now I'm the enemy.

69
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:26,453
No, I didn't say that.

70
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,706
- Can I get something for you, miss?
- Oh, no, thank you, Irma.

71
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,416
I'm fine. I'm not hungry.

72
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:36,922
- So, what are you saying?
- I just need a little unconditional support

73
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,716
from my loving father right now.
That would be...

74
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,343
That would be nice.

75
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,756
Well, thank you so much for doing this.

76
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,468
I'm doing it for Franklin.

77
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:26,263
How'd you get that bruise on your face?

78
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,974
I was attacked by a...

79
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:31,726
One of my friends here.

80
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:33,812
And you bit him.

81
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:34,896
I did, yes.

82
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,276
Somewhere amidst the pile-on,
when half the prison joined in the fun.

83
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,736
Self-defense, you know.

84
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,825
Don't bite anybody else.

85
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,327
Okay, I need to get you out.

86
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:52,372
I can better start shaping the narrative
with you as a quasi-free man.

87
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:55,333
The bail is two million.
I'm guessing you don't have that.

88
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,752
- I don't. No.
- What about family?

89
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,671
Parents? Siblings? Favorite uncle?

90
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,923
Well, I'm estranged from my family.

91
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:03,341
Why is that?

92
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,305
Is it important?

93
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:10,849
It is.

94
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:14,227
Especially since you seem to be
estranged from everybody.

95
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,899
Well, I haven't really spoken to my family
since I left for college.

96
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,194
They would lack the means,

97
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:27,490
as well as the inclination,
to help with bail.

98
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:33,163
Are there any more Elenas out there?

99
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,628
Other women you've been involved with
during the course of your marriage.

100
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,174
I will find out.

101
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,468
And you might as well tell me now.

102
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,470
Were there any others?

103
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,307
There was one.

104
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:58,480
Just a one-off years ago.

105
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,567
I'd lost a patient, and I was,

106
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,527
you know, in a mess.
I was distraught, and...

107
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,405
And you had a lapse.

108
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,200
Yeah.

109
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:12,702
And how many others?

110
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,496
No, like I said, just the one.

111
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,957
Are you gonna be able to defend me,
Haley, or not?

112
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,127
I'll be able to defend you best
if I'm not surprised.

113
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,338
Well, there was no one else,
apart from Elena.

114
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:28,009
Elena, and the one where
you were distraught.

115
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:33,139
- The sad fuck.
- Is that supposed to be funny?

116
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,726
I'm not funny.

117
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:38,687
I'll need her name.

118
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:04,504
- Thank you for coming.
- My pleasure.

119
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:14,597
I'm kind of a glutton for punishment.

120
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:17,142
This thing...

121
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,853
It's like the trial of a lifetime.

122
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,898
So, the opportunity for me
to relive losing it...

123
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:26,568
- I'm sorry.
- I'm kidding.

124
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,321
You know, if it was somebody I loved

125
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:31,906
whose ass was on the line, I'd...

126
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:35,034
I'd be wanting Haley Fitzgerald
instead of me, too.

127
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:37,494
So...

128
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,710
Do you think that he might be innocent?

129
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:48,423
- Jonathan.
- That's what you wanted to ask me?

130
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:52,051
There's something to be said
for objectivity, so I just...

131
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,221
My gut instinct is yes.

132
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:59,350
He could be innocent.

133
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:03,354
You know, brain's connected to the gut.
They got scientific evidence of that now.

134
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:06,232
You know that, of course,
you being a shrink and all.

135
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:08,401
I still think he's a dick.

136
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,696
Just not one who'd commit murder.

137
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:44,604
Haley feels that it's important
that he gets out on bail.

138
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,690
She feels it would present him
to a potential jury pool

139
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:50,419
in a more favorable light, and he'll be
able to contribute to his defense

140
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,195
in a more meaningful way.

141
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:57,909
I assume this is when your loving father

142
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:02,121
gives his unconditional support
a test drive?

143
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,960
Are you all planning to live together
like a family again?

144
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,962
- No. No.
- Okay.

145
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:11,714
Jonathan will live in the apartment,
and...

146
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:18,513
Henry and I will continue
to live with you, if that's okay.

147
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,312
Mark.

148
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:29,607
Good day, sir.

149
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,536
Thank you, Robert.

150
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,386
<i>Move it!</i>

151
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,096
Let's go!

152
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,683
Move it! Let's go!

153
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,590
Well, I can't imagine
what you must think of me.

154
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,470
I certainly understand

155
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,555
why you would not feel comfortable

156
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,015
putting up my bail.

157
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:45,474
- But...
- Stop.

158
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,144
I'm not here for your understanding.

159
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,564
I'm here to look at you.

160
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,734
I'm here to make sure
that you understand me.

161
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,905
I think you're guilty.

162
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,533
I believe you killed that woman.

163
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:08,623
Grace makes room for the possibility
that you did not.

164
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:14,379
And perhaps because
she so rarely asks for my help,

165
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,675
I find myself...

166
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,428
ill-equipped to refuse it.

167
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,932
But should you run,

168
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,144
should you do anything
to further harm my daughter,

169
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,146
my grandson,

170
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,358
I will track you down.

171
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:40,446
And I will kill you myself.

172
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,123
Thank you.

173
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,834
I'll make good with your daughter.

174
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,252
With Henry.

175
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,170
And I will make good with you.

176
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,010
I'm done here.

177
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:11,310
Get up. Let's go.

178
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:38,755
Please make a path.

179
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:42,550
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say this,

180
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,511
and then I, I would be
grateful if you would leave us alone.

181
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:47,972
I'm obviously very happy to be out,

182
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,557
and beyond that,

183
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,268
I look forward to clearing
my name in court,

184
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,270
and proving that I'm innocent
of this crime.

185
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,439
Thank you very much.
There'll be no more questions.

186
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,572
Thanks, Hugh.

187
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:06,991
Sorry.

188
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:10,912
- O h!
- Sorry.

189
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:13,705
Hi.

190
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:17,460
Hi.

191
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,671
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,599
You're not in trouble, Henry.

193
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,270
Then why am I here?

194
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,774
- I would just like to know what was said.
- What was said?

195
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:43,027
I would just like to know what was said
between you and Miguel Alves.

196
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,656
"Hi," was said,

197
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:47,823
by me.

198
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,034
Miguel didn't say anything.

199
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,120
You just said "hi"?

200
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:54,956
Well, after I said "sorry."

201
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:57,667
You said sorry to Miguel.

202
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,545
- Yes.
- And what were you sorry for?

203
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:07,135
I bumped into him by accident.

204
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,137
So, I said sorry.

205
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,805
It's one of the five C's.

206
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:14,308
Character, courage, conscience,
charity, and courtesy.

207
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,352
I said "sorry" out of courtesy.

208
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,498
Hmm.

209
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,961
Thank you.

210
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:46,799
I already regret it.

211
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,470
I'm not going to play the role

212
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:54,473
of brokering you
back together again, you know.

213
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:55,808
I'm not.

214
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,769
You never liked him.

215
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:00,438
No.

216
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,273
No, I never did.

217
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,613
Jonathan upset me in a profound way

218
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:10,448
the minute I first set eyes on him.

219
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,451
I did ask you what it was
you loved about him.

220
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:17,997
I asked you whether
he seemed so perfect for you

221
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,999
because you had explained to him

222
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,043
exactly what "perfect for you" meant.

223
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,754
And he was just giving back
what you wanted.

224
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:34,513
I know you're angry.

225
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:39,268
I'm furious.
I'm furious with myself, Grace.

226
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,355
For not putting up a fight.

227
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:44,482
God.

228
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,239
They wanna kick Henry out of school.

229
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,114
What?

230
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:58,162
Yeah. Yeah.

231
00:17:58,454 --> 00:18:02,041
They want him to be homeschooled
until all of this is over.

232
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,960
Excuse me.

233
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,587
The police are back.

234
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,591
We hate to be such a nuisance.

235
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:13,469
- But you continue to be.
- Far be it from us

236
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,948
- to give you advice, doctor, but...
- Then don't.

237
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:19,392
But are we to understand you've allowed
your husband back into your home?

238
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:23,396
My personal life
is none of your business.

239
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,982
Why would you think that?
Hmm? Your personal life,

240
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,317
your husband's personal life,

241
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,069
is our primary business of late.

242
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,280
What do you want?

243
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,866
- Can you sit for a second?
- No. I would prefer to stand.

244
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,577
How well did you know Elena Alves?

245
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:41,706
- Are we back to that?
- She called you.

246
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,667
Many times, in the days before her death.

247
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,461
It's right there on her phone.
Your cell number.

248
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,674
Nothing to say?

249
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,347
I never, ever spoke to Elena Alves.

250
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,350
Not on my cell phone.
Not on any other phone.

251
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,394
Yeah, that's true.

252
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,856
Her phone shows that those calls
were never answered.

253
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,108
Because you never picked up.

254
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,609
Why are you fucking with me?

255
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,528
- Did you know it was her?
- No.

256
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,197
Because I don't pick up a number
when I don't recognize it.

257
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:18,200
- I assume that it's a telemarketer. I'd...
- Mm.

258
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:19,702
All right. Fine.

259
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:23,581
If you think maybe I was the one
that killed her, great.

260
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,375
- Be sure to testify to that.
- We're just trying

261
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,795
to get all the information.
Including, but not limited to

262
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:34,133
- your relationship with the victim.
- I had no relationship with her.

263
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,469
Other than I was on a committee with her.

264
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,596
- And I walked...
- Evening, miss.

265
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,598
Good evening, Alan.

266
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,225
And I unwittingly

267
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,686
walked within a block of her apartment

268
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,355
the night that she was killed.

269
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:51,067
You know she was an artist, right?
A sculptor. Painter.

270
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,320
It was on the news.

271
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,822
- You never knew it before.
- So you never...

272
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,866
Posed for her?

273
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,951
Oh, fuck you. What?

274
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,828
We found something
in her basement storage.

275
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:08,250
- I don't...
- It's an oil portrait.

276
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,636
I would say she captured you...

277
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,306
Rather well, don't you think?

278
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:37,446
<i>Did you know?</i>

279
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,490
<i>No, no.
No, I had no idea.</i>

280
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:40,950
<i>You mean, like a portrait?</i>

281
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,244
- <i>Yes! A portrait.
- Christ.</i>

282
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,621
And exceptionally detailed.

283
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,667
Well, I knew she was obsessed, but...

284
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,712
What are the police making of it?

285
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,508
I don't know. Or they're not saying.

286
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,512
They're just asking more questions
and I don't have the answers.

287
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,474
We'll get through this.

288
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,102
We'll get through this somehow.

289
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,271
- Jonathan, stop.
- We will. We will. We will.

290
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,398
We're not in this together.

291
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:13,732
We're not.

292
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,945
You stand accused of a crime
that maybe you did, maybe you didn't do.

293
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:20,197
And I'm gonna play the role.

294
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:22,283
The assigned role of the wife.

295
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:24,952
And that's it.

296
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:34,587
Well, then, I'll just pray
that I make my way back to you.

297
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,630
You know, what we had, you and I, was...

298
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,758
It's too big to undo just like that.

299
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,553
But you did.
You managed to undo it, didn't you?

300
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,609
Whatever I feel for you,

301
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,694
it doesn't matter, because my mind

302
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,279
is stronger than my heart.

303
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,324
You know that about me.

304
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,659
And while you may not be
a murderer, you're...

305
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,371
You're not my husband.

306
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,374
You'll never be my husband.

307
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:17,463
Come on.

308
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,839
Come here.

309
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:20,508
Come here. Come on.

310
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:21,634
Come on.

311
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:26,764
- It's me. It's me. It's me.
- Why would you...

312
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,310
I can't.

313
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,230
- It's me.
- Stop it. Please stop.

314
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:38,067
Stop. Just stop it. Stop it now.

315
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,236
No. No.

316
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,114
No.

317
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:46,450
Come on.

318
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,416
<i>Bail, you will recall,</i>

319
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,086
<i>was set at ten million bond,
two million cash,</i>

320
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,880
<i>a number Dr. Fraser has
presumably met.</i>

321
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:01,715
<i>It is white privilege.</i>

322
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,300
<i>You think that
if it was the husband,</i>

323
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:05,594
<i>or any black man, that he would
have been granted bail?</i>

324
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:08,472
<i>This was a vicious murder.</i>

325
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,516
<i>The woman's head
was nearly liquefied.</i>

326
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,393
<i>He's not a threat to society?</i>

327
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:14,270
<i>It's obscene.</i>

328
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,448
Franklin.

329
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:27,908
- Hi, dear.
- Oh.

330
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:29,702
- Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,204
- Hi. Come say hello.
- Hi.

332
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,789
- Hello. How are you?
- You run off.

333
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:34,873
- Good.
- Tell them sorry.

334
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:36,477
- Tell Miss Hatsy it's my fault.
- Bye.

335
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:37,918
I've told Grace a thousand times,

336
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:40,546
but if there's anything I can do.

337
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:44,008
You're a dear, dear girl
and she knows it. So do I.

338
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,217
How is she?

339
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:49,138
She's always so stoic.
How is she, really?

340
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,308
Really?

341
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:56,270
I don't know.
I don't know whether I ever knew.

342
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,482
Ah. She's just Grace being Grace.

343
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,901
My date has just appeared.

344
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,572
You have fun.

345
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,032
Oh, I intend to.

346
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:12,011
He didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,579
Why homeschool him, then?

348
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,623
Well, we feel
it would be in the best interest

349
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,833
of everyone, if Henry,
for the time being...

350
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,211
- Why?
- With the trial approaching,

351
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,297
the distraction serves no one.

352
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,635
You told my daughter
that Reardon would be there for Henry.

353
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,472
- That the community was steadfast.
- I did, but...

354
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,141
Henry's life has been ripped apart.

355
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,810
If ever an overpriced, self-important,

356
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,605
full-of-shit school needed to step up...

357
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,273
This is coming from the board.

358
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:47,404
They feel we need to create distance
between Reardon and all the ugliness.

359
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,035
I cannot exalt your grandson's needs
at the expense of the school's writ large.

360
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:54,912
Well, I can.

361
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:58,415
I've given a lot of money
to this school, Mr. Connaver.

362
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:02,294
And I've always considered it
a privilege to be able to do so.

363
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,130
But make no mistake.

364
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,342
I am a cocksucker.

365
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:12,554
And I don't mean that
in the sense of gay belittlement,

366
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,682
as it's currently come to be interpreted.

367
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:16,975
No.

368
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:20,104
I'm an old-fashioned cocksucker.

369
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,731
The more traditional kind.

370
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,111
The kind who fucks over
anyone who hurts me,

371
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,696
or a loved one.

372
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,951
You speak of ugliness, Mr. Connaver.

373
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:40,624
You have not yet met ugliness.

374
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,414
Please.

375
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:22,438
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

376
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,335
- Hi.
- Hey, honey. Hey.

377
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,128
- It's all right.
- Are you okay?

378
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,547
Fine. I promise.

379
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,843
What happened?

380
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,387
I don't know. I was... Whew.

381
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,474
I was walking in the park,
and I got lightheaded and then...

382
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,977
Think I just went numb.

383
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,822
Hey. Hi.

384
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,157
Hey.

385
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:43,867
Jonathan.

386
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:47,495
Are you okay?

387
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,707
I'm fine. It was probably
just a bit of a panic attack,

388
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,627
and then stress.

389
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,630
Yeah.

390
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,676
- Hey, buddy. Hey.
- Hi.

391
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,678
- How you doing? You all right?
- Yeah.

392
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,560
So, what are the doctors saying?

393
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:14,564
Um... They're just saying
that it was stress-induced,

394
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,651
and that I'm gonna be discharged, so...

395
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,361
- All right. So, eyes open.
- Jonathan...

396
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,697
- please don't.
- Eyes open. Eyes open, please. Please.

397
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,616
Jonathan, come on.

398
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,869
- Please don't do this.
- And open, open, open. Open, please.

399
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,708
Can you track my finger?

400
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,713
- And touch my finger. Come on.
- Oh, please. Really?

401
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,047
Do it.

402
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:45,595
Yeah. And now your nose. And, uh, finger.

403
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,265
And now nose. I think you're okay.

404
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,853
I think you're okay.

405
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:56,857
Yeah.

406
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:58,942
When can I get out?

407
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,869
Jesus. So, what was it?

408
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,787
<i>I don't know. They say...</i>

409
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,165
<i>They say it was
just an anxiety attack.</i>

410
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,333
Anxiety?

411
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,002
Why on Earth would you have anxiety?

412
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,670
Is something going on in your life?

413
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,005
<i>You're funny.</i>

414
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,007
Why don't you come over the house

415
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,925
one night this week and we can have a,

416
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,720
I don't know, a boozy sleepover.
Just you and me.

417
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:30,807
Yeah, that sounds fun.

418
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,434
<i>You okay?</i>

419
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:34,936
<i>You really okay?</i>

420
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,731
Mm-hm. I'm fine, I promise.

421
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,151
I'm thinking of you.

422
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,403
Okay. Bye.

423
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:18,938
May I come in?

424
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,690
Yeah, sure.

425
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,490
It's a wonderful instrument, the violin.

426
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:31,284
Yeah. I, I like it.

427
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:35,080
Most kids at Reardon
want to play the drums,

428
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,707
and the bass, and the guitar, and...

429
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,459
I like the violin.

430
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,545
Because it's different.

431
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,421
Mm-hm.

432
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,344
I heard you left your footprint
on Connaver's head.

433
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:51,971
Hmm.

434
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,475
He's a putz.

435
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:44,482
Well, hello.

436
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,571
Can I come in, please?

437
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,867
Please.

438
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,332
Thank you.

439
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,297
Miguel. Hey.

440
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:08,798
Hey.

441
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:11,635
Oh, you look well, my friend. Yeah?

442
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,972
- Leave him alone.
- He's my patient, Fernando.

443
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,309
- Just get your hands off him.
- You look strong. That's great.

444
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:23,521
- I'm so sorry about your mom.
- Don't talk to him.

445
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:27,651
I want you to know
that what happened to your mom, Miguel...

446
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,988
- I didn't do it.
- All right. It's all right. Come on.

447
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:34,152
- Go to your room, Miguel.
- No, he should know that.

448
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,992
Go to your room.
Go to your room. Come on.

449
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,453
- Go to your room.
- He needs to know that, and so do you.

450
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,830
There were lines I crossed.

451
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:45,710
- But I did not take Elena's life.
- Get out of my house, now.

452
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:47,921
I didn't do it, Fernando. I didn't do it.

453
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,341
Go to your room, Miguel.

454
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,760
Now.

455
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,097
Put your headphones on, okay?

456
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,099
Put your headphones on
and turn the volume up.

457
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,978
Fernando, I...
I don't mean to seem insensitive,

458
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,689
but desperation has a way
of trumping good manners.

459
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,442
With Elena, there was something
about her that seemed...

460
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,028
I don't know. That was off.

461
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,614
- I need to find out exactly...
- This is your plan?

462
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,367
This is your fucking plan?

463
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,369
To make her seem off?

464
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,871
I know your grief,
because I feel your grief.

465
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,916
And I want whoever did this to be caught.

466
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,377
I don't believe you.

467
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,379
Well, you need to believe me.

468
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,715
And at a minimum, believe this.

469
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,341
You need to stay away from my wife.

470
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,054
Like you stayed away from mine? Huh?

471
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,980
She has to be fed.

472
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,636
Would you like to feed her?

473
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:20,763
Hmm?

474
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,682
Your daughter.

475
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,642
Would you like to feed her?

476
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,690
Here.

477
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,025
Here, baby.

478
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:33,985
Daddy's home.

479
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,593
- You met her before?
- I have, yeah.

480
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,221
You've held her before?

481
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,058
Yeah.

482
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,562
Such a beautiful little girl.

483
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,524
Yeah. That she is.

484
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:14,567
That she is.

485
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:17,862
Come here. See you. Let's see you.

486
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:18,947
Yeah.

487
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,324
- It's difficult to love her.
- Yeah.

488
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,788
I have tried really hard, and...

489
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:29,916
And I will keep trying.

490
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,505
But it's difficult, knowing how...

491
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,048
I could take her.

492
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,717
Would you prefer that?

493
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:48,017
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- I had to warn him off Grace.

494
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,687
- And I thought if I appealed to him...
- He'd what?

495
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,189
Believe you? Forgive you?

496
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,317
You just committed witness tampering.

497
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:59,070
A condition of your bail
is that you stay away...

498
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:01,194
- I did not try and influence him.
- Doesn't matter.

499
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,034
You actually thought that
you might win over the man

500
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:08,037
whose wife you're accused
of savagely killing.

501
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,789
How much fucking charm

502
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,542
- do you think you have?
- I didn't see the harm. I really didn't.

503
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,127
I didn't.

504
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:17,464
Do you ever?

505
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:21,593
Fine, I apologize. What's next?

506
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:27,348
You actually did think
you could change his mind, didn't you?

507
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,479
Oh, my God. Of course.

508
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:34,354
What?

509
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,191
Why wouldn't he believe you?

510
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,860
You cast a spell.

511
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:42,322
You have done it
with everyone you've ever met.

512
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,617
With a face like that.

513
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,662
I have a handsome, charismatic client.

514
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,207
Capable of mesmerizing.

515
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:57,921
We will win this.

516
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,591
We will get the jury to see in you

517
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:05,428
what you see in you.

518
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,266
What I see in you.

519
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:20,526
Wow.

520
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,198
How'd I do? Did I pass?

521
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,201
Barely.

522
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,286
So, what's the deal?

523
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,122
Are we just gonna play games, here,
Haley, or do you perhaps have

524
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:35,083
a legal strategy for my defense?

525
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:38,086
I met with the district attorney.
They have a strong case.

526
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,713
The scene of the crime
is essentially a shrine to your DNA.

527
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,050
That said, it's still circumstantial.

528
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,529
She didn't offer "heat of passion,"
but I think I could get her there.

529
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:49,180
If you are talking about a plea,
the answer is no.

530
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,140
Voluntary manslaughter would be a steal.

531
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:52,642
Yes. For someone who did it.

532
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:56,789
We lose on murder one or two,
you could spend the rest of your life in jail.

533
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:59,148
I'm not pleading guilty. Is that clear?

534
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,359
I'm innocent.

535
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:03,570
I did not fucking do it.

536
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,533
Hi. Thank you very much.

537
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,303
- Anything else?
- No, that's great. Thank you.

538
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,662
Thanks.

539
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,887
We're gonna do a TV interview.

540
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,516
Like it or not,

541
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,770
this case is on trial right now
on television, for everyone to see.

542
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:40,273
Including the potential jury pool.

543
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,859
We need to jump into that pool.

544
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:45,695
You want me to go on TV?

545
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,238
With me at your side.

546
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,742
It could be the straightest line
to an open mind. Let people...

547
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:54,203
Let people see you. Hear you.

548
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:57,457
Without being subject to cross.

549
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:07,675
<i>I never aspired
to a perfect life, you know.</i>

550
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:10,595
I just wanted to be happy.

551
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:13,973
I had this idea of what
a good family looked like,

552
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,850
which I got from you and Mom.

553
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,770
- That's really all I wanted.
- Grace.

554
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,274
Your mother and I were never happy.

555
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:26,235
What?

556
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,449
I was unfaithful to her.

557
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,369
All the time.

558
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:43,711
No, you weren't.

559
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:48,841
I think maybe that's what
informed my contempt for Jonathan.

560
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:52,887
He reminded me of me.

561
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:59,018
I was not a quote-unquote
"good husband," Grace.

562
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:03,606
You were. You were!

563
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:08,236
You were, Dad. I remember. You were...

564
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,863
You loved her.
You, you were devoted to her.

565
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:13,241
You would write her notes.
You'd bring her gifts.

566
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,743
You'd shower her with jewelry,

567
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:17,078
You, you...

568
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,580
Dad, you loved her.

569
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:21,958
I saw it. I remember...

570
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:25,795
Yeah.

571
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:27,922
I did.

572
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,551
But I was unfaithful to her,

573
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:35,346
again and again and again and again.

574
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,724
No.

575
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,184
- And each time,
- You...

576
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:42,603
I would come to the realization

577
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,023
that this was not the way
I wanted to live my life,

578
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:48,860
and I would come back to the fold.

579
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,446
Determined to reset,

580
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,741
I would confess to your mother.

581
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:56,075
Apologize.

582
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,954
Different jewelry.
I don't think she ever wore any of it.

583
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:04,041
I'm sure it was poison to her.

584
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,963
And the gifts were penance.

585
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:11,716
My atonement.

586
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,596
It's just not what you
needed to hear right now,

587
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,558
but the idea that your ideal of a marriage

588
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:23,644
was based on what your mother and I had?

589
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:31,068
You've always had a way
of chasing ghosts, Grace.

590
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,446
Of believing in things you shouldn't,

591
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:36,824
and I am afraid that
you are going to find a way

592
00:43:36,908 --> 00:43:38,242
to believe in him again.

593
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:46,667
Exactly how weak do you think I am?

594
00:44:09,857 --> 00:44:12,109
<i>Okay,
in three, two, one.</i>

595
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:13,861
<i>And cue Connie.</i>

596
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:16,322
Joining us now
is Dr. Jonathan Fraser,

597
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,533
along with his attorney, Haley Fitzgerald.

598
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,452
- Welcome. Thanks for being with us.
- Thanks for having us.

599
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:24,705
You know, this is
a little unusual interview.

600
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:28,835
<i>Allowing access to your client
on national television.</i>

601
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:32,588
<i>Well, honestly,
he's already been quite on display.</i>

602
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:34,090
<i>And the picture has been distorted.</i>

603
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:37,093
I thought, let the people
see for themselves.

604
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:38,886
What do you want them to see?

605
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:41,889
Uh...

606
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:46,185
I suppose the answer
to your question is...

607
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:47,520
The truth.

608
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,566
Which is to say that I'm flawed.

609
00:44:52,775 --> 00:44:57,780
I do not pass myself off as...
honorable, because I'm not.

610
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:00,825
I was unfaithful to a wife who I love.

611
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:03,786
I hurt her, I hurt my son.

612
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,997
<i>Both those things are unforgivable.</i>

613
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,542
<i>You do admit that
you're a cheater.</i>

614
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,003
<i>But are you a killer?
Did you kill Elena?</i>

615
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:14,547
<i>That I'm not guilty of.</i>

616
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,883
<i>Well,
let's take your version of events.</i>

617
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:18,926
<i>You say
you suddenly came upon her.</i>

618
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,513
<i>You discovered her dead.
But why did you run?</i>

619
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,058
<i>Because I was in shock,</i>

620
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:29,604
and I mean that in the medical sense.
So, that's a cognitive shut-down.

621
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:31,439
It's like a very extreme form
of panic.

622
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:33,482
<i>Innocent people do not flee.</i>

623
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:36,736
<i>Well, I didn't feel
at all like an innocent man.</i>

624
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,781
<i>I was guilty of infidelity,</i>

625
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:45,453
<i>and I felt pretty certain,
that, uh...</i>

626
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:50,166
- Uh...
- Go ahead.

627
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,087
That I was the cause of her death.

628
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:58,758
Which is not to say
that she died at my hands.

629
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:00,635
But I felt it was possible, probable even,

630
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:03,554
that someone else,
in a fit of jealousy, or rage...

631
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:07,600
I had...

632
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:10,811
Made love to her.

633
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:14,148
<i>It could have possibly
triggered the killer.</i>

634
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:16,025
<i>Maybe he saw...</i>

635
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:19,695
<i>We know that she was killed
shortly after I left.</i>

636
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:23,616
<i>But the police say
that the evidence points</i>

637
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:27,161
<i>- only and unequivocally to you.</i>
- So, I think that the police need to...

638
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:29,372
If I could jump in.
The police do an excellent job.

639
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:32,208
- Sorry. Yeah. Yeah.
- But sometimes they make human mistakes.

640
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:35,103
- You think they rushed here?
- This is a high-profile homicide.

641
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,797
Which happened to a mother
from a well-to-do school.

642
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,882
These things are not supposed to happen.

643
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,677
And when they do,
the public demands an answer.

644
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,555
And assurance that the same horror
couldn't possibly visit them.

645
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,766
- The police feel that pressure.
- Pressure?

646
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:51,495
Yes, they feel that pressure.
And doubly so in an election year.

647
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:53,914
<i>- I'd think pressure to get it right.
- Absolutely.</i>

648
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:55,314
But sometimes, they get blinded.

649
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:58,484
And in this case, by low-hanging fruit.

650
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:02,613
Jonathan was there, around the time.
He left his DNA.

651
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,240
<i>And it wasn't you?</i>

652
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:07,660
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

653
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:10,204
<i>You know,
I get the feeling</i>

654
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:13,040
<i>you're trying to come off
as some kind of victim?</i>

655
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:16,210
<i>Well, I...</i>

656
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:20,673
<i>I'm not a victim
in a conventional sense, no.</i>

657
00:47:20,756 --> 00:47:23,134
<i>And I brought
a lot of this on myself.</i>

658
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:24,217
But...

659
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:27,555
Let's not forget that...

660
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:35,563
Sorry.

661
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,065
<i>Go, go ahead.</i>

662
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:39,859
<i>Go ahead.
Let's not forget what?</i>

663
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:45,531
Jonathan...

664
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,660
That in all this...

665
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:53,289
I lost someone I love.

666
00:47:58,127 --> 00:47:59,336
<i>And, uh...</i>

667
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:02,423
Well, there you are.
You know, people often think that

668
00:48:02,548 --> 00:48:04,675
being made a suspect must preempt,

669
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:06,969
or quash grief.

670
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:09,055
But I can assure you
that that's not the case.

671
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,059
<i>So, you still say
you didn't kill her?</i>

672
00:48:13,142 --> 00:48:15,519
<i>Well, I say that
because I did not kill her.</i>

673
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:17,730
<i>You loved this woman.</i>

674
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:19,982
<i>You knew her.
You knew her life.</i>

675
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:24,737
<i>Do you have some idea,
perhaps, who did?</i>

676
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,705
I do, yeah.

677
00:48:34,729 --> 00:48:42,729
