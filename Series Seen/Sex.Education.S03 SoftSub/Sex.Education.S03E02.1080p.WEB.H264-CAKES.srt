I think it sounds a bit stupid.

You should definitely apply.

- Can you do it, please?

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,280
- Got it.
- Thanks.

68

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,560

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,720

I'll wait downstairs.

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,720
Hello, Mr. Hendricks.

99
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Morning, Ruby. Would you like some

100
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
breakfast?

101
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,400
- You don't have any nut milk?
- Mm-mm.

102
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,520
Well, if I eat anything else
before 10:00 a.m., I'll vom.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,080
So, no, thanks.

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,680
I am very glad you feel comfortable
staying the night with Otis.

105
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,000
I want you both to feel
that this is a safe space

106
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,400
to explore your relationship.

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,760
- Oh, we're just having casual sex.
- I would never date him.

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,840
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was never this gassy with Otis.

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Doesn't it feel kind of gross
having something growing inside you?

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,440
No. Feels quite natural.

111
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,880
That would make me claustrophobic.

112
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,600
Well, that's interesting.
Why would you think that?

113
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,560
What if the father
turns out to be a dickhead?

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,360
Then I have to see him until the day I die
just because he impregnated me.

115
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,640
Well, there is that.

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,400
Commitment can be a frightening prospect.

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,520
Mum, can you please not therapize
my friend?

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
Good morning, darling.

119
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,160
That is an interesting outfit.

120
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,440
Very suave.

121
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,480
- Told you I look stupid.
- You don't look stupid, OT.

122
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,760
You look chic and expensive.

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
OT?

124
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Oh yeah. Otis was a bit babyish,
so I changed it.

125
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,240
Okay, let's go.

126
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,680
- So you're getting back together?
- No.

127
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,960
We're gonna co-parent.

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,320
- Are you upset?
- No.

129
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Yes. I'm confused.

130
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,680
I thought you liked Jean.

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
She really hurt you, Dad.

132
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,120
Listen,
I think I just need time to process this.

133
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Okay.

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,920
I love you, kid.

135
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,520
- What you writin'?
- No, don't read it yet. It's not ready.

136
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,400
The <i>Moordale Gazette </i>announced
a short fiction competition.

137
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,800
It's a five grand prize!

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,280

I could get with that.

139
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
You all right?

140
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,720

a baby with Jean Milburn.

141
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,640
Ew!

142
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,280
- Aren't they too old?
- Yes.

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,480
Does that mean
Otis is gonna be your brother?

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh shit!

145
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000

146
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,720

176
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,600
Anwar, you can't own a look.

177
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Right.

178
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
What are you doing?

179
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,200
Well, gotta find a new look now, don't I?

180
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,000
FYI, this, dangerously close to brown.

181
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,480
Good morning, baby.

182
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Where... where you going?

183
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
Okay, okay, okay.

184
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,480
Guess who's going all the way tonight?

185
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,400
Come on, yeah! Huh!

186
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm guessing it's you.

187
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,720
You're supposed to look happy for me.

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,120
I'm happy. I am happy, Eric!

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,040
Uh-huh.

190
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,320
Are you sure
Adam isn't gonna mess you around?

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,640
I think he's not comfortable with himself.
I don't want you to get hurt.

192
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,040
Enough! I don't want to hear
your feelings about Adam now.

193
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,360
- Yeah.
- I want you to be my best friend.

194
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,840
And ask questions
about me going all the way, way, way!

195
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,960
You're right, okay. Sorry.

196
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
So, where's it gonna happen?

197
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
Well, both our parents are home,
so I'm making a romantic picnic.

198
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
We're gonna do it alfresco.

199
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,280
Alfresco?

200
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,640
- Eh-heh.
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,840
- Eh-heh. Eh-heh.
- Eh-heh. Eh-heh!

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,600
No, thanks, I'm all right.

210
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,600
Okay, good morn...

211
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,320
Very funny, very funny.

212
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Okay, who did this?

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,400
It was Adam, miss.

214
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
No. It wasn't, Dylan.

215
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,536
I've covered for you before.
You do this every time. Outside, now.

216
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Ooh!

217
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,400
Everyone else,
turn to page 25 of the workbook.

218
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,680

246
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,480
Thank you.

247
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,080
Hey, Hope!

248
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,360
We're working on
a little thing for assembly.

249
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,960
It's gonna be epic.
Why don't you pull up a chair?

250
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,600
No, thank you, Colin.
Um, could I borrow Jackson, please?

251
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,720
Yeah, cool. Okay!

252
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,720
Sopranos,
all I can hear is "tit-ties," all right?

253
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,120
It's "titties."
I want you to be like a cat on heat.

254
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,760
I wanted to hear your initial thoughts
on the new hallway guidelines.

255
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Uh, they're interesting.

256
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,120
Interesting is a non-word, Jackson.
Tell me what you really think.

257
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,640
I guess I don't understand the lines.

258
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,536
Feels a bit militant.

259
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,920
It's more about creating
a calmer environment for learning.

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,400
To encourage the students to take time,

261
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,760
to be quiet,
and present with their own minds.

262
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,280
Kind of like a Buddhist thing?

263
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,280
No.

264
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,080
No, I do think it's important...

265
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
...for students
to use the time between lessons

266
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,840
to process what they've been learning
throughout the day.

267
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,200
And I need you to help me
bring them up to speed.

268
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,120
People look up to you.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,560
I can try...
...but I think I'm gonna struggle

270
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,960
to get anybody around here
walking in single file.

271
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
Excuse me. Hi.

272
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
Hi.

273
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,720
Jackson's gonna walk you through
some of the new school values.

274
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Oh.

275
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,760
This should be fun.

276
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
Hey.

277
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Hi.

278
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,520
Are you taking the bus?

279
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,720
You all right, Adam?

280
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
Is there something you need?

281
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Yeah.

282
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,360
I was wondering, um, if...

283
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
I mean, whether you...

284
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,760
Uh, actually, never mind.
Uh, it's nothing.

285
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,320
Remember, I... I'm here
if you need any help with anything.

286
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Yep.

287
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,440
<i>What's this line really about?</i>

288
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,000
Guess it is annoying
when people run in the corridor.

289
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,680
It's from a Scandinavian school model
about creating unity on campus.

290
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,600
Okay.

291
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,320
Apparently, quieter corridors
equal better grades across the board.

292
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,880
And Hope's last school
achieved 90% A to A-Star rating,

293
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,840
so I'm not complaining.
I've been researching her.

294
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,520
This line is not about unity.
It's about control.

295
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,840
We're going to be put into
tiny little boxes.

296
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,680
- I think it's just a line.
- Nothing is ever just a line.

297
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,240
Please keep to the left. Thanks.

298
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh, Maeve,
no facial piercings allowed, I'm afraid.

299
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
Why?

300
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,880
You won't wear a nose ring
when working at a top law firm, will you?

301
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,520
School's meant
to prepare you for the real world,

302
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,920
and from what I've heard,

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,200
you're a very smart girl,
so let's be a team player.

304
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,560
That's the best pair of titties
I ever drew.

305
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,680
You're not gonna paint over
the Wall of Cock?

306
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Pardon?

307
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Sorry. It's a wall at the back of school
where people draw genitals.

308
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,680
Ah, yes.
I remember it from my own time here.

309
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,640
- Have they not painted over that?
- No.

310
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
Oh, I'm Vivienne Odusanya.

311
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,840
Great name, Vivienne.

312
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,720
I'll have the wall painted
in the next couple days.

313
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
- Oh, we can do that.
- What?

314
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,680
We'd love to help paint it.

315
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,480
Okay. Fantastic.

316
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,280
Thanks, Vivienne.

317
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,080
What did you do that for?

318
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Viv!

319
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Hello.

320
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,480
Actually, would you stand opposite me?
I have misophonia.

321
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,760
What is that?

322
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,400
It's a phobia
of the sound of other people eating.

323
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,240
She can still hear you.

324
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Fuck me.

325
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,840
Right, what's goin' on with you?

326
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,600
You can't actually be okay
with them being a couple. It's impossible.

327
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,720
I'm okay with it.
I think they're sort of perfect together.

328
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,200
I think I like someone else.

329
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,240
Isaac? It is, isn't it?

330
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,800
I knew it!

331
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,160
You're always talking about him.

332
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,000
Isaac this, Isaac that.

333
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,320
- Isaac, Isaac, Isaac.
- Stop, shush!

334
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
Yes, it's Isaac, but I'm confused

335
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,280
because we got really close as friends,
and I don't wanna ruin that.

336
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,160
Well, I think you've got nothing to lose.

337
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,320
And if it all goes tits up,
you've still got me and my flappies.

338
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Yeah.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,040
Aimes, this is amazing.

340
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,040
- I've been practicing!
- Mmm.

341
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,160
But all the flour,
it's making me constipated.

342
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,280
Last week,
I didn't do a shit for five days.

343
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,280
Then when I finally did do a poo,

344
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,680
it was like my bum had
this gigantic orgasm.

345
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
- Oh, it was great.
- Your stories are so special, Aimes.

346
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,040
I can't believe I'm painting a wall

347
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,400
so you can suck up to a teacher.

348
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,920
This wall is vulgar.
You're doing a good thing.

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,360
Loads of art is vulgar, Viv.
Picasso, obsessed with dicks and vaginas.

350
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,640
This is not Picasso. This is graffiti.

351
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,560
Who's to say
what's art and what isn't?

352
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,920
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,880
I know her. Well, I mean,
she bumped into me the other day.

354
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,720
My pronouns are they/them,
but no worries. I'm Cal.

355
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
You can't paint over this wall.
It's history.

356
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,240
It's a wall of penises.

357
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,760
Okay, but not just any penises.

358
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
It's a wall of historical penises.

359
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,720
Like, look.
This one, this was drawn in 1985.

360
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,240
And this lovely little scrote right here,
1990!

361
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,560
We weren't even born, and you're trying
to paint over it like it's nothing.

362
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,240
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

363
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,040
You're head boy, right?

364
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,640
If you really care,
you should make your case.

365
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm gonna go talk to Hope.

366
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,520
Uh!

367
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,320
Uh!

368
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Colin!

369
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Glad I caught you.

370
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,280
Oh, sorry.
Am I on the wrong side of the line?

371
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
I'm still trying to get used to it.

372
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
No.

373
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,320
I wanted to talk about
your song choices for the choir.

374
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,360
Well, the students choose their own songs.
It's, uh, it's all part of the fun.

375
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Yes, but in the wake
of all the bad press we've been getting,

376
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,640
I don't think students singing
about "sucking titties" is entirely wise.

377
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Do you?

378
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,160
No, I guess not.

379
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,600
I... I'll try and tone it down.

380
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,120
I'll have my assistant send over
some suggestions

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,560
for more appropriate song choices.

382
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,320
- Great chat, Colin.
- Okay.

383
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040

Different. She's got a lot of ideas

We know that it's

426
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,680
an unusual situation.

427
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,800
May I ask what made you break off
the relationship before?

428
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,760
Oh, it was a number of things.

429
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,320
Jean kissed her ex-husband.

430
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
I see.

431
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,280
I made a mistake that I apologized for.

432
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,400
I found the sudden presence
of a partner in my life,

433
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,960
in my space, every day, difficult.

434
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,360
Like, uh, my coins...

435
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
Loose change...

436
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,280
- ...everywhere.
- ...everywhere.

437
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,800
Annoying.

438
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,680
So he ended things.

440
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,000
A decision that I completely respect.

441
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,080
Is it what you wanted?

442
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,640
No. I wanted to try again.

443
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,240
Is that why you decided to keep this baby?

444
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,680
- No. Absolutely not.
- No.

445
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,520
I had discovered
I was pregnant quite late on.

446
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I really didn't know
what I was going to do.

447
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,520
Anyway, after a while, I

448
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,160
started to feel
that it was something that I might want,

449
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,160
which was surprising.

450
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,440
My son is
in his final year of school, and...

451
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,960
to be honest,

452
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I don't think I'm ready to let go
of being a full-time mum.

453
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,960
I think I'm good at it.

454
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,520
And also, well, this may sound stupid, but

455
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm 48, and he's had a vasectomy,

456
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,960
so it just seemed...

457
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,640
Fated?

458
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Yeah.

459
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,880
Anyway...

460
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,400
Being an older parent is intimidating.

461
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,000
I've found that, and so...

462
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I want Jakob to be involved
in any way that he can.

463
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Well,

464
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,360
I think
you both still care about each other,

465
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,160
but you weren't dating
for very long beforehand,

466
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,080
so in some ways, you're still strangers.

467
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,520
You haven't had time to build up
that foundation of trust,

468
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,680
which you are going to need
to be co-parents.

469
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,400
I'm gonna give you some homework
to help you move forwards.

470
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,880
Okay.

471
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Aimee!

472
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,280
Hey! I'm going to the gym.
Do you want to come to mine later?

473
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,040
Oh! I can't tonight.
I'm hanging with Maeve.

474
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
Yeah, I'm sorry to steal her, Steve.

475
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,080
Okay. Maybe tomorrow?

476
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Mm, yeah. Ooh, oh, tomorrow!

477
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,840
What was that about? I'm seeing
Elsie's new foster family tonight.

478
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,200
I know, I know, but he keeps trying
to kiss and cuddle me.

479
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,000
He doesn't mean to put pressure on me,

480
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,680
but sometimes he gets this hungry look
in his eyes, and I just wanna scream,

481
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,880
"No, Steve, I don't wanna have sex!"

482
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,040
I used to really like sex,

483
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,920
and I still wank a lot when I'm on my own,
but I don't know.

484
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,120
I just feel safer when I'm by myself.

485
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
How long has this been going on for?

486
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,000
Since the bus.

487
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,280
You might need to talk
to someone professional, Aimes.

488
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,160
Do you think I can find someone
like Otis's mum? She seemed nice.

489
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,960
Yeah.

490
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,760
Hi, Otis.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

491
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Ruby picked this out for me.

492
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,840
I didn't ask, but cool.

493
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,640
We're still casual,
but I wanted to try something new.

494
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,080
Casual doesn't seem like you.

495
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,680
Anyway, Aimee is still struggling
after last term, and I'm...

496
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,160
I'm worried about her.
She needs to talk to someone.

497
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,120
I wondered maybe
if she could talk to your mum?

498
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
- Sorry if it's weird to ask.
- No!

499
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,720
No, Maeve, of course.

500
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,760
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll... I'll chat to her.

501
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Thanks.

502
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,120
What did you mean,
"Casual doesn't seem like me"?

503
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,360
I don't know,
just the whole no-feelings thing.

504
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,000
You used to care a lot.

505
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Things are easier when you don't care.

506
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Nobody gets hurt.

507
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,280
Yeah.

508
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,120
Anyway, thanks, Otis. Gotta go.

509
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,440
We're going to hang at yours.

510
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,600
So I have bought crisps,

511
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,440
and some ham,

512
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,840
and some more crisps. I panicked.

513
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,520
- Are we here to have dinner?
- I don't know!

514
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,960
It's what they do in films.
It's supposed to be romantic, isn't it?

515
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,880
I think I'm a bit scared.

516
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,280
You don't want to anymore?

517
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,280
No. No, no, no. I do. I really do.

518
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,800
It's just, I... I'm worried
that I don't know what I'm doing.

519
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,760
Well, I don't know either.

520
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,520
Don't worry.
I douched before school.

521
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Uh...

522
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,240
What's wrong?

523
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,680
I, uh, I don't...
This... this isn't what I want. I...

524
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
You...

525
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,800
don't wanna have sex with me.

526
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,320
- Otis was right.
- Otis? What do you mean?

527
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
He said that you would change your mind.

528
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,200
That you weren't comfortable
with yourself.

529
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,120
That this would be too gay for you.

530
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,840
Look, I understand that you're not ready
to tell your mum, but...

531
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,760
if you're not all in,
then I can't be with you.

532
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Well?

533
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Say something!

534
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,120
It's just... I don't... It's...

535
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,520
- This isn't what I want.
- Fuck's sake.

536
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,520
Excuse me, please. Get off. Get off it!

537
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,240
Ridiculous young man!

538
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,480
Ridiculous.

539
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,560
I think
he's pretending to go to work,

540
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,400
which is just so humiliating.

541
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,120
<i>I know you feel bad for him,</i>

542
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,680
<i>but he's been with us for weeks now.</i>

543
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,080
<i>It's time for him to go.</i>

544
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,200
Okay, I'll tell him. Promise.

545
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
<i>When, Peter?</i>

546
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,280
- Tonight.
- Peter, I'm back!

547
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,800
Gotta go, he's here.

548
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,320
Hey, Michaela! How's work, champ?

549
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Uh...

550
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,520
Great, yes.

551
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,080
- Very good.
- Great.

552
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,680
Lots to do already. Very happy.

553
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
- Look...
- I've got some good news.

554
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,200
I've found a flat to move into, so...

555
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Oh.

556
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Thank fuck for that!

557
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,840
I was gonna ask you to move out.
I didn't want to because it's so awkward.

558
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,520
But, uh, that's fucking brilliant news!
When are you leaving?

559
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,080
<i>Peter, what's he saying?</i>

560
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Christ.

561
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,680
- Maeve.
- Anna.

562
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,640
Lovely to meet you. You're so pretty!

563
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,800
Come in. We're playing tea parties
with Elsie's dollies.

564
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,960
Wanna give us a hand?

565
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,680
Shall we have some cake?

566
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,240
Would you like a cup of tea?

567
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,040
What about some...

568
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,280
Hi, Elsie.

569
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,040
- Maeve!
- Hello!

570
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,800
Ooh! I missed you!

571
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,680
I missed you.

572
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
- Yes.
- No.

573
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,520
- Yes.
- No.

574
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,840
- Oh yes! Yes!
- No.

575
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,800
- Yes.
- No.

576
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,240
- Yes.
- No.

577
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,840
- Yes!
- No!

578
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,720
- Now!
- Yes!

579
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,200
Fuck!

580
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,960
Ah!

581
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,880
So tomorrow is purple day.
We all have to wear something purple.

582
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,600
- I don't have anything purple.
- I left something out for you.

583
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
You what?

584
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,040
Don't you wanna hang out for a bit?

585
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,720
Uh, my mum's working,
so I'm making dinner for my dad.

586
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,840
He finds it hard to cook now.
It's fine though!

587
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,240
Want me to come and help?

588
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,960
Did you wanna have sex again?

589
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,400
No, just thought
you might want some help with your dad.

590
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,120
I'm fine.

591
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,760
I'll see you tomorrow.

592
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,520
You leaving, Ruby?

593
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Hi.

594
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
That's Jakob, my, uh...

595
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,160
- The...
- We're gonna be co-parents.

596
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,880
You're a good-looking couple,
for old people.

597
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,880
We're not exactly a couple!

598
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,120
Who is this rude person?

599
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,560
Otis's lover, apparently.

600
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,720
Right, "I See You" is an exercise
where you stare into each other's eyes

601
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,640
and articulate the emotions that come up.

602
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,960
Oh, this is dumb.

603
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,680
Come on. Let's be serious.

604
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,480
Okay. Okay.

605
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
Right, knees touching.

606
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,160
- You blinked.
- Stop it.

607
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,680
Come on. Come on.

608
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,136
- Knees to knees. Come on. You can do it.
- Yeah.

609
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,920
Focus, focus, focus. All right.

610
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,520
Okay.

611
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,200
So what emotions are coming up for you?

612
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,400
That this is a stupid exercise,
and I really wanna kiss you.

613
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Hello.

614
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,880
We need to talk, New Kid.

615
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,160
Would you like some tea?

616
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,800
No, I don't want any tea.

617
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,000
I want you to stop talking shit
to my boyfriend.

618
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,760
Did you and Eric have a fight?

619
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,640
Yes.

620
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,720
No.

621
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
Sort of.

622
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,040
You told him I'm not properly gay,
and now he's angry

623
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,080
because he thinks
I don't wanna have sex with him.

624
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,800
I never said you're not "properly gay."

625
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,200
I said I want Eric to be careful
because you've hurt him in the past,

626
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,320
and I'm worried.

627
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,200
You should be talking to him
about this, not me.

628
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,760
Tried talking. Doesn't come out right.

629
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,600
What do you mean?

630
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,560
I don't know how to say what I'm thinking.

631
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,360
All the words are there in my head.

632
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,840
I just don't know how to say
the thing that I want to say.

633
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,080
The more I think about it,
the worse it gets.

634
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,880
People are just looking at me,
waiting for me to say something, so...

635
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
So I don't say anything at all.

636
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,680
People think I'm scary or stupid.

637
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,760
Why do you find it so hard?

638
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,840
I didn't grow up in a naked family.

639
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,880
What's a naked family?

640
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,000
You know, those families
where everyone walks around naked,

641
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,680
talking about how they feel.

642
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,800
Like you and your mum.
Bet you're naked all the time.

643
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
We are not.

644
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,720
Do you think your family...

645
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,280
I'm not here
to do your weird therapy thing.

646
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,000
I just want you to stop talking about me
to Eric. It's none of your business.

647
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,600
I will stay out of it.

648
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,600
Sometimes, it helps
to write down what you want to say first.

649
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,680
I'm not good at writing.

650
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,600
Or you can ask the other person
to close their eyes

651
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,880
whilst you talk to them.

652
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Sounds stupid.

653
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,080
What I'm saying is,

654
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,960
it might help you think more clearly
about what you want to say

655
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,920
if you don't feel observed.

656
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
It's just a suggestion.

657
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I'm going now.

658
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,000
You should wear your normal clothes again.

659
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,160
That top makes your neck look very long.

660
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,600
Oh, that was a bad idea.

661
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,800
Yeah.

662
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,080
Probably was.

663
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,400
Well, Dr. Cutton is right.

664
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,200
We do care about each other,
and that can be confusing.

665
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,840
But we're adults, and...

666
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,080
we won't let that happen again.

667
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,960
I think we more than care for each other.

668
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,720
What are you saying?

669
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,400
I think we should be a family.

670
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,320
But she also said
that we barely know each other.

671
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,600
I don't care what the therapist said.

672
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,840
I think we should be a family, Jean.

673
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,960
Are you still at school, Maeve?

674
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,920
Mm-hmm.

675
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,360
I'm in my final year.

676
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,080
Well done, you. That's a big achievement.

677
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,360
Why? Because Mum's a junkie?

678
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,200
No, it's a big achievement for anyone.

679
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
Mm-hmm.

680
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,360
And I understand
you don't have a lot of support at home.

681
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,520
Are you in some kind of positivity cult?

682
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
No.

683
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,240
It helps
when the social workers come round.

684
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Uh-huh.

685
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,440
You've got a lot of books.

686
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Yes, I teach literature part-time.

687
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,840
You can never be lonely
with the company of a good book.

688
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,840
You can borrow that if you like.

689
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
No, thanks.

690
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,960
When's my mum gonna be able
to come and see Elsie?

691
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,080
She should be here now.
Does she run late often?

692
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,280
Sorry. My mum's coming here?

693
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,280
Yeah, this is a family visit.

694
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,640
I assumed you two would've spoken.

695
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,640
- Hello, Erin.
- Fuck.

696
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,520
Oh, it's lovely to meet you.

697
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,200
Can I come in or what?

698
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,680
Where's my baby girl?

699
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,720
Mummy!

700
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,080
Oh, darling!

701
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,240
Hi, Mum.

702
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,760
What's she doing here? She's the reason
Elsie's in this happy-clappy shithole.

703
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,120
- Not with me, her flesh and blood.
- That's rude, Mum.

704
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,520
Rude? I'll tell you what's rude.
Calling the police on your own mother.

705
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,640
That's rude.

706
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,320
Okay. I think
I'm gonna come back another day.

707
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,280
Yeah, you do that.
Nobody wants you here. Bye-bye. Bye.

708
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,200
I love you so much!

709
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,760
Mm.

710
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
Hm.

711
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,360
Hi.

712
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,200
Ah, don't worry about him.
He's out like a light.

713
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,440
How was Elsie's new place?

714
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,880
I'm not sure about the foster lady.
She's a bit of a know-it-all, but...

715
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
it was nice.

716
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,160
Until my mum turned up
and told me to get out,

717
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,440
which was less nice.

718
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Shit.

719
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,560
Yeah, it was pretty shit.

720
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,040
Do you want a hug?
Mine are notoriously terrible, but still.

721
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,160
Yeah, all right.

722
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,320
- I'm sure your mum will...
- No.

723
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
Let's not talk about it. It is what it is.

724
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,480
He's disgusting.

725
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,640
Yeah.

726
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,880
I'm related to that.

727
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Wait.

728
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,520
- Sorry.
- I...

729
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,760
I've gotta tell you something.

730
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Okay.

731
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,560
The night that your mum
and Elsie went with the police,

732
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,880
that Otis guy came,

733
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,200
and I didn't tell you.

734
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Okay.

735
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,520
He said that he wanted to talk to you

736
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,160
and that he left a message on your phone,

737
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
but you'd... you'd gone to the shops.

738
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
And...

739
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,000
I listened to the message.

740
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,200
And I deleted it.

741
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Okay.

742
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,080
What did the message say?

743
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,240
Um...

744
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,880
Something about him
still having feelings for you

745
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,960
and that he felt like
he'd messed things up.

746
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
He said,

747
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,480
"Call me back

748
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,280
if it wasn't too late."

749
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,560
Can you say something, please?

750
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,520
Elsie left weeks ago.

751
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,480
I... I didn't know how to tell you.

752
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,960
It's not an excuse, but...

753
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,400
I was angry

754
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,840
at all the shit that you dealt with.

755
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,800
I don't think Otis understands it at all.

756
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,920
The way that he treated you at that party.

757
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,560
He said that you were a selfish person,

758
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,840
and you are
the least selfish person I know.

759
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,520
So you went into my private property.

760
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,280
I'm a dick, I know, but...

761
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,200
...I was doing it
because I was trying to protect you.

762
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
You're right.

763
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,560
Otis doesn't understand me.

764
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,720
But neither do you.

765
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,480
Because if you did,
you'd know that I don't trust anyone.

766
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,280
But I trusted you,

767
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,480
and that was special...

768
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,720
and you've messed it up.

769
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,240
People make mistakes.

770
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,120
- Like your mum. She...
- Don't talk to me about my mum.

771
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,760
Can't believe
I thought you were different.

772
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Come on.

773
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,520
What do you wanna talk to me about?

774
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
I, uh...

775
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,720
I've...

776
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,960
Adam, it's late...

777
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,120
I'm sorry.

778
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,520
I wanna tell you how I feel,
but I don't want you to look at me.

779
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Okay.

780
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,240
I... don't want to have sex with you.

781
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,640
I want you to have sex with me.

782
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,920
I don't understand
what you're saying, Adam.

783
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,280
I want you to put your dick in me.

784
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,920
That's how I would like to do it.

785
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,400
Can you turn around, please?

786
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,000
I would love to put my dick in you.

792
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,560
I think you should go

793
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
before my parents see
you stayed the night.

794
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,720
He has to work.

795
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,360
Yes, I know. He works very hard. Mm-hmm.

Your grandma's on the phone.

Coming!

00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,320
- Yes, I know.
- Who's got my highlighter? Who's got it?

799
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,560
Your cousin Shukpo is getting married.

800
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,280
Your grandmother wants us
all to go to Nigeria for the wedding.

801
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,880
Ooh! Oh!

802
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,240
What about school?

803
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,080
- You'll only be gone a week.
- Okay...

804
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,960
Remember,
she doesn't know anything about Adam.

805
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,600
- She's too frail for that.
- Okay.

806
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,400

Colin.

813
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,440
I need somewhere to stay for a bit.

814
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,520
Sure, man.

815
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,880
No, no. Nope, nope, nope, nope.

816
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
Hello, darling!

817
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,840
- Good morning.
- Have a seat. I made eggs.

818
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,720
What's going on?
Last time you made eggs was when Dad left.

819
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,120
Jakob and I have done some talking.

820
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,240
- And...
- Mm-hmm.

821
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,440
...we think it would be best
for the new baby and...

822
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,880
for us, and for everyone, really,

823
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,880
that we try and make this work properly.

824
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,960
As a family.

825
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,560
Which means?

826
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,520
That I want Jakob and Ola

827
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,120
to move in with us.

828
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,840
I know that's a lot to take in,
and if it doesn't feel right for you,

829
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,840
we'll find another way, but...

830
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,600
I think it could be good.

831
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,920
Okay.

832
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,400
That's it?

833
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,840
If this is what you wanna do, Mum,
then, yeah, I'm fine with it.

834
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,400
I mean,
I'm not gonna be living at home forever.

835
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,720
Thank you for being so adult.

836
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,520
Mum, do you think
I'm a casual-relationships kinda guy?

837
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,120
I think you're the sort of person
who wants meaningful connection.

838
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,240
But I also think that it's good for you
to try different types of relationships.

839
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,720
There's a friend of mine at school.

840
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,760
She was sexually assaulted last term
and needs some help.

841
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,680
I said I'd ask if you'd speak with her.
It's fine if you can't.

842
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,760
I'd be honored to speak with her.

843
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Thanks, Mum.

844
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,200
Um, hello! Why are you wearing
your homeless clothes again?

845
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,800
Because these are my clothes, Ruby!

846
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,960
I don't wanna have to change who I am
in order to hang out with you.

847
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,440
But if you're really that embarrassed
of me, I guess we have to call it quits.

848
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,160
People don't call it <i>quits </i>with me.

849
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,320
They don't have to
if you always keep things casual.

850
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,880
I would like to get to know you better
if you'd let me.

851
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,840
Why?

852
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,280
Because I think
you're an interesting person.

853
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,800
I mean, you're terrifying...

854
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,160
but interesting.

855
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,000
Do you mean you want to be my boyfriend?

856
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,120
Yeah, I guess so.

857
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,800
I think I can probably make people think
this jacket is cool.

00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,200
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

867
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,280
Okay.

868
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,880
Uh...

869
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,400
Mm...

870
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,080
I would like to be

871
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
better at school, and... and maybe...

872
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,840
not be in the bottom set anymore.

873
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,280
Can you help me do that, please?

874
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,640
Why are you turned around?

875
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,600
It makes me think better.

876
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,240
Okay.

877
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,320
Sure, Adam.

878
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,040
I can try and help you.

879
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,720
But you must commit yourself.
I don't want to waste my time.

880
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Thanks, miss.

881
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,440
Why is he not wearing purple?

882
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,840
I think we should dress
how we want to from now on.

883
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,440
Still cool and expensive, obviously.

884
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,320
Shut the front door.

885
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,920
It's my new look.

886
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,280
I call it "Pimp on Fire."

887
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,280
- You look great, Anwar.
- You look like you were dressed by a bin.

888
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
Maeve.

889
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,920
Hey, I spoke to my mum,
and she'll talk to Aimee.

890
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,120
Thanks, Otis.
I appreciate that.

891
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,360
And me and Ruby aren't casual anymore.
We're official.

892
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
Hmm.

893
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,240
Got you an appointment
with Jean Milburn.

894
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,240
- It's a good start.
- That's great!

895
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Yeah.

896
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,600
What if she thinks
I'm wobbly in the brain?

897
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,280
She won't think that, Aimes.

898
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,320
- So what's the news with Isaac?
- Changed my mind about that.

899
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,520
- Why?
- Because you were right.

900
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,560
Don't need a boy when I've got you.

901
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,640
Maeve, why is your nose ring still in?

902
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,280
Because I forgot to take it out. Sorry.

903
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,920
Okay, hand it over.

904
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,760
- Now?
- Yes, now.

905
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,040
And don't make me ask again.

906
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,440
Might start to think
you're not as smart as people say you are.

907
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
Hey!

908
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,080
- Jackson Marchetti has a crush?
- Reduce it.

909
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,200
Jackson,
I just saw the wall isn't painted.

910
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,200
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about that.

911
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,240
As head boy,
I'd like to put my case forward

912
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,040
for saving the Wall of Cock.
It's a piece of school history

913
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,720
and a form of artistic expression that,
in my opinion, shouldn't be censored.

914
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,720
What do you think, Vivienne?

915
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,400
I think the wall should be painted.

916
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,840
It's vulgar, immature, and doesn't
represent the school in the right way.

917
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,240
- Yeah, but...
- I agree.

918
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,720
Would you like Jackson's job?

919
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,920
- Sure, absolutely, yes.
- Wait, what?

920
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,120
Fantastic. You start today.

921
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,880
This will give you lots more time
to focus on your artistic pursuits.

922
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,200
You know it would look amazing
on my school CV. I couldn't say no.
