It was okay.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
I didn't come though.

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,400
But you do usually come, though, right?

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah. I mean, with other guys.

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Well, this is quite a surprise.

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240

Tom Baker, Joe Fuchart, Ryan Bailey...

Okay, I get it. I get it.

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,680

- I don't know. Maybe do some research.

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480

- Mm-hmm.

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,960

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,040

<i>I'm about to be on-air, sweetheart,
so I'll... We'll talk about that later.</i>

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,480
We have Dr. Jean Milburn here
to talk about her new book,

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,040
<i>Uneducated Nation -
A Sex Education Manifesto for Our Youth.</i>

44
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,400
She wrote this as a response to
working on campus at Moordale Secondary,

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,760
which got some pretty bad press recently
following a chlamydia outbreak,

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,760
and the performance
of a so-called "sex musical."

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,600
So, Dr. Milburn, tell us about the book.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,720
Well, I was shocked at the ineptitude
of the SRE curriculums in schools.

49
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,960
So I created this easy-to-read manual
to help empower our teenagers,

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
and their parents, as they become
sexually active young adults.

51
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
Sounds a bit racy.

52
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,880
Well, if, by racy,
you mean highly researched

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,040
and completely essential to the health
and well-being of our children,

54
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,360
then, yes, I suppose it is.

55
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,120
A lot of people
will be sitting at home thinking,

56
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,840
<i>"I wasn't taught this stuff, and I..."</i>

57
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Thanks.

58
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,280
<i>"Is it really necessary?"</i>

59
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,360
<i>Hopefully, if people read my book,
they'll understand how...</i>

60
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,240
They're not still going on
about "Sex School," are they?

61
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,360
Mm. It's as if no one
in this town's had sex before.

62
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, thanks for the tea, Joe!

63
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
I better go.

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,480
I don't wanna be late for my first day.

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,160
If you're not gonna finish your tea,
at least take your lunch.

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Oh.

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,400
It's a fancy sandwich. Cheese <i>and </i>ham.

68
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,840
- Wow.
- Mm.

69
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,880
Hm. Thank you.
See you later. Have a nice day.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,240
- Bye.
- Good luck!

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,600
Enough of the yearning looks, you pillock.
Just tell her you like her already.

72
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,240
- Hi!
- Hi!

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,400
Nice ride, Aimes.

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,800
Thanks! Mum thinks I'm safer driving
than getting the bus, so here we are.

75
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,920
Okay.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,640
Who's this?

77
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,080
Maeve, that's Steve.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,160
No, Aimee, the goat.

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh! She's our commitment animal.

80
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,720
Apparently,
pets bring couples closer together.

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,320
We didn't think about who was gonna
look after her when we're at school, so...

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,440
Yeah. Right!

83
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,440
Whoa! Hey!

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Sorry, love!

85
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,560
- Aimes?
- You okay?

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,960
- No!
- Yeah.

87
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,560

Oatcake, what's on your face?

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,560
It's a mustache.
I've been growing it all summer,

94
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,400
but somebody has been too busy having sex
with their new boyfriend to notice.

95
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,600
Uh, I was hoping it was a phase.

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,600
And Adam and I aren't having <i>sex</i> sex.

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,400
We're just doing hand jobs and stuff.

98
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,760
Hand jobs is sex.
Virginity is a construct.

99
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,080
Yes! Yes, I know!

100
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,240
But I really want to go all the way!

101
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,680
What is it you want to say to me?

102
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
I think you need to be careful.

103
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,640
And I think you need
to make more of an effort with him.

104
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
Okay. Okay, I will.

105
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Hey, I forgot to tell you.
I saw Maeve the other day.

106
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
Why are you telling me about Maeve?

107
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,320
- I thought you might wanna know?
- She hasn't responded to my message.

108
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,200
She's made it abundantly clear
she doesn't want me in her life, so, no.

109
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't need to know
what Maeve is doing anymore.

110
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,200
Well, I just...

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
Oh my God!

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,080
The fuck is that?

113
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
- Adam, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck!

114
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,960
Whoo! Ha ha!

115
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,080
All right, New Kid?

116
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,760
What is that on your face?

117
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,560
What's Adam Groff doing back?

118
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,600
I heard his mum bribed the school
to let him back.

119
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,400
And you know he's gay now, right?

120
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
You okay?

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,720
Yeah, I'm fine.

122
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
Oatcake, you all right?

123
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm A-okay, Eric. I'm fine. I'm chillaxed!

124
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,000
To the max!

125
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,840
Okay then, Mr. Mustache.

126
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,200
So you guys didn't speak much over summer?

127
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,800
No. I haven't heard from him
since last term.

128
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,480
- I always thought you two would make up.
- We're not fighting.

129
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,840
We're just not friends anymore.

130
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,080
Why's there a camera crew here?

131
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
You've grown!

132
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,920
Massive!

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,880
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, girls!
Why is there a goat on campus?

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,880
She's mine and Steve's commitment animal.

135
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,920
Right. You didn't think of a hamster?

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,560
Or, um, a terrapin?

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Or a worm farm?

138
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
How's Eugene?

139
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,400
I mean, long-distance is hard,

140
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,600
but I think if we play our cards right,
we'll both end up at Oxford.

141
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,000
Did I tell you he speaks six languages?

142
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Yes.

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,800
Here are some of the students
currently attendingwhat has been dubbed

144
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
<i>the "Sex School."</i>

145
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh, excuse me, young man,
what can you tell us

146
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,200
about last year's chlamydia outbreak
on campus?

147
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Please speak.

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
<i>We're live.</i>

149
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh, hi. Hi.

150
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
<i>I'm Eric Effiong.</i>

151
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,320
<i>And all I can say about the outbreak was
that it was absolutely terrifying.</i>

152
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
<i>We were scared for our lives.</i>

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
Do you have an opinion, young man?

154
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,640
<i>Yes.</i>

155
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,280
<i>Firstly, it was mass hysteria,</i>

156
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,480
not a chlamydia outbreak.
Your facts are wrong.

157
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,000
- Otis, shh! We're on TV.
- Yeah, shut up, Milburn!

158
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,280
- Are you Dr. Jean Milburn's son?
- Yes. Yes, he is that.

159
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,800
Are the students of Moordale as depraved
as your mother makes out in her new book?

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,760
I think my mum's book is
an honest insight into teenagers today,

161
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,040
and people should probably read it
before speculating.

162
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
<i>You should probably read it.</i>

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
<i>Probably.</i>

164
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
It's true. I do love an empty school.

165
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
- But it's nice to see the students.
- Priceless.

166
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,520
I used to teach geography
before I became a headmaster.

167
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm also very experienced
in teaching history and...

168
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,200
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Groff.
We will consider your application.

169
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,800
Are you actually going to consider
my application?

170
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
No.

171
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,640
I'm sorry. The controversy surrounding
Moordale Secondary is too fresh.

172
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,120
You're also far too experienced
for this role.

173
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,880
This is the fifth teaching position
that I've applied for,

174
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,120
and frankly, I'm running out of options.

175
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,680
It's still a no.

176
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,120

188
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
Good morning, Moordale!

189
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
How is everyone feeling today?

190
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,560
Really good!

191
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
I am your new head teacher, Mrs. Haddon,

192
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,200
but you can call me Hope.

193
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,840
She's cool.
Teachers aren't supposed to be cool.

194
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,040
The first thing you need to know about me

195
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
is that I used to be sitting
where you are now.

196
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,960
Literally.

197
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeah, I went to Moordale too.

198
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
- I love her lipstick. It's so bold.
- Mm.

199
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,320
I've achieved a lot since then.

200
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,240
Two degrees, teaching positions
at some of the country's top institutions,

201
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,040
and by 28, I became
the youngest head teacher in the UK.

202
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,320
But the years I spent in this building
were the best of my life.

203
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,080
This school not only encouraged me
to excel academically,

204
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,000
but it truly allowed me
to find my purpose.

205
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,080
Which is why it's been so hurtful
to read some of the horrible things

206
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,280
written about Moordale in the press.

207
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,840
I don't know what went wrong

208
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
or how we ended up here,

209
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
but I do know

210
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,680
it changes today.

211
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
I can promise you this.

212
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,840
If you work hard
and you take pride in your school,

213
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,440
I will get Moordale and your futures

214
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
back on track.

215
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
- Yeah!
- Oh!

216
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,320
- Wow!
- Come on, girl!

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,280
So let me hear you.

218
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,360
Let's get Moordale...

219
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,960
Back on track!

220
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
Let's get Moordale...

221
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,040
- I love her.
- Back on track!

222
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,880
She's like Joan of Arc, but cooler.

223
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
- Back on track!
- Yes!

224
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,800
Wow!

225
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,560
- Thank you all!
- Come on.

226
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,200
To a great start and a great week. And oh!

227
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Can Otis Milburn
and Maeve Wiley come to my office, please?

228
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,520
You get to meet her in the flesh.

229
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Maeve!

230
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,880
Hi, Jakob!

231
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
You're looking well.

232
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, this?

233
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Funny story.

234
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,320
You impregnated me.

235
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
Surprise!

236
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Oh shit.

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
Damn it! Shit, shit, shit!

238
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,840
How come you're back in school?

239
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,440
I wanna learn some shit, don't I?

240
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,840
You must be Jackson Marchetti,
famed head boy.

241
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,000
That would be me.

242
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,680
Of course. Of course.

243
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,240
Acting, swimming extraordinaire.

244
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,280
I'm re-enrolling.
I think I need to take some kind of test.

245
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,720
Ah, yes, Mr. Groff's son.

246
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,640
My receptionist has your paperwork.

247
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,240
Hi, guys. You can go straight in.

248
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Jackson,
can I get you to come back a bit later?

249
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
It was really lovely to meet you.

250
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,000
I've heard
a lot about the two of you.

251
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Sit down.

252
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,320
Don't worry. You're not in any trouble.

253
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,800
An on-campus sex clinic for teenagers is
rather entrepreneurial, in my opinion.

254
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,440
Shows a lot of business savvy.

255
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,920
Is it something you're wanting to pursue?

256
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
N... no.

257
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,600
No. We don't run the clinic anymore.

258
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,320
We've realized
it wasn't very ethical, and we...

259
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,240
We sort of stopped being friends.
We grew apart.

260
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,880
Oh. That's a shame.

261
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Anyway, I just wanted to say that Moordale
is here to encourage your passions.

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,200
It would be great
if you could keep me in the loop

263
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,560
of any further business endeavors
you come up with in the future.

264
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
That's it.

265
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
Okay.

266
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,720
Thank you.

267
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Oh, Otis...

268
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,040
tell your mum I'm really looking forward
to reading her book.

269
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
I will... Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,720
- I thought we were screwed.
- Me too.

271
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,360
- Shit. Well, thank God.
- Yeah.

272
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,040
So why aren't we friends anymore?

273
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Nice beard.

274
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,480
What's your point?

275
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Nothing.

276
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,640
We're just in different places.

277
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
If that's what you wanna call it.

278
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Bye, Otis.

279
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Maeve?

280
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Yeah?

281
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,920
It's called a mustache.

282
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Yeah, no shit.

283
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,320
- Wait. Did anyone see you coming in?
- No, I was careful.

284
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,440
Okay.

285
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
Careful there. Careful there.

286
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Okay.

287
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,360
Oh, your aftershave is so cheap.
It turns me on.

288
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,360
Hi, I'm looking for Sex King?

289
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,480
<i>What is the problem, young man?</i>

290
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,160
Um, my girlfriend told me
she's never come having sex with me,

291
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,960
but she did used to with other guys.

292
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,200
- <i>What are your measurements?</i>
- What do you mean?

293
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,040
<i>Women need a large penis
in order to come.</i>

294
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,160
<i>A smaller penis could be okay
with the right amount of girth,</i>

295
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
<i>but a small dick and no girth
will never please a woman.</i>

296
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,960
I've, uh, never measured.

297
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,680
<i>Come back to me when you do.</i>

298
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,640
<i>I'll need measurements
for width, length, erect, and flaccid.</i>

299
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,160
<i>That'll be 30 pounds, please.</i>

300
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,440
- But you haven't helped.
<i>- Half now, half later?</i>

301
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,800
Kyle?

302
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,400
Milburn! It's only you.

303
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,960
Thought it was the fuzz again.
I'm the Sex King now!

304
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,960
You are no such thing!

305
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,800
You left a gap in the market.

306
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,920
- "Pubes are overrated"?
- Yeah.

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,400
"To win the race, come on the face"?

308
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,400
Big-time.

309
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,240
Are you just getting
all your advice from porn?

310
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,360
Look, no offense, mate,
but I've had a lot more sex than you.

311
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,960
Well, I'm going to have to report you
because this is dangerous and it's wrong.

312
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Shoot!

313
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
What are you doing in here, anyway?

314
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Nothing.

315
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,920
Kyle.

316
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,080
Ruby! What are you doing here?

317
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,040
Well, well, well.

318
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,280
Ruby Matthews
is secretly shagging Otis Milburn.

319
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,080
- Kyle...
- People are gonna love this!

320
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,800
Kyle, wait!
Please don't tell anyone about this.

321
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,120
Then you can't tell anyone
about me being the Sex King.

322
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,000
Unless you want everyone to know
about your secret sex affair.

323
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Laters, losers.

324
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Well done.

325
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby, wait!

326
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,680
I... I have to tell somebody.
He could hurt people!

327
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Otis,

328
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,160
do you like having sex with me?

329
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Mm.

330
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,720
Do you like it when I touch you?

331
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,680
Would you like it if I were
to suddenly stop touching you forever?

332
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,880
No.

333
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,120
- Then you will keep your mouth shut.
- Mm.

334
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,000
Remember,
five feet behind me at all times.

335
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,800
Someone else is giving out sex advice
on campus.

336
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Who?

337
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,400
I can't say.

338
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,720
What do you mean, "You can't say"?
We tell each other everything!

339
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
You know it stays between me and you.

340
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,440
Okay. Okay, fine.

341
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
- It's Kyle.
- Hmm?

342
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,360
He's charging people for advice
and calling himself the Sex King.

343
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,760
Look at my big tits!

344
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,960
- I mean, we have to tell someone.
- We can't.

345
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Why not?

346
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Because

347
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,280
if I do, he's gonna tell people
I'm hooking up with Ruby.

348
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,640
Sorry, what?

349
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
Look, I haven't told you,

350
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,920
but we've been having casual sex
all over summer.

351
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,920
She wants it to be a secret,
and we haven't seen each other that much.

352
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Are you kidding?

353
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,560
Hey, what's that on your neck?

354
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,680
<i>♪ Everybody dance now... ♪</i>

355
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,960
Oh my God!

356
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,360
What? How? When?

357
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,560
Okay, okay, okay.

358
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,560
So, it was Olivia's party.

359
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,600
You were supposed to come
but decided to watch movies with Adam.

360
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,200
<i>Anyway, I was there on my own.</i>

361
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,560
<i>At first, Ruby ignored me.</i>

362
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
But then...

363
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,440
<i>♪ Give me the music ♪</i>

364
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,280
<i>♪ The music is my life... ♪</i>

365
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,480
- Milburn!
- Oh!

366
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
Oh. Hi, Ruby, what are you?

367
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm early 2000s Christina Aguilera.

368
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,440
Very cool. I'm macaroni cheese.

369
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,200
- Shut up and have sex with me.
- What are you sad about tonight?

370
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm a teenage girl, Otis. I'm always sad.

371
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,280
Wait. Why were you macaroni cheese?

372
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
That's not the point, Eric!

373
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,320
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

374
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,520
I think I'm still figuring it out myself.

375
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,680
You're having casual sex
with the most popular girl in school?

376
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,600
I know!

377
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,640
- I'm so proud of you!
- It's amazing.

378
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,960
- I'm so proud of you!
- And there's no strings.

379
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,600
- So nobody gets hurt.
- Mm.

380
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,200
Wahey! Whoa!

381
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,000
What you gonna do about Kyle?

382
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,640
I guess
it's not my responsibility anymore?

383
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Ow! Oh!

384
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,040
Groff loves penis!

385
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,320
How did the test go?

386
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,320
It does look bad.

387
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,720
You got a problem?

388
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,080
No, Adam. Sorry, Adam.

389
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
What are you doing?

390
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,480
They... they were talking about me.

391
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,880
But that doesn't mean
you can hurt people, Adam.

392
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,120
No, I... I can't do this again.

393
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,600
What are you all looking at?

394
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,960
Hey, hey, little bro!

395
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,800
How was the, uh, job interview?

396
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,120
Did you smash it?

397
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, yes, it was great.
Um, I start tomorrow.

398
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,480
Thank fuck!

399
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,960
Hey, tell me something.

400
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,840
What's an average teacher's salary
these days?

401
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,080
You know, ballpark. We were talking
at work, and we haven't got a clue.

402
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,440
- Well, it starts...
- Mm.

403
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,000
Taste that. Go on, it's a protein shake.

404
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,280
How fucking good is that?

405
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,520
Come on! Eh?

406
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,480
Oh shit. You remember James McBride?
He's only gone and bought a yacht.

407
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,480
Now the wife's dropping fucking hints.

408
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,280
Know what the secret
to a happy marriage is?

409
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm not really the best person
to answer that, Peter.

410
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,360
Money. Well, that and keeping
the toilet seat down, but

411
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,280
mostly fucking money...

412
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,120
I'm so wired after court today!
I fucking destroyed the defendant.

413
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,240
I mean, I just like...
...dismembered them.

414
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,160
Come on. Quick game of squash, Chub-Chub?

415
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
Oink, oink.

416
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,400
Nice day at school?

417
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,880
Yeah, it was all right.
Your book is causing quite the stir.

418
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,520
- Press there and everything.
- Really?

419
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,760
- It's not that controversial.
- I know.

420
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,120
Mm. Wanna watch a movie tonight?

421
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
How about <i>When Harry Met Sally...?</i>

422
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
Or...

423
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,160
<i>...How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days</i>?

424
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,560
You choose.

425
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,080
I'm going out.

426
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Where?

427
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,920
I have homework with Eric.

428
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,280
- I'll be home later.
- Right.

429
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Oh, Otis.

430
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,560
I've got a scan tomorrow.
Will you come with me?

431
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,520
Please?

432
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Sure.

433
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,000
But you have to tell him, Mum.

434
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
I will.

435
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
Go away, Mum.

436
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,840
You're not wanking, are you?

437
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,120
Are you okay?

438
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,240
Do you wanna go and smash some shit?

439
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,240
Or we could talk instead?

440
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I'm... I'm not good at talking.

441
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,240
When my mum died,
I was angry all the time.

442
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,480
My counselor told me
to take my anger out on a pillow,

443
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,440
so I punched my pillow
every night for months.

444
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,400
But in the end, it turned out that
talking was the only thing that helped.

445
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,560
What happened today?

446
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240
I... I don't want people
to think I'm a pussy.

447
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,040
- 'Cause you're dating a guy?
- I'm still a man.

448
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,880
Yeah. Of course you're still a man.

449
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,800
But you know,
men don't need to hit things,

450
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,640
and men can date other men.

451
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,680
- You need to tell Eric how you feel.
- I don't...

452
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I don't know how.

453
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,120
Well, I think you should try.

454
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,280
Ya pussy!

455
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,480
Can we do the punching pillow thing first?

456
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
Absolutely. Bring it here.

457
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,400
So what you have do is
just take a deep breath in.

458
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,976
- Mm-hmm.
- Get yourself all pumped up.

459
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,480
Ah!

460
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,360
Get it.

461
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,280
That's a good effort, Michaela!

462
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,400
Quick shower, then, uh, Quorn Bolognese.

463
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,800
Fucking love Quorn!

464
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Oh God.

465
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,240
I said, don't wear your jacket!
People might recognize you!

466
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,400
It's cold, and we're in the woods.
I'm sure it will be fine.

467
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,840
And the jeans...

468
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,240
Mmm.

469
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Thank you.

470
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,200
Yes.

471
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,680
Hello!

472
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,616
Let me get my leg.

473
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,880
Shh.

474
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,600
Okay.

475
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,960
Oh! Ow!

476
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,320
Ow, ow, ow!

477
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
- Stop.
- Careful of my hair.

478
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,400
Okay, this isn't working.
Can't we go to your house? Or mine?

479
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,400
Houses are off-limits. It's too risky.

480
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
I get that you want us to be a secret,

481
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,080
but it feels like you're embarrassed
to even be seen near me.

482
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm a very private person, Otis.

483
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,440
I think you're embarrassed.

484
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,320
Okay, fine. I'm embarrassed!

485
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,120
I am hot and popular,

486
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,760
and you are a badly-dressed stick man
with a creepy mustache.

487
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,680
You said you liked my mustache.

488
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,360
And I was good at sex.

489
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
You are good at sex, Otis,

490
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,000
but that doesn't mean
I want to be seen in public with you.

491
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,320
Well, I don't wanna be seen in public
with someone who is mean

492
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,960
and uses people for their good sex skills!

493
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,800
I have more self-respect than that.

494
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,400
We're done.

495
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,400
And we're not done. We're over!

496
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,720
"Over" and "done" mean the same thing!

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,400
Listen, I know you're not speaking to me,
but I really think we should talk.

507

Call me back?

508
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I miss you.

509
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,000
Hey, Maeve.

510
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,880
Can I talk to you about something?

511
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Yeah.

512
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
What's wrong?

513
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,560
Mum still isn't answering me.

514
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
She hates me.

515
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,400
You did the right thing,
and don't forget that.

516
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,880
What do you wanna talk about?

517
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,280
I wanted to talk about the...

518
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Um...

519
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,520
I wanted to talk about...

520
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,480
breakfast.

521
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,960
Raspberry or strawberry jam?

522
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Uh, raspberry.

523
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,920
Well, good news, we've got neither.

524
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,560
Mm. Very good, very good.
I'll be out in a second.

525
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
<i>Thanks so much
for coming in again, Jackson.</i>

526
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,640
I basically
just wanted to get to know you a bit,

527
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200
seeing as we'll be working
closely together.

528
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,920
You know, I was once head girl here.

529
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,120
I get the responsibility.

530
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Yeah, it's fun.

531
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,080
And challenging, I hope.

532
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,920
Hm.

533
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The thing is, I'm really wanting to inject
some proper passion back into this place.

534
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,040
To create an environment
where everyone can excel,

535
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,160
no matter what path
they choose to go down.

536
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,840
Hope, the press are here
for your interview.

537
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,320
Thank you. I'll be right there.

538
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,040
I wanted to share with you
the new school values.

539
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,640
I'm excited to hear your feedback
when you get a chance.

540
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Hi!

541
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,920
Oh, and, Jackson,

542
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm going to need you to take this role
a bit more seriously than you have been.

543
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,800
I'm not really into
the whole "cool guy" thing

544
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,920
if you know what I mean.

545
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,760
Not really.

546
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,960
You will.

547
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,120
She's nuts.

548
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,200
- Cal, it's PE. Are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

549
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,960
- Whoa!
- Hey.

550
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,360
- Oh. Oops.
- Whoa!

551
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm... Okay, I'm in your way, obviously.

552
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
It's okay.

553
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,120
After you, good human.

554
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,880
- Hey.
- Hey.

555
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,600
I don't like it when I hurt people.

556
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
- Then don't.
- Yeah.

557
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,280
I don't know why I do it. I just get so

558
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,240
angry, but...

559
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
I wanna change.

560
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Okay.

561
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,080
You're a poofter now, Groff?

562
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,480
Yeah, I am a bit of a poofter now.

563
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,400
Is that all right with you?

564
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,760
Yeah, mate. I think it's cool.

565
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,960
Yeah, congrats, dude.

566
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,240
You don't need to congratulate someone
on being gay.

567
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880

Okay. Width, length, flaccid, erect.

577
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,560
Shit. It's not very big, is it?
Come on. Let's get you hard.

578
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,040
Yeah!

579
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,320
Come on!

580
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,680
For the love of God! Come on!

581
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
Come on!

582
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,760
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- And you.

583
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
We were thinking, I don't know...

584
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Shit!

585
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,760
Strange.

586
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,200
I guess
it's lost property for you.

587
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Fuck.

588
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,760
Dude, why are you naked?

589
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,040
Don't look at my dick!

590
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,600
Hey, Otis. Is it true that you
and Ruby are a thing now?

591
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,000
No. No. Why did you say that?

592
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,360
Everyone's talking about it.

593
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,560
Sex King.

594
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,840
So in the structure,
the double bond causes a kink in the tail.

595
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
Uh-huh.

596
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,200
So... Aimee Gibbs!

597
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,480
Sir, I need to take Goat out for a wee.

598
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,800
Right, fine. Go on.

599
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,000
See, this is exactly why you shouldn't be
bringing livestock into school.

600
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,360
- My mum's looking after her tomorrow.
- Good.

601
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,120
Okay, this is the only goat
you should be seeing in school.

602
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,560
Uh, it's a goatee.

603
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,040
It's my new look. Hands up who likes it.

604
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,440
Oh God. Oh God.

605
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,760
Do a wee for Mummy.

606
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,816
What the f...

607
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,240
Fatty acids!

608
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,600
- Okay...
- Sir, Dex Thompson's naked!

609
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,800
Oh my God! It's tiny!

610
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,840
Look away!
I don't want you to see my dick!

611
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,840
Fuck!

612
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,840
Penis!

613
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,160
What is happening? Tell me now!

614
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,040
Why are you naked?

615
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Dex?

616
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,416
- I need to borrow this.
- No, not my goat. Not my goat.

617
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,120
- I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
- Don't take her!

618
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,520
- I'll bring it back.
- Please!

619
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,360
- I'm sorry.
- Please!

620
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,080
Goat!

621
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,960
I would say I'm here to try
and bring back a sense of community

622
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
and family values that...

623
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,600
Is that a dog?

624
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,520
<i>It's a fucking goat.
Film it, for Christ's sake!</i>

625
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,880
What were you saying about family values,
Headmistress?

626
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,680
<i>Would you just excuse me
just one moment? Thank you.</i>

627
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
No.

628
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,320
No, no, no!

629
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,120
No, no, no, no!

630
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,560
I think I just lost all my work.

631
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,760
Yeah, the computers are terrible.
Maybe get a laptop.

632
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,880
- Hey. Hey, have you seen Kyle?
- No.

633
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,560
I should never have listened
to the fucking Sex King!

634
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
Dex, are you okay?

635
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,040
I should never have listened
to the Sex King.

636
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,080
Who's the Sex King?

637
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
Kyle.

638
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,560
Okay, okay, okay.

639
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,920
Hey!

640
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,960
Are you stalking me, woman?

641
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,080
No! No, don't be ridiculous.

642
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,360
I just happened to be driving by
this place where you work.

643
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,360
You've driven past 15 times!

644
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,640
I can see you out the window.

645
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
What's going on?

646
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,640
Can we talk?

647
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,840
If you stop being scary.

648
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Yes.

649
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,680
- Are you stepping out?
- Mm-hmm.

650
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Good.

651
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,800
<i>So, Dex,</i>

652
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,080
how did we get here?

653
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,480
I was measuring my penis.

654
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,080
Mm. I told him to do that.
So what're your stats, then?

655
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,240
I was interrupted.

656
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,840
And I don't wanna know.

657
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,240
What if I do have a small penis,
and I can never please a woman?

658
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,600
Maybe you can look at it for me
and tell me if it's small.

659
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
- Yeah! Sure.
- No! No! No!

660
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,920
No! No, nobody's inspecting anything

661
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
because penis size isn't important.

662
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,280
Only guys with small dicks say that.

663
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,120
Dex, you shouldn't compare
the size of your dick to anyone else's.

664
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,640
It's irrelevant and unhelpful.

665
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,960
You'd also be surprised

666
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,720
how many guys have insecurities
about the size of their penis

667
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,440
and exaggerated views
as to what other male genitals look like.

668
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,080
It's true. I wish mine was straighter.

669
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,720
It sort of bends to the side a bit.

670
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,440
It's... it's wonky, you know?

671
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,520
It's not wonky.

672
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
It's unique.

673
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,960
Thanks, Milburn.

674
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,920
That means a lot.

675
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,920
Well, that's very touching.

676
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,440
Dex, why did you say
you'll never please a woman?

677
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,360
He can't make
his girlfriend come during sex.

678
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,000
What kind of sex?

679
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,480
You know, just normal fucking.

680
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:12,040
Okay. Well, most women struggle
to orgasm from penetration alone.

681
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,240
- Really?
- Yeah.

682
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,600
You heard of the clitoris?

683
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,400
Sure.

684
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,160
Might be time to get acquainted with it.
Ask your girlfriend what she likes.

685
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,720
And remember that orgasm
doesn't have to be the main goal of sex.

686
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,440
You can have fun

687
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,200
and be creative.

688
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Could you clarify?

689
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,680
You have ten fingers and a tongue, Dex.

690
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,480
Use your imagination.

691
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,560
Wow.

692
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,160
You guys are actually really good
at giving out sex advice.

693
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,200
Maybe keep this on the down-low?
Could be bad for my business.

694
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,600
Hey. I'm going to lost property,
but thanks for the help.

695
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,120
Oh! And, hey, Otis,
I heard about you and Ruby.

696
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,840
Don't know how
you pulled that off, but congrats.

697
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,240
- You and Ruby are a thing.
- Well, we're not anymore.

698
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,240
We were for a bit,
but it was casual, you know?

699
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,360
No feelings.

700
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,680
No feelings. Sounds cool.

701
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Thanks for telling everyone, Kyle.

702
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,640
Well, I didn't tell anyone.

703
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,600
But now everyone knows
about you and Ruby,

704
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,520
guess I can carry on being the Sex King.

705
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,360
Au revoir, loser!

706
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,480
It means
exactly the opposite of that, Kyle!

707
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,640
I didn't know
whether I was going to keep it.

708
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
I was confused, and

709
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,880
I kept putting it off.

710
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,320
Then I started writing my book.

711
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,960
And I enjoyed every second of that,
and I got immersed.

712
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,200
- How could you keep this from me?
- I wanted to tell you, I did.

713
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,440
I... But the...

714
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,440
the longer I waited, the harder it got.

715
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,480
I'm having a baby?

716
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,440
I don't want you to feel
backed into a corner.

717
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,000
I have decided to keep this baby,

718
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,800
and I feel empowered by that choice, and...

719
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,280
I only need you to be involved if you feel
it's something that you would like.

720
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,680
Do you want me to be involved?

721
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,600
Of course I do.

722
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,200
But only if you want to be involved.

723
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,240
I have a scan

724
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,320
tonight at 4:30.

725
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,240
- At Moordale Community Hospital. You...
- Thank you.

726
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,640
I really have to think about this.

727
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,880
- Of course.
- Yeah.

728
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,120
<i>I would say I'm here</i>

729
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,680
<i>to bring back
a sense of community and family values.</i>

730
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,720
<i>- What were you saying about family values?</i>
- Come in.

731
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,840
<i>Would you just excuse me
just one moment? Thank you.</i>

732
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,400
The clinic is still running
in the old toilet block.

733
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,040
Maeve and I have nothing to do with it,

734
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,240
but it's still happening,
and it's dangerous.

735
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,440
Students shouldn't be getting advice
from students,

736
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,480
but they still need help,

737
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,920
so hopefully, you can provide
the right service on campus.

738
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,000
Thank you for telling me, Otis.

739
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,120
Miss Sands, I did type up my essay,
but the school computer broke.

740
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,400
- Can I get an extension?
- Okay. Don't let it happen again.

741
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,160
Oh, uh, Maeve,
have a look at applying for that.

742
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,440
You're the perfect candidate.

743
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,960
Adam, I marked your test this afternoon.
Here's your timetable.

744
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,520
Ah! What set are you in?

745
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,640
Take a guess.

746
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,600
Eric. Eric!
Everybody knows about me and Ruby.

747
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,800
Did you tell anyone?

748
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,600
I accidentally told Adam.

749
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
And I told Ola.

750
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,000
- I told Lily.
- And I told everyone.

751
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,720
This was supposed to stay
between me and you!

752
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,440
What are you doing here?

753
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,000
I sold my first painting,
so no beans on toast for us tonight.

754
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,880
We are going out for pizza!

755
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,080
Oh, well done.
Always knew you would, genius.

756
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,760
Apparently, you're secretly sleeping
with Otis Milburn.

757
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,040
Ugh! As if.

758
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
It's true.

759
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,320
No, it's really not.
It's really not.

760
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Mum?

761
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,800
Hi, how are you?

762
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,960
<i>Stop calling me.</i>

763
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,360
- We have a friendly relationship.
- Yeah, but not that friendly.

764
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,520
I didn't come,
but that was so much better!

765
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,160

So now everyone knows anyway,

768
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,320
I was thinking
we could keep seeing each other?

769
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,120
You know,
because I like having sex with you.

770
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,880
No more cars or toilets?

771
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,720

777
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
It needed to end.

778
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,560
So it's really done, then.

779
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,720
