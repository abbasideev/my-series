Hey.

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,720
- Hey.
- What happened?

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,080
She hemorrhaged.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,760
Still in surgery, and the baby's fine,
but I haven't seen her yet.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
- I'm gonna get more tea. See you in a bit.
- Okay.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Is she okay?

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,520
Things are kinda tense at home.

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,840
My mum and I had a fight.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
What about?

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Everything.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
And nothing.

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,520
She tried to ask me about Maeve,

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,000
and I told her
that everything she does is a mess.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
I was horrible, and now I...

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,120
I just wish
I could tell her all about her.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
Your mum

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,320
will be fine.

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,320
What if she's not?

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
She's Jean Milburn.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,200
She has to be.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,520
Come here.

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,440
- Michael?
- Hm?

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,200
You need to go.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,640
Do I have to?

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
Should we tell Adam?

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Michael,

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,440
we're getting a divorce.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,080
This is all so confusing.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,480
Maybe you could come over
to the flat later, and I'll cook.

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,520
We can talk through everything then.

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,120
Okay.

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Okay.

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Is something up with you and Adam?

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Otis, we're not talking about
my relationship problems now.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
Please.

59
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
Just distract me.

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,880
I kissed someone else in Nigeria.

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,800
I told Adam. I think we might be over.

62
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,000
I wanted to tell you, too,

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,880
but I just... I was so ashamed,
and I didn't know how to.

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,640
- Do you want it to be over?
- I don't know.

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,640
I feel like a bad person.
I don't even know why I did it. It just...

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
It made me feel free.

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,480
You're not a bad person.

68
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,000
- Is my mum okay?
- It's too early to say.

69
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,480
But we should have
more information for you soon.

70
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,920
Would you like to meet your sister?

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,760
We can see the baby.

72
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,360
Uh, I'll wait here
just in case there's updates on your mum.

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
Hi, guys.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Wow.

75
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
- You can open the hatch if you want.
- Yeah?

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,880
- Yeah.
- Can I touch her?

77
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah, you can touch her. Gently.

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,360
Hello.

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,600
- I'm Otis.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,080
Ola, you've...

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
Morning.

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
Morning.

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,640
- Brought you a cup of tea.
- Oh, thank you.

84
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,560
You look happy.

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,400
Is that anything to do with Otis?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Look at you. You can't stop smiling.

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,480
Do you know, I'm not planning on
having anybody else take this room.

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,840
It's free if you'd like it.

89
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Elsie loves having you here.

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,760
I'd really like that.

91
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,080
Do I have to keep that shit on the wall?

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,760
No. You can have
whatever you want on the walls.

93
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,200
Okay, good.

94
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
- Maeve!
- Good morning.

95
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,200
Good... Oh my... Good morning!

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
Oh my God!

97
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
What are we gonna do today?

98
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Hmm? Whoo!

99
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Adam?

100
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,080
Oh, I'm just popping to pick up
some things for Jean Milburn.

101
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,200
What's this?

102
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,600
I, uh, I'm competing with Madam tonight.

103
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,040
I didn't think you would wanna come.

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,040
Of course I wanna be there.

105
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,920
Is your friend Eric coming?

106
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,160
Uh, no. We... we had a fight.

107
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Oh.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sorry to hear that.

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I really wish you'd told me about this.

110
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,200
People like to be asked to go to things.
Makes them feel like you care.

111
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,160
I will ask next time.

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,640
- I'm off for my run.
- Okay.

113
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,880
- Hey, Mum.
- Hm?

114
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,400
Um, did you always know
that you were a lesbian?

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
Why?

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,920
Oh, I just never asked before.
It's fine if you don't wanna answer, I...

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
No, no, no, no. Um...

118
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,760
I actually didn't connect with that part
of myself until I met your mum.

119
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,080
Oh, so it's more about the person?

120
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,560
Well, I think I was in denial

121
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
for a long time.

122
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,760
I had a lot of shame.

123
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,040
I mean, I always knew those feelings
were there. I just didn't <i>know</i> know.

124
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,840
Does that make sense?

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Yeah.

126
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Yeah, I think so.

127
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,760
Sorry you felt shame, Mum.

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,400
Did you want to tell me something?

129
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm not telling you that I'm gay.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,760
- Well...
- Thanks though.

131
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,000
Actually,
can I join you for your run?

132
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,920
- Yes.
- Yeah?

133
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,480
If you remember where your trainers are.

134
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
- Come on, then!
- All right.

135
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,240
Oh, you're dressed!

136
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,880
Do you want a lift to school?

137
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,120
Did you guys decide on a name?

138
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
No.

139
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,480
We couldn't agree.

140
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
- Did you pick Ola's name?
- No.

141
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,920
Her mother did.

142
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,520
It'd be bad luck if my mum died.

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,480
'Cause your wife died. You'd be cursed.

144
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,920
- I don't know why I said that.
- It's all right.

145
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,040
It's because you're scared.

146
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,240
I'm scared too.

147
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,720
If something happens to my mum,
I don't wanna live with my dad.

148
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Otis,

149
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,880
I know I'm not your father...

150
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,080
but I'm not going anywhere.

151
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
- You didn't finish the tree house.
- Yeah.

152
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,040
Won't be much time now...

153
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,080
...with this little one.

154
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,560
Any news about my partner?

155
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,320
They found
the cause of the bleed,

156
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
but they're still operating.

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,160
Gonna be all right.

158
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
- Hello, Aimee.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Groff.

159
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,136
Oh, wait. Can I still call you that?
I heard you're getting a divorce.

160
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,040
Oh. Maureen is fine.

161
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,536
I'm here for an appointment
with Dr. Milburn, but no one's in.

162
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh, she went into labor.
I'm just picking up some stuff for her.

163
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,400
Oh my God! Maureen, babes, this is huge!

164
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,760
Oh yeah,
Mum couldn't look after Goat today.

165
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Yeah, sure.

166
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm dying for a poo. I'm so anxious,
I think it's gonna be a sloppy one.

167
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Oh.

168
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,080
<i>♪ There's tears in your eyes ♪</i>

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,040
<i>♪ They seem so lonely ♪</i>

170
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,120
You know, I think I saw an alien once.

171
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,960
It was when I was at nursing college,
and I was coming back from the pub.

172
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
Suddenly, there was this immensely bright,
green light in the sky.

173
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,920
It got closer and closer, and I could feel
the hairs on my arms and neck standing up.

174
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,200
Then it... it just vanished.

175
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,680
Were you drunk, Mum?

176
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,880
I have no idea what it was.

177
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,440
Maybe you should still go
to the Eighth thing later, love.

178
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,800
I mean, you never know.

179
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,040
I think it's time
I outgrew the alien thing.

180
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
But thanks.

181
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,120
Can you throw that stuff out for me?

182
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,200
I don't need it anymore.

- See you after school.
- Okay. Bye.

196
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

197
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

198
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,360
Buh-bye.

199
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Ooh!

200
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Miss?

201
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,480
- Yes.
- I, uh, I took your advice.

202
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,160
About how everyone's good at something.

203
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,800
Hm.

204
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,360
- Wait, is this tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,080
Okay. I'll try my best to be there.

206
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,760
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

207
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
You're back early.

208
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,560
Yeah, I got a call saying
I could come back in, so...

209
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
How are you?

210
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,040
Uh, Eric kissed someone else.

211
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,120
You're probably happy to hear that.

212
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm actually not.

213
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,360
Yeah, it feels shit.

214
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,880
I hate him, which is annoying
because I also love him.

215
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,080
I know that feeling, yeah.

216
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
What's this?

217
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm competing in a thing where tiny dogs
jump through hoops and shit.

218
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,480
That's really stupid, man.

219
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Charming.

220
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,240
Whoo!

221
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
What's going on?

222
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,720
She's gone! Her office is empty!

223
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,840
Holy fuck!

224
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,456
- Oh my God!
- I don't believe it.

225
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,600
- Explains why they let me back.
- She's gone.

226
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,200
No loitering!

227
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,000
- Your face. What's going on?
- Hope's gone.

228
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,320
- Huh?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,280
Is someone gonna take over?

230
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,600
Maybe you should apply, sir.

231
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,920
No, I'm serious. Mm.

232
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Yeah.

233
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
What do you want?

234
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,920
Um... Oh, a KitKat. Always a KitKat.

235
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,920
- Thank you, Sugar Daddy.
- Mm-hmm.

236
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,360
- Oh my God!
- No!

237
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,360
Why does this always happen?

238
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,080
- Every time. Every time.
- Innit?

239
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,320
Come on. Come on!

240
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,960
Uh, I don't think that's helping.

241
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,320
I can probably reach it.
I have long arms. I can reach it.

242
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,080
- Uh, don't get stuck.
- I can do it.

243
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
- I don't need a KitKat.
- I can do it.

244
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Okay.

245
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,280
Come on!

246
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,056
Just... I heard a man got trapped
under a vending machine, and he died.

247
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,240
I can do it!

248
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
Fuck!

249
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mate.

250
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,480
She can't... she can't die.

251
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
Oh no. Oh no, she won't.

252
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,920
She won't. She can't.

253
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,800
Will you be long?
I just wanna get a packet of Hula Hoops.

254
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,560
Excuse me?

255
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,760
Can you not see
that we are very upset here?

256
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,000
- It's fine.
- Go away. Right now.

257
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,880
Get out of here!

258
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,880
Now!

259
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,040
Nonsense!

260
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,760
Unbelievable.

261
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,960
Jean is out of surgery.

262
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,440
<i>♪ They wanna have fun... ♪</i>

263
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,120
Uh, why are you so happy?

264
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Because Hope resigned, and Eugene is here.

265
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,200
Uh-uh!

266
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,440
I'm gonna go call Eugene.

267
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,160
So...

268
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,920
I acted a bit like an idiot yesterday.

269
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,160
Mm-hmm.

270
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,080
I think your cishet brain
maybe exploded a bit.

271
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,000
You didn't have to run away.

272
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,400
- I freaked out.
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,840
I have a free period later
if you wanna talk about it.

274
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,480
Yes.

275
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,040
I'll come find you, okay?

276
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,960
Knickers.

277
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,080
Three.

278
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Oh!

279
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
I wouldn't go in there for a bit
if I were you.

280
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,080
- Oh.
- No, seriously.

281
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
Do you want to talk about
why you're feeling anxious?

282
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Yeah.

283
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,120
I need to break up with my boyfriend.

284
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,720
He's so lovely to me,
but I've changed so much,

285
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,720
and I want to know who I am on my own.

286
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Mm.

287
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,320
I don't think I know that either.

288
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,800
It's so difficult to be alone.

289
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,280
There are so many man jobs
I don't know how to do.

290
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,080
Yeah! Steve is so good
at opening my crisps.

291
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,720
Hm.

292
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, it probably will be hard,

293
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,240
but if you feel you want
to spend some time with yourself,

294
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,560
you should take that opportunity.

295
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,840
Your boyfriend will be all right.

296
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,160
Can I ask you something?

297
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,440
You know Adam?

298
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
Well, obviously.

299
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,960
Yeah.

300
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,840
Do you think he's happy?

301
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,760
Oh, well, we don't really talk.

302
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,760
He doesn't really have many friends,
but he seems happier now he's with Eric.

303
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Oh.

304
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Right.

305
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,600
Toothbrush.

306
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
Okay.

307
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Oh.

308
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
- I think, then, I've got everything.
- Great. I'll meet you outside.

309
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,440
Okay.

310
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,680
- Oops.
- What?

311
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,880
- I left the keys inside.
- Oh fuck!

312
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,000
What?

313
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,640
Goat.

314
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
There she is.

315
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh!

316
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
- Hey.
- Hello, darling.

317
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
Hey, Mum.

318
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,200
- Do I have three eyes?
- No, no.

319
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,960
No, you just have two.

320
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,360
Feels like I've got three.

321
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,720
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

322
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,640
Oh, I've got something to tell you.

323
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,280
Very important.

324
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,640
I've been meaning to tell you
for a very long time.

325
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
Yeah?

326
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I

327
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
am the king.

328
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,280
The king of what?

329
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,240
The King of Everything.

330
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,480
Isn't that the best news
you've ever heard?

331
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,000
- Yeah, that's pretty great.
- Mm.

332
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,040
I knew you'd think so.

333
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
Oh my God.

334
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,361
- Why am I wearing this horrible dress?
- Mum. Mum, just... just rest.

335
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,040
- Just lie... just lie down.
- Someone's taken my knickers.

336
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,080
- Has he taken my knickers?
- No.

337
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
- Um...
- Did he take them?

338
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,760
Darling, I think he took my knickers.

339
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,400
My mum thinks she's the king.

340
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,360
What?

341
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
She's high on anesthetic.

342
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,880
She told me she's the King of Everything.

343
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,040
- Oh, I'm really glad she's okay, man.
- Yeah.

344
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,240
You've been an amazing friend,
but you need to go talk to Adam now.

345
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,040
Oh God!

346
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,800
I don't know what to say to him.

347
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
Just tell him how you feel.

348
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,360
...the energy required to completely remove
an electron from an atom of an element

349
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
to form an ion.

350
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,000
So, ionization energy. You're all to know
that formula for your exam on Monday.

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,840
If you look in your textbooks
on page 32, you will see...

352
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,800
Over here!

353
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,440
You're supposed to be on the run.

354
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
I know that.

355
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,440
That's why I'm hiding.

356
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
You should come in the bush with me.

357
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,840
Mum, you need to disappear.

358
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,960
I had to give you something.

359
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,200
- What's this?
- I want you to go do that America thing.

360
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,216
- Where did you get it?
- It doesn't matter. I sold some shit.

361
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
I want you to go.

362
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,920
It's too late anyway.

363
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,080
Supposed to leave tomorrow.
I haven't paid, so...

364
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Well, call 'em up and charm 'em.
Try not to sound so angry.

365
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,840
I can't.

366
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Yes, you can.

367
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Mum...

368
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm moving in with Anna.

369
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,160
I feel really guilty,
like I've left you behind.

370
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,400
No.

371
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,080
You never left me behind.

372
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,120
I left you behind.

373
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,320
I was too young and stupid to have kids.

374
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,840
I've let you down over and over again.

375
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,520
That's why I need you to take this money

376
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,440
and go to America.

377
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Or

378
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
buy yourself something pretty
for your new room.

379
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,480
Now, I don't wanna hear any more about it.

380
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
Oh.

381
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,080
I gotta go.

382
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,760
So I thought about it a lot.

383
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,840
I just don't think I'm queer.

384
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,320
I figured as much.

385
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,000
I thought you were all about
breaking out of boxes.

386
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
So what does it matter
if I'm queer or if I'm not?

387
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,880
Because I'm not a girl,
and I'm worried you still see me as one.

388
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
Yeah, maybe I do.

389
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,920
But I'm open, like, I'm...

390
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,440
willing to learn.

391
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,800
Here's the thing.

392
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm still figuring out
so much shit about myself.

393
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040
I can't carry you too.

394
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,000
And I still wanna have fun when I can

395
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
because I feel so heavy all the time.

396
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,240
So, what does this mean?

397
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,040
It means that we can still be friends.

398
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,560
I don't really have friends
that I've been with like that.

399
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,480
There's a first for everything.

400
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,840
I do really like you.

401
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
I really like you too.

402
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm sorry that

403
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,000
this isn't gonna work out.

404
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,120
<i>Could sixth formers make their way
to the common room, please?</i>

405
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,720
<i>Could all sixth formers
please make their way to the common room?</i>

406
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,280
Oh, Mark! Hello.

407
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,040
I was wondering whether you
and I could have a conversation

408
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,240
about the head teacher position.

409
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,600
What do you want to know?

410
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,520
I would like to put myself forward
for the job.

411
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,120
I have worked at Moordale for seven years.

412
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,920
- I have a good understanding...
- Sorry, uh...

413
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,760
- Emily. Yeah.
- Emily. Emily.

414
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,000
We're not taking applications currently,
but thanks.

415
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,800
Can you sign your story?

416
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,880
Glenoxi's my hero.

417
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,880
No. No, no.

418
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm the grown-up.

419
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Oh!

420
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,480
It's open!

421
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,440
Go, Maureen! Go, Maureen!
Go, Maureen! Go, Maureen!

422
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Goat?

423
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,360
I think Goat might be a lesbian.

424
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,720
Following the coverage
of yesterday's events,

425
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,520
our investors have pulled
all of their funding from the school.

426
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,840
What?

427
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,120
So we have no choice but to sell
Moordale Secondary to developers.

428
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,320
What?

429
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,880
Now, I have been sent
to tell you personally

430
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,280
because, as sixth formers, this decision
could have a dire effect on your futures.

431
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,480
You will need to find
educational alternatives

432
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,040
to complete your schooling
by the end of this term.

433
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,880
This term?

434
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,200
Basically, you guys are fucked.

435
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,480
Shit.

436
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,600
That backfired.

437
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,280
- What a waste of time.
- Hey.

438
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,240
Speaking up for what you believe in
is never a waste of time.

439
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
You did the right thing.

440
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,160
Thanks, miss.

441
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,440
I was not expecting that.

442
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
<i>Yeah.</i>

443
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,520
Listen, I, uh...

444
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,240
was wondering if you'd read my poem.

445
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,560
I wanna give it to Eric,
but I think it's still shit.

446
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,080
Okay, I'll read it for you.

447
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,680
Um, they're selling the school.

448
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,800
What? When?

449
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,960
- Adam, I'm so sorry. I...
- Stop apologizing.

450
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,880
Can we walk home together?

451
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,400
Yeah.

452
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,280
I'll give you a hand.

453
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,440
Thanks. This woman bumped into me,
and she didn't even say sorry.

454
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,680
Oh, it's you.

455
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,920
You have a bit of lipstick on your teeth.

456
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
I've had a shit 24 hours.

457
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,760
Yeah, I heard.

458
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,720
Would you like some KitKat?

459
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
What the fuck?

460
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Hey.

461
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Hey, are you following me?
Because you're starting to freak me out.

462
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,520
I... I wanted to say sorry.

463
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,720
- For what?
- For not speaking up.

464
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,440
That's okay.
You'll speak up when you're ready.

465
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Also, uh,

466
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
I need your help.

467
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,440
- Delivery.
- Oh.

468
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,040
Maureen, thank you.

469
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,920
It means a lot.

470
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,760
She's out of surgery.

471
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.

472
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,440
I'll pop in when she's feeling stronger,

473
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,160
but if there's anything else I can do,
anything, just ask.

474
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,480
Thank you.

475
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,960
See you.

476
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Hi, kid.

477
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,600
How long you been sitting here?

478
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,680
I think I did this, Dad.

479
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,000
What do you mean?

480
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,000
I think I made
all this bad stuff happen to Jean.

481
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,160
I said some really terrible things to her.
I had some really horrible thoughts.

482
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Jean is awake.

483
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,040
And she's fine.

484
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,600
- Okay.
- Okay?

485
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,080
And we all have
horrible thoughts sometimes.

486
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Doesn't mean bad things will happen.

487
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,080
Something bad did happen.

488
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,600
- Dad?
- Yeah?

489
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,400
I'm pleased that you're happy with Jean
and that you're moving on.

490
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,880
But I'm also really worried
you'll like your new family more than me

491
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,520
because I remind you of the pain.

492
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,680
You remind me of joy.

493
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,360
Only joy.

494
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Okay?

495
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Okay.

496
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm thinking that maybe
we could pretend it didn't happen.

497
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,240
But it did happen.

498
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,360
I messed up.

499
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Badly.

500
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,240
I... I can be okay with it.
It was a stupid kiss.

501
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,240
It didn't mean anything. I can get over...

502
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,760
I don't think it was just
a stupid kiss, Adam.

503
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Did you...

504
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
did you sleep with this guy? Is that...

505
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,680
No. That's not what I mean.

506
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,440
We only kissed, but it wasn't stupid.

507
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
It was something.

508
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
You don't feel bad?

509
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,480
Yes, I feel bad.

510
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,160
I feel bad I hurt you.

511
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,040
But you wouldn't take it back?

512
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,960
No, I don't think I would.

513
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,880
- It felt easy with him.
- Mm.

514
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,880
And it feels hard with me.

515
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,160
I just feel like I'm... I'm ready to fly,

516
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,880
and you're just learning to walk.

517
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,960
And I've worked really hard
to find myself,

518
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,600
and I'm beginning to lose who I am.

519
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,000
We're gonna break up, aren't we?

520
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,200
- I think we have to.
- Yeah.

521
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,920
It's not your fault.

522
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,320
We're just going in different directions.

523
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,320
- Adam, can we keep talking?
- Mm... Uh...

524
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,640
Don't...

525
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,120
...have anything else to say.

Sweet baby girl,

534
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,680
you've had a tough time of it.

535
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,680
Well, she's definitely not a Thor.

536
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,040
Oh, I don't know.

537
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,400
It might be growing on me.

538
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,960
Look at that.

539
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,440
I think she definitely wants to meet you.

540
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,280
Yeah, come.

541
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,040
You can open the hatch.

542
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Hello.

543
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,200
Maybe we should call her Joy.

544
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,120
Joy.

545
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,680
I like that.

546
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Me too.

547
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,760
Did you know the school was gonna close?

548
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,000
You all thought
you were being so smart yesterday.

549
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,480
But you've only destroyed yourselves.

550
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,080
I thought we made a pretty good case.

551
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,880
You know, I'm not much older than you,

552
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,720
but my generation knew
how to conduct themselves.

553
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,960
We knew what was important.

554
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,520
The issues we talked about
have always been there.

555
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
People just haven't felt
safe enough to raise them.

556
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,680
That's what's changing.

557
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Thank you.

558
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,320
So what you gonna do now?

559
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,360
I've been trying to get pregnant

560
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
for three years.

561
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm currently trying to start
another round of IVF.

562
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,920
Well, I hope it works out.

563
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,040
It won't.

564
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,320
It won't.

565
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,800
You have no idea what it's like
to wake up to the feeling of failure

566
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,200
every morning.

567
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,800
- I'm sorry. I'm clearly having...
- ...some kind of breakdown.

568
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,680
How are you a failure?

569
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,560
Because my... my body won't... won't...

570
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,480
It doesn't do

571
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,080
the... the one thing it's supposed to do.

572
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,120
The one thing I want it to do.

573
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,680
But you can't have everything,
I suppose.

574
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,840
And dwelling on it makes me weak.

575
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,160
I don't think you're weak.

576
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
I think

577
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,640
saying you feel disappointed by something
you want but maybe can't have

578
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
makes you honest.

579
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,840
And admitting your vulnerabilities
makes you courageous.

580
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Yeah.

581
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,760
It's very hard.

582
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,960
But thank you.

583
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,440
- Darling?
- Hey.

584
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,360
- Could you help me back to the room?
- Yeah.

585
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
Congratulations, Dr. Milburn.

586
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,920
Thank you.

587
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,040
Come on!

588
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,320
<i>For those who have just arrived,</i>

589
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,480
<i>welcome to
the Midgeville County Dog Trials.</i>

590
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,720
<i>Next up, ladies and gentlemen,
is the toy dog agility round.</i>

591
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,600
<i>First up will be Kelly Fuller
and Twinkle Twinkle, the Pomsky.</i>

592
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,800
I overheard
some of your conversation with Hope.

593
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,560
It was really beautiful
how you navigated that.

594
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,080
I know we've had fights about it, darling,

595
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,200
and I never want you
to not pursue an interest in therapy.

596
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,320
I just really want you to know

597
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,160
the weight of the responsibility.

598
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,200
I think I do.

599
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,840
I can't really explain why
I love talking to people.

600
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
It's just...

601
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,280
Like a rush?

602
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,400
Yeah.

603
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,000
A rush of connection.

604
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,120
I didn't mean what I said

605
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,000
about all your relationships being a mess.

606
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,600
I actually think you're brave.

607
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,920
I kind of thought
you were gonna die, you know?

608
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,760
I realized I still...

609
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,760
I still behave

610
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,320
like a child most of the time,

611
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,840
and I pretend to be so grown-up.

612
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,920
I still need you.

613
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,280
I can't not have a mum.

614
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,880
You're not a child.

615
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,840
You're a young man,

616
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,000
and sometimes
I find that difficult to accept.

617
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,080
And I'm sorry.

618
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,840
And thank you for being so brave.

619
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,040
You must be exhausted.
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

620
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,120
- Love you.
- Mm, I love you too.

621
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
There's someone called Maeve,

622
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,760
and she's really important to me.

623
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,920
I know I don't really understand
anything about love,

624
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,280
but I think she's my person.

625
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh, sweetheart. I don't know
if any of us understand much about love.

626
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,200
I just know we feel it when we feel it.

627
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,960
I can't wait to meet her.

628
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,320
Oh shit.

629
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
You okay?

630
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Yeah.

631
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,160
There was someone I liked a lot,

632
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,240
but it didn't work out, so...

633
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,880
That sounds shit.

634
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,520
Shall we have ice cream, talk about it?

635
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,840
I did it for a while
with Ace bandages.

636
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,040
Until I nearly broke a rib.

637
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,800
I didn't realize they tighten over time,
so they can restrict breathing severely.

638
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,680
- How are you doing, Layla?
- I'm... I'm good.

639
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,360
Wow! You're glowing.

640
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,520
Truly! Yeah.

641
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,600
All right, so that binder is designed
for safer chest compression.

642
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,600
You might be tempted to wear two binders
or wear a size smaller, but you shouldn't.

643
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,560
Okay.

644
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,640
Yeah?

645
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,800
How does it feel?

646
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,200
It feels so much better.

647
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
Yeah?

648
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,080
- Yeah.
- I'm so proud of you.

Hey. Just tried you.

00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,680
I was at the shops.

685
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,040
You going somewhere?

686
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,640
Yeah.

687
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,040
Anna asked me to move in with her.

688
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,200
- I acted like a dick, didn't I?
- Yeah.

689
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,920
You did, but, you know...

690
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,680
I'm sorry.

691
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,080
So you're finally getting
out of this place, then?

692
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,360
Congratulations.

693
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,880
I still want you in my life if you do.

694
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,000
- As friends, maybe.
- Maybe.

695
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,960
Probably.
But let's give it some time, yeah?

696
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,920
Better go.

697
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,160
I would offer to help you with your case,
but, um, you're on your own, I'm afraid.

698
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,520
That's fair enough.

699
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,160
See ya.

700
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,560
On your way, sucker.

701
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,320
Time to announce the three winners
of the toy dog agility runs.

702
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,280
This is the one.

703
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,560
In third place,

704
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,000
Kelly Fuller and Twinkle Twinkle.

705
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,040
- She was very good though.
- Yeah, she was.

706
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,360
In second place,

707
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,000
Francesca Hull and Bark Wahlberg.

708
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,600
First place goes to...

709
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Okay.

710
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,920
...Frank Larson and Howard the Jug.

711
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,440
And a special mention tonight
goes to Adam Groff and Madam

712
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,960
for one of the best debut performances
we've seen in a long time.

713
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,840
Give 'em a round of applause.

714
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,880
Hi. How'd you know I was here?

715
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,680
I didn't. It's the Eighth tonight.

716
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,240
This is where it's supposed to happen.

717
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,520
- Why are you laughing?
- I thought this was a bit random.

718
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,280
Oh, yeah.

719
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,200
Why are you here?

720
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,000
This is my mum's favorite place.

721
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,680
I'm sorry. I... I didn't realize
how much you were missing your mum.

722
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,080
I think we've both been distracted.

723
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,760
I'm sorry I said that aliens weren't real.

724
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,360
I want to try and be more open-minded.

725
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,320
It's beautiful here.

726
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,800
She really loved this view.

727
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,280
I wish I could tell her about you.
I know she'd love you.

728
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,160
- Oh, here he is.
- Hm.

729
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,440
Is that Eric?

730
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,400
Uh, no, it was a... friend.

731
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,320
Um, Eric wasn't my friend, Mum.

732
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,760
He was my

733
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,920
boyfriend.

734
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
We broke up.

735
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,600
Please don't tell Dad
I didn't win a proper prize.

736
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Okay.

737
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,920
Why?

738
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,120
He would just be disappointed.

739
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Hey.

740
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,400
Okay, what are you doing?

741
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,240
Well, you know, I wanted to finish it
before they bring the baby home.

742
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
- Aw.
- You look amazing.

743
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,120
- Thank you.
- Uncle Eric...

744
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,240
...is here.

745
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,880
I don't know if I'm dressed for DIY.

746
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,960
How'd it go with, um, Adam?

747
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
We broke up.

748
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,120
- Oh, bro.
- Yeah, it was horrible.

749
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,000
Do you wanna talk about it?

750
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,080
No.

751
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,320
- Let's finish this tree house.
- Yes!

752
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,640
How... What is this?

753
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,560
That's a hammer.

754
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,960
Five, four,

755
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,160
three,

756
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,240
two, one!

757
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,520
Maybe it'll happen next time.

758
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,920
Do you wanna stay a bit longer?

759
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,920
No, it's okay.

760
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,840
Lily, look!

761
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,800
- Maeve?
- Yeah?

762
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,160
What the hell is this?

763
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,160
My mum gave it to me
for the trip to America.

764
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,400
They booked me on a flight tomorrow,
but I'm not going.

765
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,160
Uh, why?

766
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,600
Because things are good with Otis.
I don't wanna mess it up again, so...

767
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,520
Oh my God. Maeve Wiley, come here now.

768
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
Sit down.

769
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,600
- I'm talking to you as your second mother.
- Mm-hmm.

770
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,680
If you decide to not go to America

771
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,600
and make
your disgustingly big brain even bigger,

772
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,480
I'm gonna have to end our friendship.

773
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,880
A bit harsh.

774
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,120
If I was gonna miss out on an opportunity
for a boy, what would you tell me?

775
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,240
Probably to screw your head back on.

776
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,200
Exactly.

777
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,000
Don't forget about me.

778
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,320
Impossible.

779
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
Right.

780
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,040
We better get you packed, then. Again.

781
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,520
- So no more Moordale.
- Mm.

782
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,720
What are we gonna do?

783
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,760
Well, as long as we've got each other,

784
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,360
we'll be all right.

785
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,280
Otis?

786
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,680
Come one, come on. Come on!

787
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Hey.

788
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,680
What are you doing here?

789
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,520
Mm, um...

790
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,120
Okay, um...

791
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,280
I've changed my mind.

792
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
About what?

793
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
America.

794
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,320
I found the money, so I'm going.

795
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Right.

796
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
When?

797
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
Now.

798
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,240
Wow.

799
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,480
- Yeah.
- Oh.

800
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,680
You know you don't need my help
for the clinic, right? It's your gift.

801
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,320
Yeah, and what about us?

802
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,600
We'll see where we're at when I'm back.

803
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Proud of you.

804
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,000
I mean it.

805
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,600
- America?
- Yeah.

806
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,240
So this is goodbye.

807
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
No.

808
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
No.

809
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,880
It's see you soon.

810
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,120
Okay, cool. Wish me luck.

811
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Yeah.

812
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,880
Bye, Eric.

813
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
