1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hmm.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,000
Quite specific.

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,400
Come on, Eugene. Just get to the boobs.

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Wait a minute, please! Merci.

5
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,960
What the fuck?

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,920
What the fuck?

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,880
I... I'm sorry.

8
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,640
My boyfriend referred to my vagina
as a "lady flower."

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
Dump him immediately.

10
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,520
Ah, merci.

11
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,360
We are at Beaumont-Hamel,
a preserved battlefield of the Somme.

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,080
British troops suffered
over 19,000 fatalities here

13
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,240
on their first day, making it
one of the bloodiest days

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,800
in British Army history.

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
Mr. Hendricks.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,320
Thank you, Miss Sands. Now, some rules.

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
"Rules? But you're the fun one."

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
I know, Ruby, I am,
but from now on, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,640
Okay, so Miss Sands
will now divide you into groups.

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,040
Did you hear about Ruby?

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,640
I know. Can you imagine
getting dumped by Otis Milburn?

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,320
During that time,
I want your full uniforms on.

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,320
The entire time.

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,360
I don't wanna see any loose ties.
We're representing the school today, guys.

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,560
- So that means no drama.
- Otis, these guys.

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,480
- No, miss, he can't be in our group.
- He's a twat.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,960
It's fine, miss.
It's the least I could do.

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,320
After all, I did break his heart.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,320
Oh, that would make
a lot more sense, actually.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,720
Uh, miss, will I get to hold a gun?

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,520
No. You've already asked.
You won't get to hold a bomb either.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Eric, no.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,160
- You cannot wear that.
- Why not? It's just my tracksuit.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,080
You don't want to draw attention
to yourself in Nigeria.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,160
It's dangerous for you.
It's not like here.

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,960
What do you mean for me, Mum?

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,600
You know what I mean.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,640
Go and change now.

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Come on! I want everyone packed
in the next half an hour!

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,720
I wish I was in your group.
I don't know those guys.

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,720
You'll be okay.
And it's good to make new friends.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,040
Now, off you go, you silly sausage.

43
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,360
I know this is bad, but Steve
is making me feel so arachnophobic.

44
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you mean claustrophobic?

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Arachnophobic means
you're scared of spiders.

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,640
Oh! No, I love spiders.

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,520
I love their hairy legs.

48
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,760
How many people died here, do you think?

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
A lot.

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,680
- What were they fighting over?
- That's a good question.

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,000
How's your new best pal, Hope?

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,840
- She's just checking in.
- She's just using you.

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Well, I'm using her too.
That's how you get ahead in life.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,920
- Okay. If you're cool with that.
- I am.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,720
- Lt. Marchetti!
- Oh!

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,640
Your country needs you.

57
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,880
- Hey, Viv.
- Hey, Cal.

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,440
Come to the student forum
and talk about the uniform thing.

59
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,360
- You clearly feel strongly about it.
- Oh, thank you, but no thank you.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,760
Other students would benefit
from the issue being raised.

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,520
Well, then they can raise it.

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,560
Race you to the top. Three, two, one, go!

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Ruby, can we talk?

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,080
Don't look at her. Don't speak to her.
Don't breathe.

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,480
- I'm trying to apologize.
- Stop talking. It's triggering for Ruby.

66
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,400

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,120
Jakob,
I'll wait for you in the car.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,040
Yeah, yeah, coming.

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,280
Hi, I'm Hope Haddon.
I'm here to see Dr. O'Dern.

76
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Jean Milburn.

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Yes.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm Hope.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,040
- New head teacher at Moordale.
- Yes. I know who you are.

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,200
You must be exhausted.

81
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,240
New hit book and a baby on the way.

82
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Yes, it is a bit full-on at the minute,
but I like to keep busy.

83
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,240
How are you enjoying
the transition to Moordale?

84
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,120
A lot of things needed addressing,
as I'm sure you're aware.

85
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,160
You deal with some of it in your book.

86
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh, you've read it.

87
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
I skimmed.

88
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,320
It's an interesting take,

89
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,920
but we have different perspectives
when it comes to teaching children.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes. I've seen your new SRE curriculum.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,600
It looks a lot like
you're advocating abstinence to me.

92
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,920
It isn't so much about abstinence
as it is about restraint,

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,840
which I think is an important attribute,

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,040
particularly for teenagers
who should be focusing on their education.

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Unfortunately, restraint doesn't mix
very well with raging hormones.

96
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,240
I think that's giving teenagers
less credit than they're due.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,640
Sorry. I gave you the wrong form.
This one's for the older mummies.

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,040
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Yes.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,600
If you're open
to discussing this further,

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,640
I'd be very interested
in telling you more about my perspective.

101
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,200
Okay.
I'll see if I can find some time.

102
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,440
Fantastic.

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
A bit awkward, isn't it?

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm currently with your ex-girlfriend,

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
and, you know,
you stole Rahim's boyfriend.

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,840
That's what I mean by awkward, you know?

107
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,880
I thought if I said it out loud,
it'd make it less tense, but it didn't.

108
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,280
I dated Aimee as well.
Should we check out these trenches?

109
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,920
I, uh, I didn't steal your boyfriend.

110
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,920
That's exactly what you did.

111
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
- I really liked Aimee, you know?
- Oh yeah?

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,200
She was really nice.
And a total fuck machine.

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,040
- You're a lucky guy.
- That's so inappropriate.

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
- Shrooms?
- No, thanks.

115
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
Why did you say no to Viv
about the uniform thing?

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,600
What's the point?
Not like it would change anything.

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,120
- Well, you could try. Maybe Hope might...
- Dude.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
Let's just have fun. Okay?

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
Mushrooms, anybody?

121
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
- Oh. Ooh!
- Oh.

122
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,680
What do you reckon?

123
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,200
- Okay.
- Hey, guys! I found a bunker.

124
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,080
What would you like me to bring up
at the student forum?

125
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Well, I think we should have
free pads and tampons at school.

126
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,120
Mm-hmm. See, that is a great idea.

127
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
Could you take a picture of me
with this guy?

128
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, sure.

129
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,080
Who's Eugene, and what does
he wanna do with your sweet crevice?

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
He's my boyfriend,
and, um, we've been sexting.

131
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,120
Apparently,
his fantasy is medieval maidens.

132
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,520
- Hm.
- And he calls his dick a sheath.

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,840
Yes, and my vagina a lady flower.
Gives me the ick.

134
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,840
But you like fantasy stuff.

135
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,480
I love me some Dungeons and Dragons
when it's a game, not when I'm DTF.

136
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Maybe you should try and get into it.
You might be surprised.

137
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,480
Ola didn't know about alien role-play.
Now she fucking loves it.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,880
Okay. Well, I guess I can try.

139
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,400
I'll help you.
I'm basically an erotica genius.

140
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,080
"Men slept 12 to a bunker
in four-hour shifts."

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,320
"Rats bit off chunks
of their flesh while they slept."

142
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Brutal.

143
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,120
"Meat was saved for battles."

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,440
"So that meant getting a good meal

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,480
meant you might be killed the next day."

146
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,920
It says, "During World War I,
250,000 boys under 18 were recruited."

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,640
Same age as us.

148
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,960
Crazy to think
people used to have to go to war.

149
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
Some still do. We're just lucky.

150
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,600
What are we supposed to be looking at?
It's basically a fucking junkyard.

151
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,360
Why couldn't we have gone
to the Eiffel Tower? Better for selfies.

152
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,080
I think we're supposed to imagine
what it was like here back then.

153
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,520
- Did you hear something, Olivia?
- Must have been the wind or a war ghost.

154
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,600
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah. Stop it.

155
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,840
She hates you.

156
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,080
Thank you for the support,
but I can deal with this by myself.

157
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Hm?

158
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
I do feel awful, Ruby.

159
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
I didn't want to hurt you,

160
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
and I feel worse
thinking that you hate me.

161
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't hate you, Otis.

162
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,200
It'd be so much easier if I did.

163
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
I just can't be around you
at the moment, okay?

164
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
I... I get it. I'm glad you don't hate me.

165
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,480
- All right. Come on, let's go.
- Come on!

166
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,320
Is that it?
We've only been here half an hour.

167
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,160
France is so shit.

168
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,880
What's a conscientious objector?

169
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,480
It was when men refused to go to war
because it went against their beliefs.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Wow.

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,720
I wanna stand up
for what I believe in more.

172
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,520
Like you in SRE the other day.

173
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,920
I'd never be brave enough
to do something like that.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
You could definitely do that, Aimee.

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,840
I, um, hooked up with Isaac the other day.

176
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,040
What? Get in!

177
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,040
- What was it like?
- It was good.

178
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,560
Yeah. We just get each other.

179
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Think I'm gonna give it
a proper go with him.

180
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,680
You do know Otis and Ruby broke up.

181
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,200
Yeah, I heard.

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
What about it?

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,960
- Oh, I just thought maybe...
- Maybe what?

184
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,600
Well, I...

185
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,880
- I thought you guys might...
- I said I wanna give it a go with Isaac.

186
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,840
What Otis does isn't my business anymore.

187
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Okay. Cool.

188
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm so happy for you.

189
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,400
Thanks, mate.

190
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,080
- Oh, fuck off, Anna.
- What's going on with Anna?

191
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,800
She paid for this trip without asking.
It's pissed me off.

192
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,440
She didn't pay for it. I did.

193
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,360
What do you mean?

194
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,000
You said you couldn't afford it,
so I asked my mum to pay.

195
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,440
- I knew you wouldn't take the money.
- Why did you do that?

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,280
It's no big deal. I wanted you to come.

197
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,320
You don't have to pay me back.
Money doesn't matter to me.

198
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
It does to me.

199
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
We should get on the coach.

200
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,840
"I want to remove your codpiece
and release your beautiful sheath,

201
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,160
then let you make love to me
in a glen full of bluebells

202
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,960
where you will water my hidden peach
with your prince's tongue."

203
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,440
No, I'm not gonna send that.
It's just not me.

204
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,480
Thank you though.
You keep thinking about the student forum.

205
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,640
Some people have no imaginations, I guess.

206
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,360
Lil, I wouldn't mind if we had sex
without the alien stuff sometimes.

207
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,080
I've been meaning to say something.
I didn't know how to.

208
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Why?

209
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,640
I didn't wanna make you feel weird.

210
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,760
No. Why don't you wanna do
the alien stuff? I thought you liked it.

211
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,200
I do sometimes.
Sometimes it's a little bit strange.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,776
- I'm gonna get on the bus.
- Let's go!

213
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,336
- Aw, Lil!
- Let's go!

214
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,280
We're off
to another cemetery, and I am pumped.

215
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,920
I mean, I'm moderately excited,
and I will be monitoring your behavior.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
Shit, we're running 15 minutes late!

217
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
- Are we?
- Yeah.

218
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,360
Terry, I will give you 20 euros
if you can get us back on schedule.

219
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
- Done.
- Great.

220
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,520
Come on, Quentin, for fuck's sake!
What, do you wanna marry France?

221
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,160
Jesus!

222
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Terry!

223
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,760

He can sit with Steve.

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,080
No, thanks. I'm fine.

228
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,040
They were too young to die, Maeve.

229
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,920
Some of them were our age.

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Mm-hmm.

Okay, Hope.

234
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,920
So, seeing as it's only been six weeks
since your last round of IVF treatment,

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm going to advise waiting
a little longer before trying again.

236
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,560
I'd rather not wait too long.

237
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,640
Have you thought about other options,
such as adoption?

238
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,480
I've been asked this before.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,760
I've thought about it, and I am not ready
to stop trying to have my own child yet.

240
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,200
Can I ask about how this is affecting
your relationship with your husband?

241
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,000
- Infertility treatments can cause strain...
- We're fine.

242
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,640
He couldn't make it today because of work.

243
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,040
When can I book another round?

244
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
I'm not prepared
to offer you another round yet.

245
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,840
I'll have to talk to another doctor, then.

246
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,600
You can see Dr. Ennis
when he's back from holiday next week,

247
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,920
but I think he'll tell you the same thing.

248
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,360
I want a second opinion.

249
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,080
Jean Milburn.

250
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,200
Uh, yes. I'm just waiting for my partner.

251
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
Everything looks normal.

252
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,800
You don't wanna know the sex.
Have you changed your mind?

253
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
No, thanks.

254
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I'd rather wait.

255
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,560
Many older mothers
make that choice.

256
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,280
They want to focus on
getting through the pregnancy safely.

257
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,520
Now, you are aware
there's a higher chance of miscarriage,

258
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,280
genetic abnormalities, fetal growth...

259
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,800
Yes. I've been reminded of the risks
many times. Thank you.

260
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,400
I didn't go into this lightly.

261
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,400
Yes. Modern science
is allowing women like yourself

262
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
to have babies older and older now.

263
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,120
You don't sound as if you approve.

264
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,320
Well, it's easy to forget
that being an elderly parent

265
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,960
can have a negative effect
on your children's lives.

266
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,480
Do you have children, Doctor?

267
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
- Uh, yeah, two.
- Hm.

268
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,840
And do you think having
a king-sized arsehole for a father

269
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,160
had a negative impact on their lives too?

270
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,160
I want to talk to your superior.

271
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,560
Is it true you don't wank anymore?

272
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,280
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,080
Everyone says that Eric broke your heart,
so now you can't wank anymore.

274
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,640
Please stop speaking.

275
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,280
If I don't wank every day,
my balls go blue.

276
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,040
I don't need to know that.

277
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Excuse me.

278
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
You going for a wank?

279
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,680
No, I'm not going for a wank.

280
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
I don't know why
you're taking it personally.

281
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
I'm embarrassed.

282
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,080
I've been dressing up as an alien,
and you've been thinking it's strange.

283
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,120
Not<i> strange</i> strange.

284
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,720
Just sometimes, I wanna be
in the real world when I'm having sex,

285
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,880
not a silly fantasy land.

286
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,360
Oh, so now having sex with me is silly?

287
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,280
Cal.

288
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,680
- Jackson.
- What?

289
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,080
Have you ever noticed how

290
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
we're on a trip,

291
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
but we're

292
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
on a trip?

293
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,760
- Fuck, that's so deep.
- Yeah.

294
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,880
Cal?

295
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,880
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

296
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,656
Should we go?
We should. Let's go.

297
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,720
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

298
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,560
All right, let's go.

299
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,920
You'll always be head boy, Marchetti.

300
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,800
What the fuck?

301
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,040
This door leads to another portal.

302
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A minute.

303
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,680
Wait a minute!

304
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,480
One minute, please.

305
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,400
Oh fuck!

306
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,200
No, no, no, no, no!

307
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,200
Let us in!

308
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
- Set us free!
- Wait a fucking minute!

309
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,400
Ah!

310
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Come on!

311
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
It's cool.

312
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,120
What are you doing in there?

313
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Hey.

314
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh my God!

315
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,560
Sir!

316
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,440
Terry, get a grip on her!

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,440
Is everyone okay? What the hell happened?

318
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,880
Something hit that car.

319
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,800
I think It was a bat!
I hope it's not dead.

320
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,840
A doctor should not be putting
his opinions about my pregnancy on me.

321
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,280
- It's completely inappropriate.
- <i>Oy vey.</i>

322
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,880
It's patriarchy in action, in fact.

323
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,120
Dissecting a woman's choices
in the cruelest manner.

324
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,560
- And in a hospital!
- Hey, what's happening?

325
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,920
I just had the most horrible experience
with a doctor,

326
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,400
and I am making a formal complaint.

327
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
Sorry. We are upset.

328
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,880
No, we are not upset.

329
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,800
I am upset.

330
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,720
And my anger is appropriate.

331
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,081
- Can you help us? Thank you.
- Let me call my supervisor.

332
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,320
Oh! Ha! That is fantastic.
Yes, ignore the pregnant woman,

333
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,160
and listen to the straight white man,
for fuck's sakes.

334
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Jean, calm down.

335
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,680
Don't you tell me
to calm down, Jakob. Where were you?

336
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,040
I told you,
I was trying to get us some tea.

337
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,080
Well, fuck the fucking tea.

338
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,320
I needed you in the room.

339
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,640
How can I help you?

340
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
Oh, that's fantastic. Another one.

341
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,200
I don't think that was a bat.

342
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,960
- It's a poo!
- It's human poo.

343
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,600
I think I'm gonna vomit.

344
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,720
One of your students
threw poo at my car!

345
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,040
Yes. Okay.

346
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,656
Anyone know what he's saying?
Who speaks French properly?

347
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,320
Rahim, please.

348
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Um, he says, "At least no one was hurt."

349
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,640
Yes.

350
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,240
I saw an arm throw it out of the window.

351
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,440
And he says that
we should carry on driving now.

352
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,120
It was him.
It was him! He has no sock!

353
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
It was him who threw the poo at my car!

354
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,560
He thinks he knows me.
I don't know you, sir. I'm sorry.

355
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,480
No, you wouldn't know us.
We're from Moordale, England.

356
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,360
I think someone threw it from our coach.

357
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
The toilet's blocked,
and the window's open.

358
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Oh my God!

359
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,600
Did someone throw this poo
from that coach?

360
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,840
- What if it was me?
- Huh?

361
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,000
- It's not you, Jackson.
- I poo all the time.

362
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
- Someone own up, please.
- I'm just a tube.

363
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,160
Did they put it in a sock?

364
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,320
Don't touch it.

365
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,320
It could be evidence.
Jesus Christ. Oh my God!

366
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,040
Oh good. Hope's calling me. Hope.

367
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,360
Ignore it, Colin.

368
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,560
Jesus Christ.
Do you guys think this is funny?

369
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,240
Do you?

370
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,000
Do you have any idea the kind of pressure
Miss Sands and I are under?

371
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Someone is gonna take responsibility
for this flying feces!

372
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,360
Anyone? No?

373
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,400
Okay. I didn't wanna have to do this,
but, boys, trousers up.

374
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,600
We're checking socks, mate. Trousers up!

375
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,360
Steve. Other one.

376
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Great.

377
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,440
- Milburn.
- Really?

378
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Yes!

379
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,040
Socks. Good.

380
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,800
Excellent.
Thank you. Not yours, mate.

381
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
Jackson. Good. Excellent.

382
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Come on.

383
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
- Good.
- It was my poo, sir.

384
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,320
- I panicked and...
- It's my poo.

385
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,800
- I blocked the toilet. I was embarrassed...
- I also poo sometimes.

386
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,600
Oh God, don't we all?
What is this, Spartacus?

387
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,640
Maybe it was my poo.
Maybe it's Miss Sands' poo.

388
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,216
- What?
- She's more than capable.

389
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
We don't have time for that now.

390
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,360
Adam, clean this up.
I don't care how. Okay?

391
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you, Adam Groff,

392
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,800
for owning up to doing this huge poo

393
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,240
and undermining my authority.

394
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,680
Thank you. Cheers, buddy.

395
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,680
Cheers, mate. No. No.

396
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,200
- No. Fuck him. Fuck him.
- Okay, let's all relax. Yeah?

397
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,120
If anyone needs to use the toilets,
they're over here.

398
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,640
Be back here in 15 minutes.

399
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Thank you.

400
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,000
Everyone thinks
I'm an idiot anyway. I wanna go home.

401
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,280
I thought you hated me.

402
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
No.

403
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,040
I don't hate you.

404
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,000
But I'm not touching your poo, mate. So...

405
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,680
Oh, what manner of beast!

406
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
- When I decided to be a teacher...
- Mm-hmm.

407
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,240
...I dreamt of helping students
fulfill their potential

408
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,720
by gently drawing out
their inner creative gifts.

409
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,840
Instead, I'm plunging their shit.

410
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
You are majestic.

411
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Maeve.

412
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,720
Can we talk?

413
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,080
Not right now, Aimee.

414
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,720
Why are you acting like this?
I wanted to pay.

415
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,080
You don't get it.

416
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,480
What is it that I don't get?

417
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,240
We live in completely different worlds.

418
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm not rich like you.

419
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,600
I can't decide to be a baker
just 'cause I like toast.

420
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,840
That's a fucking mean thing to say.

421
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Yeah, well, sorry, but it's true.

422
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,480
I wanted to do something nice. That's all.

423
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,120
You never accept help from anyone, ever,
'cause you're too proud.

424
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
I wanted to do a nice thing.

425
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,920
- I don't need nice things.
- Because you're above it all and strong?

426
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,720
You act like you don't give a shit
about anyone. It's to keep people out.

427
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,960
You've done it to Otis,
and you're doing it to me!

428
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,840
- I don't keep everyone out.
- You do.

429
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,760
No, I don't.

430
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,000
You're probably gonna do the same to Isaac
and end up hurting everyone.

431
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,760
You're one to talk.
Look how you treat Steve.

432
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,400
You act like he's got the plague
every time he's around you.

433
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
He's so confused

434
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,800
because you're too much
of a people pleaser to break up with him!

435
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,720
You talked about being brave.

436
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
That would be brave.

437
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,840
I'll pay you back somehow.

438
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

439
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,080
Have you replied to Eugene?

440
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,560
No. It's... it's too awkward.
I think I'm just gonna break up with him.

441
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,480
My mum always used to say,

442
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,600
"If you love someone,
it's better to bend a bit than break."

443
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,720
That's if you really like them, obviously.

444
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,280
It must be hard not having her around.
She sounds really smart.

445
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Yeah, she was.

446
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,040
It's a little bit confusing at the moment
because my dad's having a new baby,

447
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,680
and Lilly doesn't really seem
to understand why it's difficult.

448
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,280
My aunt died last year,
and I thought the sadness would pass,

449
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,480
but it never really goes away,
only gets smaller.

450
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,000
Maybe Lily's never experienced that.

451
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,880
Why don't you try telling Eugene
what you'd like him to sext you instead?

452
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
Let's go! What's that?

453
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,160
- Really?
- It might work.

454
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,680
CLOSED

455
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,360
Right. Good. Okay!

456
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,080
Now that we're all a little bit calmer,

457
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,200
should we have a sing-along? Yeah?

458
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Let's do it.

459
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
You all right?

460
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,880
Aimee and I
just had our first fight.

461
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,360
This trip is the worst.

462
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,360
Can't get much worse than a rogue poo.

463
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Where's the coach?

464
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,440
- Have you got your phone?
- No. I left all my stuff on the coach.

465
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Me too.

466
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
Okay. It just got a lot worse.

467
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,640
Jean, haven't seen you for a while.

468
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,920
Why'd you stop calling me?
Holy fucking shit! Wow!

469
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,480
That's... You're...

470
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,440
I didn't think you could...
that, like, older women could...

471
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,720
- Just say congratulations, Dan.
- Congratulations! Congratulations.

472
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
Shit. It's not mine, is it?

473
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,120
No, it's mine, actually.

474
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,800
Oh, that's great, dude.
That's great. Well done.

475
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Phew!

476
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,200
We need to go, actually. Goodbye.

477
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,840
Right, yeah.
No, I've gotta go see the doctor myself.

478
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,360
I've got a weird chafing thing
going on with my ball sack.

479
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,840
I think it's my motorbike,
but it's really...

480
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,160
You didn't need to know that. Okay.

481
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
Congratulations!

482
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,280
You used to sleep with this man?

483
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,080
He's so much younger than you.

484
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,240
I used to sleep with a lot of men.
And some of them were younger than me.

485
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,400
This makes me think.

486
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,720
What does it make you think?

487
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,680
Is the baby even mine?

488
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,480
- What?
- He seemed to think it was his.

489
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,960
- Don't be ridiculous. He...
- Well, he did.

490
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,240
I found this at home.

491
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,400
What?

492
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,520
That could be anyone's.

493
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
It's probably Remy's from years ago.

494
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

495
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,960
Because you're pregnant,
and I didn't wanna cause any stress.

496
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,720
But then I see this motorcycle man,

497
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,840
and you seem
to have contacted him quite recently.

498
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,640
And then I remember
you've been kissing your ex-husband and...

499
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,480
- Jakob!
- It just makes me think, okay?

500
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,080
Look, I have had
a lot of casual sex in my life.

501
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,880
I can't change that.
In fact, I wouldn't want to.

502
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,680
But if you don't trust me,
then this just isn't going to work.

503
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,000
I don't trust you.

504
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,160
I can't believe this is happening.

505
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,760
How about a paternity test?

506
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,840
Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Okay.

508
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,040
If that's what you want.

509
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,280
And what do we do in the meantime?

510
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
Are we still even together?

511
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
I don't know.

512
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,320
Okay, party people.

513
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,760
This is for real.

514
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,560
Who remembers this? Anyone? Here we go.

515
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,040
Ready? Whoa.

516
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,480

517
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,320

518
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,080
<i>♪ And the jam is pumping

519
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,200

524
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,760
I'm sorry I made you feel embarrassed.

525
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,280
I don't think the alien stuff is silly,
but it's not real.

526
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,280
I'd like to be a bit more grounded
and in the moment with you.

527
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,760
Aliens are definitely real.

528
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,840
There are potentially endless galaxies
and planets and universes out there,

529
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,400
and you actually think
we're the only life that exists?

530
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,200
I think it's better to focus
on the life that we have on Earth.

531
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,600
I can't believe
you don't think aliens are real.

532
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,200
I can't believe you do.

533
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,920
<i>♪ See, 'cause that's where the party's at

534
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,840
It's getting dark.

535
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,120
It's gonna be cold once it's dark.

536
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,760
I only got a B in French,
so if we find someone to help,

537
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,080
how do we know they're actually
a kind stranger and not some psychopath?

538
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,560
What are we gonna eat?

539
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm hungry all the time!

540
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
I'm panicking. Are you panicking?

541
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,960
No. We're not gonna starve to death.

542
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,320
I don't think you're taking this
seriously enough. We could die.

543
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,480
We're not gonna die.

544
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,440
Someone will drive past.
We can use their phone.

545
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,320
It's gonna be fine.

546
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,360
We should hitchhike
or just walk to a nearby town.

547
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,040
I think we should stay here.

548
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Okay, this is bad.

549
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,080
This is very bad.

550
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,280
Okay.
How... how do you say "help" in French?

551
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,600
How do I say "help"?

552
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,200
Help!

553
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,960
I am help!

554
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,040
Why are you laughing?

555
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,800
- Sorry. You're funny when you're stressed.
- Well, you're not helping.

556
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,720
I am help!

557
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,680
Something you wanna say?

558
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,680
I think poetry's dumb.

559
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Why?

560
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,400
It's just long words
that don't make any sense.

561
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,240
Maybe you're not listening.

562
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,080
I have written a poem about you.

563
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,200
"I shed blood over what?"

564
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,560
- You fell over... Right.
- "A rectangle man so unremarkable."

565
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,680
"A boring horse."

566
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,600
"Its blah-blah eyes never open,
never closed."

567
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,520
"His head shape so average."

568
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,080
That's actually quite good.

569
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,880
I think I was wrong though.

570
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,360
You're not as unremarkable as I thought.

571
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,520
Hm. Mm-hmm.

572
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,680
Even if you don't do the forum,

573
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,600
maybe you should still talk to Hope
about the changing room thing.

574
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,480
I don't like Hope,

575
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,280
but it's important to you,
so I think we should make her listen.

576
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,840
What do you think?

577
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,000
Okay, well, I think...

578
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,640
we can make things better.

579
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,320
I didn't think I cared about things,

580
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,240
but I do.

581
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,200
Hm.

582
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,280

Can you pass this to Maeve?

600
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Babe,

601
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,120
are you not attracted to me anymore?

602
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
I won't be upset.

603
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,880
Of course I'll be upset. I just need
to know if you wanna be with me.

604
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,200
Course I wanna be with you.

605
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Maeve's not here.

606
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,880
Maeve? Maeve?

607
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,920
Where's Maeve?

608
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,080
She's definitely not here.

609
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,640
Maeve Wiley's not on the coach.

610
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,720
That can't be right.
I did a head count. Maeve?

611
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,400
- Maeve? Maeve?
- Maeve! Maeve!

612
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,560
Who is Maeve?

613
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,280
Who are you?

614
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,520
I'm Albert.

615
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,360
- Oh...
- Colin Ray Hendricks.

616
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,920
Terry, turn the coach around! Maeve?

617
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,520
Why did you and Ruby break up?

618
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Um,

619
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,880
I didn't like her as much as she liked me.

620
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
It's true. I know.

621
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,600
What about you?
How's it going with that Isaac guy?

622
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,800
"That Isaac guy."

623
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,880
Yeah, things are good.

624
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
I like him.

625
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Hm.

626
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,520
I know you left me a voice mail.

627
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,600
Can we not, uh, talk about that?

628
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,920
It's embarrassing enough
you've ignored me for months.

629
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,160
Or pretend it didn't happen.

630
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,440
I never got it.

631
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,320
Isaac deleted it.

632
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,320
What do you mean, "deleted"?

633
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,400
He was trying to protect me, apparently.

634
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,600
He fucked up. It's a whole thing.

635
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,360
So you... you never heard it?

636
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Nope.

637
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,560
How long have you known?

638
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,600
I don't know. Couple weeks.

639
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,120
And you didn't say anything?

640
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,480
No.

641
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,360
You acted like a complete dick
to me last term.

642
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,840
You don't get let off the hook
'cause you call up once and say I'm sorry.

643
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,680
That's exactly how apologies work, Maeve.

644
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,520
He shouldn't have deleted it.

645
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,480
No, he shouldn't have.

646
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,280
But he did, and here we are.

647
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,320
What did it say?

648
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,720
The voice mail?

649
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Doesn't matter.

650
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,360
It was ages ago.

651
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,760
Matters to me.

652
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,360
It was something like,

653
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
"Hi, Maeve."

654
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,280
"I'm watching you on TV right now."

655
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,800
"And I wanted to let you know
how proud I am of you."

656
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,920
"And about how you saying you had feelings
for me was all I ever wanted to hear."

657
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,040
"'Cause it's always been you."

658
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
"I love you."

00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,520
We're the worst teachers.

687
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,240
- But we are good in a crisis.
- Yeah.

688
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,520
And we make the most incredible team.

689
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,840
Don't you think?

690
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,200
What are you doing?

691
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,680
Emily Swati Sands...

692
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,600
will you marry me?

693
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,920
Of course not.
We've been dating less than a year.

694
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,280
But...

695
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,760
I have been thinking
that maybe we could move in together.

696
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,680
Really?

697
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,760
Yeah.

698
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,800
But where will Michael live?

699
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,920
He's a grown man. He'll be fine.

700
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,640
Yes! Yes! Yes!

701
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,680
Save your applause.

702
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,640
We are not getting married,
but we are moving in together!

703
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
Yes!

704
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
Can we please go home?

705
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,600
Uh, miss, I'm ready for my presentation.

706
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,240
Oh, we're not doing that
till we get back to school, Kyle.

707
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,200
All right, listen up, everyone.
I've had an epiphany on this trip.

708
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,040
We're all gonna die.

709
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,600
- Kyle, sit down.
- Life is so short.

710
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,120
We might not be dead yet,
like those poor, young soldiers,

711
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,400
but one day we will be.

712
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,160
So, my point is...

713
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,040
Where'd he get that?
That's a soldier's hat. Stolen property!

714
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,200
Oh.

715
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,560
I've forgotten what my point is,
but how cool is my hat?

716
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,880
It's not cool, Kyle.

717
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,080
Oh yeah. Um...

718
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,600
My... my point is that we should try
and live in the moment

719
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,800
because we don't have long.

720
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
So,

721
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,520
if you love someone,
you should tell 'em that you love 'em.

722
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,760
Tell 'em now.

723
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,840
Because it might be too late.

724
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,600
Life is

725
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
fragile.

726
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,800
So, in the spirit of spreading the love,

727
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,560
I got a little gift for everyone.

728
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,560
These are called magic mushrooms.

729
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,480
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- So...

730
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,720
Kyle, sit down!

731
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,920
Sit down, Kyle.

732
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,080
You have to spoil it.
You were doing so well, Kyle.

733
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,280
Let's just forget that happened,
all right?

734
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,400
I know this trip
has been hard for some of you.

735
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,200
But we're only half an hour away
from the White Cliffs of Dover.

736
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,160
So, let's fix up,

737
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,880
tidy up our uniforms,

738
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,240
and get our general shit together.

739
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
Yeah?

740
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Cheers.

741
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,000

Yeah?

762
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,160
We should talk about what happened.

763
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,400
Is it okay if we don't tonight?

764
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,920
I need to sort my head out.

765
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,600
That's okay.

766
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,320

Are we okay?

769
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,920
Yeah, yeah. We're totally fine.
I'll see you on Monday.

770
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
How'd it go?

771
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,280
It was... 100% peachy. Yeah.
