What are you looking at?

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,640
Your eyebrows look bad today.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,960
Mm, do you want to

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
smooth 'em out for me?

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,320
Not particularly, no.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Well, I was thinking
maybe you could stay over tonight.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,920
Watch a movie.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Maybe, uh... you know?

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,880
No, thanks.

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,600
- I've gotta go home.
- Oh.

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,720
Ruby, are you sure everything's all right?

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,200
Why do you keep asking me that?

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,920
Well, I have noticed you're being

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
meaner to me than usual.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
- Like you're annoyed with me.
- What would I be annoyed about?

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,320
I can't give you a lift tomorrow,
so I'll just see you at school.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,640
- Okay?
- Okay.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
That's really good. Is mine good?

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Yeah, yours is really good.

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,480
Maeve, would you like to stay for dinner?

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
No, thanks.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,200
- I've gotta get up early tomorrow.
- How come?

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,760
I have to finish this application
for an overseas study thing,

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,520
and I need to use a school computer, so...

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
Well, why don't you use mine?

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
No, it's okay.

54
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,080
Honestly, it's fine.
Then you can stay for dinner too.

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,800
Okay.

56
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,680
Thanks, Anna.
I'll see you and Elsie on Saturday.

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Weren't you going on a school trip?

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,280
- Do you need help paying for it?
- No, thanks. I don't need charity.

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Mum?

60
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,040
Mum, I can see you.
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,400
So, what, you're besties
with her now, are you?

62
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,400
No, I'm not besties with her.
I'm just visiting Elsie.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
- What are you doing here?
- Just going for a quick evening run.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
It's not illegal, is it?

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,000
You only wear hats
when you're doing something dodgy.

66
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Fine.

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,160
I walk past the house sometimes
to know she's safe.

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,280
Elsie's safe here.
You don't need to worry about that.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,920
That woman's got
a "dance like nobody's watching" poster.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,640
She's clearly a sociopath.

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,560
Do you think Elsie misses me?

72
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Course she does.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,280
You're her mum.

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,120
She just wants you to get better
so you can be together all the time.

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,640
Come on.

76
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,800
So what's happening with this Isaac?
I like him.

77
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,640
It's none of your business.
Stop being so nosy.

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,920
<i>Pardonnez-moi!</i>

79
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,440
So, how has it been living together again?

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
It's been good.

81
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,800
No problems.

82
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,560
Yes, it's been good.

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,080
We've been, uh,
settling into the new family situation.

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,760
I think it's a big adjustment
for our kids.

85
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
How... how are they feeling about things?

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,240
Well, Otis,
who's my son, has a girlfriend,

87
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,680
and so he's very much been asserting
his independence from me,

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,680
and I don't see him very much anymore,

89
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,400
which is a little painful,

90
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,080
but I'm trying to respect his boundaries.

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,160
And...

92
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,200
And Ola,

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,320
who's Jakob's daughter,

94
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,720
I think she might be feeling uneasy
around me and

95
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
the new family setup.

96
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,320
What is the situation
with Ola's own mother?

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Oh, she's dead.

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,040
She... she passed away
a few years ago from cancer.

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,360
And is this loss something you can both

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
talk about openly?

101
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Yes.

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,120
I think we've talked about it, haven't we?

103
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,080
Yeah, well, I... I don't like
to dwell on the past too much, but yeah.

104
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,360
Well, that went well?

105
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,400
Uh, yeah. Well,
then we don't have to do it again, or...

106
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,200
You do know that therapy isn't
a one-session process, right?

107
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,240
That some people go for years.

108
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,720
Yeah, I'm sure Dr. Cutton would love
to have our money for years.

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,360
Wait. What are you saying?

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Are you saying that therapy's just
a cynical money-making practice?

111
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm not sure I believe in it.

112
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
You don't believe in therapy?

113
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,160
Come on.

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm not saying
you're not very good at your job,

115
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,800
but I'm not sure
that talking can fix everyone.

116
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,920
What? Did I make you upset?

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are entitled to your opinion.

118
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,800
Oh. Thank you.

119
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,120
My God.

123
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Oh, uh, what's your favorite food?

124
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
Food. Uh, lasagna?

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
No, pizza. And fish and chips.

126
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,561
I like peanut butter on toast,
but not too toasted and without crusts.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
That's incredibly unhelpful.

128
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,520
Let's just get takeaway, then.

129
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,440
Got much planned
for today, compadre?

130
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,680
Um...

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
No. Not really.

132
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
What about you?

133
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,760
Oh, I'll be spending the day
pretending I like teaching.

134
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
It's good to be busy.

135
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,080
Oh, is that the time?
I better skiddle-skaddle-doo.

136
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,200
Hey, listen. Why don't you,
me, and Emily have dinner tonight?

137
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,360
You can pick up the ingredients today.
How do you feel about Mexican?

138
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
I don't cook.

139
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
It comes in a packet, dude.
We'll cook it. You just gotta eat it.

140
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,280
Okay? We're on.

141
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,640
We're on like Donkey Kong.

142
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,040
Cool.

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Cheers!

144
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
How come Ruby didn't drive you in today?

145
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,480
I wanted to ride in with my best friend.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,520
Hmm? You've had a fight, haven't you?

147
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,120
No. No, not had a fight exactly.

148
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
What did you do?

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
Okay. Um, all right.

150
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
So a few days ago, Ruby said,
"I love you," and I didn't say it back.

151
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh my God!

152
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
Well, what did you say?

153
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I said,

154
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
"That's nice."

155
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Is that bad?

156
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Very bad.

157
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
Very, very bad.

158
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
- You said, "That's nice"?
- Yeah.

159
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
Yeah. Well, I couldn't lie, Eric.

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
And it's not like I don't really like her.

161
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,560
I do, but love is a big word,

162
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,160
and I don't think
I've felt that way about anyone.

163
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Except Maeve.

164
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes, but that is over.

165
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,960
I... I don't even know if I believe in love.

166
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,200
It's all just...
it's all just a chemical reaction.

167
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,520
Otis,
you're the most romantic person I know.

168
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,760
Maybe you just don't feel that way
about Ruby yet, which is fine,

169
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,680
but you have to tell her the what?

170
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
- The truth.
- The truth.

171
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
Because the longer you leave it,
the more hurt she'll be. Yeah?

172
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,720
- Yeah.
- Come on!

174
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,280
I... I was thinking that maybe if I got a B

175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,160
on the test this afternoon,

176
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,080
that I might be able to move up a set.

177
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,720
Fingers crossed, Adam.

178
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,280
Okay. Um, all right. Come over.

179
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,400
Uh, remember what I said
about how sentences need full stops?

180
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
Show me here where they would go.

182
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,280
- What's happened to your face?
- What's happened to your face?

183
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,400
- Nothing.
- Nothing's happened to my face either.

184
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,760
Something's happened to your face, mate.

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,840
- Anwar, your face is hideous.
- I know. I look like a crazy fucking mofo.

186
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,360
- Well, should you go to hospital?
- No, I think it's just stress hives.

187
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,160
- What are you stressed about?
- It's hard being me. Okay?

188
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
Ruby!

189
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Want me to carry your bag to SRE for you?
Maybe we can have a little chat.

190
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,280
- You back in the game?
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
Ooh la la. Ooh la la. Ooh la la.

192
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,760
Are you sure that she said she loves you?

193
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,800
'Cause it seems more like she hates you.

194
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
Attention, everyone.

195
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm sure you've read today's news article
with Dr. Jean Milburn.

196
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,240
"After spending a length of time
on the Moordale campus,

197
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,120
I realized there is a battle happening

198
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,520
for the emotional
and sexual health of our teenagers."

199
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't know about you,

200
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,560
but I am sick of hearing our school's name
being dragged through the mud,

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,760
which is why I'm implementing a plan
to put a stop to that.

202
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,160
It starts with a new syllabus for SRE,

203
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,760
which will now be called
Growth and Development.

204
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,320
And to put our parents'
and investors' minds at ease,

205
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,280
I want you all to follow
these new guidelines precisely.

206
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,760
That means no one will diverge
from the set topics,

207
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,920
and no one will talk to students
about their private lives.

208
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,880
The students usually have
quite a lot of personal questions.

209
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,560
School is not a place
for personal questions.

210
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,320
Jobs were lost over inappropriate events
that happened on this campus,

211
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,160
and I want you all to be protected
from that happening again.

212
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Understand?

213
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm off to pregnancy yoga.

214
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
What are you doing?

215
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm building a tree house.

216
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,520
Okay. Why?

217
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
It will be fun for our baby to play in.

218
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,400
I made one for my daughters
when they were kids, and they loved it.

219
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
It's okay?

220
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Sure.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
Viv, wait up!

222
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,280
- So you're talking to me again?
- I was never not talking to you.

223
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,880
I was wondering
whether <i>we</i> could talk to Hope

224
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,560
about setting up something where people
could talk about what they need on campus.

225
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,640
- What kind of thing?
- A forum or something.

226
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,000
People could talk about
mental health or gender identity.

227
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,040
This is how far you'll go to get a girl.

228
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
- What?
- Person.

229
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,760
Do you even care about this,
or are you trying to get into Cal's pants?

230
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Uh, okay.

231
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,200
Look, you were right.

232
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,840
I didn't take head boy seriously, okay?
I didn't care.

233
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,840
But I wanna be better.

234
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay, um, I'll think about it.

235
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
All right.

236
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,440
I just read your story.

237
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,680
It's amazing.

238
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,360
I can't believe Glenoxi had sex
with Starlanza after she ate her mother.

239
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,040
She's very complicated.

240
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,400
Do you think I've got a chance at winning?

241
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,960
Do you think <i>The Moordale Gazette</i>'s
the right place for it?

242
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,560
I already applied.

243
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,920
Oh. Okay.

244
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,640
It might not be
to everyone's taste, you know?

245
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
I think I've got a pretty good shot.

246
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,880
I told you, you have to have
the perfect timing of the mushroom.

247
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,880
- How are you getting the perfect timing?
- When you see the blue shell...

248
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,880
Wow, Lily,

249
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,720
you look normal.

250
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,360
Your hair looks nice, Lily.

251
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,280
Yeah, you're almost pretty.

252
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
What happened to your face?

253
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,481
I was giving you a compliment.
Doesn't mean we're friends.

254
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,960
Did my hair really look that weird before?

255
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
No.

256
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,040
I thought it looked really cute.

257
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,280
Listen up, everyone.

258
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
If you haven't paid for the school trip,
please see Hope today.

259
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,560
Mmm.

260
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,760
I cannot wait to eat baguettes with you!

261
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,960
- What?
- I'm being French.

262
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,920
Oh, okay.

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,440
Um, yeah, I'm not gonna go
on the school trip.

264
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,240
- Why?
- 'Cause it's too expensive.

265
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,640
It's not that much, is it?

266
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,880
It is expensive. My mum freaked out
when she saw how much it was.

267
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,720
- Really?
- Yeah.

268
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,880
For today's SRE class,

269
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,840
boys will be in this classroom
and girls in this one.

270
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Can we please form
two orderly lines, please?

271
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,200
Uh, where do I go?

272
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,960
Yeah, I don't know.

273
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
So Cal wants to know
what line they should join.

274
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,840
Boys in this classroom
and girls in this one.

275
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
But I'm non-binary.

276
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,120
- I... I don't know which line either.
- Um, wait here. I will ask for you.

277
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,880
What seems to be the problem?
Other than your uniform again.

278
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,160
We don't fit into the description
of boy or girl,

279
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
so where are we supposed to go?

280
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,680
You can both go in the girls' line.

281
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
But I'm not a girl.

282
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,600
They'll be discussing female anatomy,
which I'm sure will be helpful for you.

283
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,880
So we go to the vagina or penis line.
Is that what you're saying?

284
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,480
It's okay. I... I don't wanna cause trouble.
I'll go with the girls.

285
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,600
Thank you. That's very helpful.

286
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
Is there anything else, Cal?

287
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,920
Mm-hmm. This is complete bullshit.

288
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,200
Be careful, Jackson.

289
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,800
Wouldn't want
to see you going down the wrong path.

290
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,600
Okay, guys.

291
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,520
No questions, okay? No questions.

292
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,720
<i>You again! No!</i>

293
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,720
<i>Oh, hello there.</i>

294
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,720
<i>We all know what it's like to get
unwanted and unnecessary erections,</i>

295
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,360
<i>whether it's during your sleep,</i>

296
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,640
<i>at a disco, or kissing the girl
you've got a crush on for the first time.</i>

297
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,040
Sleep for me.

298
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,160
<i>How do you deal with the danger</i>

299
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,560
<i>of unexpected emissions</i>

300
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,560
<i>until you're ready
for procreating with your wife?</i>

301
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm here to tell you
about how a night of sex ruined my life.

302
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,760
Did me and my boyfriend use a condom?

303
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,200
Yes.

304
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
Did it split?

305
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Yes.

306
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,640
Did my boyfriend tell me?

307
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
No.

308
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,240
<i>Homosexual activities have
a much higher rate</i>

309
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,920
<i>of leading
to sexually transmitted diseases</i>

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,720
<i>such as herpes,</i>

311
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
<i>syphilis,</i>

312
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,200
<i>HIV,</i>

313
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,880
<i>and AIDS.</i>

314
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,800
Um, sir, this video is not talking
about safe sex at all.

315
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
It's just shaming gay people.

316
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,520
What do flying penises
have to do with STIs?

317
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Remember, we're not asking questions.
We're just watching the video, so...

318
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,080
- Why can't we ask questions?
- That's another question.

319
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,640
They're making valid points
about this video, which isn't informative.

320
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,040
It's just preaching abstinence
and homophobia,

321
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,920
which is dangerous,
and we're a bit old for flying penises.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,400
- Stop saying "penis" to me.
- You can't put this on and expect us...

323
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,760
Please, you're disrupting the class.
Get out.

324
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,280
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously. Go.

325
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,480
He can't say "penis" in sex ed, sir?

326
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm sorry, okay?

327
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,080
But I could lose my job
if I let you all ask me questions.

328
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Just watch it, please.

329
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,760
I believe teenagers shouldn't have sex
because sex will ruin your life.

330
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,920
Forever.

331
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,360
I went from having dreams
to having a six-month-old baby

332
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,800
that left me with a leaky bladder
and a baggy vagina.

333
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,680
Sorry, is the boys' class being taught
about pregnancy as well,

334
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,960
or is it just us girls?

335
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,480
It's just us, is it?

336
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,000
- Very progressive.
- Quiet, Maeve.

337
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,120
After getting pregnant,
I had no choice but to leave school.

338
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
There are always choices.

339
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,600
- Women do not have to have children.
- Enough!

340
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,696
We shouldn't be shamed
for having sexual desires.

341
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
You make sex sound terrifying,
but it doesn't have to be.

342
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,920
It can be fun and

343
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,200
beautiful and teach you things
about yourself and your body.

344
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,040
You should be telling us
how to do that safely.

345
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,360
Not telling us to refrain
because it doesn't fucking work.

346
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
Okay. Out, now.

347
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Happily.

348
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,960
Right.

349
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,720
Now we're going to watch
a video of me giving birth,

350
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,080
where you'll see that I tore
from my vagina to my arsehole.

351
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,400
Oh, your poor vagina!

352
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,080
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

353
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,080
Yeah, but my opinions on abstinence
weren't appreciated, so I got kicked out.

354
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
Yeah, me too.

355
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,241
We need to tell Hope she can't be
teaching this stuff. It's backwards.

356
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,760
- She's not gonna listen.
- We need to do something.

357
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
Like what?

358
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,040
I dunno.
Maybe we could help people like before.

359
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,520
You mean take their money?

360
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
That wasn't the only thing
the clinic was about.

361
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,760
What else was it about?

362
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,880
Anyway, I'm not getting involved anymore.

363
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,720
It's not my problem.

364
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,080
It's not your problem?

365
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,640
Why? Because you're too cool?
You don't need to care anymore?

366
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
You didn't wanna do the clinic either.

367
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,680
Yeah, you're right.
And now I remember why.

368
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm going to the library.

369
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,600
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

370
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,960
- Hey!
- Hey.

371
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,360
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Huh?

372
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,120
Uh, do you wanna talk about it?

373
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,120
Nope.

374
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Let's get baked.

375
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Okay.

376
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,600
Sometimes me and Malek
don't use a condom. He pulls out.

377
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,960
I thought that if something went wrong,
I would just get the morning-after pill.

378
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,720
- That's okay, right? Yeah, that's okay.
- No, that's not okay!

379
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,760
We've just watched a woman push
something the size of a watermelon

380
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
out of her vagina.

381
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,120
Nothing's okay.

382
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,440
My rash could be syphilis, herpes, or HIV.

383
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,840
I think I'm gonna die.

384
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Anwar!

385
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,560
Okay, we must never have sex again.

386
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,920
- Agreed.
- Understood.

387
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,360
Um, I could get in trouble for this,
but realistically, you'll have sex again.

388
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,280
What I just witnessed
would make Helen Brook roll in her grave.

389
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,120
So, for the love of God,

390
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,240
please talk about contraception
to a sexual health professional.

391
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,600
There's a sexual health clinic
on Mayfield Road. Mayfield Road.

392
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Oh. Yeah, thanks. Bye.

393
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,720
- Where the fuck is Mayfield Road?
- Who the fuck is Helen Brook?

394
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,840
I think she was an advocate
for reproductive rights.

395
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Ruby, please can we talk?

396
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,200
Not now, Otis!

397
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,200
I've got to go
and protect myself from your penis!

398
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
- There's a time and a place.
- Yeah.

399
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,360
Okay, ladies.

400
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,680
Let's move onto our sides,

401
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,360
using a bolster to support
your beautiful, blooming bellies.

402
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,200
Let's breathe in...

403
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,520
and out.

404
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,200
Taking a moment

405
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,280
for ourselves.

406
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,280
Breathe in

407
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,240
and out.

408
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,880
Oh.

409
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
You okay?

410
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,840
Jakob is building a tree house.

411
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Pardon?

412
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,600
Oh.

413
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,240
He's building a tree house for the baby,

414
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,680
which is really lovely, right?

415
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,760
Yeah, that's lovely.

416
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,040
Then why
am I feeling like I can't breathe?

417
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,440
You're just feeling panicky.

418
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,800
It's okay. It's normal.

419
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,440
I thought this was the right thing to do...

420
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,720
...for me, for the baby.

421
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,040
I didn't want to raise
another child alone,

422
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,240
and now
I'm feeling like I'm losing control.

423
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
And...

424
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,160
...I think I've made a really bad decision.

425
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,960
What makes you think that?

426
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,720
Well, we have nothing in common, Maureen.

427
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,680
Nothing.

428
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
I mean,

429
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,960
I feel like
I'm having a baby with a stranger.

430
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,560
You know, Michael and I used to have
a lot in common.

431
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Wanted the same things in life.

432
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,880
Nice house, babies, a dog.

433
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,680
But in the end, we had all those things...

434
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,200
but no connection.

435
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,280
Jakob adores you.

436
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,040
I know these changes are scary,

437
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,800
but I think that counts for a lot.

438
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,520
Thank you.

439
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,080
I needed that.

440
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,040
Shall we go back inside?

441
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,040
Do we have to?

442
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,440
Stinks of farts in there.

443
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,360
At least they're not my farts.

Sentences need full stops.

455
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Oi!

456
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Shut up!

457
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm trying to concentrate.

458
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,680
Here are your books, Rahim.

459
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,560
And the, um...

460
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,680
and the poems you wrote me.

461
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,080
Why did you keep them?

462
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't know.

463
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,120
Just... No one's
ever written me poetry before<i>.</i>

464
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,160
I wanted to remember it.

465
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,440
- Adam doesn't write you poetry?
- Sorry?

466
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,600
Sorry. No, it's just, um...

467
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,880
No, Adam does not write me poetry.

468
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,080
Well, that's sad.

469
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,280
Poetry is magic.

470
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
Abracadabra.

471
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Heard you were talking about magic.

472
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,840
No, we were talking about poetry.

473
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,000
- Yeah.
- Right.

474
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
Eric doesn't like poetry. That's why
he's giving you your books back.

475
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
I never said I didn't like poetry.

476
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,360
The poet Ariana Brown said
about our various selves

477
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,200
that they are
"all names you wear in harmony."

478
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,520
"Until you can't."

479
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,000
Was he taking the piss?

480
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,280
I don't know.

481
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,960
Why did you say I didn't like poetry?

482
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, I didn't think that you did.

483
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
- Why do you care what he thinks?
- I don't.

484
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,320
- Why are you getting upset about it?
- I... We're arguing again!

485
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,160
I think it will be good for us
to get some space when I'm in Nigeria.

486
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,120
- You wanna get away from me?
- Adam, you are so defensive!

487
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,640
No, no, no. You just said
that you wanna get away from me.

488
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
How am I supposed to feel?

489
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,120
- I don't have the energy to fight.
- Fine. Don't, then.

490
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,280
- Hello, Hope.
- Hi.

491
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,160
I wanted to talk about what happened
with the girls' and boys' lines.

492
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,320
Okay.

493
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,080
I think it made
some students feel really uncomfortable.

494
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,320
Well, I'm not sure
school is supposed to be comfortable.

495
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
I think it's supposed to be hard.

496
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,960
And challenging.

497
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,200
I agree 100%.

498
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,440
But I wonder if students
might have space to be challenged

499
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,840
if they felt we were listening
to their concerns.

500
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,360
Okay. What do you suggest?

501
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,680
I was thinking of setting up
a student forum to hear direct feedback

502
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,200
from students about what they wanna see
implemented on campus.

503
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,360
This shows great initiative, Vivienne.

504
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,480
I'll be interested
to see what you discover.

505
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,960
In the meantime,

506
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,080
I'd like you to keep an eye
on your peers during the trip.

507
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,640
- So can I have your number, please?
- Yeah.

508
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I'll text you.

509
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,800
Okay.

510
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,760
Great.

511
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay.

512
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,160
Ah, Maeve.

513
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,760
Have you calmed down

514
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,680
since your little outburst
in Growth and Development?

515
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,960
Well, what was being taught is bollocks.

516
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,840
That spirited energy would be
better channeled into your education,

517
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,160
especially if we're going
to find the funding for the GTIP.

518
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,880
Sorry for saying bollocks<i>.</i>

519
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,120
You wanted to see me
about the trip? I can't go.

520
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
Your fees have been paid.

521
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,400
By who?

522
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,320
It was an anonymous payment.

523
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Okay.

524
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,600
I'm serious about the hair.

525
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,280
Change it immediately.

526
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,080
Oh, Michael.

527
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,720
How are you?

528
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,640
- I didn't think you liked Mexican food.
- I don't.

529
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,200
Not that I've tried it.

530
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,040
I'm just shopping for dinner.
My friend is cooking...

531
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,800
"fa-jee-tas."

532
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
Um...

533
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,920
It's pronounced "fajitas."

534
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,080
Oh.

535
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,520
I think you might like them.

536
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,240
How are you coping with everything?

537
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Good.

538
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,080
I'm very, very

539
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,160
excellent.

540
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,960
How's Adam?

541
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,480
Why don't you ask him yourself?

542
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
I haven't heard from him, so...

543
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,640
I think he'd appreciate it
if you reached out to him.

544
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,000
You're his father.

545
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,080
It's not too late to fix things, you know?

546
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,440
The pull-out method can lead
to unwanted pregnancy

547
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,040
if your partner doesn't pull out in time
or sperm gets into your vagina.

548
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,160
It also puts you at greater risk
of getting or transmitting an STI.

549
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,040
Is your boyfriend putting pressure on you
not use a condom?

550
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,680
He says it makes it feel better for him.

551
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,280
How does it feel for you?

552
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,200
Like I can't enjoy the sex
'cause I'm scared of getting pregnant.

553
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,600
Well, that's no good for anyone, is it?

554
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,080
Now, tell me.

555
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,560
Do you engage in unprotected sex?

556
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,560
Every film I've seen with a gay person
ends with them having sex

557
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,360
and dying of AIDS.

558
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,160
I don't wanna die.
So, yeah, I always use a condom.

559
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,000
So long as you and your partner,
or partners, are practicing safer sex,

560
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,760
getting tested regularly,
you're very unlikely to contract HIV.

561
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,600
There's a medication now called PrEP
that protects people from contracting HIV

562
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,320
if they are engaging
in frequent casual sex

563
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
in situations
that might be putting them at high risk.

564
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,720
And for those that do contract the virus,
there's medicines now

565
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,960
that enable them to live
a long and healthy life,

566
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,480
even get to the stage
where the virus is undetectable,

567
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,240
which means
it can't be passed on to somebody else.

568
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,800
So, I don't think
you're gonna be dying for a while yet.

569
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,640
Now have you changed your diet recently
or used any new detergents?

570
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,560
No.

571
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,480
What about new condoms or lube?

572
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,240
Well, apparently, I'm allergic
to strawberry-flavored condoms.

573
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
Mm-hmm. And my boyfriend's a dickhead.

574
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,320
You gonna dump him?

575
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
No. I still love him, annoyingly.

576
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,320
Um, does he love you?

577
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Yeah. Of course he does.

578
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,200
Ruby Matthews. You can come in now.

579
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,720
Otis doesn't love me.

580
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,920
What do you mean?

581
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,800
I told him that I loved him,
and he didn't say it back.

582
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,480
What did he say?

583
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,960
He said, "That's nice."

584
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,160
- What a dickhead.
- Everyone loves you.

585
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
I know. That's why I'm so confused.

586
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,920
I think I'm in the wrong place.

587
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,320
I couldn't decide
which of your favorite meals to make,

588
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,640
so I made them all.

589
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,640
Well, Joe did, but, um...

590
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,680
I'm really trying here.

591
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,480
I can see that.

592
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,720
These chips are cold.

593
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,960
Well, you were late.

594
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,800
Yeah, well, I was cutting my hair.
New school rules.

595
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,600
- Looks nice.
- Thanks.

596
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,520
I think Anna paid for my France trip
without telling me.

597
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,440
- So you're going?
- I don't need charity from anyone.

598
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,520
Maeve, don't be proud.
Just go on the trip.

599
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,440
Don't tell me what to do.

600
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,680
So you're still angry at me, then?

601
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,240
That would be a lot easier...

602
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Than liking me?

603
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,680
Yeah, than liking you.

604
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
But you also fucked up.

605
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Why did you do it?

606
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,360
I was threatened.

607
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,200
You just get me.

608
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,520
Like, we've both been through
so much of the same shit.

609
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,480
You understand me like nobody else does.

610
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,120
I didn't wanna give that up.

611
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,280
Well, I feel the same.

612
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm truly, truly sorry.

613
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Can...

614
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Nothing.

615
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,920
You wanna know what I can feel?

616
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,080
Yeah.

617
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,760
Well, I can't feel anything

618
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,240
below my level of injury.

619
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Um...

620
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,120
If you put your hand on my chest,
I'll show you.

621
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,800
- Okay.
- I'll tell you when.

622
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
There you are.

623
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
I can get hard.

624
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,040
I just need a little help.

625
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,880
Not that we're gonna do that yet.

626
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
So...

627
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,640
would you be able to come or...

628
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,760
Yeah.

629
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,600
Sort of, um...

630
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,120
When I get touched
in the places that I can feel...

631
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,240
it can get a little intense.

632
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,320
So...

633
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Here?

634
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Yeah.

635
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,800
Please may I take your T-shirt off?

636
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,360
There you go. Just like magic.

637
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
Well, I feel somewhat exposed.

638
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,160
Now we're equal.

639
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,800
Well, where do you like to be touched?

640
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,600
Above the waist.

641
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,600
<i>I'm quite into my ears being touched.</i>

642
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,960
Please may I touch your ears?

643
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Yeah.

644
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,040
That would be the other lasagna.

645
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Um...

646
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Thanks for inviting me over.

647
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,680
I've been wanting to talk

648
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,400
because I know

649
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
why you're angry with me.

650
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,480
And I wanted to say
I've been having an amazing time with you,

651
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,880
and I do really like you.

652
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,640
Mm, you like me?

653
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Yeah.

654
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
I like you a lot.

655
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,760
But you don't love me.

656
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,640
I just have to say that in my own time.

657
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,560
And I don't feel that way right now.

658
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,200
That's not to say I won't.

659
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,480
I just don't at the moment.

660
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,240
I've never said that to anyone.

661
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
I'm sorry.

662
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,720
We haven't been dating for that long<i>,</i>

663
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,320
and I don't know
if you actually<i> lov</i> e <i>me </i>love me.

664
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,160
I introduced you to my dad.

665
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,240
I've never introduced anyone
to him before.

666
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,520
Well, we could still keep hanging out
like we are.

667
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,520
You need to go.

668
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,400
Do you mean go just now or go for good?

669
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
For good.

670
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,880
One sec.

671
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,080
- Can't I just pull out?
- Do you wanna have a baby with me?

672
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,720
No.

673
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,960
I mean, not until I've gone to uni
and I've got a job.

674
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,560
Mm, yeah. Well, put a condom on, then.

675
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,520
Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.

676
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,800
Mm-mmm.

677
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
Oh! This is incredible!

678
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,360
Mm. The balance of flavors
and the hint of fire.

679
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,920
It's so different!

680
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,920
- How was your day, Michael?
- Bumped into Maureen.

681
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,240
Mm.

682
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,560
And she asked me how I was,
and we spoke about Adam briefly.

683
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,840
Mm. And then, just as she was leaving,

684
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,480
she said something about
it never being too late to fix things,

685
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,080
and then she touched my arm.

686
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,000
That's major! She wants you back!

687
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,000
Colin, that's not our business.

688
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,000
Unless that's something you want?

689
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,560
Mm.

690
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,200
Well, you have to let her know
before it's too late.

691
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,960
Make a gesture.
Oh, send her a fruit basket.

692
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,560
- She's not in hospital, Colin.
- Helium balloon.

693
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,976
- Or five years old.
- Hot air balloon.

694
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,080
Way too much.

695
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,960
I think
she would appreciate something personal.

696
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,320
Something meaningful to your relationship.

697
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,520
Women like to feel like
they've been heard.

698
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Mm.

699
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,480
Ah, bleh, bleh.

700
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Hello, darling.

701
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,080
- Hey.
- Nice day?

702
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,240
It was okay.

703
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,560
They're teaching us abstinence
in school now.

704
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,920
What?

705
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,800
- What's Jakob doing?
- Building a tree house.

706
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,720
It's looking good, Jakob.

707
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Yeah.

708
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,200
Do you need some help?

709
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,320
Yeah, come here.

710
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,440
If you hold this one like that.

711
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,680
You take this one.

712
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
- Okay.
- And I hold here.

713
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
- You okay?
- Yeah.

714
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,800
Yeah?

715
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,520
I just hurt someone really badly,
and I kinda feel like shit.

716
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,240
Did you do it on purpose?

717
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
No.

718
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,880
Ruby wanted me to say I loved her.

719
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,200
But I didn't feel the same.

720
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,600
You did the right thing.

721
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,520
I don't know.

722
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,120
She was really upset.

723
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Well,

724
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,680
people deserve your whole heart, Otis.

725
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,800
If you can't give them that,

726
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,960
it's better they know.

727
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,280
It's the kinder thing to do.

728
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,560
Come on.

729
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,400
These are for you.

730
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,600
Oh.

731
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,200
Thank you. Why?

732
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,040
Well, you said
it's not too late to fix things,

733
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,160
and I know we broke up
because I didn't want mangoes...

734
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,040
I meant fix things between you and Adam.

735
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,480
But, Michael, we didn't break up
because you didn't want mangoes.

736
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Then why did we?

737
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,080
- Maureen! Everything okay?
- Um...

738
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Who's that?

739
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
It's, uh...

740
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
Um...

741
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,200
I'm seeing someone new.

742
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,080
Right. Good.

743
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,400
Sorry. Uh...

744
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,120
Well, congratulations.

745
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,840
Thank you.

746
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,480

Adam! You know
you can ring the doorbell now. We go out!

773
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,800
Yeah, but I can't stay, I can't stay,
so can you come down?

774
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,800
Okay. Come to the front door.

775
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,720
Hey. I... I'm sorry I lost my temper. I...

776
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,120
I know.

777
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,360
I know. It's just, I...

778
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,280
I just wish you wouldn't get jealous.

779
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,280
I chose you.

780
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
I, uh...

781
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,000
I don't want us to have space...

782
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,400
'cause I love you.

783
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,040
I love you too.

784
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,320
Hi there. What's... Ooh.

785
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
Okay.

786
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,120
Glad to see
you took my advice seriously, Maeve.

787
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,760
Something tells me
you don't take advice from anyone, Cal.

788
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,800
- Your uniform's still shabby.
- I don't understand why it's a problem.

789
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,600
Perhaps you can attend
Vivienne's student forum next week

790
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,280
and raise your concerns there.

791
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
Do keep me updated on the trip, please.

792
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,200
Vivienne's forum?

793
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,320
- You didn't tell her it was my idea?
- Didn't come up.

794
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,280
Miss, how... how did I do on the test?

795
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,800
You got a D.

796
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,720
You'll have to stay in the same set.
Please don't be disheartened. Keep trying.

797
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,480
What's the point?
I'm not good at anything.

798
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,280
Everyone's good at something, Adam.

799
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,720
Maybe start by thinking about
the things you like doing.

800
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,280
I'm... I'm quite good at pretending
I'm Gandalf in <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

801
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,280
But that's a start.

802
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,640
Excuse me, sir.

803
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,560
Hi.

804
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,960
- Hey.
- All right.

805
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,160
Over to you two, then.

806
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,880
I'm trusting you
to maintain some discipline.

807
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,160
- Okay?
- Okay.

808
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,320
- Okay.
- You betcha.

809
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,240
Okay! Let's go to France, motherfuckers!

810
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,440
Sorry, sorry.

811
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,680
France!

812
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,880
Yo!
