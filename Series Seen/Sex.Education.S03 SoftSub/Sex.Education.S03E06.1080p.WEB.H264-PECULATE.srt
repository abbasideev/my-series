1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,200
"And then Lord Vanon said,

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,120
'Candita, I will love you
until my dying day. Marry me!'"

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,640
"But Candita didn't wanna be owned
by some rich, alien dude."

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,240
"So she said,
'I don't love you, Lord Vanon,

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,560
but I do want to have sex with you.'"

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,280
"Lord Vanon agreed
to have sex with Candita

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,200
and showed her
his penis hands for the first time."

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,120
"She was repulsed, but she liked it."

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
What's with the cape, Lily?

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,520
It's my nebula protector, obviously.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Lily wrote another story.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,480
Sarah, why don't you go
and chat with the other girls?

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,080
I'm going to have to confiscate this.
And I need to speak to your parents.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,040
Lily Pad,

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,640
Miss Talbot called. She was really upset.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,000
She said you'd written a story.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,160
Something about

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,800
hands looking like...

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Penises?

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,480
She asked if everything was all right
at home. It was embarrassing.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,040
The thing is,

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,840
nice girls
don't really talk about all that

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,160
S-E-X stuff.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,120
You know,
it's... it's just not really appropriate.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,560
I like writing stories.

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,600
Well, maybe keep 'em to yourself.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,080
<i>♪ Pressure on people, people on streets</i>...<i> ♪</i>

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
<i>♪ Pressure ♪</i>

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,080

00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,760

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,120
Are you fucking kidding me?

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Fuck!

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
Mum?

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Yeah?

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,440
Aimee's here for her appointment.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh shit. I completely forgot.

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,120
- All right, I'll be right down.
- Okay.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,200
So this one has a longer labia,
which is really common.

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,760
This one's all tucked in.

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,640
With pubes, without pubes.

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
This one's more frilly.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
This one's crooked, like mine,

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,960
and this one,
as you can see, is on its period.

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,520
- I'll go for the one with pubes.
- Great choice!

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,920
- Thank you.
- Sorry, Aimee.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,480
I'm a bit disorganized this morning.

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,480
- Morning!
- Morning.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
- Vulva cupcake?
- Ah.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Yeah.

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
Thanks.

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,680
They must have had a fight.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,960
Wow.

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,080
Look at all those tits.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,480
Yeah, I'm reorganizing
my vintage men's magazine collection.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,960
Those are my favorites.

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,200
Oh, they're lovely.

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,040
Anyway, how you doing today, Aimee?

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Well,

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,480
I had a big fight
with my best friend, Maeve,

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
and I'm feeling really sad about it.

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,480
But also like I wanna
punch her in the face.

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,720
Why don't we talk about it?

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,200
You seem quiet.

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm just a bit tired.

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
What is it?

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,240
I just got into
the Gifted & Talented program.

69
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,160
I can't believe it!

70
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,560
I can.

71
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,480
I knew you'd get it.

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,080
- Hey, that's amazing!
- Thank you.

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,040
Try to enjoy it.

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,480
Otherwise, I will have to tell a joke.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Please don't.

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,720
- Knock, knock...
- No. Okay, I'm going to school.

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
I'll see you later.

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,360
Ay, ay, ay, ay, Mummy,

79
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
this is for you.

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,400
My friends will be jealous of these gifts.

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,760
Abeo is so generous.

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,160
Me, I'm always boasting
about my son-in-law.

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,800
The successful accountant in England.

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,040
What is she on about?
Dad's not an accountant.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
I don't know.

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,720
I'll get you some more.

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,480
Ah-ah. Don't worry, Mummy. I will get it.

88
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,760
No, now it's not often
I get to wait on my grandson.

89
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,680
Oh!

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,720
- Hey!
- Hey, my sister!

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,720
Bebe. Emeka.

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,640
Hm.

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,120
- He's going to be at the wedding.
- I haven't seen him for years.

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,800
- His business is doing so well!
- Who's Emeka?

95
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,280
- I don't know who he is.
- And he's still single, you know.

96
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,880
Stop gossiping, Beryl!

97
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,640
- Who's Emeka?
- No one!

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,840
Eh? You were engaged!

99
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,800
- Engaged?
- Okay, girls.

100
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,080
Time to start getting ready
for the wedding!

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,120
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey! Go!

102
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,160
- Grandma!
- Yes.

103
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,040
She said
I was being unfair to Steve

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,840
because I'm too much
of a people pleaser to break up with him.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,640
And how did that make you feel?

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Like an idiot.

107
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,440
Because she's probably right.

108
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,240
She didn't have to say it
in such a mean way.

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Why do you think she's right?

110
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,240
'Cause it's true.

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,480
I hate fights.
I hate making people feel bad.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,440
So I just lie and tell them
what they wanna hear,

113
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,720
which is why
I probably won't break up with Steve,

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,800
and why I had such awful friends
for so many years.

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,280
And why I smiled at that gross,
stupid man on the bus

116
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,240
and made him think
he could rub his stupid dick on me.

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,800
Do you feel

118
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,320
that if you hadn't smiled at him,

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,840
he wouldn't have assaulted you?

120
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,880
I don't know.

121
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,720
Had you smiled at strangers before?

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,680
Had that led to them assaulting you?

123
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
Listen to me, Aimee.

124
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,920
What that man did to you on the bus

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,800
has nothing to do with your smile

126
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,160
or your personality

127
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,520
and is only about him.

128
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,280
And it is absolutely not your fault.

129
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you understand?

130
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Okay.

131
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
How do I get stronger?

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,440
Like you.

133
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,080
Like Maeve.

134
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,600
Oh, I bet you're stronger
than you think you are.

135
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,240
The fact that you can say you feel angry
because of the fight with Maeve,

136
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,720
that's a positive step towards
feeling your full spectrum of emotions.

137
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
But also,

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,280
it's not anybody's place

139
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,280
to tell you that you should or shouldn't
break up with your boyfriend.

140
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,280
Yeah, I guess so.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,720
I mean, I did tell her to get over herself
and be with Otis,

142
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,520
but I think I have a point.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,240
They're clearly in love.

144
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,280
Yes, he's been a bit of an arsehole,
but he's apologized a lot.

145
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,520
And she isn't the easiest person
to get to know, so it's kinda like...

146
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,240
I probably shouldn't have talked
about Otis, should I?

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,480
How was he an arsehole?

148
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
Oh.

149
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,200
Well, see you next time, Aimee.

150
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,360
Thank you.

151
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,840
- Oh, Aimee, can I grab a lift?
- Yeah!

152
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,520
- Who's that from?
- Just Eric.

- I like your moves.
- Thank you.

158
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Here.

159
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,320
Let me fix your Aso-Oke.

160
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Okay.

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,600
Wow! What is this called, Mum?

162
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
- "The Senator."
- Uh-huh!

163
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,680
- Do you like it?
- Yes! It is camp as hell!

164
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,280
Your grandma might hear.

165
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Um,

166
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
who's this Emeka guy?

167
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
It was a long time ago.

168
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,240
We were silly teenagers.

169
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
Mmm!

170
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,920
Okay. And why did you not get married?

171
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
I met your father.

172
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,600
- Okay, you met my father in the war...
- You look lovely.

173
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,520
Thanks!

174
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Thanks, Mummy!

175
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,800
If I could add some gold eye shadow,
I'd look even better.

176
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm serious, Eric. Not here.

177
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,200
I'll see you outside.

178
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,200
Rubbish.

179
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,400
"Lord Vanon unsheathed
his throbbing cock-rod,

180
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,160
plowing Princess Zandora all night long."

181
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,400
The musical was weird,
but she's actually into banging aliens!

182
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,520
Hey, Lil, can we please talk?

183
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
What's going on?

184
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,640
They published my story.

185
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,520
Oh my God.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,680
Hope, um,
I was wondering if I could talk to you

187
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,840
about getting
a gender-neutral changing room on campus?

188
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I think it would really help
the trans and queer students here.

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,240
Cal, we can talk about whatever you like

190
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,320
once you come to school
wearing the correct uniform.

191
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,800
How exactly would you define "correct"?

192
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,240
Layla, could you come here, please?

193
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,080
Layla is a perfect example
of how you can express your identity

194
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,080
and still abide by school rules.

195
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,040
So Layla's a good NB,
and I'm a bad one. Is that right?

196
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,840
I don't understand your slang.

197
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,800
N-B.

198
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,080
Like, nonbinary person.

199
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Layla, you can step back. Thank you.

200
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,520
I think it's interesting
how you like to split us up.

201
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Layla and me, Jackson and Viv.

202
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,600
Is there too much power
in multiple otherness for you?

203
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,120
Like I said, come to me
when you're sticking to protocol.

204
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Can you believe Adam Groff threw poo
out of the coach window?

205
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,360
I always knew he was deranged.

206
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,760
Oh my God, Mark!

207
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,640
You scared me.

208
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,080
Why are we in the paper again?

209
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,880
And why have I been
fielding complaints from parents

210
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,800
telling me their children
went on a school trip

211
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,680
which involved missing students
and human feces?

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
- I'll look into it.
- Hm.

213
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,920
I told our investors
and the rest of the school board

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,080
that you were going to turn
the narrative around.

215
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes.

216
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,240
And our upcoming open day
will nip this in the bud.

217
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,400
We'll be announcing
the rebrand to the press...

218
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,000
A rebrand isn't enough.

219
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,680
You need to show them
that this place has changed.

220
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,720
If we don't get the next round of money,
we are screwed. Do you understand?

221
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,640
Yes. I will not let you down.

222
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,680
Good. I've got a meeting to get to.

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,880
Of course.

224
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,440
Of course you do.

225
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Thank you.

226
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Thank you so much
for that encouraging pep talk.

227
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,680
So supportive.

228
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,960
- Gentle. Fucking fucklord...
- Hi, Hope.

229
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,960
- Hi.
- Sorry, I can come back...

230
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,320
No, absolutely not.
Um, how can I help you?

231
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,040
Um, okay, so I got onto the GTIP.

232
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,560
- Oh. Well done.
- Um...

233
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,880
So I was wondering if you'd managed
to get that funding we talked about.

234
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,320
- I spoke to the school board.
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,320
And unfortunately,
things are a bit tight at the moment.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,360
And so, they said no.

237
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Yeah.

238
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm so sorry, Maeve.

239
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,200
No, it's fine.

240
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,640
Hopefully, your family can find the money.

241
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,240
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,480
Okay.

243
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,080
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

244
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,320
Free vulva cupcake?

245
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,760
Ew, they're so ugly.

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,120
I thought so, too, at first,
but every vulva is unique and beautiful

247
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,000
and deserves to be cherished.

248
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Cherish it.

249
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,240
Mm, this is so good.

250
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
Why don't you just speak to her?

251
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,600
'Cause I'm still pissed off.

252
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
- Hey<i>.</i>
- Hi.

253
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,480
- How are you?
- Good.

254
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,360
I just got into
the Gifted & Talented Program.

255
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,160
That's amazing! Oh, congrats, Maeve.

256
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,120
Thanks. Don't think I have
the money to go, but, you know...

257
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
So,

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,280
I can tell you are ignoring my texts,

259
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,680
which, under the circumstances,
is quite a point of vulnerability.

260
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,960
Yeah. I'm sorry.

261
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Mm...

262
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,880
It's just... I just wasn't expecting
what happened between us to happen.

263
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,560
- Yeah.
- And, um...

264
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,760
I like Isaac.

265
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,400
You know, I think we have something good.

266
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,000
So, uh...

267
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,160
What, we should just forget about it?

268
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,040
I think so.

269
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,200
<i>All students
to the assembly hall, please.</i>

270
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
I've asked you all here

271
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,920
to announce
a new direction for your school.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,080
A fresh start.

273
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,040
Moordale Secondary
will soon be known as Sparkside Academy.

274
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm sure
you will have many questions,

275
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,840
but our goals for Sparkside
will be made clear

276
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,280
at our upcoming open day.

277
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,720
We will also be inviting the press

278
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,920
to show them
that "Sex School" is a thing of the past.

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,520
And speaking of press,

280
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm sure you're all aware

281
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,080
that our school
once again made the news today.

282
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,240
Take me now, Lord Vanon!

283
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,920
Yes, it was very funny, wasn't it?

284
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,120
However, the part where they called us
an "institution full of sexual deviants"

285
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,240
was not very funny at all.

286
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,560
It seems that there are some students here

287
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,080
who get a kick
out of giving us a bad name.

288
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
And it has to stop.

289
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,680
So, Lily Iglehart, Cal Bowman,

290
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,800
and Adam Groff, come to the stage, please.

291
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,840
Take a seat, please.

292
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,280
From now on, punishment will be
dealt with differently on this campus.

293
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,920
Will you read that out, please, Cal?

294
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,120
"I am a slovenly troublemaker..."

295
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,800
A little louder, please.

296
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,480
"I am a slovenly troublemaker
who doesn't care about my peers!"

297
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,080
- This is fucked up!
- Sit down, Jackson.

298
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,840
Put the sign on, Cal.

299
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,480
I don't think my story was dirty.

300
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Then why is everyone laughing at you?

301
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,160
Read it.

302
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
"I wrote

303
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,040
dirty and disgusting words
which have brought shame on my peers."

304
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,000
Um, I can't read that word.

305
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,960
It says that you are unhygienic.

306
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,200
Because what you did in France
was filthy and put your peers at risk...

307
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,160
Enough!

308
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Sit down.

309
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,440
It's supposed to be school,
not somewhere we should be afraid.

310
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
Okay, you're suspended.

311
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,640
- What?
- Leave.

312
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
What?

313
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,680
I said, leave!

314
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,280
"I am unhygienic
and put my peers at risk."

315
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,040
You will not be allowed your phones
for the remainder of the week.

316
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,400
No one is to speak to these students.

317
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,360
And you will not be allowed
to remove your sign until I say so.

318
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,680
You better shut your cake stall down.

319
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,120
Okay. Back to class.

320
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
Hey.

321
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,800
- Hello, what's going on?
<i>- The police are here.</i>

322
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,600
<i>- They're looking for Elsie...</i>
- Slow down, Isaac. What?

323
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,480
Your mum took Elsie for a walk
at her visitation. She didn't come back.

324
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,400
<i>- They think she's kidnapped her.</i>
- What?

325
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,840
<i>They're heading to Anna's now.</i>

326
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,960
They wanna talk to you.

327
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,120
Um, okay, I'll meet them there.

328
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
You okay?

329
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,400
No.

330
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,800
Um, I need to go to Anna's.
There's an emergency.

331
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,160
- Do you wanna borrow my bike?
- No.

332
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
- It's quicker!
- I can't ride a bike, Otis.

333
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,160
- What do you mean you can't...
- No one ever fucking taught me! Okay?

334
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Fuck!

335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,160
When will you get married, Eric?

336
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
He's 17, Mummy!

337
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,440
I got married at 18. Young people
are getting married very old now.

338
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,680
It's foolish! Why wait?

339
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,720
Listen, Eric,
don't get married until you have to.

340
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,840
Have fun while you can.

341
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Ow! Hey!

342
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,280
Atinuke, I told you
you are not in this photo.

343
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,560
- Uh-uh.
- What if you and Jimoh break up?

344
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,160
Out!

345
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,920
- Have you got a girlfriend, Eric?
- He hasn't...

346
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,560
Eric doesn't have time for girlfriends.

347
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,920
He's too busy focusing on his school work.

348
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,280
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

349
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't wait too long.

350
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,400
I'll pray every day

351
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,360
that you meet a good Christian woman
and have a big wedding in Nigeria...

352
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,280
Yes!

353
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,200
...before I die.

354
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,320
Okay.
Everybody, bunch together!

355
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,720
Okay, on three, and then smile.

356
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,200
One, two, three, smile!

357
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,880
Hey, you.

358
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,520
You. Why are you not smiling?
You're ruining my picture.

359
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,440
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

360
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,760
- Sorry!
- Okay. One, two, three, smile.

361
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Just here.

362
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

363
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
- I wanted to make sure you're okay.
- Thank you.

364
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,080
You all right, Maeve?

365
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,200
- What's he doing here?
- She needed a lift.

366
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
That's convenient.

367
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,680
Well, I'd better go inside and help,

368
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,440
but thank you for dropping Maeve off.

369
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,160
You know, I'm gonna come help too.

370
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,120
Can you
tell me about this morning?

371
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
She seemed okay.

372
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,840
- Her appeal for custody failed last month.
- There you go.

373
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,920
She'd never been happy
about the supervised visits. Thank you.

374
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,040
She didn't seem distracted?

375
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
Yes, did she seem on edge at all?

376
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,320
How about I ask the questions, boys? Hm?

377
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,000
So, how did Erin seem this morning?

378
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,240
She wanted to take Elsie
to the playground.

379
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,800
I had never imagined...

380
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,480
Will my mum be in any trouble?

381
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,960
This is serious. She could face
prison time when we find her.

382
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,720
It's gonna be all right.

383
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,400
She used a cashpoint
on Barrow Street at 10:17 a.m.,

384
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,760
but that doesn't give us any indication
as to her whereabouts now.

385
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,000
She's probably left Moordale.
Have you checked CCTV at the station?

386
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,960
Yeah, we have.

387
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,600
- And what about buses?
- We thought about buses too.

388
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,000
And you can tap her phone.

389
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
Sorry, how are you both connected
to the case again?

390
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm Maeve's friend.
He is her complicated love interest.

391
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,160
You used to be her friend
until you were an arsehole at that party.

392
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,560
The only arsehole is the man who deleted
my voice mail without telling her!

393
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,120
Outside, both of you.

394
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,720
- Outside. Yep.
- Okay.

395
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,080
Always popping up
where people don't want you.

396
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,040
- Just go home, man!
- You... you don't know me.

397
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,400
- Always making things worse.
- What are you even doing...

398
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,680
Shut up! The pair of you!
My sister is missing.

399
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,176
This is not an opportunity for you
to swing your dicks around!

400
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,481
Dunno how you can even think
of choosing this guy over me.

401
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,600
Choosing? What are you talking about?
You're so deluded!

402
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Oh right.

403
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,240
Did something happen
between you guys on the trip, then?

404
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,760
But it doesn't mean anything.

406
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,760
I mean... I do... I don't know what it means.

407
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,280
Elsie's missing.
That's all I care about right now.

408
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,800
Well, good luck finding her, Maeve. Um...

409
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,520
Isaac, don't go.

410
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh fuck.

411
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,960
- Thanks, Otis.
- I think I should stay and help.

412
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,200
No, I don't think you should.

413
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,400
- You'd make things worse!
- What do you mean?

414
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,440
Since you stopped the clinic, you stopped
caring about anyone but yourself.

415
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,000
No, that's not true.

416
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,880
It... it's just not my responsibility.

417
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,440
I think you should go.

418
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,360
I don't wanna see you anymore.

419
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,480
Maeve.

420
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Jakob!

421
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,760
Jakob!

422
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,920
I think we need to work out
what we're going to tell the kids

423
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,200
about why we're sleeping in separate beds.

424
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't think they need to know.
It's private between you and me.

425
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,400
Well, I disagree.

426
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
Open dialogue is important with teenagers.

427
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,520
Okay, you go ahead and tell them.

428
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,480
I was just dropping off your book.

429
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,600
Would you like to come in for a chat?

430
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,280
Have a seat.

431
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
So,

432
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,360
why did you decide to return my notebook?

433
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,680
I thought you should have it.

434
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,080
So I assume it was also you
who made the photocopies last term.

435
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Yes, it was.

436
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,040
And I'm ashamed of my behavior.

437
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Um...

438
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,200
I keep reading the things
Maureen said about me to you.

439
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,360
And I think they're all true.

440
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,000
But I don't know how to change.

441
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,880
Come and voice your opinion
at the Student Forum tonight. Thank you.

442
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,880
Viv, listen, I've had an idea.

443
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,680
Let's use the forum to ask people
how they feel about Hope's new values.

444
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,800
If enough people don't like
what she's doing, we can change things.

445
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,680
- I can't do that.
- I don't get it.

446
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,880
Why are you trying to help her?
She's bad news, Viv!

447
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,320
Jackson, I'm not an idiot, okay?
I need to get into a good university.

448
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,120
It's not just my dream.
It's important to my whole family.

449
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,280
And I do not have the privilege
to fuck up school.

450
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,120
Viv, I know you're not an idiot.
You're the smartest person I know.

451
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,040
You're kidding yourself
if you think she cares about your dreams.

452
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,840
<i>Vivienne Odusanya
to Hope's office, please.</i>

453
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
Think about it.

454
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
I asked you to keep an eye on your peers
during this trip.

455
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,040
And then I hear rumors,
and I'm left feeling confused

456
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,920
because when I asked you
how the trip was going, you said,

457
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
"Great!"

458
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,320
So help me out here, Viv.

459
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,560
I didn't wanna get anyone into trouble. I...

460
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,720
- I felt in the middle.
- Right.

461
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,280
When I first met you,

462
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
I thought,

463
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,160
"This girl's going somewhere."

464
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,840
You know, "She's driven. She's focused."

465
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,280
But I don't know
how far you're going to go

466
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,120
if you can't
keep your head above the parapet.

467
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,320
I'm sorry. I... I should have been honest.

468
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,280
Don't apologize to me.

469
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,320
Apologize to yourself.

470
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,760
I would hate
to see you lose out on opportunities

471
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,440
because of a need to play nice.

472
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,160
It's a very female trait,
and it holds us back.

473
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,760
It will not happen again.

474
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
It better not.

475
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,520
Oh, one more thing, Vivienne.

476
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,640
I want you to make
a presentation to the press

477
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,440
and prospective students
on our upcoming open day.

478
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,640
Even after this?

479
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,240
Yes. You're our head girl.

480
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,160
And having a strong, smart,
young woman of color leading the way

481
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,440
shows how progressive we are as a school.

482
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,280
So it's about how it looks.

483
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,720
Of course it is.

484
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,480
Here's the video
and the slides for you to prepare with.

485
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,480
Uh, will you be
coming to the Student Forum?

486
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,280
Perhaps there'll be some interesting ideas
I can add to the presentation?

487
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,320
Why would I want to come and listen
to a bunch of teenagers whinging on

488
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,640
about their insignificant problems
for an hour? No, thank you.

489
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,560
I've had quite enough
of this navel-gazing,

490
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,800
identity-obsessed hysteria for one day.

491
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,760
The quicker you and your fragile,
petty little peers realize

492
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,320
that you're not that special

493
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,240
and that the real world doesn't care
about your supposed issues, the better.

494
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,320
I'd like to ask you
about your childhood, Michael.

495
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,680
Can you tell me about your mother?

496
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,640
She was quiet.

497
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
And gentle.

498
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,560
And she loved to cook.

499
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,760
And she always smelled rather lovely...

500
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,800
of shampoo.

501
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,240
And your father?

502
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,400
Dad. Well, he...

503
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,400
he was just different from my mum.

504
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,160
- Terrible, Dad, terrible.
- You're supposed to stop it.

505
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,120
I think Michaela's crying, Dad!

506
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,480
What?

507
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,200
Why are you crying?

508
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,440
Stop it! You're a boy!

509
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,000
Boys don't cry.

510
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Hm.

511
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
When was the last time you cried?

512
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,880
Can't remember.

513
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,360
Not even after your separation?

514
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,680
And what do you do
that brings you pleasure?

515
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,400
Are you suggesting I...

516
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
masturbate?

517
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
No.

518
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,640
Believe it or not, Michael, I don't think
everything comes back to sex.

519
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,640
What I'm asking is,

520
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,400
what do you do that makes you feel joy?

521
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't think I feel that emotion.

522
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,080
Very often, Michael,
when children are bullied by a parent,

523
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,000
they falsely learn
that emotions are a sign of vulnerability,

524
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,640
and so they shut them off.

525
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,160
What I'd like you to do

526
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,080
is to find something

527
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,480
that makes you happy.

528
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,040
Um, thank you.

529
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,960
And I'm sorry I said that thing about...

530
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
masturbation.

531
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,520
That's really okay.

532
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,400
However, in your case, Michael,

533
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,600
masturbation might not be such a bad idea.

534
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
You okay?

535
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
What happened?

536
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,480
Oh, well,
I just messed everything up. Again.

537
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,920
'Cause I am clearly incapable

538
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,280
of forming healthy relationships
with anyone.

539
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,640
Is this about Maeve?

540
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,200
I've never told you about Maeve.

541
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,000
Aimee mentioned,
just briefly, in her session with me

542
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,600
that you'd had a romantic tension
with someone called Maeve,

543
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,840
and something happened
at the party that you had here,

544
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,760
and you fell out over something you said.

545
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,280
Do you want to talk about it?

546
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,880
No, I don't want to talk about it.

547
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,920
Jealousy can make us act out of character
and say things we don't mean.

548
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,720
- Was there another boy on the scene?
- You're doing it!

549
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Again!

550
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,640
I can't believe you had the audacity
to tell me to stop giving out advice

551
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,640
because I was being unethical.

552
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,040
You are the most unethical woman
in the world!

553
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,720
- Why won't you let me help you, Otis?
- Help me?

554
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,440
How could you possibly help me?

555
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,160
You push every man
you come into contact with away.

556
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,560
- You literally suck at relationships.
- Where is this coming from, Otis?

557
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,080
You brought Jakob into my life.
You make me live with Ola like a sister.

558
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,800
And I like having them around.
It feels normal, for once.

559
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
But that's over,

560
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,160
isn't it?

561
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,440
Yeah, that's what I thought.

562
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Shit.

563
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

564
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,840
This is my fault.
I should've told you what my mum is like.

565
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,000
Maeve, this is not your fault.

566
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,880
You're 17. You shouldn't have
to deal with stuff like this anyway.

567
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,160
It's too much.

568
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,120
Will you stay tonight?

569
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,640
- Eric, what do you think of the wedding?
- Auntie Beryl!

570
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,040
It's good!
It's good, you know. I think?

571
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,000
- I don't know. I've not been to many.
- Ah. You will go to more.

572
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,080
Hmm. Ah!

573
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,520
See Emeka?

574
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,640
Mummy was heartbroken
when Beatrice didn't marry him.

575
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,440
- Why?
- Hm.

576
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,720
His family is good.

577
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,720
Very wealthy!

578
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,120
Ah! He would have
given your mother the world.

579
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,000
Uh, and what about my dad?

580
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,400
- Your father?
- Uh-huh.

581
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,520
He was a very local guy! So bush!

582
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,080
Hm. You see?

583
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,640
Mummy didn't even think
he had any prospects.

584
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,040
Wow, wow.

585
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,240
But he's proven us all wrong.

586
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,640
And he has made a name
for himself in England.

587
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Mm.

588
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Ah!

589
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,560
They barely gave me any stew!

590
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,720
Auntie.

591
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,520
Auntie!

592
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Hey.

593
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,760
I'm so sorry she did this to you.

594
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,120
I was happy not having any friends.

595
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,920
And then you came along and made me feel
like I wasn't so strange after all,

596
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,360
but it was just a lie.

597
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
You told me not to submit my story
because you said it was weird,

598
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,160
and then you judged me.

599
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,080
I was only trying to protect you.

600
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,600
You shouldn't be speaking to me.

601
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,320
Jackson?

602
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,880
- Hey. Um...
- Hey.

603
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,840
Thanks for sticking up for me.
What Hope did was complete bullshit.

604
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,960
- I know.
- And I think we should fight this.

605
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,480
All right. Let's do it.

606
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,080
<i>I've had quite enough
of this navel-gazing,</i>

607
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,600
<i>identity-obsessed hysteria for one day.</i>

608
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,800
<i>The quicker you and your fragile,
petty little peers realize</i>

609
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,400
<i>that you're not that special...</i>

610
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,760
<i>- ...navel-gazing...
- ...doesn't care about your supposed issues...</i>

611
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,560
<i>I've had quite enough
of this navel-gazing,</i>

612
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,560
<i>identity-obsessed hysteria for one day.</i>

613
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,240
<i>...hysteria for one day.</i>

614
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,400
<i>The quicker you and your fragile,
petty little peers realize...</i>

615
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,520
Weddings are weird, right?

616
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,040
Can you imagine dancing
to a whole room of people looking at you?

617
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,640
I think I'd like it.

618
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,640
My name's Oba.

619
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,200
Uh, I'm Eric.

620
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
You must go to a lot of these, then?

621
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,160
Oh. No, not really.

622
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
The groom is my close friend.

623
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,520
Ah.

624
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,560
I've always taken photographs as a hobby,
and he's a bit cheap.

625
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,840
It's funny.
I feel happy for them, but also a bit sad.

626
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,760
Because I know
I'll never have this for myself.

627
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,520
Do you know what I mean?

628
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Ah...

629
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
I thought

630
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,080
we weren't supposed
to talk about that here.

631
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,520
There are lots of people like us here.
We just have to speak quietly.

632
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm going out after this
if you want to meet them.

633
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,880
Uh, no, no. I, uh,

634
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,120
I don't think I can.

635
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Okay.

636
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
Hm.

637
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,120
What are you doing here?

638
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
I feel bad

639
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,600
that you got suspended for me.

640
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,840
I got suspended for my beliefs.

641
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
I, uh...

642
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,720
I'm trying to write a poem for Eric,
and I thought you could help me.

643
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,640
You want me to help you write
a poem for my ex-boyfriend?

644
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Forget it.

645
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,160
Let me see the poem.

646
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,920
- "Eric, you make me smile..."
- Do you have to read it out loud?

647
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,840
This is a bad poem.

648
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,720
You need to write from your heart.

649
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,520
Not overthink.

650
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,720
You shouldn't try
to write poetry because I write it.

651
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm not. I'm... I'm...

652
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,520
I'm writing it because Eric likes it.

653
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,760
What about you? What do you like?

654
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,800
I... I, um, I like...

655
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
dogs.

656
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,040
I'm a cat person.

657
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,560
Unbelievable, man.

674
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,200
Are you sure
you don't want to see the rest of Lagos?

675
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,840
I'm sure, Oba.

676
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,480
Oya!

677
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,880
Take me to my people, then.

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,880
Mm-mm-mm-mm!

682
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,840
- Where are you taking me, then?
- You'll see.

683
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,400
Somewhere sexy? Somewhere fun?

684
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,440
Somewhere a little bit sweat?

685
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,600
Yeah, man. Here now.

686
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,080
Yeah, okay. Thank you. I'll be right back.

687
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,680
You... What?

688
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,720
Where are you running off to?

689
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,480
So I... I just don't know you that well,
and I think I should probably go.

690
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,120
What? We just got here.

691
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,240
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

692
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,560
No, sorry, where did you go before?

693
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,520
I was checking escape routes.

694
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,080
- Escape...
- I've got you.

695
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
It's okay.

696
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,880
You're going to love it. I promise.

697
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
All right, love.

698
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,560
What's all of this rubbish
with this small club boys, eh?

699
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,040
- Omo England! Welcome!
- Oh.

700
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,560
Hi!

701
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,720
- Oh my gosh! You look incredible!
- Mm, mm, mm.

702
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,160
Bow bow! Ah!

703
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,640
Hey!

704
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,560
- Hey, sister. How are you?
- Hey, how you doing?

705
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,280
Hi! How are you guys?

706
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,200
Okay.

707
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,440
Thank you!

708
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,920
Don't worry. You are getting there.

709
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,240
- You're not ready. You're not ready!
- I don't actually even know.

710
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,680
- You're gonna dance up in here!
- Ooh la la.

711
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,840
Oh my gosh.

712
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,920
How do you feel?

713
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,520
Like I've come home.

714
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,800
Oba?

715
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,000
Hm?

716
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,040
Oba, wake up.

717
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,280
Oba, wake up. I... I need to go home.

718
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,920
My family will be worried.

719
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Okay.

720
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,320
It was nice to meet you.

721
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,840
What do you mean, nice to meet me?
How am I supposed to get home?

722
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,920
We're in Lagos!

723
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,880
I'm kidding.

724
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,240
I'll make sure you get home okay.

725
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
Fine.

726
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
Um...

727
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,120
Did we...

728
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,240
No.

729
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Cool.

730
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,360
Where were you? I was worried!

731
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,480
I was out with Oba.

732
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,240
- He showed me some of Lagos.
- Why didn't you tell me?

733
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,720
Well, you were too busy flirting
with your ex-fiancé.

734
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,560
- Eric, that's...
- No, Mum.

735
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,760
I was so excited
to come back here, you know?

736
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,440
And all we've done since arriving is lie.

737
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,600
Why'd you tell everyone
Dad is a successful accountant?

738
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,720
Your dad is an accountant.
At least, he was when he lived here.

739
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,480
No... no, but he's not back home.

740
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,400
So...
...why don't you tell the truth?

741
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,800
- Are you ashamed of him?
- Not at all!

742
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,400
But my mother didn't always approve
of your father. It's been easier to lie!

743
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,240
Do you wish you married
that Emeka guy instead of Dad?

744
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,960
No! That man is so vain!

745
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,480
We were never the right fit.
Not like your father.

746
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,120
What do you mean?

747
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,600
Being with your dad,
I always felt at peace.

748
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,240
I don't want to pretend, Mum.

749
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,600
Not here or anywhere.

750
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,920
I love that you're not afraid
to be yourself, Eric.

751
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,640
Maybe one day I'll get there too, hm?

752
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,800
But it takes time.

753
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,320
I'm sorry for scaring you, Mum.

754
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,880
I'll make you something to eat, hm?

755
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,720
Thank Abeo for my beautiful presents.

756
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,360
- Tell him he must visit next time!
- I will tell him.

757
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,280
- Oh, Eric!
- Mm.

758
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,360
You let me know
when you get yourself a girlfriend.

759
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,920
- Actually, Mummy, Eric is dating someone.
- Mm-hmm.

760
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,760
I told him not to tell you
until he knew it was serious.

761
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,400
Huh. Ah!

762
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,400
What is she like?

763
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,040
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

764
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,280
They don't talk much,

765
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,680
but they really love dogs.

766
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,760
- Mm-hmm.
- And, uh, they can be very kind.

767
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,680
Mm-hmm.

768
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,960
And they make me laugh.

769
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,640
A lot.

770
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,080
And I think you'd really like them.

771
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,640
Laughter does wonders for the heart.
They sound like a good choice.

772
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,440
