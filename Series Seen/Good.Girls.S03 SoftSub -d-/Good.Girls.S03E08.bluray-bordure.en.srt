00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,965
You better give me that money, bitch.

Hey!
(SCREAMS)

4
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:12,803
Am I gonna make it?
Here we go. This is it.
It's go time.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,722
You saved her leg.
I did?

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,098
And how much of my cut is from Cartier?

7
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,266
All of it.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,559
What?

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,645
How'd you get insurance to cover it?

10
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:23,356
I tried to seduce my therapist.
He straight up rejected me.

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,107
I want to get better.

12
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,526
Friday at 8:30.

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,861
I couldn't make as much.
Why is that?

14
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,279
BETH:
The price of ink went up.

15
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,449
You stole from a man
who blew a little girl's
brains out for fun?

16
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,575
BETH: 10% off the top.

17
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,660
RUBY: What if he finds out?

18
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:36,744
BETH: He won't.

20
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,756

22
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,014

Going down a hard road

24
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,187
Just don't know

25
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,731
Don't know where I've been

26
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,857
Mmm.

Can I get you anything else?

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,947
I think we're probably good.

What didn't I order?

30
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,451
Oh, let's see.

Chef's got an ambrosia salad.

32
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,123
Bingo.

33
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,211
Mmm.

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,010
I'm really sorry, Leslie.

35
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,970
Mmm, yeah, thanks.

Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,691
Some people at the store were happy,

41
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,319
but they don't know you like I do.

42
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:53,571
Who?

00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,239

Hmm.
Frozen foods?

00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,161
Mmm-hmm.

46
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,955
And Marta.

47
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,667
Seriously?
What's her problem?

48
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,754
She saw you do an impression of her
in front of the whole bakery.

49
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh, man. Before I knew
it was a birth defect!

You know what?

Oh.

59
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,696
Yeah, that explains it.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,823
Your fingers look more regular.

I need you to do something for me.

Name it.

66
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,215
I can't go in looking like this.

You look great.

You know what they'll do to me.

You've seen the documentaries, right?

70
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,017
What can I do?

71
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,729
Your sister still got that shop?

72
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,775
Come and take me home

73
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:13,859
What do you think?

74
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,239
I'd add a scorpion to the pentagram.

I'm out in the woods

76
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:30,084
Said I'm lost in the woods

77
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:33,671
Oh

78
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,358
JOSH: Okay, how many seats
in the House and Senate?

79
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,902
ANNIE:
Hmm, how many seats on a plane, Josh?

80
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,113
I have no idea.
Exactly.

81
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,824
But you fly a lot more
than you pass bills in
the Senate. Am I right?

82
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,577
Right. I'm sensing it's not the material

83
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,953
that's been the problem here.

84
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,539
So do you have study buddies
over there across the pond?

85
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:12,042
Oh, you mean a quiz chap.
(LAUGHS) Yeah, yeah.

86
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,420
I've always been a lot more
chap than quiz, you know?

87
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,630
Hmm, right.
Next subject.

88
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,715

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,341
No.

You know everything about me.

91
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,345
That's how this works.
All you, no me.

92
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,972
Just, like, one little crumb.

93
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,224
Your middle name.
Twitter name.

94
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,018
Porn name?

95
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,104
Huh, is that pineapple?

96
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,570
That was mine.

97
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,905
I just wanted a bite.

98
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,450
Of my pizza.
There are four other slices.

99
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,327
Well, I didn't want a whole piece.

100
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,497
Yeah, but my mouth touched that one.

101
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,041
I'm not following.

102
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,001
Your mouth touched my mouth.

103
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,587
I just wanted to try the pineapple.

104
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,089
We just kissed, my friend.

105
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,258
We certainly did not.

106
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,260
Oh, it is not so certain.

107
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,933
We should do chemistry.

108
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:10,601
Aren't we?

109
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,522
Never mind.

110
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,857
Okay, Doc.

111
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,319
You know, you could talk about
transference all you want,

112
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:24,740
but you just pizza transferred
your tongue into my mouth.

113
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,158
Hard.

114
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,369
And I don't think it was just
about the pineapple.

115
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,123
I think we're done for tonight.

116
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,458
Mmm.

117
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,378
You're the best quiz chap I ever had.

118
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,353
Hmm. Do we look any different?

119
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:57,189
Better.

120
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,109
Older.

121
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,360
Sexier.

00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,742
Oh.
What, now look at this.

125
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,412
Toaster's broken.
Had to microwave them.

126
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,997
Mmm.
Mmm.

127
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,041
Harry tried to write a poem
about famous marriages.

128
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,167
Where is that animal?

129
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,419
It started with Bert and Ernie,

130
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,254
and then he went back to sleep.

131
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,882
Okay, well, we feel loved.

132
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,925
But go wake him up.
Get ready for school.

133
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,385
STAN: Thanks, baby.
Yeah.

134
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,723
So what do you wanna do?

135
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,893
What do you mean?

136
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,687
Sara said she would babysit
if we wanna go out.

137
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,773
You trust that child
in our house all alone?

138
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,027
Okay, so here's what it is, all right?

139
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:45,487
I'm gonna rent a Bentley.

140
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,739
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.

141
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:49,325
Convertible, ostrich seats.
Okay.

142
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,076
And I'mma drive you up to Birmingham,

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,495
and we're gonna go have dinner
at the Townsend Hotel.

144
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,580
Hmm?

145
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:57,791
I think that's the place
they got the bourbon that nobody can get.

146
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,003
Like 70 bucks a glass.
Smells like a forest fire.

147
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,922
Mmm.
We're gonna get that.

148
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,884
And then when the check comes,
I'mma charge it to the room.

149
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,761
Oh, we're getting a room now?

150
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,305
We're gonna get not a room.
Presidential suite.

151
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,389
Ooh.

152
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,267
And then, wake up, breakfast in bed.

153
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,769
Home to the kids by noon.

154
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,108

156
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,946
But we deserve it.

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,702
Let's just go halfsies
on the new hot water heater.

158
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,791
Hmm, nothing like a good, hot shower.

159
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,464
(SIGHS)
I gotta work anyway.

160
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,634
Yeah, same.

161
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,765
What if we turn it length-wise?

162
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,809
It's a square, Annie.

Or is it...

A diamond.

Take it easy on my floors, okay?

166
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,405
I need the practice.

167
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,448
They're all she has left.

168
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,909
So what are we gonna do here?

169
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,995
I made a to-do list.

170
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,539
That is a battle cry if I ever heard one.

171
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,791
(CHUCKLES)
She means business.

172
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,126
Yo, Murderball.

173
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,211
You wanna park it
and join the conversation?

174
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:25,587
RUBY: I hear you just fine.

175
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,466
Number one.

176
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,177
Gain back his trust.

177
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:34,096
How?

178
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,685
Softly, just break it to me softly

179
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,896
Be straight with me but gently

180
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,649
Tender before you kill me

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:46,900
Pow-pow

182
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:51,864
And once we do number one,
then we move on to number two.

183

Oh, my gosh.
That's so funny.

364
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,065
We're playing you in the semi-finals.

365
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:49,484
I'm Beth, by the way.
Kenny Boland's mom.

366
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:56,616
We'll see you on the ice.

367
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,014
Oh.

368
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,975
Oh, it is hot in there.

Wait a minute.
That sign is in dollars.

370
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:29,566
Well, yeah.
What did you expect?

371
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,067
Loonies.

372
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,278
What are you talking about?

373
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,280
You're supposed to smuggle me to Canada.

374
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,615
Says who?

375
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,283
Your gang leader.

376
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,744
Okay, first of all,
he's not our gang leader, and...

377
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:42,912
His guy on the inside said
that if I lit the fire,

378
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,373
my debt would be paid,
and he'd get me to Canada.

379
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,044
Why?
What did he tell you?

380
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,883
Same thing.

381
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,053
We just thought you'd wanna pee first.

Ooh. (CHUCKLES)

384
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,393
Well, man, I wish you would've
asked me five minutes ago

385
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,188
because it's a mess in here.

Oh, Jesus.

I am super horny.

Oh, my God.
Back in a jiff.

390
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,701
Ugh.

391
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,244
Unbelievable.

392
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,714
That is deeply stupid.

393
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:36,716
It's Boomer.

394
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,551
Talk about a lamb to slaughter.

395
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:42,222
To be clear...
I know, I know.

396
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:45,642
This is not Mary's
fuzzy, cute, little lamb.

397
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:50,772
It's a dirty, mangy, feral...

398

Serial raping lamb.

If anyone deserves it...

Sorry it took so long.

401
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,198
I've been in solitary the past few weeks.

402
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,951
Jesus, why?
What did you do?

403
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,286
It was more what was being done to me.

404
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,247
Can we please go?

405
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,790
I needed time to heal.

406
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:09,874
All right.

407
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,085
They wanted to make sure
I could pass a solid, you know...

408
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,754
Let's get back in the bag.
Come on, move it.

409
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,339
Oh, I need a favor.
Come on, let's go.

410
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,552
Are you kidding?

411
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,054
Look, since we're still state-side,

412
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,973
I wanna see Nana.
Real quick.

413
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:28,601
With that face?
You'll kill her.

414

We're all going to
Saskatchewan in a grain truck.

415
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:33,106
I may never see her again.
And she's getting up there.

416
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,358
Call her from the road.

417
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,402
She's in a nursing home.

418
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,154
Wait, what?

419
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,780
Since when?

420
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,365
She had a bad fall.

421
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,200
Well, what happened?

422
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,410
I don't know.

423
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:48,329
No one was taking care of her.
I was locked up.

424
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,415
No.

425
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,544
He should say goodbye to her.

426
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,755
No.

427
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,548
She should say goodbye to him.

428
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,301
We have a job to finish, Annie.

429
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:03,219
And you-know-who is not gonna wait.

430
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,931
Manolo's good people.
He'll wait, right?

431
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,851
He's solid.
He's a solid dude.

432
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:15,106
It is her last chance.

433
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:23,907
One hour.

00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,992
Thank you.

435
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,119
All right, back in the bag.
Go on.

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,002
Deeply stupid.

barge in here, okay?

Why don't you ask that prick
where he put his hands?

439
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,471

he fully knew the rules.

Thirteen?
Yeah.

Is that O'Brian?
Is he the captain there?

447
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,862
Well, I heard he retired.

448
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:05,240
I went to academy with his son.

Oh, great cop.

00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,953
Will you please tell this guy
he can't just go through our stuff?

What's the problem, man?

00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:15,124
Dude said his wife's earrings got stolen
at some birthday party.

a warrant or something?

not how it works for girls like you.

00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,612
We don't have time for this, okay?

540
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:37,780
No, I gotta see it through.

541
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,491
Lookit, she's a wonderful
lady and whatever,

542
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,201
but we gotta get you to...

543
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,494
BETH: Canada.
Yeah, right.

544
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,871
I'm not going.

545
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,748
Uh, yeah, you are.
No, I'm not.

546
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,958
We don't answer to you.

547
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,377
Yeah, we answer to someone
way scarier than you.

548
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,796
Why does that guy
give a turd where I go, huh?

549
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,184
You know what?

550
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,644
Thanks for the ride.
You're off the hook.

551
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,979
Uh-uh. No way.

552
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:11,772
Annie, I dig your new hair.

553
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,065
It's not really new.

554
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,109
Well, I like that you
let the roots grow out.

555
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,820
Hey, hey.

556
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,905
Beth.

557
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,073
Hey. Turn off the child locks.

558
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,533
ANNIE:
Beth, what are you doing?

559
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,118
Give me Nana back!

560
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:27,205
Get back in the bag.

561
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,917
No, don't.

562
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,169
Get back in the bag, Boomer.

563
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,381
If we didn't have
enough reasons to go to hell.

564
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,177
I swear to God this will be
her final resting place.

565
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:42,470
Beth, don't!

566
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:46,390
Oh, she's gonna go so well
with all this old people stuff.

567
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,642
Please...

568
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:50,978
Leftover prunes, lots of wound care,

569
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:53,731
and honestly, I don't know if this goo is

570
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:56,317
from sponge baths
or just straight up phlegm.

571
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,069
No!
Don't!

572
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:01,197
You will never be able
to siphon her out of this ooze.

573
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:10,122
Okay.
Okay, okay.

574
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,708
Okay.

575
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:16,087
Put him in.

576
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,843
We're not going to Canada, are we?

577
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,034
What's going on with you and my mom?

578
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,079
Sorry, who are you?

579
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,832
How many other moms see a kid shrink?

580
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,794
Oh.
Hello, Ben.

581
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,297
She thinks you care about her.

582
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:03,676
I, um...

583
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,557
I care about all my patients.

584
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,435
So you drink beer
late at night with all of them?

585
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,104
Well, most are in bed by 8:00, so...

586
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,398
Maybe you haven't gotten
to this part in your sessions yet

587
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,317
or whatever, but let me
break it down for you.

588
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,068
She's really into you, okay?

589
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,030
Like, the only reason
she's doing any of this stuff

590
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,615
is, like, to impress you or something.

591
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,744
Okay, look, it's natural
to worry about your mom...

592
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,078
I just know her.

593
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,540
Well, uh...

594
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,834
Rest assured, we're trying
to work on these issues.

595
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:39,170
Okay, but when she realizes that
you're "working on issues"

596
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:40,671
and not in love with her,

597
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:42,590
she's gonna get in bed for three months,

598
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,300
eat a whole lot of mac and cheese,

599
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,720
stop waxing, stop paying the bills,
stop making my lunches.

600
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,680
And forget about this GED thing.

601
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,185
I, um...
I hear what you're saying.

602
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:57,646
Good, 'cause if you don't,

603
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,900

five star Yelp reviews into one-ers.

Oh, but how are you getting home?

608
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:14,372
I rode my bike.

609

610
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,611
Oh, God. Oh, God.

Who's got Nana?

612
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,742
I do.

613
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,202
BOOMER: Sorry, who's talking?

614
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,329
(GROANS) It's me, Boomer.

615
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,833
BOOMER: Annie. Annie.
Listen... You gotta listen to me, okay?

616
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,420
I Know you hate me.
But I also know you loved my Nana.

617
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,671
Just stop talking.

618
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,840
BOOMER: She wouldn't have made it as long
as she did without you.

619
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,758
So I need you
to take care of her now, okay?

620
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,760
And do what she wanted, okay?

621
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,596
Annie?
I need you to say "okay."

622
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,724
Annie, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

623
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,643
Hockey bag in the trunk.
Pop it.

624
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:20,187
BOOMER: No, please, please.
Please, just...

625
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,149
Please say something!
Just, anything, Annie!

Okay, please, please?

630

Stop.

BOOMER:
Whoever is carrying me,
I'll do whatever you want.

632
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,918
You don't have to do this again.

633
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:45,504
We're all good now.

634
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,506
It's basic management, right?

635
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:50,593
The best employee, the most loyal,

636
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:52,261
they're the ones who get a second chance.

637
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,513

BOOMER:
Guys, where are you taking me?

641
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:04,398
Can someone just tell me
where you're taking me?

642
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:05,983
Oh, him.

643
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:09,487
Yeah, I got different plans for him.

644
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:16,869
BOOMER: Ow! Don't throw
me around, at least, okay?

645
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:18,913
Could you be
a little bit more responsible?

So?
So why don't you check yourself?

696
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,349
Excuse me?
You opened this door.

697
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,727
Swag money?
A professional karaoke machine?

698
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,646
That boulder...
And then you opened it again.

699
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,773
You opened it again, and then
you bashed down the damn wall.

700
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,274
One of us has to be good!

701

Fighting it.

704
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,412
And you know what that gets you?

705
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,624
That doesn't get you respect.
It doesn't get you a badge.

706
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,251
It doesn't get you a proper wedding ring.

707
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,212
It just gets you tired.

708
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,507
And then you get washed
right back down again.

Uh... like a girl?

715
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:45,119
Hmm.
Anything on my teeth?

716
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:48,831
Is that important?

717
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,249
Very.

718
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,293
Okay, well then, a little right here.

719
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,503
Here?

720
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:57,464
Good looking out, Timster.

721
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:00,300
(DOOR OPENS)

722
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,845
Annie. Hey.
Ah.

723
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:04,722
Wish me luck.

724
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,849
Hey, so we can totally skip
the rest of government

725
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:08,559
because I watched this
mini-series last night

726
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:11,145
on John Adams, which was way too long
and extremely boring.

727
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:12,730
But it pretty much...

728
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,314
covered everything.

729
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,068
Sorry, did I get the wrong time?

730
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:21,488
Before we get started,
I wanted to introduce you to Lila.

731
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,740
Hello.

732
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,117
What's up?

733
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,410
Lila's a teacher.

734
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:27,661
Sixth grade.

735
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,912
Very cool.

736
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,041
And she's also American,
so she has a much firmer grasp

737
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,085
on your people's sordid history.

738
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:36,336
(CHUCKLES)

739
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:39,631
Oh, and by the way,
I think it's awesome that
you're getting your diploma.

740
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,842
Oh, thanks.

741
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,802
It's never too late.

742
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:44,928
Hmm.

743
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,726
I thought you could use a real tutor.

744
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:53,145
I thought we were making progress.

745
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:56,190
Well, it's better this way.
Don't you think?

746
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,984
I don't know what to think.

747
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:02,279
Well, that's what I'm here for.

748
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:04,156
He'll give you my number.

749
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,366
I'll see you at home.

750
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:09,369
LILA: Bye.
Bye-bye.

751
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:13,957
Oh, okay.

752
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,253
All right, why don't we
start with what's bothering you today?

753
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,724
Chairs were on sale.
DEAN: Nice.

754
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,476
Just have to put them together.

755
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,895
I figured the kids could do it
when they get back.

756
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:38,732
Getting a jump, huh?

757
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:40,984
Look at this.

758
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,821
BETH:
Is that our anniversary?

759
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,406
No. Valentine's Day.
Three years ago.

760
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:51,119
Oh, with the sitter
who yelled at us for coming home too late.

761
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,288
(LAUGHS)
We got sitter-shamed.
Uh-huh.

762
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:55,874
We should shut more bars down together.

763
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,876
Like, in general.

764
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,128
We're real good at it.

765
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,967
I can't remember the
last time I had that much fun.

766
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:08,387
And you wore jeans.

767
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,140
So?

768
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:14,810
It wasn't that dress.

769
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,648
I didn't need anything from you.

770
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,902
I really wish you did.

771
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:32,536
It's just a dress, Dean.

772
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,876
Well, I'll start on the chairs.

773
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:58,186
I can tell by your face

774
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:04,067
That you're looking To find a place

775
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,779
To settle your mind

776
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:12,659
And reveal who you are

777
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:18,290
And you shouldn't be shy

778
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:23,420
For I'm not gonna try

779
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:27,841
To hurt you or heal you

780
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,887
Or steal your star

781
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,485
(LAUGHS)

782
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:04,461
Open your eyes

783
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:07,464
Get up off your chair

784
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:13,762
There's so much to do In the sunlight

785
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:16,640
Give up your secrets

786
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:19,393
And let down your hair

787
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:26,692
And sit with me here By the firelight

788
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,481
Third one this month out of Detroit.

789
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:10,193
Labs came back. Butyl acetate,
chromium oxide, and camphor.

790
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,112
Car paint?

791
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:13,822
Or nail polish.

792
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:15,615
Ew.

793
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,452
It's a woman.
Ew.
