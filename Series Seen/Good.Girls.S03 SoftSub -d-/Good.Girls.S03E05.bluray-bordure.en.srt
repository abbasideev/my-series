00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:07,507
SARA: I got fired from tutoring.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,008
They said I took their stupid pen.

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:10,426
She's not me.

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,429
I tried to seduce my therapist.
He straight up rejected me.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,724
You have a storied history
of pursuing inaccessible men,

7
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:19,268
which is a defense mechanism
to protect you from rejection.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,020
You're gonna like her.
She has birds.

9
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,104
"Bye."

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,483
So we wanted to talk
to you about doing some
custom work for us.

LUCY: /f it got into the wrong hands,

13
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:30,363
it's kinda, like, counterfeit.

14
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,657
That did not even occur to me.

15
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,034
He's alive. I'm dead!

16
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,411
Word is, you do the best work.

17
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,996
I'd like to see how it's done.

18
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,876
What do you think?
I think I need you alive.

19

Of course, Mr. Shapiro.

MICK: Morning, sunshine.

34
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,533
Wow, they don't build them
like this anymore.

35
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,620
Pickup's not today.

36
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,247
Is this where the ink goes?

37

Please...

41
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,882
Please don't do that.

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,092
Okay, my bad.

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,553
What tension do you set the rollers at?

44
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,764
Why?

45
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:21,307
Just curious.

46
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:24,935
Why?

47
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,688
'Cause I'm a Curious guy.

48
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,608
Well, you could look at the manual,

49
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,069
but there isn't one because
this is older than the Bible.

50
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,323

51
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,743
See you soon.

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,381
They didn't give me a knife.

54
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,551
I don't want your grubby-ass
house key on my BMT.

56
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:00,304
Gross.

57
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,514
I barely use it.

58
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:03,891
Why didn't you just get two six-inch?

59
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,435
Because the foot-long comes
with chips and a drink.

60
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,354
All good, thanks.

61
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,442
You know, I would love
to be rolling in six-inchers,

62
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,487
but instead I am working
my ass off for nothing.

63
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,449
Yeah, 'cause I just love being
homey's indentured servant.

68

Lock the doors.

69

What?
Hit the locks.

70
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:36,924
But they don't work.
They're broken.

What's going on?

72
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,760
Take this home and hide it somewhere.

73
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,304
Why?
And only take it out when we're printing.

74
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,518
What is happening right now?
This is insurance.

75
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,602
For what?

76
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,605
Anyone can run a printer, right?

77
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,899
But you need these plates
to make our money,

78
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,110
so if one of us disappears...

79
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,445
Why would we disappear?

80
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,322

put it to the boy's ear. Nothing.

Wait, so you mean, like,
if someone wanted
something special printed,

361
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:29,347
you would draw it?

362
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:31,558
But you'd pick the paper, the colors.

363
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,184
Yeah, but you'd draw it?

364
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,647
Yeah, and then we'd make
an engraver's plate
and print it all on-site.

Oh, Jesus.
I didn't do it.

Maybe if it was scissors or something.

Um, a while.

535
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,942
You think they sell that color
at Home Depot?

536
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,241
What if you add too much water
to the mulch?

537
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,578
Starch builds up.
BETH: And why don't we like that?

538
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,497
Why don't we like that?
Because the paper won't feel right.

539
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,167
You wouldn't even be able
to pass it off at a bodega.

540
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,880
Just because she gave you a cookbook
to a five-star restaurant

541
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,590
doesn't mean you can make the dishes.

542
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,385
You need the chef.

543
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,180
You need us.
You need all of us.

544
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,064
Nah.

545
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:09,528
No?

546
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,995
Not all of you.

547
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,293
(GUN FIRING)

548
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,680
Get up.

549
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,849
What?
We gotta do this.

550
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:45,809
Now?
Get up.

551
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,395
All right.
I'm up. I'm up.

552
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,315
I'm not a lost cause.

What are you talking about?

554
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:56,028
When you look at me,
I don't know who you see anymore.

555
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:57,946
I see my wife.
You can't leave me.

556
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,490
She's acting crazy
in the middle of the night.

557
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,075
That's how it happens, you know?

558
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,910
It's not any big thing.

559
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,537
You just wake up one day
and you stop caring

560
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:07,456
that I don't put the remote back
in the same spot

561
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,208
'cause you just got used
to looking for it.

562
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,251
Well, who says I'm used to it?
I couldn't watch anything tonight.

563
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,295
Marriages don't end, Stanley.

564
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,631
They fade, little by little.

565
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:16,965
Okay, come here.

566
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,093
You don't even see it happening.

Get in here.

569
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,855
Tell me where that remote is,
and we're good forever.

570
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:37,486

Aren't I kinda old for this?

Please?

577
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,130
Jordan called an Uber from the mall

578
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:39,965
and Chris-Kevin picked her up.

579
00:37:40,048 --> 00:37:41,633
Oh, no.

580
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,719

I'm still mad at you.

584
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:58,233
Don't be.

585
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,986
Not tonight.

586
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,913
Can we get rid of the bird, too?

587
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,207
It's nesting in the bath mat.

Meet Dorito Boland.

591
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,820
When did you buy a bird?

592
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:47,407
He's a rescue.

593
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:49,326
Did you tell the kids yet?

594
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:53,789
I thought we could surprise them together
after school today.

595
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,588
I wasn't trying to make things worse.

I just... I really hate you being around
that guy again.

598
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:12,432
Me, too.

599
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:15,310
Really?

600
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,944
So what happened?
Was he pissed?

601
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,367
Yeah.

602
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,287
I told you he won't kill
something he loves.

It's not me, though.

Money.

606
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,181
How long's this guy gonna be around?

607
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,186
Um, about 50 years.

608
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,023
We'll have to put him in Our will.

She's off today. Why?
