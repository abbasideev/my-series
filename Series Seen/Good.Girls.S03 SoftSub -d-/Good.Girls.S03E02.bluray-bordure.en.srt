Yeah, ever since she got therapized.

Therapists.

722
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,207
Jenny's mom's a therapist.

723
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,084
And she went to rehab for Ritalin.

724
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,962
Why are they up your butt anyway?

725
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:38,338
You don't need a therapist.

726

Yeah, but what do people usually say?

734

Well, most of my patients are younger,

735

about brushing teeth,

This is stupid.
I'm gonna go.

Okay.

Aren't you gonna try to stop me?

741
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,473
I can't help you if you don't have
any problems.

742
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:33,268

kind of smells like pee.

No, you hid it better.

You should've checked references.
