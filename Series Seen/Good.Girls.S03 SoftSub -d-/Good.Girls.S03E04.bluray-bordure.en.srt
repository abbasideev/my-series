Where did this guy go to prison?

6

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,075
Pro. You're not dead yet.

184
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,413
How are we gonna get 100 grand?

185
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,207
Another pro.
How is that a pro?

186
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,669
Well, he could have said, like, $100,

187
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,129
which would have been way easier,

188
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:14,298
but said a lot less about you
as a person.

189
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:17,092
Do you know how many ones
we're gonna have to get
to print that much?

190
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,177
RUBY: Con.

191
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,887
Thank you.
RUBY: It's a lot.

192
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,722
Not to mention washing it.

193
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,015
Con.

194
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,643
Okay, there are gonna be
a lot more cons than pros.

195
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,856
How firm was he on this number?

196
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:31,982
(DOOR OPENS)

197
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:37,779
Hey, ladies.

198
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,460
What is going on?

199
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:52,961
I got floss.

200
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:55,380
Oh?
We were out.

201
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,008
What else did you get, Dean?

202
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:02,429
Hmm, got some razors, deodorant.
I'm gonna try these

203
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,014
breathe right nose strip thingies...

204
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,099
Why is there a shotgun on our bed?

205
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,018
It's the only gun I could get without
a waiting period.

206
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,187
What if the kids find it?

207
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:12,064
I'll hide the ammo.

208
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,484
And what if they find that?
They won't.

209
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,238
Kenny's found every one
of his Christmas gifts
for the past five years.

210
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,364
That's 'cause you hide them.

211
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,243
I Know you're upset...
No.

212
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,495
I'm terrified.

213
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,122
And I get that.

214
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,710
But this isn't gonna make him go away.

215
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,254
Then tell me what will.

216
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,259
I don't want a gun in my house.

217
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,802
And I don't want the tweaker
on the front lawn

218
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,679
reporting back to the guy
who emptied a clip in me,

219
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,724
but hey, that's the world
we're living in.

220
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,941
Time.

221
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,235
Nine minutes, 38 seconds.
Mm.

222
00:12:58,485 --> 00:12:59,569
Not bad.

223
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,406
Yeah, it's for preschoolers,
but congrats.

224
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,242
What else you got around here?

225
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,664
We could talk about stuff.

226
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,090
How do you talk about something
that you can't talk about?

227
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:21,300
Well, just start.

228
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,805
I'm really worried about my sister.

229
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:28,348
Okay.

230
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:36,023
She's dealing with something that's
very life-threatening.

231
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,191
Well, they say when someone gets sick,

232
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,943
it might as well be the whole family.

233
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:44,489
It's just that we thought
that it was gone,

234
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,366
and now it's back.

235
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,201
The big C, huh?

236
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,537
Mm.
What kind?

237
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:54,833
It's Super rare.

238
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,044
I lost my mom the same way.

239
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,754
Oh, God.

240
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,214
So, I've been down the road.

241
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,677
Yeah, it's just...
It's not, you know, one of the...

242
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:09,348
Like a breast cancer or a lung...

243
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,893
Not one of the super popular ones, So...

244
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:13,977
Try me.

245
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,771
(EXHALES SHARPLY) I...

246
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:17,814
I just...

247
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,900
I...

248
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:22,277
Eye...

249
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:24,654
Ball...

250
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,656
Cancer.

251
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,950
It's eyeball cancer.

252
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,746
Just the, uh...
Just the one.

253
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,414
Left one.

254
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,375
Retinoblastoma?

255
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:40,670
If I never hear that word again...

256
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,714
That's how my mum died.

257
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:44,966
Oh, no.

258
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,219
Has she lost her vision yet?

259
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,180
Ish?

260
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,108
Mom always wanted to see
the Grand Canyon.

261
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,611
I planned a whole thing.

262
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:07,572
We'd stay at the lodge
on the valley floor.

263
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,949
It's Supposed to be great.

264
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,785
Yeah, but, um, I got this cat

265
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,453
'cause I was having a hard time dealing,

266
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,580
and it wouldn't sleep,

267
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,417
so I pushed the trip by a week.

268
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,629
She went completely blind
the night before our flight.

269
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,299
Did you still go?

270
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,636
I! mean, she said it smelled amazing.
(CHUCKLES)

271
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,388
That's just who she was.

272
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,391
Um...

273
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,854
This made me wanna be a therapist.

274
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,190
The Eye in Survivor.

275
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:45,777
You're gonna make it

276
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,904
whether your sister does or not.

277
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,340
Okay, I feel much better.
Thank you.

278
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,092
Thank you.
Yeah.

279
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,846
Same time, same place next week.

280
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:14,723
I'm gonna grab Timmy.

281
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
Timmy!

282
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,311
Timothy, come on in.

283
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,023
Add $350 to that.

284
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,486
You know you don't have to put
the dot zero zero, right?

285
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,488
I'm aware. Thank you.

286
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,907
Plus $200. Stan's working
a bachelor party.

287
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,366
And I get time and a half for nights,

288
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,618
so put half, like, another...

289
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,578
(CROWD CHEERING)

290
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,330
For, like, another hundred.

291
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:40,540
No dot zero zero.

292
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,584
Okay, I like to see
the whole number, all right?

293
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:43,835
Where we at?

294
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,962
BETH: So that puts us at... (SIGHS)

295
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:47,380
Still way off.

296
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,135
If we didn't hit Fine & Frugal,

297
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,845
I had another plan.

298
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,350
Okay, this general attitude
is why I keep things to myself.

299
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,478
What?

300
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:04,898
You remember when that Kardashian

301
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:08,568
got, like, a bazillion-carat
diamond necklace stolen
from her hotel room in Paris?

302
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,653
All right, I gotta pee.

303
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,783
Do you still wanna hear it?

304
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,630
Ooh.

305
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:30,757
(INHALES)

306
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,417
Let's go. We gotta go.

307
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,961
It's insane, but...

308
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:13,550
If we had explosives, a hypnotist,
and a military helicopter,

309
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,260
we might be able to pull this off.

310
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,513
Hang on. Did you...
Dd you change?

311
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,473
Yeah. I got our money.

312
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:21,808
What?

313
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,185
It's Gordie Howe's.

314
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:25,895
That means nothing to me.

315
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,606
From the 1955 Stanley Cup.

316
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,482
Even less.

317
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:35,655
Oh, we gotta go.

318
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,741
Let's go.
Let's go.

319
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,460
(CROWD CHEERING)

320
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,349
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

321
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,978
It's okay. It's old.

322
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,776
I grabbed the only thing
I could think of.

323
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,235
What was that?

324
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,780
A toilet plunger.
Smart.

325
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,241
But I had to use
the wood part to break the glass.

326
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,538
Uh, but what'd you hold on to?

327
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:26,706
Toothbrush.

328
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,458
You didn't.
I did.

329
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,127
Vinegar, baking soda, lemon juice.

330
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,633
Did you at least wrap some
toilet paper around it?

331
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,927
There was so much pressure
from the knocking.

332
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,346
ANNIE: Plunger's seen some things.

333
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:43,556
There's a volcano burger on that menu.

334
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,145
Double bison patty
smothered in habanero sauce.

335
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,065
It comes with bottomless chili fries.
(GROANS)

336
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,236
BETH: Okay. (SIGHS)

337
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,489
Now what?

338
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,783
We wait.

339
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,286
It's gonna be worth it.

340
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:09,624
(SIGHS)

341
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,053
Hey. How we doing tonight?

342
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,555
How do you think we're doing?

343
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,016
How do you even know
what this thing looks like?

344
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,355
The guy sent me, like,
four different angles of it.

345
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,525
Hmm?

346
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,236
Apparently, it belonged
to his grandfather.

347
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,870
At what point are we taking this too far?

348
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,538
This is our job, Ruby.

349
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,914
She's a straight A student.

350
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,291
Yeah, smart like a fox.

351
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,376
She tutors, volunteers.

352
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,461
Good cover.

353
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:59,507
The other day, I watched her bring in
the Connors' trash cans

354
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,967
without even being asked.

355
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,385
Casing the joint.

356
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,972
She's a perfect kid.
Yeah, and so were you.

357
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,736
She's not me.

359
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,497
I need to get in there.

360
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,296
Please.

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,906
You've missed two sessions.

543
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:20,284
Stalking included.
I got worried.

544
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:25,205
Look, there's no point, okay?
I made it weird.

545
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,332
We should talk about that.

546
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,001
And make it weirder?
It's called transference.

547
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:32,171
When people make progress in therapy,

548
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,714
it's not uncommon to...

549
00:35:34,923 --> 00:35:37,926
You know, develop, like,
a crush on the person helping them.

550
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,805
Okay, well, this right now
is definitely not helping,

551
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,849
and I have stuff to do, so...

552
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,773
All right. See you.

553
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,653
I'll, uh, go back
in my apartment, count to 50.

554
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,448
You Know what I think'?

555
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,122
You have a storied history of pursuing
inaccessible men,

556
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,124
which is a defense mechanism

557
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,417
to protect you from rejection.

558
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:14,004
In fact, you do that
with a lot in your life.

559
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,633
I mean, why pursue anything that would
make you happy

560
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,551
when there's a chance
you might not get it, right?

561
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:25,224
And you put all that
under a nice thick layer
of sex and sarcasm

562
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:27,810
that makes you bulletproof
to any real emotion.

563
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,607
But, uh, you know, hey.
What do I know?

564
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,693
I graduated bottom of my class online.

565
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:41,365
You can't charge me for that.

566
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:45,285
If you don't come back,
I've gotta fill your spot.

567
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,380
Hey, have you seen my purse?

568
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,174
The ammo's in the office.

569
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:04,304
The gun is in the garage
with the lawn stuff.

570
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,724
How would you ever get to it?

571
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,685
I just like knowing it's there.

572
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,733
Okay.

573
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,027
We were so good with him gone.

574
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,404
Purse is on the couch.

575
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:11,705
I'll be right with you.

576
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,043
Hey, now.

577
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,762
I don't have it all right now, okay?

578
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,889
I'm not here for that.

579
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,184
I'm just here for some custom printing.

580
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,396
Word is you do the best work.

581
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:40,108
I'd like to see how it's done.

582
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:42,277
I don't know what you're talking about.

583
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,362
Oh, no?

584
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:47,533
'Cause your friend says you do.

585
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,039
I wanna see.

586
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,252
Well, he's got it wrong.

587
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,004
(GUN CLICKS)

588
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,508
Show me.

589
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,208
Pulp's gotta dry now.

590
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,418
Okay.

591
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:06,672
Takes a while.

592
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,298
I got time.

593
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:05,605
What do you think?

594
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:09,901
I think I need you alive.
