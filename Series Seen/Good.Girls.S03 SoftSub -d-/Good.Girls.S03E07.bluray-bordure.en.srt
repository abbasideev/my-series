Let me tell you something
about my husband.

Stanley Lamont Hill is a Cop,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,553
whether you give him a badge or not.

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,390
He couldn't commit a crime
if his life depended on it.

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,683
Well, what'd they say?

7
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,602
That they'd be honored
to have me back on the force.

8
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,438
Then I came home, tried on my uniform.

9
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:23,898
It made me feel like a fraud.

Looks a little light.
I couldn't make as much.

17

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:38,744
He got in my face and then followed me
back to my car.

183
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:39,828
Why?

184
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,205
He kept saying that Dorito was his

185
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,082
'cause she was singing some French song.

186
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:44,875
And I was like, "Dude,
she knows lots of songs.

187
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,877
My kids taught her Don't Worry, Be Happy."

188
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,170
I was like, "Back off."

189
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,755
But he get getting in her beak,

190
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:54,009
and calling her Abdul or Apu or Abu.

191
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:57,596
Au Jus.

192
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,974
Yeah. How'd you know that?

193
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,987
Here. Order anything you want.
It's on me.

194
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,906
Not hungry.

195
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,534
What's in the bag?

196
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,787
You look like you could use some coffee.

197
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:25,874
They make a mean Arnold Palmer.

198
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,381
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

199
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,260
Just one.

200
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,928
Seriously, Max, what's in the bag?

201
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,893
Where is my girl?

202
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,278
We told her not to get
in the van, but she...

203
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,447
she trusted him.

204
00:10:58,365 --> 00:10:59,658
Sounds like Lucy.

205
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:05,038
If it wasn't for her, we would all be...

206
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,915
It's true, Max.

207
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,834
She's a hero.

208
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,088
Y'all get a chance to think about food?

209
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,965
We did not.

210
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,717
We're gonna need another minute.

211
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,052
Well, the chef's got
a few yummy specials,

212
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,888
help kick your morning off right.

213
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,098
Got an eggs B that's to die for.

214
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,183
All set.

215
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,726
Uh, here.

216
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,190
I'm gonna do the eggs B.
WAITRESS: Yeah, okay.

217
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:35,110
I mean, if it's that good.

218
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,531
What do we do about this guy?

219
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,242
Well...

220
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,205
That's the tricky part.

221
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,415
I mean, we can't exactly go to the cops.

222
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,126
Or we'll all end up in that van.

223
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,213
And it's back.

224
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,966
I don't want to go to the cops.

225
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,010
Okay. Good.

226
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,221
I want to kill him.

227
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,850
Max, it's not that easy.

228
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,227
Take it from her.

229
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:09,811
BETH: If you miss,

230
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:11,855
which you will--

231
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,607
Again, she would know.

232
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,151
We're all back in that van.

233
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,780
So he just gets to do this
to innocent people?

234
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,075
And we just sit here and we do nothing?

235
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,202
WAITRESS: Arnold Palmer?

236
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,162
Over there.

237
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,424
Thank you.

238
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:47,432
I've got a cousin.
He's a former Navy SEAL.

239
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,142
You mean like a...

240
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,227
He'll do it.

241
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,312
How much?
MAX: Going rate is 30.

242
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:54,147
Grand?

243
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,274
He won't miss.

244
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,109
Do you have that kind of money?

245
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,904
I was hoping you did.

246
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,240
(SCOFFS)
We don't.

247
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,829
Then I have to do it myself.

248
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,873
WAITRESS: Eggs B, coming in hot.
Jesus.

249
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,628
Oh, and just some hot sauce.

250
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,300
No, you don't.

251
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:24,761
I've got nothing else left to lose.

252
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,976
Max.

253
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,062
Who's your cousin?

254
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,579
You got the bromine charts
for the Spa Master 50?

255
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,833
I do, yeah.
Come on, man.

256
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,294
Crazy about Jeff, huh?

257
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,838
What?
Called up to the big show.

258
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,507
He got Vegas?

259
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,427
ERIC: Regional Sales Manager.

260
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,887
Seriously?

261
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,638
And they are setting him up fine.

262
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,807
Even paying relocation for the pugs.

263
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,768
You ever think about transferring?

264
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,979
And give up 11 years
at this party palace?

265
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,524
My wife and I, we're going through
something right now.

266
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,194
There's this guy.
I don't want to get into details.

267
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,029
Anyways, this guy is...

268
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,448
he's bad news.

269
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,994
It's bad for my marriage.
It's bad for my family.

270
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,789
I mean, we...

271
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:37,834
we could really use a change of scenery
right about now.

272
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,919
You know what I'm saying?

273
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,797
Well, then you gotta get your sales up.

274
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,298
How'd he do it?

275
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,718
(LAUGHING)

276
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:50,305
Boned Gayle.

277
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:53,475
Well, how'd you do it?

278
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,935
Oh, I don't.

279
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,771
I'm buried in credit card debt
and live with my aunt.

280
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,649
There's gotta be a middle ground.

281
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,110
You find it, let me know.

282
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,653
An!

283
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,197
Found it.

284
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,865
Great. Thanks.
Yeah.

285
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,242
Hey.

286
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,579
Who gets Jeff's leads?

287
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,998
They just go back to corporate.

288
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,875
Not if we get to them first.

289
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,419
Well, we can't do that.

290
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,087
Would you rather bone Gayle?

291
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,841
I'm gay.

292
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,509
Exactly.

293
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,846
ANNIE: Oh, you want to talk dumb?

294
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,473
What's dumb is stealing from
a Known murderer.

295
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,558
Shh!

296
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:37,310
He's not even here yet.
Man pops up like a genie.

297
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,980
(SIGHS) It would be SO easy.

298
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:43,275
How many times can three people
who look like us

299
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,652
commit a robbery without getting caught?

300
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,070
Law of averages.

301
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,948
I'm not up on that law.
You're not up on any laws.

302
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:52,284
There's at least 30 grand in the safe.

303
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,828
Oh, my God.

304
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,538
Do you not remember the last time

305
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,748
you thought there was
"30 grand" in a safe?

306
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,333
My way's easier, all right?

307
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,336
We skim from a few more runs,
and we'll have it.

308
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,422
And then what?

309
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,008
We issue a fatwa, and go home
and make our kids dinner?

310
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,303
Would it be the worst idea?

311
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,891
It would not.

312
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:28,445
How's it feel?

313
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,863
Still light.

314
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,119
Some fancy ink.

315
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,581
Pigment's from India.

316
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,376
Why I get the feeling
this ink guy's robbing me blind?

317
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,129
I can't control the world market.

318
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,050
Well, bring him by.

319
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:53,553
Why?

320
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,599
I'd like to meet him.
You know, see if we could
work something out.

321
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,059
He's in Oklahoma.

322
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:00,810
Thought you said Kansas City.

323
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,814
Isn't that in Oklahoma?

324
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:06,608
Missouri.

325
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,154
I'll see what I can do.

326
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,949
Cool.

327
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,160
What about the next run?

328
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,038
Yeah, nah, that's not gonna happen
till I get my costs down.

329
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,916
You're still making a profit. It's still
good business, right?

330
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,085
Not if you don't trust your partners.

331
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:41,893
Nah.

332
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,187
No one even said anything.

333
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,481
Something off with your energy.

334
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,941
We need a loan.

335
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,485
It's collateral.

336
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,696
How much you after?

337
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,115
30 grand.
For what?

338
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,826
Independent contractor.

339
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:00,787
You doing a remodel?

340
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,206
Uh, teardown.

341
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,418
I mean, it's smarter
to go through your bank

342
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,378
or your credit union
for a home equity loan.

343
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,507
That's not possible.

344
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,594
You gonna pay through the nose here.

345
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,016
It's for a hitman, okay?

346
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:25,645
Or we could just waste time
on finance metaphors,

347
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,772
and the next thing you know,
we're back in that van.

348
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,614
So you're looking for a personal advance.

349
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:36,823
Right.

350
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,867
Yeah.

351
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,244
It's not enough collateral
in the world for a loan like that.

352
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,746
Why?

353
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,873
I mean, when you end up dead,

354
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,208
which it sounds like there's
a real strong chance of,

355
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,085
guess who gets stuck with the tab.

356
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,049
Metaphor would've taken
five seconds longer.

357
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,967
And been way more effective.

358
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,054
Why don't y'all dust off those pretty
OJ masks of yours?

359
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,598
Like I've been saying...
We don't do that anymore.

360
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,766
Why?

361
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:04,893
Because we've evolved.

362
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,313
We're entrepreneurs now.

363
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,648
With no money.

364
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,775
We are not gonna rob your store, Annie.

365
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:15,111
Dude, it would be so easy.
I would do it myself
if there weren't cameras.

366
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:17,822
How easy?
Like, no security.

367
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,367
In and out.
It would take longer
to fill up a Slurpee.

368
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,495
Like Lionel Richie easy?

369
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,873
I literally just need
someone to hand the cash to that isn't me.

370
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,251
Okay, I see.

371
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,754
You know, I wish you all
would've led with that.

372
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,049
I might be able to help y'all after all.

373
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:37,258
Really?

374
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:39,969
Is there a different kind of loan?

375
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,555
Everybody, on the floor!

376
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,266
Chill. It's just me.

377
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,519
Better give me that money, bitch.

378
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,354
(SIGHS)

379
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,943
In and out.
Quicker than pouring a Slurpee.

380
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,071
I mean, how big is this damn Slurpee?

381
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,492
Bogey on our left.

382
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,202
Showtime.

383
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,458
Hi, do you have
time to save abandoned babies?

384
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,043
Uh, kind of in a hurry.

385
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,628
You can't spare a moment?

386
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,088
For abandoned babies?

387
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,008
I just want to get a water.

388
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,343
You know who would love a water?

389
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,555
The more than 22,000 infants
that are thrown in dumpsters every year.

390
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:27,809
Um, definitely against that.
I just, uh...

391
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,812
(SIGHS) All right.

392
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,397
I'm happy to work a volume discount.

393
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,357
How many units are we talking about?

394
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,025
Dean, I need a word.

395
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,527
Sounds great.
You name the time,

396
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,612
and I will have my guys there to install.

397
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:41,448
Now.

398
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:44,451
You know what, Richard?
Let me get into this,

399
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,618
and I'll call you right back.

400
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,288
Great. All right, thanks. Bye.

401
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,374
DEAN: I just don't get why
all that money has to go
back to corporate.

402
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,959
So you're calling the shots now?

403
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,837
No, but I can't make
my numbers just selling barbecue tongs.

404
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,630
And I can't have my men going rogue.

405
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,174
It's not how we do things here.

406
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,300
Oh, I know.

407
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,469
What's that supposed to mean?

408
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,345
I think you know what it means.

409
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:07,974
Pack up your desk.

410
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,435
Seriously?

411
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,438
Forward me your open projects.

412
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:15,857
That's how you're gonna play this?

413
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,567
Keys in the night box.

414
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:22,989
No.

415
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,325
Excuse me?
No.

416
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:28,077
No, what, Dean?

417
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,747
I'm not gonna pretend
like you're firing me

418
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,999
for a legit work reason when the truth is

419
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:36,377
you're only pissed off
'cause I won't tap that.

420
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:38,254
Get out of my office.

421
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,714
Oh, come on, Gayle.

422
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,051
I'm about to call corporate
and have you blacklisted

423
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,053
from every showroom in the country.

424
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:46,930
Great. Put it on speaker.

425
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,348
What?

426
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:51,226
I'll tell them how
you promote using only your vagina.

427
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:54,187
(CHUCKLES)
You think I'm Roger Ailes?

428
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,855
No one cares about me.

429
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,733
And they certainly don't care about you.

430
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,820
They care about Eric.
He's a lifer.

431
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,946
So?

432
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,864
So he knows everything.

433
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,950
Why would he risk his job for you?

434
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:09,786
Because I promised him yours
once I get you out.

435
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,706
So here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna walk back over there.

436
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,584
I'm gonna complete that sale
you so rudely interrupted.

437
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,378
I'm gonna take another of Jeff's leads

438
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:21,756
and another and another
and I'm gonna turn
this joke of an operation

439
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,969
into the number one leader
in Southeast Michigan's regional sales.

440
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,725
Open or closed?
Leave.

441
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,646
Is there a website I can go to?

442
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:40,775
Your donation today
helps get a baby out of the trash.

443
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:42,193
I don't have any cash on me.

444
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,319
How were you gonna buy the water?

445
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,654
We're happy to take a card.

446
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,615
Maybe next time.

447
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,371
How much longer can we do this?

448
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,462
ANNIE: Deep breaths.
Everybody just stay calm.

449
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,630
We can figure this out.

450
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,134
Don't worry, ladies.
I'm licensed to carry.

451
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,641
Where is it?
Get out of here.

452
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,059
Not until I get it all back.

453
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,686
Hey, man, we don't want any trouble.

454
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:17,896
Yeah? Well, you should've told her that

455
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,689
before she cleaned out
my wife's jewelry box.

456
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:20,773
What's he talking about?

457
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,525
So go to Cartier and buy her some more.

458
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,818
Or I'll just go to the cops.

459
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,737
Okay, yeah, then they can take
my statement.

460
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,864
I'm not gonna leave out
any details for your wife.

461
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:44,172
That was my soup.

462
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:46,424
Oh. Oops. Sorry.

463
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,884
STAN: What the hell was that?

464
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,719
Those guys are all dicks.

465
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,471
Is that where the money came from?

466
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:54,265
I'm doing his wife a favor.

467
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,267
He's gonna replace it
with something better.

468
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,061
What do you got me involved in?

469
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,979
These guys are all the same, okay?

470
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,440
They send their wives off
to New York to see Dear Evan Hansen

471
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:03,650
while they hump Detroit.

472
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,734
Jesus, Krystal.

473
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,570
They totally deserve it.

474
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,906
And how much of my cut is from Cartier?

475
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,742
All of it.
They don't tip, either.

476
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,289
I got another one this weekend
if you're still down.

477
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,464
Do either of you ladies have a phone?

478
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:28,925
Because I don't.

479
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:31,886
Mine's in my truck.

480
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,139
Uh...

481
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,725
Let me look.
Hands where I can see 'em!

482
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,812
Okay, go ahead, honey.

483
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,565
Nothing's been stolen, right?

484
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,234
Not a dime.

485
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:48,277
Okay.

486
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,323
How about...

487
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,285
before this gets real ugly,

488
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:59,956
we just let him go?

489
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,793
Yeah, that sounds about right.

490
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,587
He looks sorry.

491
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,131
You have no idea.

492
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:11,592
Call the cops.

493
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,561
What?

494
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,062
What?

495
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,397
No bars.

496
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,357
Hey!

497
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,692
(GUNSHOT)
(SCREAMS)

498
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,236
MAN: Is everyone okay?

499
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,865
No.

500
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,502
Okay, thank you.
They're on their way.

501
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,254
What do I do?
What do I do?

502
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:49,839
BETH: Okay, thank you.
Try to stop the bleeding.

503
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:50,923
How?

504
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,467
Can I get a Gatorade?

505
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,634
Anything you want, baby girl.

506
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,803
When you get your permit,
it's just a stupid class.

507
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,723
The green kind.
They don't let you practice.

508
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,475
Get the woman a Gatorade, Jason.

509
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,768
Okay, okay.
All right.

510
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,561
Okay, okay.

511
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:06,022
Can you make it tighter?
I'm trying.
I'm trying.

512
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,398
Where's my drink?

513
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,941
JASON: Okay, they're out of green.

514
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,651
They're out of green, baby girl.

515
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,236
Anything else sound good, huh?

516
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,821
Frappuccino. Mocha.

517
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,115
Frap! Mocha!
JASON: Uh, got it.

518
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,284
This isn't working.
There's still too much blood.

519
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,703
Okay. Sponges.
Aisle three.

520
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,414
And behind that, Saran wrap.
Here we go.

521
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,084
Ice scrapers.
Back wall.

522
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,587
You want a straw, mama? Huh?
Does that sound yum?

523
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,631
Am I gonna make it?

524
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:33,758
Will you shut up and drink your frap?

525
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,968
Here we go. This is it.
It's go time.

526
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,430
Need a fluids run up.
And get a blood ox, please.

527
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:40,932
Is she gonna be okay?

528
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:44,060
Jesus. Who did this?

529
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:46,437
Why?

530
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,939
You?

531
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,609
Bullet almost nicked the femoral artery.
I mean, you saved her leg.

532
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,569
I did?
Maybe her life.

533
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,654
(GASPS)

534
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,032
Oh, no.
PARAMEDIC: Let's go.

535
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,870
Someone call Stan.
Of course.

00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,925
"Lionel Richie easy"?

540
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,469
No one knows you were there.

541
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,054
We even did it on a Sunday.

542
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,265
Yeah, because we don't get
deliveries on Sundays.

543
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,934
Until you did.
He was supposed to come tomorrow.

544
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,769
And I asked for a knife.

545
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:28,312
Yeah, well, what the hell is that?

546
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,189
This is something you split a bagel with.

547
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:32,358
What do I look like? Rambo?

548
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,527
Okay, I did the job.
I want my cut.

549
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,279
Okay.

550
00:27:40,783 --> 00:27:42,660
I'm sorry, what the hell are you doing?

551
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,121
Oh, what's 10%
of zero, again?

552
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:47,039
Oh, yeah, zero!

553
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:51,127
I believe I'm owed something
for my pain and suffering.

554
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,172
You know, at least
you didn't take a bullet like your girl.

555
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:58,426
Bunny got shot?

556
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,514
She gonna be okay?

557
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,600
Yeah.

558
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:07,393
Thanks to me.

559
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,354
STAN: You are a lucky lady.

560
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,356
'Cause I got you.

561
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,984
You got grazed.

562
00:28:19,071 --> 00:28:20,281
Want to know what happened?

563
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:23,618
Mmm...
Mmm-mmm. Not now.

564
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,537
Did you get the hospital bill?

565
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,873
(SIGHS) Can't look.

566
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,960
I told those ambulance guys
I'd get an Uber.

567
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,296
After being shot?

568
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,049
(CHUCKLES)
I'd have got an SUV.

569
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,675
(LAUGHING)

570
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,677
At least the crutches were free.

571
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,972
Yeah, I stole those.
What?

572
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,016
They were just sitting
by themselves next to the elevator.

573
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:48,184
Stanley.

574
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:51,896
They wanted to charge us
400 bucks for them things.
(LAUGHS)

575
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,231
BETH: Hey, how's the patient?

576
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:55,691
Flying high on painkillers.

577
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,818
Ooh. What color are they?

578
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,571
Hey.

579
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:06,327
It wasn't supposed to--
Yeah, tell that to my kids.

580
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:10,706
RUBY: The universe has balanced itself.
Telling you, it's karma.

581
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:12,583
Dude, you gotta hear this.

582
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:16,003
Remind you of any Canadians you know?

583
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:17,964
Oh, stop.

584
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,676
I shot a man.
A man shot me.

585
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,720
I don't think the universe
is keeping score for Big Mike.

586
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,181
The circle is complete.

587
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:29,141
Well, almost.

588
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,978
I did save your life.

589
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,562
Now I wish you had let me bleed out.

590
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,151
So what do we do here?

591
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,654
Well, JT says he's down
to try again if we are.

592
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:42,947
Are you out of your mind?

593
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,949
Well, his nephew still needs a saxophone.

594
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,450
We are done with that.

595
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,203
Okay, So we just go sit on the curb

596
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,788
and wait for the van to pull up?

597
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,791
Because, you know, that's what happens
when you steal from a gang.

598
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,836
We should let tampon boy take his shot.

599
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,381
Yeah, and then he misses, and gosh,

600
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:02,133
this looks familiar.
Where am I?

601
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:04,969
Oh, I'm back in the van with all y'all.

602
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:06,762
RUBY: He might not miss.

603
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:08,806
ANNIE: Max-y Pad's gonna miss.

604
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,892
Have you ever fired it?

605
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,064
When I was little.

606
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,566
With bullets?

607
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:22,528
Well...

608
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,032
we'll just walk through the basics.

609
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,414
Max.
Yeah.

610
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,084
Grab the gun.

611
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,674
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

612
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,800
Oh, boy.

613
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,594
Pro tip.

614
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,804
Exhale before you pull the trigger.

615
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:50,514
Why?

616
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:52,141
Well, most people hold their breath,

617
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:54,477
which increases your pulse
and makes your hand shake.

618
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,062
How'd you learn that?

619
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:57,980
Him.

620
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:02,026
You can buy expensive cars

621
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:06,155
(GUNSHOT)
Oh, oh, oh, no! Oh, wow!

622
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,990
It's okay!
Oh, that's loud. I can't--

623
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,158
Shake it.

624
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:10,534
Shake it.

625
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,036
Wow.

626
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:14,872
Here. I brought these.
Oh, yeah.

627
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:16,415
Thank you.

628
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,085
You want some of this?
Exhale.

629
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,254
Blow his head off

630
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:26,133
In your dreams

631
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,553
Show no mercy

632
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:31,639
(INAUDIBLE)

633
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,812
And all your bad...

634
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:39,355
Just do a little shoulder roll.

635
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:42,817
Feel good? Feel loose?

636
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,860
I'm good-- (GUNSHOT)
Oh! I'm sorry.
(SCREAMS)

637
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,406
Who's a badass?
You are.

638
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:50,533
Oh, me.
Yes.

639
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:54,537
That was good.

640
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,831
Die.

641
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,833
I don't know if I could do this.

642
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,960
Just kidding.

643
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:04,463
Your bad days will end

644
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,425
(INAUDIBLE)

645
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,595
(SONG CONTINUES PLAYING)

646
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,927
We'll just get you
close enough so you won't miss.

647
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,480
What is this?

648
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:05,816
You wanted to meet my ink guy.

649
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,165
You want something?

650
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,335
Sprite. No ice.

651
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:30,841
Hey, can you hook my man
up here with a Sprite, no ice?

652
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,640
So you fly private or commercial?

653
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,768
Pardon?
Oklahoma, right?

654
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:42,269
And based on what you're charging me,

655
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,522
I figure you must got, like,
a G6 or something.

656
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:48,067
Well, I talked to Max here
about your cost concerns.

657
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,318
Oh, yeah?

658
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:55,533
And I think he has a solution
to make it all go away.

659
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,451
That right?

660
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,877
MAN 2: Here you go, guys.

661
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:09,755
Sprite. No ice.

662
00:34:14,468 --> 00:34:15,553
RIO: I'm all ears.

663
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,264
Go ahead.

664
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,147
I need to tell you something.

665
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,817
Okay.

666
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,278
Just...

667
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,613
give it to him straight.

668
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,293
I've made a mistake.

669
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:53,048
I shouldn't have tried
to raise my prices on you.

670
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,426
You almost lost a customer.

671
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,681
(STAMMERING) I am sorry.

672
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:07,938
All good.
Glad we could work it out.

673
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,316
BETH: Wait.

674
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,239
That all?

675
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:24,079
Thank you for the pop.

676
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:27,541
Yeah, on the house.

677
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,711
You work with really smart people.

678
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,345
MAX: I wet myself.

679
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,724
That's okay.

680
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,355
Are you mad?

681
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,191
My kids do it all the time.

682
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,526
Not about that.

683
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,989
It wouldn't have made you feel better.

684
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,454
Just makes you feel nothing.

685
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:10,376
That sounds nice.

686
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:15,339
It's not.

687
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:18,634
How do you know?

688
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:22,221
(SIGHS) I just know.

689
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,769
Can I ask for one thing, please?

690
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:32,064
But we just got her.

691
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:35,734
I Know.

692
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,864
You can have my allowance
to buy her food.

693
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,036
Sweetie, it's not about money.

694
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,831
I'll clean her cage.

695
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,501
Where's Emma?

696
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,003
She says she doesn't care.

697
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,883
Well, Mommy didn't know,

698
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,262
but Dorito already had a family.

699
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,306
Then why'd they give her up?

700
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:07,725
We love her.

701
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,561
She was sick, and we made her better.

702
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:14,815
And now she has to go home
to her real family.

703
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,235
Aren't we her real family?

704
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:24,116
Well, you know what?

705
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:28,203
We'll get another pet.

706
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:29,997
We will?

707
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,963
Only this time, you choose.

708
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,923
Anything you want.

709
00:37:45,637 --> 00:37:47,181
Snake.
Snake. Yes!

710
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,604
How about a gerbil?

711
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:55,272
Or a hamster?

712
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:57,399
Oh, remember that cute rabbit
that you wanted

713
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,484
from the farmer's market?

714
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,568
Yeah.

715
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,862
And then we can feed him to the snake.

716
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,322
(LAUGHING)
Yeah!

717
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:05,157
Let's go look up snakes.
Yeah, let's go.

718
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:12,164
I'm sorry.

719
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:15,959
This is the last thing he takes from us.

720
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,630
Hey, kids, movie night.

721
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:22,466
Sam Jackson on a plane.
It's educational.

722
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,598
Hey, Stanimal.
You want in?

723
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:32,601
Make sure no melds drop out
of your G-string this time.

724
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,311
If I do this, I'mma do it right.

725
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,065
Always two parties.
First one, you earn their trust.

726
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,484
You treat 'em like kings
while I case the castle.

727
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:42,027
Then say you had such a great time,

728
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,279
you're gonna come back,
bring more girls. Do it up.

729
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:46,782
That's when we take 'em down.

730
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,034
But only the most expensive piece.

731
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,288
'Cause with one, they're rich enough
to think they just lost it.

732
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,333
Let me know what time Saturday.

733
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,504
Stan.

734
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,424
Are you sure?

735
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,972
STAN: We're talking two horsepower,

736
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:12,057
zero to 60 in half a day.

737
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:13,725
What?

738
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,563
But faster than them damn crutches.

739
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,189
(HONKING)

740
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,278
Careful. Watch the corner.
Watch the corner! Hey!

741
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,948
That might've been a mistake.

742
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,492
How'd you get insurance to cover it?

743
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,579
DEAN: All right.
KENNY: Have to go so bad.

744
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,289
DEAN: I Know, I know, I know.
Give him the keys.

745
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:36,707
BETH: Here, here.
DEAN: There you go.

746
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,208
There you go. Go, go, go, go.

747
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:42,629
Hey, real quick.
Let me ask you a question.

748
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:47,759
What do you think about Las Vegas?

749
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,723
I think we can't afford a vacation.

750
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,643
No. Like, to live.

751
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,480
Why there?

752
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,275
It's not here.

753
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,569
(CHILDREN YELLING)

754
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:07,821
What is that?
KENNY: Come on, come on!

755
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,117
You're still in here?

756
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:13,994
A little privacy, please.

757
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,120
The door was open.

758
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,997
Just give me, like, one more minute.

759
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
What are you doing?

760
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:22,336
(SIGHS) Righting my ship
and finding my port.

761
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,338
Ew. Light a match when you're done.

762
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:25,797
But I don't know

763
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:31,720
It's simple and so complicated

764
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:34,181
I could walk all day

765
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:36,642
On the railroad tracks

766
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,393
But there's much more

767
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,686
So how'd you pay for it?

768
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,398
To it than that

769
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,483
You really want to know?

770
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:48,403
You want to know
what happened in that store?

771
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,490
Why throw stones, right?

772
00:40:51,573 --> 00:40:55,243
You know all of my Secret ideas

773
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:59,498
The ones I'm giving up on
And the ones I'll keep

774
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:04,586
I'd tell you why But I don't know

775
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,800
It's simple and so complicated

776
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:12,302
I could walk all day

777
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,097
On the railroad tracks

778
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,057
Where's all our stuff?
Shh.

779
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,978
To it than that

780
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:33,365
I'm so lucky 'Cause I asked you once

781
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:37,285
What are you doing?
Do you want to come up

782
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,996
For a cup of tea?

783
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,289
Come visit with me

784
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,375
We'll play guitars

785
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:46,044
And I will give you My number

786
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,552
I'd tell you why

787
00:41:58,223 --> 00:41:59,307
What's it say?
