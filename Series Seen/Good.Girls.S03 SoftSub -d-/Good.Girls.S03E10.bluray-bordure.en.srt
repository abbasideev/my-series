00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,382
I had him recall the nail polish.

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,384
What's that?
We had to change the formula.

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,472
Change it back.
There is a nail salon selling
them for $200 a bottle.

00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:16,516
Nail salon robbed.
Guess what they took.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,059
I figured out who we should help.

I got their daughter's kidney.

It's like a study buddy.

I wanted to introduce you to Lila.

because he's a center.

Well, guess what. If you don't
feed Darrel the puck,
he doesn't see anything.

What's the difference?

65

I can't tell you.

he is anyway, your father?

How?
It's like, what's next?

or you're grounded?

"Don't worry about it.
It went to a good cause."

194
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,424
I put a hit out on you.

195

00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,849
You know what I would really love
is if he would just show up

at one of your houses next time,

200
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,061

to think on your feet.

Uh, a customer?

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,457
Yeah. A very upset customer, so...

You see?

I'm sorry, but Mr. Fitzpatrick
is not available at the moment.

What the hell is this?

221
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,925
He said it was like hiring a lawyer.

222
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,928
They charge by the hour.
And then do nothing?

223

Yes, like a lawyer.

I'm sorry. Why does he need
the omakase to not kill gang friend?

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,608
And what is "OT"?

227
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,862
Occupational therapy
for manual dexterity.

228
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,073
What, like his trigger finger
is sore or something?

229
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,366
How's that on us?

Oh, he plays the cello?

That's a guitar.
It's a cello.

The case gives it away.

239

Has a much narrower neck
and a more cambered fingerboard.

That's no cello.

241

00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,571
(STAN CHUCKLES)

358
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,907
That ham, though.
Mmm-mmm.

359
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,991
Thank you, Lord.

360
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:14,290
Stan.

361
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,047
Oh, okay.

362
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,301
Okay.

363
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,686
And Lord, you know...

364
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,773
um, know everything Carl said...
(CHUCKLES)

365
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,194
And I just wanna thank you
for blessing us

366
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,656
with the opportunity
to meet these guys and so happy

367
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:49,033
and glad my baby girl
could make this happen.

368
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,455
Obviously, you know, we wish it was under
different circumstances.

369
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,834
But, you know, you work
in mysterious ways

370
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,419
and God bless the food, amen.

371
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:00,670
Now, can we eat?

372
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,922
(ALL LAUGHING)

373
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,007
Yes.

374
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:09,304
So how was the trip down?

375
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,556
Oh, we took the bus.

376
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:16,519
That's s a 16-hour trip.
Oh, not for us.

377
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:19,188
We could only afford to go
as far as Kenosha,

378
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:24,277
so we did a bit
of a rideshare situation from there.

379
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:28,197
Where's your car?

380
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,325
Um...

381
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:34,287
We sold it after Carl lost his job.

382
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,918
But, you know, I've been
doing so much walking.

383
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,086
I dropped my cholesterol 50 points.

384
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,922
Doctor's pleased.

385
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,673
(ALL CHUCKLING)

386
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:51,262
And the people at the church
have been real kind, pitching in.

387
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,514
Yes, and what can you do?

388
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,892
When life gives you lemons,

389
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,310
you can't rob a bank.

390
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:59,103
(LAUGHTER)

391
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,941
Mmm, boy.

392
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:07,111
So how are you going to get back?

393
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,907
Can we buy 'em a bus ticket?

394
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,285
Yeah.
Oh.

395
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,495
We can work something out.

396
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,915
No, no, we're not here for handouts.

397
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:22,877
Although I would try
some of those delicious
looking mashed potatoes.

398
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:26,172
(ALL CHUCKLING AWKWARDLY)

399
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,967
No, from here, it's easy.

400
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,721
A daughter of a friend
of ours, has offered
to drive us as far as Lansing.

401
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,100
And now from there,
it's what many would call

402
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:39,602
a scenic hike up in God's country,

403
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,647
where if my wife's ankles hold up,

404
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,816
we'll just take one day
to get back to the interstate.

405
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,193
We'll work this off, huh?
(BOTH LAUGHING)

406
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:48,528
Good heavens.
We'll have to.

407
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,697
Such good people.

408
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,324
I Know.
We're not.

409
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,284
I Know.

410
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:01,916
How do we get back to that?

411
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,894
Sweet potato pie comin' in hot.

412
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:28,818
Do we still have that pressure washer?

413
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,696
What is that?

414
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,032
Everyone wants hot sauce.

415
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,700
So I went to Costco.

416
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,244
I got a vat of the stuff
and those little plastic cups

417
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,246
so I could just dispense it
from the back seat.

418
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,331
That's pretty smart, right?

419
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,917
It's why you're five star.

420
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,338
Hot sauce in a hot car.

421
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,717
Oh, my God. Ugh!
Just everywhere.

422
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,224
I'm so sorry, Beth.

423
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:02,810
Why?

424
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:09,150
Because I... I can't do it.

425
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,072
Then don't.

426
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,742
How are we supposed to, I mean...
Well...

427
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,702
What do you want to do?

428
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,749
Hot tubs.

429
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,463
Rich people love 'em.
Negotiable prices.

430
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:32,548
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

431
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,675
Financing plans, layaway...

432
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,512
There's, like, a million ways
to cook the books.

433
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,266
It's not regulated.
There's no licensing.

434
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,976
Any idiot can sell them.

435
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:46,604
And I know just the guy.

436
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:52,777
You said I needed a system.

437
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,279
This is my system.

438
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,948
(CHUCKLES) Sistema.

439
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,421
Go ahead and hate it
because you didn't think of it,

440
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,216
but your stupid carwash,

441
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,554
it's one of the IRS's
first targets, right behind
coin laundromats.

442
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,514
I googled it.

443
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:23,307
Guess what's not on the list?

444
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,269
Hot tubs.

445
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,731
They're called spas.

446
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,653
Pay her. Deduct the artwork.

447
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,538
Good morning, Mrs. Boland.
Get him.

448
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,291
I don't believe that
I have another package for you today.

449
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:49,375
Get him.

450
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,043
I have his money.

451
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,962
I just have a few questions.

452
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:54,046
Hmm.

453
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:57,175
What does omakase have to do with it?

454
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,968
It means entrusting yourself to the chef.

455
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,846
Typically off menu,
locally driven, sushi grade...

456
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:03,764
I mean, how does it help...

457
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,769
with killing a man?

458
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,190
Your lover enjoys a two-hour
omakase lunch every Friday.

459
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,692
Never misses.
After, he goes out into the parking lot

460
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:15,902
and has a chat with the chef.

461
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,905
It's an opportunity.
He then does various business

462
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,240
with people who would make
my work difficult.

463
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:25,703
Not an opportunity.
On Tuesdays, he plays tennis
at a very posh country club.

464
00:28:25,786 --> 00:28:28,497
You'll see the charge
for the valet in there.

465
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:32,251
He does shower after
in an unattended locker room.

466
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:34,462
It's another opportunity.
You see where I'm headed with this?

467
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:35,880
I didn't put in all the details

468
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:38,466
because then I would have
to charge you for the time
it took to explain them.

469
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,059
Story of my life.
What's that?

470
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,938
Missed opportunities.

471
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,150
One thing I couldn't figure out.

472
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,407
Married mother of four,
Junior League, PTA,

473
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,412
winner of the state fair
mini muffin baking competition
three years running.

474
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:09,872
You dig deep.

475
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,460
So how's a lady like you
get involved with a guy like that?

476
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:23,761
I was just bored.

477
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,979
Tomorrow at noon,
I'll text you the address.

478
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,273
Let me get that for you.

479
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,649
WOMAN: Thank you.

480
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,609
JAMES: I am gonna replace this thing.

481
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,451
Oh, my Lord!

482
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,663
I didn't know what you guys like, So...

483
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:54,208
I've never had crepes.

484
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,043
I did a bit of everything.

485
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,881
Mmm.

486
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:03,926
So you sleep okay?

487
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,845
Harry's bed's a little tight.

488
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,682
That comforter is like,
sleeping on a cloud.

489
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:11,267
Right? His grandma gave it to him.

490
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,311
Aw.

491
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,397
You guys are so lucky.

492
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:26,866
So I made some sandwiches
for the road, and we can
pack up some treats.

493
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:27,950
You are amazing.

494
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:30,453
If there's anything
we can do, don't hesitate.

495
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,126
How about a car?

496
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:40,212
Pardon?

497
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:42,882
Carl's too proud to ask...

498
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,263
I Know it seems like we're doing okay,

499
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:53,017
but I promise you, the struggle is real
everywhere.

500
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,188
Is it?

501
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:02,818
We work triple shifts
and juggle bills, max out credit cards.

502
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,447
Your daughter is sleeping safe
in her bed.

503
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:15,956
Ooh, is the duchess coming to breakfast?

504
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:19,377
'Cause this can't be for us.
Is it?

505
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,004
Honey, that is just
the kind of people they are.

506
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,132
Well, it's like having
our own restaurant.

507
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,511
JENNY: Look at that.
I think it's fresh squeezed.

508
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,224
What is this?

509
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,475
It's Naked and Afraid, dog.

510
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,605
You should be studying.
Look, this girl just ate part
of a dead monkey.

511
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,818
Why are your books in the trash?

512
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,780
I think it's a foot or a thigh
or something, but now
she can't stop pooping.

513
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,073
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

514
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:50,783
They were just about to airlift her out.

515
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,118
You have a test.

516
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,286
Can you relax?
It got called off.

517
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,371
By who?

518
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,415
Me.
Why?

519
00:31:57,706 --> 00:31:59,208
Because I'm just not ready.

520
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,210
You've been studying for months.

521
00:32:01,877 --> 00:32:03,671
Look, it's my life, okay?

522
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:06,882
Fine.

523
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,176
Great.

524
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,888
If you're done, so am I.

525
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:15,433
Well, well, what does that mean?

526
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,725
I'm not ready either.

527
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,187
Hey, hey.

528
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,150
What... dah-dah-dah...
Do not.

529
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,026
Lord of the Flies essay is in here.

530
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:27,528
Didn't you back it up?

531
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:29,280
Handwritten.
No.

532
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:32,616
Biology book.
No more boring homework
about chloroplasts.

533
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,160
That is like half your grade.

534
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,287
Who needs it? I'll just work
at the mini mart.

535
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,164
That is not happening.

536
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,291
Why not?
Good enough for you.

537
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:51,635

539
00:32:57,516 --> 00:32:59,518
A dream in disguise

540
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,062
You know we can have it

541
00:33:03,355 --> 00:33:07,651
Well, I know we can do it
You know we can do it too...

542
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,154
How many Supreme Court
justices are there?

543
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:11,405
Eleven.

544
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,740
But there's work to be done now

545
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,492
Work to be done

546
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,538
Who was the first president
of the United States?

547
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,707
Washington.
Yeah. Whoo!

548
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,460
Give it a chance

549
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:26,587
Who authored
the Emancipation Proclamation?

550
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,671
Gotta be Lincoln.

551
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,215
Yes.
Yeah.

552
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,512
It's coming to life Little by little

553
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,596
Sixty three.

554
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,014
Yeah.

555
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:38,098
Jefferson.

556
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:40,809
Yeah. The Magna Carta.

557
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,603
Yeah.

558
00:33:45,397 --> 00:33:47,525
But there's work to be done now

559
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,151
Work to be done

560
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,028
You've got to

561
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,086
You've got to put one foot
in front of the other

562
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:12,716
Put your other foot down Down, down, down

JAMES: You're early.

564
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,470
I can come back later.

565
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,055
Don't be silly.

566
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,099
Good quality in a person.

567
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:23,978
What are we doing here?

568
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:27,356
You know the hardest part of what I do?

569
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:33,612
Doing a job without anyone
knowing you did a job.

570
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:38,075
Take JFK for instance...

571
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:41,078
The grassy knoll, book depository.

572
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:45,833
So many theories, so much confusion about
where the bullet originated.

573
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,085
Perfect hit.

574
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:50,462
Have a look.

575
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:04,893
JAMES: What do you see?

576
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:10,190
A Greek deli, a donut shop,
cell phone store.

577
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,900
I don't know.
What am I looking at?

578
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:15,446
Confusion.
Do you have the time?

579
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,785
It's 12:00.

580
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,996
Perfect.

581
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,080
Take another look.

582
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,605
Say when.

583

Anytime you're ready.

585
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:10,542
Why is it up to me?

586
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,586
You hired me to do a job.

587
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,797
Yeah, so you do it.

588
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,551
This way, I'm assured no regrets.

589
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,096
So what's it gonna be?

590
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:26,600
Every time I close my eyes

591
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:30,979
Something small within me dies

592
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,067
Can't say if it's dark or bright

593
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,987
But it's all I've ever known

594
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:43,534
And when !I sleep I sleep alone

595
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:46,745
Do it.

596
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:48,872
Now?

597
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,129
Now.

You're ready.

600
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:26,410
What?
Gonna put you back in the schedule.

601
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:31,957
Thank you.

602
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:35,294
Why did you change your mind?

603
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:38,797
We're alike.

604
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,258
You and I.

605
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,427
I don't know about that.

606
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:47,723
I was... just bored, too.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

608
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,023
Took you long enough.

00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,608
Where is she?

610
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,778
Well, couple of options here.

611
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,362
You keep taking it until you pass,

612
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:05,407
or move to West Virginia
and work the coal mines.

613
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,577
If you bring your own helmet,
I hear they hire you on the spot.

614
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,417
They said I tested
on the high end for a sixth-grader.

615
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:17,377
At least it was on the high end.

616
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:19,379
You can go now.

617
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:22,174
Right. Get up.

618
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,301
Pass.
You're coming with me.

619
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,261
Where?

620
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,722
A field trip.

621
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,350
Just 'cause I'm British
doesn't mean I play darts.

622
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,561
Are you sure?
Or cricket or rowing or rugby or...

623
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,814
Oh, oh, of course not because
you don't have any time

624
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,398
'cause you're always out on a fox hunt.

625
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,192
I don't go on fox hunts!
(LAUGHS)

626

Are you really?
Yeah.

Ah, I wish I had
a good therapist to give you.

00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,661
Outrageous. How dare you?
How dare you?

630
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,663
You walked right into it.
Yeah, I know.

I Know.

634
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:04,591
I really, really tried.

635
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,426
That's how you know you're not dumb.

636
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,304
That makes no sense at all.

637
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,557
I hoped you were too dumb
to realize that.

(LAUGHS) Shut up!

639
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,773
I mean, I wasted so much time studying.

640
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,942
Yeah, I mean, not that much.
You did fail.

641
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,822
Like, I Know that a logarithm
is an exponent,

642
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,075
and I know the difference
between a trope and a bromide,

643
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:31,952
and all the republics of Russia.

644
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:36,331
And for what?
Well, if you can spell
Chechnya, that drink's on me.

645
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,751
I thought it already was.
No stalling.

646
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:43,255
Okay. It's no problem.

in any language. (LAUGHS)

00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,426

I'm just browsing.

keep in mind none of this is to scale.

Well, not one she can afford.
