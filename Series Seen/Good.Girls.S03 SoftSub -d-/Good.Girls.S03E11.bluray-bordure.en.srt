Where's it all going, Elizabeth?

24
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,177

DEAN: So, we took
monthly sales plus the equity
left in the franchise,

78
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,384
we netted out the SG&A costs,

79

Why would I be looking to sell?

85
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,238
Because my husband's looking to buy.

86
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:44,950
Maybe he should look somewhere else.

87
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,369
Why is that?

You didn't.

89
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,296
Two ways we can handle this.

90
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,469
One, you bow out discreetly
and spend a little time with your family.

91
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,059
What's the other?

92
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,896
Pretty much exactly the same.

93
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,398
Only we would be less discreet

94
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,109
and your family would just hate you
for the rest of your life.

are they gonna give

this thing is his, okay?

118
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,782
Again, so he can feel like a man.

119
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,454
But, eventually, he'll have
to come to me for the money.

121
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,583

And she's kind of crazy,

540
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,309
which could go either way
in the sack and...

541
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:00,769
You know, overall,

542
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,147
it seems,

543
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,233
you know, worth the gamble.

544
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,359
So, you would have.

545
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:15,409
Probably.

546
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,254
(SIGHS)
Thanks for being honest.

547
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:08,587
Where's the chief?

548
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:10,881
Art class.

549
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:13,008
Really?

550
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,093
Yeah.

551
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:16,387
You know, pencils and chalk and whatnot.

552
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:18,847
And then he's going to aerobics.

553
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,725
Is that good enough for you?

554
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,062
Where the hell is his cut?

555
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:35,239
It was my son's diaper bag.
Just bring it back next time.

556
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,325
Hey.

557
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,537
I need another favor.

558
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:43,664
(CHUCKLES)
Are you serious?

559
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,417
I'm obviously good for it.

560
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,336
I have to add it to your tab?

561
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,421
Yeah, fine.

562
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:52,464
What do you want?

563
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,384
When you took my furniture...

564
00:34:56,176 --> 00:34:57,428
I didn't take nothing.

565
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,264
How did you do it?

566
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,326
GAYLE: They don't know who it was.

567
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:22,953
They completely took everything.

568
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,916
I'll call you back.

569
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,378
Oh, my God, what happened?

570
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,839
What do you want?

571
00:35:33,922 --> 00:35:36,216
Well, I wanted to buy
a hot tub place. But...

572
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,428
this place doesn't have any hot tubs.

573
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,138
So...

574
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,060
(SCOFFS, CHUCKLES) Wow. Um...

575
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:50,981
Not what I was expecting, you know.

576
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:53,067
Uh...

577
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,237
I mean...

578
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,824
how's that?

579
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,454
We already agreed on a number.

580
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:07,915
Well, yeah, but...

581
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,001
that doesn't seem fair.
I mean, why would I

582
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,253
pay that much when it's
just an empty showroom?

583
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,175
I mean, if you're not interested...

584
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,137
Sea lions, huh?

585
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,724
Oh, yeah, it's a whole
marine life series.

586
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,659

587
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,119
BOTH: Let's go!

588
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:47,329
Hey.

589
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:49,289
Those aren't church clothes.

590
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,542
We're not going to church.
Oh. You're not?

591
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,544
Says who? Jesus?

592
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:54,712
Daddy.

593
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,714
He says we're going go-karting.

594
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,340
Oh, yeah, they got so good on your Jazzy

595
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,426
I figured it was time
to take it up a notch. Shoes.

596
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,052
(KIDS SQUEAL, LAUGHING)
Shoes!

597
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,595
Put on your shoes!

598
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,727
They have Sunday school.

599
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,812
And the rest of their life to be good.

600
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:18,652
Where's all that going?

601
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,070
I'm giving back.

602
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:23,699
To who?

603
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,409
People who deserve it.

604
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:40,048
Last chance.

605
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,178
You were right.

606
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,262
Oh, I know.

607
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,932
I don't know where we're going.

608
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,851
I just want to go there together.

609
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,116
It's like a star.

610
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,297
Jackets, bathroom, car!

611
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:23,258
Let's burn some rubber.

612
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,849
You already tried
to return it, didn't you?

613
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,768
Oh, yeah. They were gonna hose me good.

614
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,024
RIO: Almost up and running, huh?

615
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:41,443
We had an issue with the previous owner.

616
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,403
No, I... I love it.

617
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,282
You do?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

618
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,993
Get away with anything you want
in a place like this.

619
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,498
Well, it'll look even better
when I get the spas back in.

620
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,291
Oh, yeah?

621
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,709
And the barbecue accessories.

622
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,420
Cool. I'll take the deal.

623
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:02,798
Okay.

624
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,675
You want to join me?

625
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,346
I would be happy to have
a sales representative

626
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:10,889
walk you through all the features.

627
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,267
Nah. Those things breed diseases.

628
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:16,478
When does it get to be mine?

629
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,314
When does what get to be yours?

630
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,360
I made all of this happen.

631
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:28,323
Next time, empty the clip.

632
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,162
See you soon, yeah?

633
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:58,395
Classy.

Hey, let your sister have a turn!

636
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:08,614
To being small business owners.

637

Kind of.
Very small.

Oh. Hey.
