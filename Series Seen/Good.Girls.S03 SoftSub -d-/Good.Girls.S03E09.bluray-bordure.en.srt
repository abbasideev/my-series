184
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,966
I might not have what it takes.

185
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,759
Really?

186
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,929
But you've done this kind of job before?

187
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,556
I work mainly with explosives.

188
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,849
Oh. That makes sense.

189
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,060
Car bombs, IEDs, pyrotechnics,

190
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,478
stuff that really, you know...

191
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,189
Leaves a mark.

192
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,316
Bingo.

193
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:47,943
From what Max said about your target,

194
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,112
he's not a guy who's so easy
to get close to.

195
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:54,700
You're gonna need a sniper.

196
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,746
Well, where do we find one of those?

197
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,040
I Know a guy.
Already got him up to speed.

198
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,458
Hold on a minute.

199
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:07,129
Max got you up to speed
so you could get another guy up to speed?

200
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,797
How many speeds are we looking at here?

201
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:10,215
He's who you want.

202
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,592
Who is "he"?

203
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,218
I have no idea.

204
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:14,970
He's that good.

205
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,056
Well, how do we find him?

206
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,391
He finds you.

207
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,977
Okay, we've got a bit of a problem

208
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,729
'cause we're ina time crunch.

209
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:28,317
We provide a service for the target...

210
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:33,739
That we are not
currently able to provide, so...

211
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,408
So we need to...

212
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,956
neutralize our target
before we become his target.

213
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,918
You want it done right, don't you?

214
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:48,962
Thumbs up, or thumbs down?

215
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,632
Thumb...

216
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,300
Thumbs up?

217
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,177
Gonna need to see 'em.

218
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:11,735
Now put them up your asses
'cause this might take a hot minute.

219
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,834
ERIC: And so when the song
came out, I was like,

220
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,921
"Hello, Mr. Smith, I've been saying
'get jiggy wit it' since '91."

221
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,382
And when did it hit the clubs?

222
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,591
'95, earliest.

223
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,219
Guys, I have news.

224
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,429
Just got heads up from corporate.

225
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,099
We're not supposed to know,
so act Super surprised.

226
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,144
But we just won the Crystal Whale

227
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,729
for the Southeastern Michigan division.

228
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,193
Dope.

229
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:59,533
Okay. Great job, everyone.
Let's get back to work.

230
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,043
You got some nerve.

231
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,296
What's your problem now?

232
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:15,340
Every person on that floor
busts their ass for this place.

233
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,427
They go to conferences,
they chase every lead,

234
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,262
they work overtime,
they never see their kids, and for what?

235
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,472
To get dressed up
and watch you collect some award

236
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,225
for co-signing their deals?

237
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,688
I told them to put your name on it.

238
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,106
What?

239
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,067
You have a choice of walnut
or mahogany base.

240
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,698
Mahogany ages better.

241
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:43,619
Why me?

242
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,497
Your first month here,
you got higher sales
than Eric had in eight years.

243
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,500
Thanks.

244
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,919
You earned it.

245
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,466
Oh, would you tell the team
that they're allowed

246
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,594
to have fun at the show?
I'm not a total monster.

247
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,888
Why don't you just tell them yourself?

248
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,099
I'm gonna skip this year.

249
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,393
Use my ticket for your wife.

250
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,199
I like Circus Peanut.

251
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,451
It's too bright.

252
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,495
Yeah, Island Mango's closer.

253
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,164
The hue's off.

254
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,375
Well, can't you just do a combo thing?

255
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,300
I am not McDonald's.
I don't just do combos.

256
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,511
It took months to get this thing legit.

257
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,846
(SIGHS) Check your phone.

258
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,931
I just did.

259
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:47,266
Did you check Facebook?

260
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,976
'Cause a hitman's gonna friend-request me?

261
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,937
Oh, like you're so versed
in how they communicate.
(SCOFFS)

262
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,772
It doesn't have to be perfect.

263
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,524
It just has to be
good enough to buy us some time.

264
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,026
ANNIE: Yeah, come on, girl. Beast mode.
BETH: You got this.

265
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,405
One part Peach En Fuego,
one part Tang Bang,

266
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:05,575
a few drops of Prairie Fire...

267
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,912
and a smidge of Oh, My Darlin' Clementine.

268
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,331
ANNIE: Fire up the press.

269
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,843
Why don't we talk about...
No.

270
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,928
You don't even know what I'm gonna Say.

271
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,640
One question, then we move on.

272
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,350
Great.
Fine.

273
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,185
Now?
Shoot.

274
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:36,440
Why her?

275
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,818
We're compatible.

276
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,779
The woman dehydrates fruit.

277
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:43,947
My favorite.

278
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,491
She loves Pilates.
So do I.

279
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,410
No man loves that.

280
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,248
Well, that's how
relationships work, Annie,
at least healthy ones.

281
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,708
Hot.

282
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,295
Say there's 100 things
about a person you could like.

283
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,922
Connect to anything over 50,
and it will last.

284
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,133
Whew. Scorching hot.

285
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:06,219
It's not a bad thing
for partnerships to make sense on paper.

286
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,349
I guess I just don't really believe
in lists.

287
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,978
Taking inventory
of a relationship helps you
realize what matters.

288
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:19,441
Ah. Like Pilates and dried fruit.

289
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,403
Those are just two, but yeah.

290
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,863
Gotcha, boss.

291
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,077
That's enough for today.

292
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:32,788
I still have three minutes left.

293
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,872
I'll credit your account.

294
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,543
Look, all I'm saying
is that I'd rather not

295
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,754
have to crunch numbers to find my mate.

296
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,172
How's that gone for you?

297
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:50,806
That is enough for today.

298
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,985
Oh, by the way, Mrs. Karpinski said
she may have a futon for us.

299
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,198
We would be sitting on a giant litterbox
with all those cats.

300
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:12,452
Oh, and I won the Crystal Whale.

301
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:16,998
Really?

302
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:20,794
You are looking
at the Southeastern Michigan
regional hot tub king.

303
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,964
Spa.
Spa.

304
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,549
Spa king.

305
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,677
Will you come?

306
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,886
Of course.

307
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,055
Will you wear that dress?

308
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,724
What dress?

309
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,020
The one you wore for him.

310
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,898
(PHONE VIBRATING)

311
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:58,999
What's that?

312
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,003
Money.

313
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:04,588
No.

314
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,965
It's not.

315
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,842
Yeah, it is.

316
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,343
Not money I could use.

317
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,932
Oh, we had to change the formula.

318
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,142
Change it back.

319
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,105
It's not possible.

320
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:32,199
Yo, I been thinking about this, um,

321
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,744
relationship of ours.

322
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,456
Lot of issues, you and me.

323
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,961
I don't disagree.

324
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,715
Cut you in.
That didn't work.

325
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,801
Gun to your head.
Nothing.

326
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:57,224
I don't know how to
incentivize you anymore.

327
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,726
So...

328
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:11,238
Open it.

329
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,376
I don't get it.

330
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,169
(LAUGHS) Take it out.

331
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,965
I don't want to.

332
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,424
We got another job for you.

333
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,762
Well, whatever it is,
I don't want to do it.

334
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:39,140
Oh. (LAUGHS)

335
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,850
(BOTH LAUGH)

336
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,896
Take it out, Elizabeth.

337
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:58,827
Maybe you're right.

338
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,621
I'm the problem.

339
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,626
Well, go ahead and finish me off.

340
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,962
If you want to.

341
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:31,943
We're good.

342
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:36,281
Cool.

343
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,332
That's what he used
to take care of your friend, by the way.

344
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,210
Why?

345
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,256
Incentive.

346
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,222
Why did I touch it?

347
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,766
RUBY: Why did you touch it?

348
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,852
What was I supposed to do?

349
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,562
Not touch it.

350
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,190
RUBY: Some hood-ass man gives you
a questionable envelope?

351
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:12,734
BETH: Okay, for starters,
you guys weren't there,

352
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,611
and the atmosphere was very threatening.

353
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,071
You don't open it.

354
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,823
Okay, I'm, like, so used to that man

355
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,117
just handing me guns that I, like,
I don't even think about it.

356
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,744
God, he's good.

357
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,954
I need you to stop that.
It's making me crazy.

358
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,958
It's how I think now.

359
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,044
(ENGINE STARTS)

360
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,259
He's not getting a good batch without
my Creamsicle Sunset.

361

Dolly Parton famously takes
one bite of each food group.

541
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,704
It's how she's kept her figure.

542
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:32,913
Oh?

543
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:36,292
All right. (CLEARS THROAT)
Shall we look at our calendars?

544
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,753
Can...

545
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,092
I'm kind of new to this.

546
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,471
I don't get a lot of repeat customers.

547
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,014
(LAUGHS)

548
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:51,390
Um...

549
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,143
how does this work?

550
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,649
Say I'm your lawyer.

551
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:06,489
I usually do a fair amount
of prep work before
we would go to... trial.

552
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:08,991
So I charge by the hour.

553
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,078
Research and discovery is billed at 700.

554
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,914
The defendant, is he local?

555
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:19,377
Okay, so travel is not an issue.

556
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,089
All other expenses
are on top of the retainer.

557
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:25,508
Trial itself will run you 60 grand.

558
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:28,594
We were told 30.

559
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,181
By a man with no arms,
who you're free to hire.

560
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,518
I only brought 30.

561
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:38,354
You'll receive invoices as we go.

562
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:42,066
So how is...

563
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,862
Tuesday at 3:45?

564
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,155
Is that too soon?

565
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,534
No, sooner's better.

566
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:54,703
Oh, no, scrap that.
I'll be in Ohio.
Any chance he's in Ohio?

567
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,375
All right, the next available slot

568
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,627
that I have is...

569
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:04,004
Mmm.

570
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,006
Oh.

571
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,343
Friday. Morning.

572
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,099
That works.

573
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:18,686
Done.

574
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,653
Thank you, Mrs. Boland.

575
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:03,105
Hey.

576
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,486
How'd it go?

577
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,906
Oh, it was...
it was pretty great.

578
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:14,825
You okay?

579
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:16,827
Yeah, I'm fine.

580
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:19,413
What are doing here?

581
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,667
Following up on some emails.

582
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:25,711
Why don't you go home?

583
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,841
I really don't have much
to go home to, Dean.

584
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,347
My husband has three TVs in his office.

585
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,767
Each one has a different
sporting event on at all times.

586
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,271
My daughter practically lives
with her friend.

587
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:45,981
And...

588
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,068
my Labradoodle only eats

589
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:51,946
if my husband fills the bowl, so...

590
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:53,864
Oh.

591
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,910
I thought I'd put this on your shelf.

592
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,954
Oh, you don't have to do that.

593
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:07,628
Oh, it looks good.

594
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,465
You went with the walnut, huh?

595
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,681
I don't...

596
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,767
I don't think you're...

597
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,728
you know, a monster.

598
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,888
What now?

599
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:05,519
I have a Surprise for you.

600
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:06,645
I'm scared.

601
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,771
I did my homework.

602
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,315
That is a Surprise.

603
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,151
Yeah, well, Gregg came over.

604
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,527
Oh, okay.

605
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:15,237
And we started making that list.

606
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,322
Oh. How'd it go?

607
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,449
It was revelatory.

608
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:20,284
All ears.

609
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:21,577
You see...

610
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,205
every time that we had
something in common,

611
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:28,334
I just wanted to rip
his pants off, you know?

612
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,836
Like, for example,
we both like making sandwiches

613
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:33,172
out of Pop Tarts,
but that didn't even make it

614
00:35:33,255 --> 00:35:35,591
on the list because we Started kissing.

615
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,010
And not just like a little peck.

616
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:42,598
Like, full on, with tongue, making out.

617
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,016
That kind of thing.
Mmm-hmm.

618
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,102
Oh, and we both like naps.

619
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,272
Well, who doesn't?
Mmm-hmm.

620
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,232
But see, of course, that doesn't make it

621
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:56,695
on the list, either, because by now,
we're in each other's pants.

622
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,322
And, you know, when I say pants,

623
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:01,992
I mean, like, we're deep
inside the underwear.

624
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:06,914
And, uh, you know,
we're both just so crazy turned on

625
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:08,666
that we don't even make it
to the bedroom.

626
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,418
So we're on the couch,
and he kind of, like,

627
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,128
kind of flips me up on top of him,

628
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,881
you know, in kind of
a Cirque du Soleil type...

629
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:17,633
Okay, I get it, Annie.

630
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,094
You know how it is when you're just So...

631
00:36:21,261 --> 00:36:23,889
you're so in sync with someone
that it kind of feels like

632
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:26,100
an old song you know all the words to?

633
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:30,646
Every instrument, every note,

634
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,816
every beat, the rhythm,

635
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:39,405
and the tempo, you know,
it just takes you over until...

636
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,614
Okay, yeah.

637
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,866
And all of a sudden,
you're not even human anymore.

638
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,119
You're just an animal.

639
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:47,996
Just made out of nerve endings

640
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,252
and feelings in that hot, aching need...

641
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:54,670
All right.

642
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,844
So I guess what I learned is that

643
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:03,721
there could be 99 things on that list,

644
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,182
but, to me, only one matters.

645
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,226
And what's that?

646
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,563
Spark.

647
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:18,318
But I'm...

648
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,946
but I'm sure you must have that, right?

649
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,619
Thank you for your honesty.

650
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,665
Thank you for your advice.

651
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,678
Nail salon robbed, right?
Super ritzy suburb.
Guess what they took.

652
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,305
Not that coat.

653
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,599
How's DL Dave's mood?

654
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,808
Not good.

655
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,101
Think he'll give me the go-ahead?

656
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,145
He's still pissed about the recall.

657
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,314
It's like bin Laden, right?

658
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,443
If nail polish was a weapon
of mass destruction, sure.

659
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,613
No one believed the analysts
when they said follow the courier.

660
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,865
The CIA didn't listen to them for years.

661
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:08,076
Thought they were useless.
Basement trash.

662
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,495
You know, 'cause they worked
in the basement.

663
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,498
But they sift through the evidence,
they track every lead,

664
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,167
and they end up being the ones
who cracked the case.

665
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:16,668
They found him.

666
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:20,672
Not the Pakistani ops.
Not the fancy drones.

667
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,549
The basement trash.

668
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,551
That's definitely trash.

669
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,928
Hey, it's new.

670
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:27,179
It's a parade float.

671
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:30,516
I'm going in.
Okay, take that off.

672
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:33,560
It's offensive.
Tell him I ran the analytics.

673
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:35,103
Did you?

674
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,814
I will by the time
he's done yelling at you.

675
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,817
Don't cry.
Save it for the bathroom.

676
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,360
And don't compare this to bin Laden.

677
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,862
You know this bitch
is hiding in a cave somewhere.

678
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:44,988
Do not.

679
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,615
Just gotta root her out.

680
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:53,121
(DOOR OPENS)

681
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:57,376
Here's a question.

682
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,380
Are there actual truffles in truffle oil?

683
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,843
Because one shaving of truffles is like
a gazillion dollars.

684
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,512
And, like, a bottle's ten bucks.

685
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:11,139
I quit my job today.

686
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,392
Why?

687
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:20,148
(CLEARS THROAT)

688
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:21,942
Um...

689
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:25,195
I kissed my boss.

690
00:39:58,353 --> 00:39:59,354
Why?

691
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,233
She kissed me.

692
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,278
Okay.

693
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:10,616
So I kissed her back.

694
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:12,868
And then what?

695
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:18,790
She tried to undo my pants,
and I stopped her.

696
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:21,376
Why?

697
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:24,671
'Cause the tux have that
weird double button, and sol...

698
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:26,340
Why did you stop her?

699
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,014
Because I don't want her.

700
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,685
I want you.

701
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,690
But I don't really
have the best track record,
(CLEARS THROAT)

702
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,859
So I don't expect you to believe me.

703
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,990
And if you need me to go to my mom's,
just you say the word.

704
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:56,244
But I really...

705
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:01,291
Beth, I really want to stay.

706
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,351
Dean.

707
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,063
Yeah.

708
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:30,779
Don't go.

709
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:40,038
Better not be my baby girl
roaming these halls at midnight.

710
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:41,790
RUBY: Better be sleepwalking.

711
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:45,585
I figured out who we should help.

712
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,548
This family,

713
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,092
their kid was killed by a drunk driver.

714
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:57,014
That's awful.

715
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,852
Dad lost his job, bank took their house.

716
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:04,104
How did you find these people?

717
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,524
I got their daughter's kidney.

718
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,885
How you feeling, champ?
