from the evidence locker?

I failed. It's over.

00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,804
I tried to seduce my therapist.
He straight-up rejected me.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,972
You've missed two sessions.

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,016
There's no point, okay?
I made it weird.

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:20,019
If you don't come back,
I've got to fill your spot.

8
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,730
There's been a bit of a snafu.

9
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:25,233
You don't say.
What if I made it up to you?

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,817
Not him, but you?

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,110
It'd be a huge order.

12
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:31,822
You would draw it?
We make an engraver's plate
and print it all on-site.

Cool.

14

He won't.

Why did you take all this?

28
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,266
I couldn't leave it there.

Why not?
Her phone was ringing.

00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,270

something horrible happened.

Something horrible did happen.

32

And we just stood there and watched.

33
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,447
I didn't watch.

34
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:58,409
Honestly, neither did I.

35
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,411
I did.

that was in her fridge

75

or, like, her laundry
that was in the dryer.

76
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,347
I mean, does someone fold that now,

in a trash bag out on the curb?

00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,308
Oh, that's good.
I mean, it's, like,

182
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,352
he's been smothering me
and loving me too hard

183
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,646
and maybe I wanna buy
my own tampons for a change.

184
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,648
Hey, hold up.
He's buying you tampons now?

185
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,816
Not me. Lucy.

186
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,653
She's gonna dump his ass
so he calls off the cops
before they go all CS/.

187
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,530
It's Kinda harsh.

188
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,865
Yeah, better than kinda dead.

189
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:43,368
I'm sorry, why did you think
we were trying to break into the phone?

190
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,330
For everything you guys just said,

191
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,832
just I thought we were gonna
slide into his DMs.

192
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,084
Oh, hello!

193
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,753
What's the boyfriend's birthday?

194
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,588
How would I know that?

195
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,131
Don't you wanna ask the bird?

196
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,176
Okay. I'm just trying to be a team player
and get into that phone.

197
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,136
Okay, well, there's
a million possibilities,

198
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,471
and we're never gonna guess it.

199
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,060
It's the new one.

200
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,229
So?

201
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,606
What?

202
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,901
There's another way to get in.

203
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,831
You want some?

204
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,375
I'm good.

205
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:33,961
Can I get some more bronco sauce?

206
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,045
Yeah, one sec.

207
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,843
So...

208
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,599
Can you get it?

209
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,146
She's not in one piece.

210
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,153
I don't need all of her.

211
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,033
What do you need?

212
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:11,665
I just need her face.

213
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,751
WAITER:
Bronco sauce.

214
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,091
You still owe me for the last favor.

215
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,676
I expected you would bring that up,

216
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,179
so I thought I would triple
your invitation order.

217
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,308
(CHUCKLES)
How you gonna do that?

218
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,227
You can't even make your regular delivery.

219
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,478
Exactly.

220
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,272
It's a vicious cycle, don't you see?

221
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,941
I can't help you if you don't help me.

222
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,362
Or...

223
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,698
Or?

224
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:47,200
You can give me something I Know you got.

225
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,707
It's been on my mind for a while now.

226
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,795
What's that?

227
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,174
(LAUGHS) Your husband won't like it.

228
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,344
I have herpes.

229
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,310
I want a hot tub.

230
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,358
Oh.

231
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:23,570
You say your prayers?

232
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,238
In my head!

233
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,740
That works.

234
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,995
(BEEPING)

235
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,539
What is that, sir?

236
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,376
Nothing.
That better not be my phone.

237
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,338
I've been to hell and back
looking for that thing.
Give it to me.

238
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,256
One more game!

239
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,676
Better give me that phone
before I "one more game" you.

240
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:47,928
Go to sleep.

241
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,647
Good night.
Mm, how's this gonna work?

242
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:01,900
How's what gonna work?

243
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,070
How's Daddy supposed to be a cop again?

244
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,406
What do you mean?

245
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,201
He'll have to arrest you.

246
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,787
I mean, right?

247
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,622
Like, at some point.

248
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,293
Don't forget to floss.

249
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,475
Hey, do you have a second?

250
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,769
He won't eat.
Since when?

251
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,813
The kids said he stopped singing.

252
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,356
Come on, Dorito.
Come on, lick it.

253
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,316
Come here, lick it.
Lick it for Dada.

254
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,985
How long does it take to get a hot tub?

255
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:51,700
Um, um, depends on the model
and the upgrades?

256
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,910
Is there, like, a floor model you could
get right away?

257
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,454
He's just not himself.

258
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,289
What if he is sick?

259
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:00,834
I need your help.

260
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,461
I can't watch another thing die.

261
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,545
Dean.

262
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,006
Neither can I.

263
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,469
How many does this one hold?

264
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:16,683
Um, that particular brand
has four contoured lounge seats.

265
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,352
But how many people can you fit?

266
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:22,856
I guess that would depend on you.

267
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,483
Okay.

268
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,445
Yeah, I'm also gonna need
that laser filtration.

269
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,491
Ooh, that's a much bigger
price point. (CHUCKLES)

270
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:39,581
Is that a problem?

271
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,048
Welcome to the Four Star family.

272
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,927
Whoo! All right.

273
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,929
Let's do this.

274
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,598
Well, I...
I just have to transmit this.

275
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,225
It's gonna just take me a...

276
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,143
(CHUCKLES) Not this.

277
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,188
That.

278
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,398
Now?

279
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,368
RUBY: Uh-oh.

280
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,911
What?

281
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,374
Too dark, too quiet,
too perfect a place to kill some suckers.

282
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,292
Man, why you gotta put that in my head?

283
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,295
Because unfortunately,
I have been in way too many
of these situations,

284
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,797
and now I know what to look for.

285
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:34,177
Following a murderer
two hours through cornfields
in the middle of the night?

286
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,262
Cool it.

287
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,479
I'm sorry, what more did you need to see?

288
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,984
Just that. Drive.

289
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,027
He's not gonna kill us.

290
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,155
He knows Dean's not putting in the order
till we get back.

291
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,618
You should've seen his face.

292
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,831
He really wants a hot tub.

293
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:14,301
Which one is it?

294
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,473
I didn't bury her.

295
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,700
How many fresh ones left?

296
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,661
Two more.
Okay.

297
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,330
I can't do another one.

298
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,373
This is the one.
I can feel it.

299
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,212
Hey. We need the light.

300
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,966
Sorry. We've got that
review thing tomorrow.

301
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,426
Stan doesn't Know what to wear.

302
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,928
What are you gonna say?
I don't Know. Suit?

303
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,307
I mean, to the police review
people or whatever.

304
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,601
He's wanted to be a cop
since third grade.

305
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:07,604
He'd still be one if it wasn't for me.

306
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:09,814
So you go in there and you make it right.

307
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,609
What happens the next time
he has to cover for my criminal ass?

308
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,111
It'll be more than probation.

309
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,530
Well, maybe there won't be a next time.

310
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,532
We're digging up the body of a girl

311
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,036
who would still be singing to her bird
if she hadn't met us.

312
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,830
There'll be a next time.

313
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,833
(SIGHS)
He doesn't wanna wear a Suit.

314
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,216
You know he can't be a cop again.
You know that, right?

315
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,344
What am I gonna do?

316
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,472
Yo. Give me some more light.

317
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,820
They're hers.
Ugh. Ugh, ugh, ugh. Oh.

318
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,663
We're gonna have to uncover her face.

319
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,118
Give me a wet wipe.

320
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:53,793
(COUGHS)

321
00:20:58,798 --> 00:20:59,841
Give me another one.

322
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:14,230
Give me her phone.

323
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,328
We're in.

324
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,038
Oh, God.

325
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,586
(SIGHS)

326
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,757
I'm gonna tell Stan to wear
a sweater and khakis.

327
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,968
Always classy.

328
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,939
DEAN: It's a tumor.

329
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,237
What?
Stage four.

330
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,655
What are you talking about?

331
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:05,615
He's got a hard, hot lump

332
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,492
right where he poops, you can feel it.

333
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,118
I'm not doing that.

334
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,747
Wing MD says it could be a feather cyst,

335
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,375
but the Beak Brothers,
they have this YouTube channel...

336
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,461
Why don't we make
an appointment with a vet
instead of YouTube?

337
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,922
There's only, like,
one avian guy in all of Detroit.

338
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:22,173
Make an appointment.

339
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,425
Just gonna say chemo.

340
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:27,971
It's probably a lot more
expensive than human chemo.

341
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,723
(CHITTERS)

342
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:33,643
Little guy's a goner.

343
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:36,980
What did you say?

344
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,941
He's toast.
Dunzo. It's over.

345
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,317
That's not gonna happen.

346
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,862
It's like we're built
on an Indian burial ground or something.

347
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,738
Look at me.
I'm officially cursed.

348
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,199
Dean.
What?

349
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:49,492
I will get the money.

350
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,202
(SCOFFS) How?

351
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:55,415
If I have to rob every bank in the city,
I will do it.

352
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,917
This bird is gonna make it.

353
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:00,211
Oh, okay.

354
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,921
Dorito can't die.

355
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,298
I'll make an appointment.

356
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,382
Thank you.

357
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:12,932
It's okay.

358

00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,526
I read that the human body
starts decomposing
within a matter of minutes.

362
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:30,658
Like, one second you're this grape,
all juicy and plump.

363
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,538
And the next, you're just
a shriveled-up raisin.

364
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,415
Mm-hmm.

365
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,168
I can't get away from it.

367
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:47,342
Who?
The face you keep seeing.

368
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,803
She's dead.

369
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,472
She ever talk to you?

if that's what you're...

I don't think you're talking
to dead people, Annie.

Yeah, they do.
Flour or corn?

392
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,244
They do not.
They do bowls, too, with rice.

393

Give me the SIM card.

Why?
So I can smash it.

it is either him or the cops!

the worst idea

He couldn't commit a crime
if his life depended on it.

And if you knew him,

498

you wouldn't question his moral fitness.

00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,108
I'm listening.

538
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:14,069
"Sense of humor."
Love.

539
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:15,904
"Feel like he cares."

540
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,574
"Great with difficult personalities."

541
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,242
Okay. Hit me.

543

546
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,544
No.
You don't mind, right?

547
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,843
Just, uh...
Just a moment, Tim.

I wanna come back.
Window's closed.

550
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,272
But I've seen, like,
every therapist in Detroit.

551
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,398
That can't be true.

552
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,858
Fine. Two.

553
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,863
There are others.
I can refer you.
You can waste their time.

555
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:00,616
What is wrong with you?

556
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:02,242
You quit me.

557
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,036
Yeah, and now I'm trying to un-quit you.

558
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,245
Already gave away your session.

559
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:07,164
You're the worst.
Excuse me?

560
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:08,374
How are you not gonna help someone

561
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,500
who is standing in front of you

562
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,043
literally begging for your help?

563
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,378
Oh, now you want help?

564
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,129
It's, like, against your oath
or whatever.

565
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,507
You sit on that beanbag making jokes,

566
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,759
while real people come in here...
Children.

567
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,928
And do the work 'cause they wanna
get better.

568
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,805
I want to get better.

569
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:25,391
You hijack appointments,
and you get off on making a scene.

570
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:28,560
You only want attention.

571
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,731
I'm just scared.

572
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,532
Of what?

573
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,331
That if I died tomorrow,

574
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:53,669
the only thing that people
would remember about me
is what was in my purse.

575
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,714
What's in it?

576
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,257
Some parking tickets,

577
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:00,759
an old cheese stick,

578
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,095
a single googly eye,

579
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,391
sunglasses case.
I lost the sunglasses.

580
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,852
That's quite an obit.

581
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,562
Right?

582
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,859
Friday at 8:30.

583
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,989
A.m. or p.m.?

584
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:23,407
It's kind of early.

585
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:26,410
I'll make it work.

586
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,835
Why'd you change your mind?

587
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,255
'Cause that was so sad.

588
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,843
Pathetic, really.
Okay.

589
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,887
A real therapist
would probably have you committed.

590
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,097
Well, guess I'm in luck, then.

591
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,900
Better not get any of that fruit gunk
on Daddy's cap.

592
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,152
He said I can keep it.

593
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:08,285
Well, what'd they say?

594
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,204
That they'd be honored
to have me back on the force.

596
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,501
That's a good thing, right?
Yeah.

597
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:20,088
Then I came home, tried on my uniform.

598
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,258
Just didn't feel right.

599
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,761
So I'll let the pants out.
I'll fit it.

600
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:26,845
No, it made me...

601
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,014
It made me feel like a fraud, Ruby.

602
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,101
Can't fix that.

603
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,496

604
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,500
That's me.
I'm Dorito's dad.

605
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,919
Soon to be grandpa.
What?

606
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,630
It's not a tumor.
She's laying an egg.

607
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,382
Wait, what?

608
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:05,801
Got caught in her oviduct.
That's the lump you felt.

609
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:08,887
Dr. Cromwell's gonna aspirate,
but she'll be fine.

610
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,931
Dorito's a girl?

611
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:15,978
Oh, thank you.

612
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,438
Okay, have a good night.
Okay, you, too.

617
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:07,738
I couldn't make as much.

618
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,324
Why's that?

619
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,491
The price of ink went up.

620
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:13,785
Gonna need to see that invoice.

621
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,873
Thought you might.
