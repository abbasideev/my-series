1
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,359
Shit.

2
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,735
Still in Wind Gap.

3
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,793
You be safe...

4
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,086
today.

5
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,937
Camille.

6
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,813
I wanna talk to you.

7
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,740
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

8
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,916
Another time, OK?

9
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,777
- Yeah.
- So ugly.

10
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,910
Hey, sis!

11
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,626
Please don't be mad.

12
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,166
I was just pissed at you
for blowing me off last night.

13
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,547
I wasn't blowing you off.
I was doing my job.

14
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,504
With that hot cop.
I'd totally fuck him.

15
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,306
Shut up, Jodes.

16
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,508
My sister's boyfriend
you're talkin' about.

17
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,344
That's not my boyfriend.

18
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,725
Not yet,
but he likes you.

19
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,852
I can tell.

20
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,185
Please forgive me.

21
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,771
Sometimes when I show off
in front of my friends,

22
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,651
I get carried away.

23
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,200
I don't feel like
fightin' with you.

24
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,244
Wanna see something funny?

25
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,992
This kid at school, J.C.,

26
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,623
came up with a crazy meme.

27
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,918
Hilarious!

28
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,871
Everybody thinks he did it, huh?

29
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,087
- Want some?
- No. Thank you.

30
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,340
OK. Well, if you
change your mind,

31
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,387
we'll be out
behind the stables.

32
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,471
- Camille.
- What?

33
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,053
Don't tell Mama.

34
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,182
Oh, my God!

35
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,693
Is your hand
getting any better, dear?

36
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,990
You know us Crellin women.

37
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,034
Slow healers.

38
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,659
Oh, could you slice those
a tiny bit smaller, please?

39
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,666
Why aren't you ready?

40
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,996
I'm gonna have to ask you
to give my regrets to Jackie.

41
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,548
This cut on my hand
is giving me fits.

42
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,921
It's barely a scratch.

43
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,628
To you, maybe.

44
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,304
Well, I'm sure the ladies

45
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,098
will be disappointed
you're not there.

46
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,551
I'll be giving them
the gift they so enjoy--

47
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,932
the opportunity
to talk about me.

48
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,765
Luckily, I'l have you
there to defend me.

49
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,897
Well, I'm certain that occasion
will not arise.

50
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,275
In Wind Gap,

51
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,983
recyclables go out
on Wednesday.

52
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,554
Jesus Christ.

53
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,859
Make yourself
at home, Detective.

54
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,277
I hope you don't mind.
The door was open.

55
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,526
- What do you want?
- I need to know

56
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,029
why you're following
John Keene.

57
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,735
Who says I'm following
John Keene?

58
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,445
John Keene. I bumped
into him at the store.

59
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,825
He said, "Are you
following me, too?"

60
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,452
- That boy's paranoid.
- Come on.

61
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,533
There's only so many
cop cars in town.

62
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,163
What are you gettin' at?

63
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,498
We need to share information
before another little girl

64
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,004
in this town loses her teeth.

65
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,256
That's what I'm gettin' at.

66
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,964
And I'll go first, since I'm
the visiting team here, okay?

67
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,890
I'm meeting today
with the reporter.

68
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,343
- Who, Preaker girl?
- Yeah.

69
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,643
That woman knows something.

70
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,845
I don't know what it is.

71
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,398
Once she tells me,
I tell you.

72
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,646
How do you know
she'll tell you?

73
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,852
Call it intuition.

74
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,405
Well, in Wind Gap
we call that something else.

75
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,482
So, we have a deal?

76
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,699
What do you got for me?

77
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,538
Keene.

78
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,164
Keene!

79
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,247
I'm letting you go.
I'm letting you go.

80
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,379
- What?
- Take off.

81
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,426
Excuse me, what?

82
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,174
You're done! Go home!

83
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,381
Are you fuckin' serious?
What did I do?

84
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,812
This fuckin' town.

85
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,197
Camille Preaker!

86
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,399
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, honey.

87
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,654
Hi.

88
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,735
She's here.
She's here.

89
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,572
Mwah.

90
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,532
Where is that
mother of yours?

91
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,119
Uh, she is tending to
an injury, I'm afraid.

92
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,877
But she's fine. She just cut
her finger on some rose bushes.

93
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,833
But she really wanted
to be here.

94
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,259
Uh-huh. Well,
that's a crock of shit.

95
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,134
Adora'll be fine.
She's a fighter.

96
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,715
Calhoun Day is comin' up.

97
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,925
It always gets her spirits up.

98
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,011
Calhoun Day.
Is that a good idea?

99
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,223
That's a crime reporter's mind
at work right there.

100
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,150
Every suspect in town
is roamin' around Adora's lawn

101
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,022
with all that young,
fresh meat.

102
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,480
Good Lord, Jackie,
that is so morbid.

103
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,656
It's stupid is what it is.

104
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,531
Excuse me!
Hello! Excuse me.

105
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,329
Can we get some menus
over here, please?

106
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,911
Thank you.

107
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,834
So, Camille,
we're dyin' to know.

108
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,287
Who do you think did it?
We want the inside scoop.

109
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,167
Well, I want to know
what y'all think.

110
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,499
What is the matter
with that girl?

111
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,835
Well, I think
Anne's daddy--

112
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,010
Bob Nash.
He did it.

113
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,259
Now, that man
is a hot mess.

114
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,806
Every time I'm in the store,

115
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,385
all he does is stare
at my titties.

116
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,311
Well, everybody does that.

117
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,889
Maybe you should invest
in a better bra.

118
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,315
Besides, Bob Nash has always
had it in for the Keenes.

119
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,938
We all know why.

120
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,690
Now, that
is just plain gossip.

121
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,613
John Keene
and Julie Wheeler's

122
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,906
little Miss Perfect
cheerleading daughter, Ashley,

123
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,655
doing Lord knows what
in her own backyard.

124
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,488
Well, I want to make him
my boy slave.

125
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,041
I'll bet that boy
killed the Nash girl

126
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,583
and then killed his own sister

127
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,753
to cover up his tracks.

128
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,421
No, I don't-- No.

129
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,374
I don't think that John
killed his sister.

130
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,630
He seems a little sweet.

131
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,586
Too sweet, if you ask me.

132
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,594
- Oh, hush.
- That is one strange family,

133
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,345
and he is the strangest
of them all.

134
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,268
♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪

135
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:18,727
♪ His truth is marching on ♪

136
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,315
♪ His truth
is marching on ♪

137
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,534
Zeke, you cannot go
and fight those Yankees.

138
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,080
Who will defend
our children?

139
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,579
I know you're afraid,
Miss Millie,

140
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,410
evil is about to descend
on Wind Gap.

141
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,165
What must be do,
my brave husband?

142
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,669
You must fight
as I fight.

143
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,922
I must go now, my love.
My men await me.

144
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,215
And so...

145
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,144
Millie Calhoun did what
was unthinkable at the time.

146
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,188
She taught the women
of Wind Gap to shoot.

147
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,515
And she formed

148
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,100
the first female militia

149
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,779
the world had ever seen.

150
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,527
Wah, wah, wah.

151
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,740
Very nice, guys.

152
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,911
Very imaginative.

153
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,705
Let's take a break.

154
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,758
I don't think he liked it.

155
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,714
Shut up, Jodes.
What do you know?

156
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,346
He's a freakin'
weirdo anyway.

157
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,307
Takes one to know one.

158
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,654
Didn't you like
our performance today?

159
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,914
It was entertaining.

160
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,666
There was never an all-female
militia in Wind Gap.

161
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:07,002
How do you know?
You weren't around.

162
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,930
My mama says all of history
was written by men, so...

163
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,098
of course they're gonna
make themselves look good.

164
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,722
History is history, Amma.

165
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,147
You can't change it,
you just learn from it.

166
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,316
That why you're
always so sad?

167
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:28,694
That because you can't
change your history?

168
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,703
Don't be sad,
Mr. Lacey.

169
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,690
Mom. Hey.

170
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,771
Come on, Mama.

171
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,777
Let's get you showered,
get some food in you.

172
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,779
All right? I got you.

173
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,611
Come on, I got you.

174
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,259
Dinner's ready.

175
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,844
Where the hell are you?

176
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,975
On the record?

177
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,811
Yeah.

178
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,647
Huh. What makes you so sure

179
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,027
he's gonna do that?

180
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,074
Because he's ambitious.

181
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,368
Cops like to see
their name in print.

182
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,037
And I look good today.

183
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,115
Yeah, so do I.

184
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,998
Hey, uh, how is it
being back home?

185
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,920
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

186
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,047
Unless it kills you.

187
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,673
Thanks. I needed that.

188
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,050
And I need a new piece.

189
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,507
- You go get it.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,517
Not today, child.
Your mom isn't well.

191
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,448
You know, most first dates
are a dinner and a movie.

192
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,293
I get a tour
of crime scenes.

193
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,869
What does that say about you

194
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,796
that you think
this is a date?

195
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,671
Doesn't say much
about my social life, I guess.

196
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,298
No, it doesn't.

197
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,254
We had a deal,
remember?

198
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,011
You are gonna answer
a question on the record

199
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,469
for every crime scene
I show you.

200
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,018
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's the deal.

201
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,097
That's the deal.
I get it.

202
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,808
All right, so,

203
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,897
crime scene number one.

204
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,233
Two teenage girls,
madly in love,

205
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,445
were found with
their wrists slashed.

206
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,156
One of 'em
left behind a child.

207
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,332
A baby, actually.

208
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,908
Oh, I went to school
with that baby.

209
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,791
Her name was
Faith Murray,

210
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,588
but everybody called her
"Fag" Murray,

211
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,916
like it was hereditary
or something.

212
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,088
- Kind of ironic, considering.
- What?

213
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,640
Well, Faith had sex
with a bunch of boys

214
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,093
to prove that she wasn't
a lesbian like her mother.

215
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,898
But no one ever
found a knife, so...

216
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,397
murder-suicide.

217
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,023
- That's strange.
- Yeah.

218
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,105
What ever happened
to your friend Faith?

219
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,735
She paid for the sins
of a mother

220
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,157
that she had never met.

221
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,952
So, instead of being a lesbian,
she became a slut.

222
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,621
See, in Wind Gap,
every woman gets

223
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,198
a nasty label if
they don't conform

224
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,658
to the rules
of engagement.

225
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,039
What's your label?

226
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,623
No, no. Too many.
Too many to name.

227
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,378
- Oh, come on.
- No.

228
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,583
I can handle it.

229
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,464
That is so
Wind Gap of you.

230
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,887
You know?
You figure out someone's secrets

231
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,339
to use it
against 'em later.

232
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,391
No, that's not my style.

233
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,059
Okay, well, it's
my turn now, okay?

234
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,262
You have to answer
one question on the record.

235
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,814
- So official.
- Thank you.

236
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,266
All right, why'd
you become a cop?

237
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,850
- Really?
- I like to take

238
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,231
my interviewees
off-guard.

239
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,154
You like to suck up
to your interviewees

240
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,730
So you get
more information out of 'em.

241
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:06,194
Gosh, you're so smart.

242
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,029
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a vet,

243
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,457
and I volunteered
at this animal shelter.

244
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,207
I'd see the animals come in
burned, tortured, mutilated.

245
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,005
I got less interested
in treating the animals

246
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,254
and more interested in catching
the animals who did that to 'em.

247
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,805
You volunteered
at an animal shelter.

248
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,431
Don't tell anyone.

249
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,725
I won't.

250
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,644
Your secret
is safe with me.

251
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,472
Even in Wind Gap.

252
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,648
So, for various
reasons, this...

253
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,066
is what they call
"the end zone."

254
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,321
Double entendre
intended.

255
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,448
This is where the football team
would have their way

256
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,824
with that week's
lucky cheerleader.

257
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,531
- Ninth grade, you said.
- Yep.

258
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,957
Makes me sick.

259
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,911
- Were the police notified?
- Of course not.

260
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,714
Some people would
call that rape, you know.

261
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,916
Eh, some people
would call that

262
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,876
consensual, you know?

263
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,803
Wait, who are you
talking about?

264
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,300
Were you one of the girls?

265
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,802
If I say yes, you'll think

266
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,633
less of me, or you'll
feel sorry for me.

267
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,718
No, I'd think those guys
took advantage of someone

268
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,599
way too young to make
an informed decision.

269
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,930
- Typical.
- What?

270
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,981
Well, a boy has sex
with five girls,

271
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,979
they're gonna put up
a statue in his honor.

272
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,562
- You know? Yeah.
- Yeah, double standards exist.

273
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,693
But having your way
with somebody,

274
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,365
that sounds criminal.
Literally.

275
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,442
Even on game night.

276
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,618
But now that I know
your feeling

277
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,118
on the subject,
have a sip.

278
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,876
Bless your heart.

279
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,327
Bless your heart
very much.

280
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,165
What's your
second question?

281
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,297
That tire sample that you
took off of Bob Nash's car,

282
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,503
- Yeah?
- where was the tread?

283
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,508
- Did it match?
- That's two questions.

284
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,930
That's a two-part question.

285
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,009
Give me that.

286
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,429
You know
it wasn't a match.

287
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,105
Well, that kind of
blows up my

288
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,398
Bob Nash-killed-
Natalie Keene

289
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,691
in-revenge-for-Anne
theory.

290
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,813
You think
there's two Killers,

291
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,066
and Bob Nash
killed Natalie Keene?

292
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,273
That's a two-part question.

293
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,950
Um, I mean,

294
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,277
the teeth pulling matches,

295
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,362
but that could be a cover-up.

296
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,788
They were killed differently,

297
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,365
and one of the bodies
was hidden,

298
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,621
and the other
was put on display

299
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,872
for the whole town
to see, like,

300
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,544
"Fuck you, Wind Gap,
look what I can do."

301
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,247
Mm, that's
an interesting theory,

302
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,299
but Nash's alibi
checks out so far.

303
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,217
Yeah, well, a lot of women
think Nash is a pervert,

304
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,011
and sometimes perverts
like little girls.

305
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,804
That's where
the teeth pulling comes in.

306
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,179
In our guy's mind,
it's equivalent to rape.

307
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,010
It's about power...

308
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,220
for someone who
feels powerless.

309
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,912
Stay.

310
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,514
Hello, Amma.

311
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,012
Did you catch
the killer yet?

312
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,515
Is your mama home?

313
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,437
You didn't?
Shouldn't, uh,

314
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,061
you be out there
looking for him?

315
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,687
Well, you're certainly
your mama's daughter--

316
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,893
I'll give you that.

317
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,603
Is there a problem, Chief?

318
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,065
Oh, I just came by
to discuss something with Adora.

319
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,696
She's in bed, resting.

320
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,082
Mama, Chief Vickery's here.

321
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,287
Oh...

322
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,373
Is everything okay?

323
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:52,052
Yes. I was just hoping
you and I could have a word.

324
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,801
Of course.
Give me a moment

325
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,131
to put myself together.

326
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,682
Uh, Alan,

327
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,511
please fix
the Chief a drink.

328
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,312
Gayla?

329
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,982
Well, I assume
you'll have the usual.

330
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,651
Mm-hmm.

331
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,523
Take a seat.

332
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,205
This place
I already know about.

333
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,410
Ann and Natalie
used to play here.

334
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,015
Creepy place for two
young girls to hang out.

335
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,848
No?

336
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,524
Yeah.

337
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,030
The way these killings
went down,

338
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,827
it makes sense they knew
their attacker, right?

339
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,154
I'm certain of it.

340
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,409
Certain? Why?

341
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,786
This guy's a hunter.

342
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,287
Hunters track their prey.

343
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,334
Where do they lead to?
A clearing.

344
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,207
This shed.

345
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,164
It's no coincidence
that the only two girls

346
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,340
that were killed in this town
used to play here.

347
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,418
He probably
hid out there

348
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,504
waiting for them,
watching them.

349
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,305
Waiting for one
to arrive before the other

350
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,008
so they'd be alone,
and then-- then he struck.

351
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,434
Well, I thought that Ann
was taken from her bike.

352
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,229
That's what they said,
but they never found it,

353
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,431
so could've happened here.

354
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,641
Well, that's an
interesting theory,

355
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,816
but there's
no proof of that.

356
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,814
No, but I'm getting close.

357
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,646
Someone in this town
is hiding something.

358
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,655
What makes you say that?

359
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,454
People are getting nervous.

360
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,031
Oh.

361
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,078
Did something happen
to you in that shed?

362
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,791
Good instincts, KC.

363
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,467
You holding out on me?

364
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,885
I might be.

365
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,255
And I was under
the impression

366
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,557
you were starting
to like me.

367
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,651
No.

368
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,354
How's your hand, dear?

369
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,273
- Better, thank you.
- Oh, good.

370
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,693
Mm.

371
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,691
Ow.

372
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,651
The roses.

373
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,038
If you'll excuse me.

374
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,291
How's Jocelyn?

375
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,510
Fine.

376
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,087
Sends her love.

377
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,469
Well, that's sweet.
Send it back, of course.

378
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,924
Of course.

379
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,974
Is there a break
in the case?

380
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,649
You'd be the first to know.

381
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,898
- However--
- Ah, the "however."

382
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,605
Mm. Calhoun Day, Adora.

383
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,316
It's not appropriate
given the events.

384
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,900
Mm-mm.

385
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,952
I think the town needs
a bit of frivolity,

386
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,871
don't you think,
given the events?

387
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,916
Possibly.

388
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,585
Then why would you
have me cancel an event

389
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,083
that's been a part
of this town

390
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,631
for half a century?

391
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,001
Because I haven't
caught the killer.

392
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,303
Ahh.

393
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,219
Well, you do have
the power as chief,

394
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,224
to do whatever's
in the interest

395
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,771
of public safety.

396
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,348
I do.

397
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,860
And some have the power
in this town...

398
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,066
to remove you as chief.

399
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,212
Oh, that's what I love
about you, Adora.

400
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,337
You never pull
your punches.

401
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,419
That's the only thing?

402
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,057
We need to talk
about your daughters.

403
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,636
What about them?

404
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,597
Well, one of them
is dangerous,

405
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,149
and the other one's
in danger.

406
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,445
I'm working on some things.

407
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,244
Any "some thing"
you'd like to share?

408
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,659
The girls were dead

409
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,036
when their teeth
were pulled, right?

410
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,787
Yeah, that's enough questions.

411
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,621
One more.
What about John Keene?

412
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,956
He seems, maybe,
too broken up

413
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,882
over the whole thing--
could be an act.

414
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,505
Well, his sister
was murdered.

415
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,803
Yeah, but I'm a guy,
and teenage boys,

416
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,053
they would sooner die
than cry in public.

417
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,760
Oh, look who's here.

418
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,350
Everything okay?

419
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,277
Kansas City.

420
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,478
Miss Preaker.

421
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,906
No need for alarm.
Just a friendly house visit.

422
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,280
Yeah. I'd like
to hear all about

423
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,860
your conversation
later on.

424
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:55,324
And I yours.
Good night.

425
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,926
What was that
all about?

426
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,350
Small town cop,
big time problems.

427
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,355
Now we kiss?

428
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,361
I'm an unconventional girl.

429
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,988
That's what you
like about me.

430
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,535
Shit.
I'm sorry, Mama.

431
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,534
You just scared me.
Sorry.

432
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,741
l... I couldn't sleep

433
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,917
with everything that's
going on around here.

434
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,211
Yeah, well...

435
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,629
You don't need
to worry about me.

436
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,877
I'm okay.

437
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,218
Okay.

438
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,263
How was La Mere?

439
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,341
Um, it was good.

440
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,551
The ladies
were disappointed

441
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,932
that you didn't come.

442
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,765
You were always
so willful.

443
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,601
Excuse me?

444
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,356
Never sweet.

445
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:35,364
I-l remember when you
were about six or seven.

446
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,320
I wanted to put
your hair up in curlers

447
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,825
for your school picture.

448
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,619
Instead, you cut it all off
with my fabric shears.

449
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,204
No.

450
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,880
No, no, no, Mama.
That wasn't me.

451
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,128
- I think you're--
- When I was expecting

452
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,585
with you, I thought
you'd save me.

453
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,933
I thought you'd love me,

454
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,260
and then my...

455
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,144
my mother would love me.

456
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:11,065
Even from the beginning,
you disobeyed.

457
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,566
You wouldn't--
wouldn't eat,

458
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,820
like-- like you were

459
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,151
punishing me
for being born.

460
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,619
You made me

461
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,700
feel like a fool,

462
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,502
like a...

463
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,795
like a child.

464
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,632
You were a child.

465
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,260
And now you
come back here...

466
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,899
...and all
I can think is...

467
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,987
What? What, Mama”?

468
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,576
You smell ripe.

469
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,266
You gonna finish soon?

470
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,405
Wait, what are you doing?

471
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,903
I'm gonna go
for a ride.

472
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,277
I'll let you put it inside me.

473
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,345
Can I get you anything else,
Miss Camille?

474
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,895
No, thank you.

475
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,605
Gayla, all these years...

476
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,563
We both know how Adora is.

477
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,945
Why did you stay?

478
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,117
Not a lot of choice
in Wind Gap.

479
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,571
You got domestic work.

480
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,406
You got the hog farm.

481
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,457
I don't like pigs.

482
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,581
Besides...

483
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,038
Miss Crellin's bark
is worse than her bite.

484
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,254
They're both pretty bad
if you ask me.

485
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,005
Good night,
Miss Camille.

486
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,054
I'm glad to see that

487
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,386
that hand of yours
is doing better.

488
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,892
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

489
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:26,150
I was just wondering
if you needed me

490
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,906
for anything
else tonight.

491
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,417
I can't think
of anything.

492
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,747
You know, I lost
a daughter, too.

493
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,923
What are you saying?

494
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,220
I don't think that you've
ever stopped to consider that.

495
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,383
It's late.

496
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,641
Marian was taken
from me, too, Adora,

497
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,689
and I would just like
to see some appreciation

498
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,483
for how I have borne that.

499
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,684
What you're saying--

500
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,315
What do you
want me to say?

501
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,817
Thank you?

502
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,069
Nobody asked you
to suffer in silence.

503
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,151
How is it that you
show more compassion

504
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,611
for the local
civil servants

505
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,117
than for your
own husband?

506
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,242
How is that?

507
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,254
If you are speaking
about the Chief,

508
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,878
I am-- I am done
with this conversation.

509
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,880
Hmm. Seemed to me

510
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,429
you could talk
to him all night.

511
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,846
It's Camille,

512
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,139
- isn't it?
- Oh, come on, now.

513
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,558
She brings discord
into this house.

514
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,602
Not everything
is that girl's fault,

515
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,305
and you know it.

516
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,982
Why are you
trying to hurt me?

517
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,311
Hurt?

518
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,364
You have a very peculiar idea

519
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,442
of the word, "hurt," dear.

520
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,293
Stay.

521
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,334
Vickery, Jocelyn know
that you're out

522
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,214
calling on another woman
late at night?

523
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:13,890
Not if you don't tell her.

524
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,558
I need you help.

525
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,511
Okay.

526
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,768
What is Adora
not telling me

527
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,348
about the Preaker girl?

528
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,732
I don't know what
you're talking about.

529
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,408
Can I have two
of those? Thanks.

530
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,125
Thank you.

531
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,378
Oh, these are, uh,
both mine, actually.

532
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,460
- Oh.
- I'm kidding.

533
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,137
I could totally
two-fist it right now.

534
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,673
Bad day?

535
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,098
Yeah, my mom is--

536
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,847
My mom is losing it.

537
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,929
And your mom had me
fired from my job today.

538
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,730
My mom fired you.

539
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,057
It's okay.

540
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,315
It's not really
a fun place to work.

541
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,487
Pigs are smart, you know?

542
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,485
They know what's
happening to them.

543
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,991
Or... what's
about to happen.

544
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,367
That's why they
shit so much.

545
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,324
‘Cause they're afraid.

546
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,164
Do you ever
get over it?

547
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,465
- Losing a job?
- Losing a sister.

548
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,508
I wish I could
tell you "yes",

549
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,010
but that would be a lie.

550
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,685
People in this town
actually believe

551
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,932
that I killed her.

552
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,388
Yeah, I know.

553
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,520
If it means anything
to you, I don't.

554
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:53,125
Natalie collected spiders.
Did you know that?

555
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,210
No.

556
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,178
She got into some trouble
back in Philly.

557
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,930
That's where we
used to live.

558
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,264
What kind of trouble,
if you don't mind me asking?

559
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,601
She got mad at a girl
for stealing her pencil.

560
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,651
So, she took it back
from her and, uh...

561
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,817
...she stuck it
in her eye.

562
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,869
Jesus.

563
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,742
Please, do not put
that in your story.

564
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,493
I've never told this
to anyone before.

565
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,951
I won't.

566
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,711
Bob always thought
Ann was on the--

567
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,258
the straight-and-narrow path

568
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,680
before she met Natalie--
the "devil child."

569
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,303
That's what he
used to call her.

570
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,230
I think they were
two peas in a pod,

571
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,308
those two--
those two weirdos.

572
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,863
Nothing wrong with that.
I'm a weirdo.

573
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,565
Yeah, me, too, I guess.

574
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,864
I always thought
those girls

575
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,410
were gonna end up
killing each other.

576
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,034
They were always
going at it.

577
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,457
Amma was the only thing that
stood between them some days.

578
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,706
Amma?

579
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,163
Yeah. Yeah, she was always
keeping 'em off each other.

580
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,879
I knew that Adora
tutored the girls,

581
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,053
but I didn't know that
Amma was close with them.

582
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,006
Oh, yeah.

583
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,932
I guess the three
would all go play

584
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,430
in that creepy
hunting shed.

585
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,143
You okay?

586
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,640
Fuck, dude!

587
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,127
Fuck.
