179
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,997
CAMILLE: Hi.

180
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,093
RICHARD: How about homemade sauce
with pasta and red wine?

181
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,635
I mean, it's progress.

182
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,796
RICHARD: You just tell me when.

183
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,965
So, homemade.
Does that mean you're gonna cook?

184
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,552
RICHARD: You bet I will,
in my fancy kitchen.

185
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,766
I mean, that is if you don't mind
having dinner in bed.

186
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,393
CAMILLE: Well,
that's very convenient of you.

187
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,275
Guess what we found today.

188
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,276
Thanks to your mom.

189
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,276
(CAR APPROACHING)

190
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,122
ADORA: Even the lawn
is not safe from her.

191
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,366
Shall I ask her to move it?

192
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,251
Why cause a scene?

193
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,758
I left your hand cream
in the bathroom.

194
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,091
-Oh, you got it.
-Of course, I did.

195
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,220
Was that before or after they found
Ann Nash's bike down at the factory?

196
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,015
Well, that was a business matter.
It did not concern you.

197
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,768
The first piece of material evidence
in a double homicide

198
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,394
certainly does concern me.

199
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,771
Now you know about it,

200
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,023
so there's no reason
to be upset with me.

201
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,401
Camille, your mother would like you
to move your car...

202
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,482
CAMILLE: Was the first call they made
to the police or you?

203
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,988
I heard that Bob Nash was there.

204
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,569
What was his reaction
when he saw the bike?

205
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,370
Are you interviewing me?

206
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,414
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

207
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,125
ADORA: I'm your mother.

208
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,046
I'm not a source.

209
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,174
I'm sure you found other ways
to get your information.

210
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,769
-Thanks for the hand cream.
-ADORA: You're welcome.

211
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,521
I believe she's outstayed her welcome.

212
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,695
You've been more than tolerant, dear.

213
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,314
Thank you.

214
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,036
Let her know
how you feel about it, please.

215
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,210
Hi. I have an appointment
with Dr. Hafia.

216
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,430
-What's your name?
-Richard Willis.

217
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,973
Willis?

218
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,763
I'm trying to get a handle on

219
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,765
the personality type
that might come in here.

220
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,314
It might help me get somewhere
on this case I'm investigating.

221
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,858
There isn't any one type
that we see here.

222
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,236
Some of them are suffering
from underlying psychological problems

223
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,190
such as depression,
psychosis, bipolar disorder.

224
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,488
And then a lot of our patients
are just trying to distract

225
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,866
from painful feelings
resulting from trauma or stress.

226
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,492
That's a pretty wide net.

227
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,290
Like I said, nothing typical.

228
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,619
But if a person
was to end up in a place like this,

229
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,670
their behavior would have to be
pretty severe?

230
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,339
Well, people come in here in a crisis.

231
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,254
Our patients can be
impulsive and aggressive,

232
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,173
but they are very rarely violent.

233
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,758
Whatever is going on with them,

234
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,340
they take it out on themselves
more than other people.

235
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,348
ASHLEY: (ON TAPE)
Do you ever miss cheerleading?

236
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,054
CAMILLE: (ON TAPE)
So, is that why you think that

237
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,014
the killer is doing this,
for popularity?

238
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,934
ASHLEY ON TAPE:
What other reason is there?

239
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,811

240
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,491
-Hi.
-FRANK: Cubby! What's the story?

241
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,702
Well, potential break.

242
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,830
They pulled the bicycle
of the first victim

243
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,160
out of a lagoon of pig shit.

244
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,667
FRANK: Holy fuck!
Were you there?

245
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,086
No. My mother was.

246
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,917
What does the book of journalism say

247
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,670
about using a family member
as a source?

248
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,380
FRANK:
They're called "anonymous sources.”

249
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,217
CAMILLE: Right.
Why would someone hide the bicycle

250
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,347
in a shallow pool of pig shit,

251
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,100
unless they were stupid
or trying to frame someone?

252
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,932
FRANK: So you think
it's someone from town.

253
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,564
CAMILLE: Maybe. Everybody thinks
that a man is behind this

254
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,986
and no one's looking at the women.

255
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,940
No, ‘cause it doesn't fit the profile.

256
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,695
Women don't kill like that,
that violent.

257
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,322
CAMILLE: Until they do.

258
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,324
EILEEN: Get it yourself.

259
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,247
Why aren't you in the office?

260

FRANK: ‘Cause the old ball and chain
won't let me.

261
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,625
She's got me tied to the bed.

262
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,171
That's what an animal I am
in the sack.

263

Hey, honey. How are you?
I'm worried about you.

CAMILLE: I'm fine, I'm just
looking forward to coming home.

265
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,846

when you're sitting

266
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,388
in the bedroom you grew up in.

267
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,596
It's closing in on you, huh?

if these conditions don't improve.

Oh, please, Camille.

285
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:53,248
I know how jealous you've always been
of anyone else's well-being.

that we didn't communicate.

00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,137
Yeah, you really are
like your grandmother.

290
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,807
She would stand guard over this house
like a witch.

291
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,350
The only time she ever smiled

292
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,474
was when you refused to nurse
from Adora.

293
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,066
Well, it has been really nice, Alan.
Thank you.

ALAN: Camille,
Adora has had a hard life.

295
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,402
Joya would come into her room
in the middle of the night,

296
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,778
and she would pinch her.

297
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,487
She said that she was worried
that Adora would die in her sleep.

298
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,370
You know what I say?
She just liked to hurt people.

Yeah, I think you've made your point.

300
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,953
I just think that
if you knew these things,

301
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,334
it might make you
somewhat kinder to your mother.

302
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,541
Yeah, I'll be leaving
as soon as I can, all right?

00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,683
(WHISPERS) I wanna bring
my dollhouse upstairs.

698
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,938
I know you think
Adora likes me better,

699
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,396
but that's not true.

700
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,487
She calls out names
when she's sleeping.

701
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,073
Marian, you.

703
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,325
-Here.
-Wait.

704
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,626
Wait.

AMMA: Do you ever feel like

707
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,254
bad things are gonna happen to you

708
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,256
and you can't stop them?

709
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,597
You can't do anything?

710
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,182
You just have to wait?

711
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,091
It's not safe here for you.

712
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,004
