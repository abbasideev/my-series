4
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,562
part of you goes to heaven,
but part of you stays here?

00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,772

how things turn out...

7
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,155

Is it?

18
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,904
I don't think John Keene is a killer.

00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,125

22
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,018

heading back to St. Louis shortly.

I get sometimes?

36

I am, Camille.

in charge of punishment.

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,594
But I feel sorry for Persephone

49
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,727
because, even when
she's back with the living,

50
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,685
they're afraid of her
because of where she's been.

51
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,072
Kind of funny, huh?
How many stories they have

52

need to get rescued from witches.

53
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,120

if John died or I died?

going on in town, all the trouble,

00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,149
it might be nice to have Amma

74

come stay with me
in St. Louis for a while.

75
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,939

might do her good.

from nursing me to death.

520
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,024
She seems like
she's gonna be just fine.

521
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,738
And I like her friend.

522
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,579
She might actually be
a good influence on her.

523
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,829
Amma's, uh... I don't know.

524
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,161
She doesn't sleep most nights
unless I'm with her.

525
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,961
-She misses Adora.
-What a thing.

526
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,757

the fucked-up family Olympics...

(TAPS TABLE)

It's about damn time!

531
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,598
So, it turns out that
the mayor didn't want me to know

532
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,434
because the new head of Parks and Rec

533
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,610
was his appointment

534
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,859
-and his mistress.
-(AMMA LAUGHS)

535
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,950
And that, I believe,
has nothing to do with,

536
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,786
Mae, your question about
why the public pool closed.

537
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,864
Oh, but it was a good story. Juicy.

538
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,623
My husband will take the long route
to avoid a simple "I don't know."

539
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,711
MAE: I like your editorials,
Mr. Curry.

540
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,713
They make good points,
and they're not boring.

541
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,715
-FRANK: You read the editorials?
-Mmm-hmm.

542
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,764
-Call me Frank. I like this girl.
-(LAUGHTER)

543
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,933
I'm thinking about going into
either politics or journalism.

544
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,394
-FRANK: Mmm.
-You just say that to impress Camille.

545
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,599
-I do not.
-Kiss-ass. (SCOFFS)

546
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,268
MAE: I don't know what
I want to do yet, exactly.

547
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,319
-We have a lot of time, right?
-FRANK: Absolutely.

548
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,489
Well, I'm gonna be
an on-camera personality.

549
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,238
I have the gift of gab, that's what...

550
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,818
That's what people say.

551
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,951
Well, that's interesting.
How does one get into that field?

552
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,408
Well, you start with the gift of gab.

553
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:12,541
Then you go to college,
and Communications major.

554
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,292
EILEEN: Again, he has no idea.

555

-I have no idea.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,801
Let's just get you
through high school first, hmm?

557
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,652
Do you wish I was a writer like you?

558
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,160
All I wish is for you to be happy.

559
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,202
You make me happy.

560
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,875

Sorry to bother you,
but have you seen Mae?

568
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,910
Oh, uh, I think that she and Amma
went to the park

569
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,619
to not swim in the closed pool,
but, uh, they should be back soon.

570
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,127
Did Amma talk to you?

571
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,628
I think the girls had
their first little fight.

-Over what?
-Who knows?

-girl stuff.
-Yeah.

I envy the skin, but nothing else
about that age, you know?

576
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,937
Yeah. Well, um, when they get back,
I'll send her your way, all right?

00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,438
