355
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,733
Yeah, yeah.
I'm cuttin' him some slack.

356
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,936
It's John Keene.

357
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,192
John Keene, Natalie's brother?

358
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,694
Yeah, yeah. Poor son of a bitch.

359
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,483
He's takin' it really hard.

360
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,994
-Excuse me for a sec, okay?
-Yeah.

361
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,243
Ms. Preaker. At Sensors.

362
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,074
Yeah.

363
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,626
What, is this your spot?

364
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,672
This what you do?
You come here and you drink,

365
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,921
and you just, I don't know,
dream about the one that got away?

leaves us alone.

by ways of a lot of other places.

375
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,241
So, yes on the "out-of-town,"

376
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,410
and jury's still out on "asshole."

377
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,372
How long have you worked on the case?

378
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,245
Since the Keene girl.

379
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,202
Vickery called for backup.

380
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,878
I think he regrets it now.

381
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,088
He doesn't like my style.

382
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,250
Which is?

383
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,468
Not his, I guess.

Hmm.

385
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,797
At least I'm investigating.

386
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,341
You don't think he is?

387

-Funny girl.
-Come on.

388
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,930
You know I'm gonna get the story
one way or another.

389
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,891
Wouldn't you rather be
in control of the conversation?

390
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,020
That's a good line.

391

Well, that's different.

399
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,996
So, is he a suspect?

400
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,082
-You know I can't answer that.
-So he is.

401

Everybody's a suspect right now.

402

You don't have any leads? Nothin"?

for some city folk conversation.

you can ask about mine...

407
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,772
Yeah. I don't really do that. Chat.

408
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,604
Got it. Okay.

409
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,693

Ann was first.

let her go no further,

like anybody.

So, just ‘fore school starts up,

487
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,548
she begs to ride over

‘cause we keep to ourselves,

but that doesn't mean I hurt my kid.

No, no, no,
I wasn't suggesting that, Mr. Nash.

00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,585

00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,719
A faggot did it.

‘Cause he didn't rape her.
