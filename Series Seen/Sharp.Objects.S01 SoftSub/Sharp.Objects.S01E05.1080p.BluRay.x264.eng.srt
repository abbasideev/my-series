Oh, fuck, no.

-Chief.

355
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,159
I'd like you to meet my wife, Jocelyn.

356
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,119
Ma'am. Pleasure to meet you.

357
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,124
Detective Willis.
I've heard so much about you.

358
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,752
Well, I hope I can change
your opinion of me.

359
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,134
Charming, as advertised.

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,841
Don't flatter yourself, Betty Sue.
Come on, honey.

00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,510
-Have a great day, Detective.
-Happy Calhoun Day.

Why don't you come over here,
hang out with us for a little bit?

365
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,825
That does sound delightful,
but I can't right now.

366
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,326
Maybe later.

367
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:22,497

sure do like their boys with badges.

-Yeah.

-Do yourself a favor

Look, I'm telling ya,
we're gonna get this guy.

386
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,432
There'll be justice.

387
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,813
Oh.

388
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,685
What, are you gonna...

389
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,777
You gonna strangle him
and rip out his teeth?

390
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,075
That'd be justice, wouldn't it?

391
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,949
All I'm asking you to do
is lock him up.

392
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,655
Jesus, he's right over there.

393
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,746
You cut my stuff? All of it?

394
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,330
I gave you good stuff.
I gave you John. We had a deal.

395

-There was no deal, Ashley.
-I am John's only advocate...

-No. We are not leaving.

-Hi, guys.

-I'm gonna get myself a beer.

-Now, don't go.
-Say, Camille.

a little tour around the grounds

So, what is this thing, anyway?
Calhoun Day.

450
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,847
So what, it's Confederate pride?

451
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,266
We don't use the "C-word" here
in Missouri.

452
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,819
Right. Bite my tongue.
Silent racism is best.

453
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,689
So, Zeke Calhoun,
our founding pedophile,

454
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,319
he fought for the South,

455
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,989
and his child-bride, Millie Calhoun,

456
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,073
she was my great-great-great
grand-victim or something.

457
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,827
She was from a Union family.

458
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,033
Hell of a pairing.

459
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,870
Yeah, well, one day,
the Union soldiers

00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,422
come down here
to collect hubby, dead or alive.

461
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,962
But brave Millie, who is with child,

462
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,510
she refuses to give Zeke up,
she resists.

463
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,968
But it's how she resists
that people in this town just love.

464
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,009
The Union soldiers,
they tied her to a tree,

465
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,223
did horrible things to her.

466
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,891
Violations.

467
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,475
But Millie never said a word.
Lost the baby.

00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,355
The end. Applause.

of happy stories around here.

00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,733

at this party to calm her down.

for one another.

532

539
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,034
Richard, some people
don't understand loss,

540
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,336
because some people haven't lost.

541
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,663

542
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:28,625

must seem strange to you,

00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,291
I just... wasn't thinking,

700
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,286
and I should have
told my editor to wait

701
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,209
on the article, so...

702
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,965
Mama, can I talk to you about Amma?

703
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,630
She's scared of something.

704
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,225
I think that's the reason
she's doing what she's doing.

705
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,683
What's she doing?

706
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,063
Her mood swings. Her acting out.

707
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,945
Oh, that's just being a teenager.

708
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,618
Well, I'm sure you'll do
what you think is best.

709
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,450
I try.

710
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,119
And I...

711
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,959
I appreciate you not telling
that detective about, um...

712
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,719
But, darling,
he'll find out, won't he?

713
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,387
I mean, not to be blunt, but...

714
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,178
When you get close...

715
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,384
I won't

716
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,936
get close. I don't. I never get close.

717
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,355
But that's what I wanted
to apologize for.

718
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,694
You can't get close.

719
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,117
That's your father.

720
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,411
And it's why I think...

721
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,671
I never loved you.

722
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,671
You were born to it,

723
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,671
that cold nature.

724
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,009
I hope that's some comfort to you.

It's okay.

730
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,802
Do you like that?

731
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,894
No.

732
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,989
No.

733
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,654
No.

734
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,703
My way.

735
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,488
We do it my way.
