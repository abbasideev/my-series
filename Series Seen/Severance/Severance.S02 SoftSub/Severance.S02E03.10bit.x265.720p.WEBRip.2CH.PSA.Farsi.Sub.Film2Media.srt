1
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,846
Good morning, Mr. Scout.

2
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,376
One, two, three, four, five,

3
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:54,591
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

4
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,637
Thirty-two, 33, 34,

5
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,725
35, 36, thirty-se--

6
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,485
Okay, me and Helly will find the goat man
and other possible goat people.

7
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,362
Dylan, hit the new break room.

8
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,657
Maybe some of
the other departments use it too.

9
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,575
Yeah. Maybe later.

10
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,329
Okay. This is kind of important, Dylan.

11
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,666
Yeah. I'm in a good groove here,
but don't worry about it. I'll get to it.

12
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:56,338
Okay. Well, just show them the sketch.
Do not leave it behind.

13
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,300
O&D.

14
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,638
Yes, Irv. You can do this.

15
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,682
I know.

16
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,767
You guys really think
they're gonna let us roam around?

17
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,020
They said on the video
we can go wherever we want.

18
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,939
Lumon is listening, remember?

19
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,108
I thought that meant
they were listening to our conversations.

20
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,779
Yeah, he's right, Mark.
I did get the hint of a double meaning.

21
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,489
Well, be discreet.

22
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,368
If they don't know we're doing it,
how can they punish us?

23
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,248
Hey,
you haven't been back there, have you?

24
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,584
No, no.

25
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,340
We've got you.

26
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,386
Thank you, Helly.

27
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,690
So, say we find her...

28
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,900
Sorry?

29
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,194
Say we get to the goat department
and they're like,

30
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:05,072
"Yes, Ms. Casey's here.
She's in this goat cage."

31
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,240
What do we do then?

32
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,493
Well, we get her to the south stairwell...
I'll go with her...

33
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,831
and once we're out the door,
my outie'll know what to do.

34
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,002
Right. Okay. Well,
sounds like you've got it figured out.

35
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,134
Are you sure you're okay
helping me out with this?

36
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,096
Yeah, of course.

37
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,808
Okay, good.

38
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,370
Yeah.

39
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,844
I... I...

40
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,390
Dylan.

41
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,685
I thought you were going to O&D.

42
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,605
Dylan.

43
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,024
I've recreated the paintings.

44
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:07,445
The ones I told you about.
The ones my outie was working on.

45
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,529
What?

46
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,449
You see, I've been thinking.

47
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,869
Maybe the hallway is really down here.

48
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,539
Maybe that's what my dreams have been.

49
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,460
We could look for it, Dylan.

50
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,087
We could go today.

51
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,673
You could accompany me.

52
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,551
Yeah.

53
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,596
Yeah, maybe.

54
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:38,602
Or maybe you go yourself,
like, for stealth, you know?

55
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,647
- Stealth?
- Yeah.

56
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,317
Look, I can't really explain. I just--

57
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,820
Miss Huang.

58
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,621
{\an8}Hall pass.

59
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,130
Everything chill?

60
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,470
Dylan G., come with me, please.

61
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,768
Good morning, Seth.

62
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,854
Natalie.

63
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,150
Looks like your balloons
could use some coffee.

64
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,572
- They were in the--
- I've got the Board.

65
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,866
Of course.

66
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,454
Hello.

67
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,916
The Board says, "Hello."

68
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,926
Hello. I want to thank the Board humbly
for my recent betterment.

69
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,726
The Board says, "You're welcome."

70
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,439
The Board is jubilant at your ascendance.

71
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,027
It wants you to feel appreciated
and asks if you do.

72
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,071
I do.

73
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:22,539
The Board austerely desires for you
to feel connected to Lumon's history.

74
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,000
To that end,

75
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:31,964
please accept from the Board these
inclusively re-canonicalized paintings

76
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,345
intended to help you see yourself
in Kier, our founder.

77
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,210
Oh, my.

78
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,838
You'll find the whole Kier cycle.

79
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,359
The Board wishes to express
that I, Natalie,

80
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,113
received the same gift
upon receipt of my current position

81
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,616
and found it extremely moving.

82
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,702
I'm grateful.

83
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,619
Yes.

84
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,877
It's meaningful
to see myself reflected in...

85
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,179
The Board has concluded the call.

86
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,864
Congratulations, Seth.

87
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,584
Is that it?

88
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,085
Think so.

89
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,164
You're gonna--

90
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,794
You sure?

91
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,216
Okay.

92
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,641
All right. Okay, we're doing this.

93
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,437
Can you see anything?

94
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,232
No. Careful, there's poop.

95
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,651
Okay.

96
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,281
Okay.

97
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,638
Oh, my God.

98
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,057
What the hell?

99
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,387
Are you here to kill me?

100
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:18,019
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I... Sorry. Hi, I'm Mark.

101
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,481
- I'm Helly.
- And we're with Macrodata Refinement.

102
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,617
What is this place?

103
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,997
Mammalians Nurturable.

104
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,008
Please, we mean you no harm.
We just wanna talk.

105
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,843
Please.

106
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,906
Irving.

107
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,909
Felicia, hello.

108
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,412
I'm sorry to pop in after all this time.

109
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,832
I'm sure you must be very busy.

110
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,376
It's good to see you.

111
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,358
Her name's Ms. Casey.

112
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,069
She's our former Wellness Director.

113
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,206
Wellness...

114
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,089
we don't abide such fripperies here.

115
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,972
Right. Well, she's been retired, but
we believe she may still be on the floor.

116
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,391
Are you sure you don't know her?

117
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,400
Maybe you should take that page
of paper and be on your way.

118
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,403
Not until you've answered my question.

119
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,408
Mark.

120
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,687
You should have left.

121
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,708
It would be cool to know
what this is about.

122
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:19,928
So, like, is it rude to keep asking
why you're a kid?

123
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,851
I don't mean to impugn.
It's just like, are you okay, you know?

124
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,812
They're not, like,
forcing you to be here, are they?

125
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,861
Oh, fuck.

126
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,785
Why are we going to the security room?

127
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,543
Wow.

128
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,298
Dylan?

129
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,386
Hi.

130
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,556
Hi.

131
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:55,356
Dylan G.,
through good behavior and output,

132
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,694
you've earned an 18-minute
visitation event with your outie's wife,

133
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:00,612
Gretchen G.

134
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,157
Cool.

135
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,451
Your time begins now.

136
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,009
Should we sit?

137
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,150
Nice sack.

138
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:39,902
Sorry?

139
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,696
Your... The--

140
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:48,493
Thanks. They made me put my stuff in here.

141
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,289
Badass.

142
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:57,669
You really don't know me at all?

143
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:04,259
No. Well, I mean,
from the photos from just now, but...

144
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,056
Yeah, Seth warned me
that this might be weird.

145
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,851
- Who's Seth?
- Don't you--

146
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,981
{\an8}<i>Please refrain from sharing information
that may be privileged or sensitive.</i>

147
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:19,650
{\an8}<i>Thank you.</i>

148
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,359
Okay.

149
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,195
Who is that child?

150
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:24,947
<i>Miss Huang.</i>

151
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:35,999
Look. It's really nice to meet you,
but am I in trouble?

152
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,711
Oh, no. No, you're not in trouble.

153
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,760
We have three kids.

154
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:49,637
Right.

155
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:53,933
And you...

156
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,144
No, he... Or--

157
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,445
My husband has had trouble
keeping other jobs.

158
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,073
He dumb?

159
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:09,950
No.

160
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,325
He a dick?

161
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,661
No.

162
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,787
What is wrong with him?

163
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,957
Nothing's wrong with him.

164
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,209
He just...

165
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,089
He never quite found his thing.

166
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,559
So he's actually kind of a fuck up?

167
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,070
Do you wanna see a picture of the kids?

168
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:50,741
Yeah.

169
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:55,996
Okay.

170
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,508
So, Jim is six.
He's in the first grade now.

171
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,677
And Ruth is four.

172
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,972
And Merrick just turned two.

173
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:15,891
Wow.

174
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,060
Holy shit.

175
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,480
Look at them.

176
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:24,900
They're awesome.

177
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,028
They are.

178
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,453
And we live on a cattle ranch?

179
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,795
And then... And Burt says,

180
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:50,007
"I don't care if
you're Baird goddamn Eagan,

181
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:54,179
you don't come to my department
and tell me how to print a snow globe."

182
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:00,476
I ca... My God, he was fearless.

183
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,939
I worked with Burt for six years.

184
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,234
And I only ever saw him
scared of one thing.

185
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:13,448
He spent two hours on his hair
the first time he went to visit you.

186
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,534
Really?

187
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,374
I should show you something.

188
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,628
- If we see her--
- Not her. It's a...

189
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,465
Here.

190
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:38,765
Oh, Irving, it's lovely.

191
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,102
I'd draw one every day I couldn't see him.

192
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,397
My numbers went down,
but I didn't even care.

193
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,908
Oh, no. That's not Burt.

194
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,579
That's something else.
That's just a... That's nothing.

195
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,248
It's...

196
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:08,629
How do you know about the exports hall?

197
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,551
I'm sorry?

198
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,141
We send a lot of shipments there.

199
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,311
Used to go ourselves.

200
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,273
But now, they send a guy.

201
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,155
Do you remember where it is?

202
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,459
Hello.

203
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,379
Hi.

204
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:02,598
- Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?
- Hey! Stop that!

205
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,934
Her name's Ms. Casey.
She was the Wellness director.

206
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,271
- Stop that!
- Have any of you seen her?

207
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:12,525
Enough! We've decided to send a courier
to inform Mr. Milchick of your inquiry.

208
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,736
No. You can't do that.
They could kill her if they find out--

209
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,114
That's not a Mammalians problem.

210
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,907
It's an innie problem.

211
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,660
Listen, we used to be afraid of
other departments too--

212
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:23,954
We're not afraid of you.

213
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:27,248
Look, they just disappeared her.

214
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,792
And if we let this happen to Ms. Casey,

215
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,546
then who's gonna step up
when it happens to us?

216
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,222
If one of your goats went missing,
wouldn't you go looking for it?

217
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,997
She used to come do her sessions
in our husbandry tanks.

218
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,837
She had a gentle way about her.

219
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,967
She said my outie excels at stargazing.

220
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,055
Meant a great deal to me.

221
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:33,232
As far as we know,
she was retired, just like they say.

222
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:41,198
But if you suspect otherwise,
we won't hinder your search.

223
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,201
Thank you.

224
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,203
Yes, thank you.

225
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,549
But before you go, we would...

226
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,596
like to see your bellies.

227
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,725
Our bellies?

228
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,104
Please.

229
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,026
Okay.

230
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,164
See? Pouchless.

231
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,460
Proves nothing.

232
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,758
Okay. Let's--

233
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,262
- So we'll just... Yeah.
- Yeah.

234
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,612
I'm glad we did this.

235
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,616
I mean, I hope, for you, this was...
I don't know.

236
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:08,702
Yeah, it was.

237
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,873
And I'll be good.
I'm gonna make you all proud.

238
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,085
I'm always proud of you, Dylan.

239
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:19,505
Cool.

240
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,558
I love you.

241
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:36,854
Sorry.

242
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,023
- Habit.
- No, it's...

243
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,821
Okay.

244
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:50,994
All right.

245
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,416
- Bye.
- Yeah.

246
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,867
So remember Merrick's ear thing, okay?

247
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:31,951
Copy that.

248
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:34,203
- Left ear.
- Yep.

249
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:37,123
And did you do the cookies
for Jim's class?

250
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,207
Bye.

251
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,252
It's our week for cookies.

252
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,340
I did not do the cookies. Sorry.

253
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:50,178
So, it's a tube
and you just need to slice them

254
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,972
- and then you put them in the oven.
- Got it, yeah.

255
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,057
Love you.

256
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,812
Hey, how was the thing?

257
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:00,898
What thing?

258
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,151
The thing with me.

259
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,946
Yeah, it was good.

260
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,324
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

261
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,618
Weird good, but good.

262
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,037
Cool.

263
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:20,249
Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll see you in the morning.

264
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,794
- Bye.
- Bye.

265
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:34,139
"But surely beer and juleps
cannot fill the void left by love.

266
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:39,186
Indeed, only wine can achieve this,
but it is famously costly,

267
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:43,815
which is why sadness is among the most
recurrent issues facing the poor."

268
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,568
Remarkable. So astute.

269
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,238
Is it? That's what I was going for.

270
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,365
Hi.

271
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:53,575
My babe.

272
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,913
This is Natalie Kalen from Lumon.

273
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:59,957
Is everything okay?

274
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,334
Yes. God, yes.

275
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:07,339
Natalie just stopped by
to discuss my book, actually.

276
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:12,928
It's a joy to meet you, Devon.
You must be so proud.

277
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,223
I am.

278
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,640
I'm sure you know by now
that your husband's work

279
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,893
has found its way onto our severed floor.

280
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,312
Yeah. Do we know how that happened yet?

281
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:29,152
So we've actually moved beyond that,
and we are now discussing the--

282
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,988
What was the term you used?

283
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,323
- The result.
- The result.

284
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:37,702
Ricken's words have had a profound effect
upon our workers.

285
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:39,662
We think he's really tapped
into something.

286
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:44,250
And Natalie wants to discuss
a version of <i>The You You Are</i>,

287
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:47,129
specifically for innies.

288
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:53,969
Okay, well, that's cool. I mean,
but what's wrong with the current version?

289
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:55,595
Nothing.

290
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,724
No, the explanation
is actually very interesting.

291
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:05,271
It's fascinating, actually. You, please.

292
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:09,442
There's a certain verbiage
to which innies respond more favorably.

293
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,445
If we just tweak it here and there.

294
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,865
They think that it could be
a real game changer.

295
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:18,952
Gotcha.

296
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,456
I gotta go.
But she needs a bottle in an hour. So...

297
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,166
Of course.

298
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,877
- Devon.
- Yes?

299
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:32,466
Can I just say, your brother is one of
the sweetest members of our severed team.

300
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:35,677
Yeah, he's a good egg.

301
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,805
Okay. One hour.

302
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,519
So she said her name's Natalie?

303
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,313
Natalie Kalen, I think.

304
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:50,525
What... Was she asking,
like, what I'm up to or--

305
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,945
Nope, 'cause it's Ricken they're after.

306
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,404
- Ricken?
- Yep. His book.

307
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,489
What?

308
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,408
I guess you and your work friends
were so inspired by it.

309
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,660
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yep.

310
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:03,955
That they're... They wanna do
like an innie specific cut.

311
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:07,792
Wow, okay. Well, there's just...
There's a lot I'm not gonna say.

312
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:09,711
And that is so appreciated.

313
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,674
Have you told Ricken
what we're doing here?

314
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,760
- Are you insane? No.
- Okay.

315
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,554
Good.

316
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,640
Okay, so you need to see the afterimage
for, like, two and a half minutes?

317
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,559
Two minutes, 18 seconds.

318
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,980
It's from the parking spot
to the elevator, give or take.

319
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:34,820
Yeah, I think the Whole Mind Collective
would be very proud of this.

320
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,737
As well as your kindergarten teacher.

321
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:38,698
What the fuck was her name?
Mrs. Lustgarten?

322
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,368
- Yeah, Mrs. Lustgarten. Yeah.
- Wow.

323
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:42,869
She really got me.

324
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,455
Yeah. Fuck, I gotta skedaddle.

325
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,417
Will you be careful, please?

326
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:50,586
Yeah.

327
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,713
Okay.

328
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,464
I do love you.

329
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,550
Okay.

330
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,761
Even thought you left me
with the check at Pips, you dick.

331
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:01,554
Thanks.

332
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,098
You're welcome.

333
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:58,171
Two, three, four, five,

334
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,590
six, seven,

335
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:04,260
eight, nine, ten,

336
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:07,764
11, 12. Shit.

337
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:12,728
Fuck.

338
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:23,632
If you want me back,
you must accommodate my needs.

339
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,387
I'm listening.

340
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:33,267
MDR. Non-negotiable.

341
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:41,066
Mark S. is so close
to completing Cold Harbor.

342
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:45,863
I intend to finish the work
that I started,

343
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,615
which is why

344
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,827
Milchick must go.

345
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:55,247
He's not equipped for the task.

346
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,710
I must be floor manager.

347
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,925
I hear ego...

348
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,014
hubris...

349
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:15,017
arrogance.

350
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,522
Kier teaches us they only cause pain.

351
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,235
Everything I accomplished, I earned...

352
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:31,116
through dedication and industry,

353
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:35,078
not because I was born into it.

354
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,714
I think you've overestimated
your contributions

355
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:49,218
and underestimated your blessings.

356
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,723
We didn't have to ask you back.

357
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,229
You didn't have a choice.

358
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,149
Are you sure?

359
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,742
Why don't we reset?

360
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,746
It doesn't have to be this way.

361
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,218
Natalie.

362
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,139
Please see if the Board is available

363
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,725
for Ms. Cobel and myself.

364
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:53,699
Let's go speak with them together.

365
00:43:58,472 --> 00:43:59,473
Harmony.

366
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:50,440
Thirty-three, 34, 35, 36,

367
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:52,693
thirty s--

368
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,986
Jesus Christ.

369
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:59,490
Are you trying to burn a message
to your innie into your retinas

370
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:03,370
because your computer told you
that was a brilliant idea?

371
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:07,082
Yeah.

372
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:12,003
No, no. What? No, no, no, no, no.

373
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:14,339
What are you... What?

374
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:16,258
It doesn't work.

375
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:20,261
- No shit.
- The switch briefly dilates the pupils.

376
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:21,179
Clean slate.

377
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,764
- Okay, thank you. Thanks.
- Also, you could blind yourself.

378
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:26,643
And how was the innie
gonna send you a message back?

379
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:29,980
That's his problem. I don't know.

380
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,398
Mark, unlock the door.

381
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:33,483
Why?

382
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,319
We need to talk.

383
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,112
- Oh, my God.
- Mark, unlock the--

384
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:41,658
Mark, unlock this fucking door!

385
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:48,957
Goddamn it. This goddamn fucking thing.

386
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:55,005
- What?
- There's an easier way.

387
00:45:57,633 --> 00:46:00,093
Didn't seem particularly easy for Petey.

388
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,764
Heard about the OTC.

389
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:12,064
Yeah, my sister talked to my innie.
He said a lot of things.

390
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,402
Did he tell her
your wife is alive at Lumon?

391
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,157
Who told you that?

392
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,419
Is she?

393
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:46,431
Is Gemma alive?

394
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,353
She was, the last time I saw her.

395
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:33,604
How could you not tell me?

396
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:36,690
We were interrupted, if you recall.

397
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:41,945
Mark, I want to help you,
but you have to trust me.

398
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:45,281
How the fu...

399
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:49,619
There is one way, and one way only,
to get information in and out of Lumon,

400
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,537
and that's reintegration.

401
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:55,791
I'm better at it now.
I can make it work with you.

402
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,253
I can sew together a version of you that
loves her with a version of you that can--

403
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,048
Yes. Do it.

404
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:05,928
You're sure?

405
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,764
I wanna see my wife.

406
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,488
The monitors differentiate
the five brain wave frequencies

407
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:08,699
of the innie and outie.

408
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:11,869
Delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma.

409
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,957
One frequency, two waves per oscilloscope.

410
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,336
The waves aren't in sync. Not yet, anyway.

411
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:24,464
That's what we're here to do.

412
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:28,177
Lean forward.

413
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,765
Is it gonna hurt?

414
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:36,226
Ideally not.

415
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,271
What does your mouth taste like?

416
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:42,941
Nothing.
Good.

418
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,166
What the fuck?

419
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:01,251
Shit.

420
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:09,676
You all right?

421
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:11,720
I don't know. Am I?

422
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:15,973
I'm gonna start with easy questions
and get more complex.

423
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:17,309
Do you remember protocol?

424
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,688
- Is that the first question?
- No, we haven't started yet.

425
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,856
Yes, I remember.

426
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:28,737
Relax your body. You should feel good
when this is over. Who am I?

427
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,364
Okay, so are--

428
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:33,032
We've started. Who am I?

429
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,325
Asal Reghabi.

430
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:35,410
Where are we?

431
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:37,246
My basement.

432
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:39,957
What was your mother's name?

433
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:41,542
Fern Scout.

434
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,460
What was her eye color?

435
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:48,464
Seriously?

436
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:51,425
Brown. It was brown.

437
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:52,719
Did you love her?

438
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:55,138
Yeah.

439
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,226
Name a dam.

440
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:01,311
Hoover.

441
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,315
What does MDR stand for?

442
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:07,191
What?

443
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,819
MDR.

444
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,448
- Mystic--
- That's wrong.

445
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:16,869
What is something
for which you feel shame?

446
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,414
Shame.

447
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:25,209
My dog died when I was a kid.
It was my fault.

448
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,587
Why?

449
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,798
I left the gate open.

450
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,593
Where were you born?

451
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:40,142
I'm not sure.

452
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,019
What month is it?

453
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,188
You mean, what quarter?

454
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,316
Wait.

455
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,902
What is your first memory?

456
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:54,072
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

457
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:57,117
Holy shit.

458
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,786
- I don't know. I don't remember.
- Tell me.

459
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,165
- Tell me your first memory.
- I don't remember.

460
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,875
<i>Hey there, you on the table.</i>

461
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:08,170
<i>I wonder if you'd mind taking
a brief survey.</i>

462
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,048
<i>Five questions.</i>

463
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:15,135
<i>To start out, who are you?</i>
