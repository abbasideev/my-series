1
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:18,704
Father.

2
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,291
A momentous day.

3
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,168
Yes.

4
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,215
Won't you eat?

5
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,093
I'll watch.

6
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,891
We're seeing to Mr. Bailiff.

7
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,487
I wish you'd take them raw.

8
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,924
Unveil.

9
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,053
Eustice Huang.

10
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:08,350
Today marks the end
of your Wintertide Fellowship.

11
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,229
Congratulations.

12
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,316
Your bed will be moved
from your parents' home

13
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,572
to the Gunnel Eagan Empathy Center
in Svalbard,

14
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,367
where you will work
to steward global reforms.

15
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,496
I thought
I'd be finishing the quarter.

16
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,042
Empathy awaits, fellow Huang.

17
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,338
You may resume your duties for the day.

18
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,841
A shuttle will pick you up at dusk.

19
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,720
But first...

20
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,807
lay the game on the table.

21
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,444
The handbook requires that you mark
this betterment with a material sacrifice.

22
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,616
I have chosen your ring toss game
as a proper totem.

23
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,981
Again.

24
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,446
Again.

25
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,583
Asher picked up the kids.

26
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,836
Outstanding.

27
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,724
I kissed your innie.

28
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,186
Beg pardon?

29
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,566
I saw your innie again at Lumon.

30
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,194
And right before I left,

31
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,491
we ended up kissing for about a minute.

32
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,753
What?

33
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,298
I'm sorry.

34
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,846
How?

35
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,473
What the fuck? Like...

36
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,600
It didn't f--

37
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,018
It didn't what?

38
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,688
It didn't mean anything?

39
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,107
I wasn't going to say that.

40
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,860
Wow.

41
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,945
Yeah.

42
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,363
You've been adrift.

43
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,407
You know that.

44
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,953
This is so many
fucking dimensions of fucked.

45
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:16,913
He just...

46
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,248
He reminds me of how you used to be.

47
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,374
- Okay.
- Dylan?

48
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,671
I'm gonna go to work and earn
a paycheck to feed our children.

49
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,298
- Will you st--
- And I'm gonna respectfully request

50
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,633
that you don't follow me there

51
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,968
and use my own body
to fucking cheat on me.

52
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,260
- Don't leave.
- You know what?

53
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,057
Since I would have no way of
knowing if that's happening or not...

54
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,767
I don't know. Maybe I just go quit.

55
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,019
Maybe I go in and I quit
and I just end his existence.

56
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,272
How about that?

57
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,728
Burt.

58
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,573
"They may be also connected

59
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:38,954
to several recent
disappearances or deaths.

60
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:44,667
Goodman may have participated

61
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:50,841
as a low-level Lumon enforcer or goon."

62
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,638
"Lumon goon." That stings.

63
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,103
We never used words like that.

64
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:13,405
With Lumon it's very specific language.

65
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,745
That was before. I...

66
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,540
I know now that I was wrong.

67
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,960
I know you're not with them.

68
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,802
Would you go for a ride with me?

69
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,850
Burt, I'm sorry. I...

70
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,364
Go for a ride with me.

71
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:29,814
<i>Yes?</i>

72
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,691
- It's nine o'clock.
- <i>And?</i>

73
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,944
The numbers aren't moving.

74
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,737
<i>The numbers aren't moving.</i>

75
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,115
<i>He may just be running late.</i>

76
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,326
The final quota was promised today.

77
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,996
<i>Get him here now.</i>

78
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,723
Hello?

79
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,684
Mark?

80
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,235
- Do you know where you are?
- I'm fine.

81
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,654
All right. Where are you?

82
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,282
Smelly fucking car.

83
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,035
That's nice.

84
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,747
And how about me?
Am I me or a copy machine?

85
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,417
Tragically, you're you.

86
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,721
This is a mistake.

87
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,431
I'm sorry. The wind was whistling

88
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,059
over the hole in the back of your skull,
so I didn't quite get that.

89
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,437
Did you just call my plan
a fucking mistake?

90
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,690
We told her everything.

91
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,526
She told us shit.

92
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:57,860
We can't trust her.

93
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,904
Yeah.

94
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,741
This is it.

95
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,688
Looks like she's not here yet.

96
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,948
I mean, what if it's a trap?

97
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,075
Maybe it is, I don't know. Maybe it's not.

98
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,703
But we fucking need her.

99
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,007
Don't answer it.

100
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,063
- Where's Mark?
- Excuse me?

101
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,609
This is the second day in a row
he's not here. Is he coming in?

102
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,279
Nondisclosure policy forbids.

103
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,033
He had a nosebleed before.

104
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,326
Is he okay?

105
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,663
Why?

106
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,957
He's Department Chief.

107
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,669
Dylan is. In Mark's absence.

108
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,547
Kinda like you and Cobel.

109
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,091
Replace one part with another.

110
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,763
That's enough, Helly R.

111
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,146
Don't you mean Helly E?

112
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,776
Helena Eagan is my employer.

113
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:06,698
You are my subordinate and this
behavior constitutes insubordination.

114
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,953
Yeah, no shit.

115
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,668
Leave it open.

116
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,310
I told you about us.

117
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,774
What?

118
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,945
I told my husband

119
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,533
about you and me this morning.

120
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,874
Was he glad for us?

121
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,002
No.

122
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:07,801
Well, he should be because I'm...
I'm making you happy.

123
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,053
I know.

124
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,972
And he's not.

125
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,351
I can't see you anymore.

126
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,230
He threatened to quit.

127
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,524
And I don't know if he's still going to.

128
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,277
But maybe if I tell him
that this is over--

129
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,906
- No. Hold on.
- This is all my fault.

130
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,659
- I never should have come here.
- Wait.

131
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,413
Gretchen, my life started
when you came here.

132
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,582
That's not true.

133
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,876
You have so much going for you.

134
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,003
No, I have nothing else.

135
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:48,717
I have this and
I have fucking pencil erasers.

136
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,511
I'm sorry, I have to go.

137
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,930
No, wait, wait.

138
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,975
Gretchen G--

139
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,729
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

140
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,317
And I know I'm just an innie,
but I love you all the way, I do.

141
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,153
Gretchen...

142
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,113
I made this for you.

143
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,782
I can give you a life. Please.

144
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,218
I'm so sorry.

145
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,097
Gretchen.

146
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,642
Gretchen!

147
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,427
You should keep it.

148
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,264
Give it to someone you meet down here.

149
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,144
It's just O&D and the goat people.

150
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,439
That we know of.

151
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,110
She's my wife.

152
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,990
She's not your wife...

153
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,538
Because no one would treat someone
they love the way she's treating you.

154
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,123
Like all the outies treat us.

155
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,833
Like everything's for them.

156
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,879
Okay, well,
what the fuck is there to do about it?

157
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,009
At the end of the day, we're still stuck
down here, with no lives and no family.

158
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,095
Irving was your family.

159
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,307
- Dude.
- And he left you a message.

160
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,351
The black hallway.

161
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,521
I don't know if he knew where it leads,
but he thought it was important

162
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,564
and they convinced you
to turn your back on him

163
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,651
for some outie woman you don't even know.

164
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,156
You know it's your fault
we're down here at all, right?

165
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,535
No, it's not.

166
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,119
And if we're so different from our outies,

167
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,623
then how come we couldn't tell
when you were gone?

168
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,086
Irving could.

169
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,715
Mark couldn't.

170
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,766
Sorry, I guess
I'm an asshole down here too.

171
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,244
Hello, Mark.

172
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,749
How are you?

173
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,337
Oh, my God, so good.

174
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,631
My wife's being held prisoner at Lumon

175
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,842
and I just got brain surgery
in my basement.

176
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,136
How have you been?

177
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,931
We're allies now, there's no need to--

178
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,099
We're allies now,
we're not neighbors anymore?

179
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,685
- Sorry, I just... I guess I'm confused.
- Can you...

180
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,312
This birthing cabin,
you can take us there, right?

181
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,313
So we can talk to his innie.

182
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,690
Not yet.

183
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,193
Even under the cover of dark,
it's perilous.

184
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,361
We wait for night.

185
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,988
- It's perilous. Okay.
- Okay, yeah.

186
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,698
You want us to wait until the evening?

187
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,618
We don't even know
if he's completed the file yet.

188
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,370
I assume no.

189
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,830
What file?

190
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,594
Cold Harbor.

191
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,142
And if you've completed it...

192
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,354
well...

193
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,864
"Well" what?

194
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,035
She's already dead.

195
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,412
Jesus Christ.

196
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,582
She better be fucking alive.

197
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,629
- No! Fuck this. We're leaving. Right now.
- Hold on. Wait,

198
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,131
- Mark-- Okay...
- I'm trying to help you.

199
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,174
Mark.

200
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:25,970
She is there and we are out here
in the middle of fucking nowhere.

201
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,388
I know
and we're gonna get her out,

202
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,516
but listen, that's what
we're doing here, right?

203
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,852
Call Mr. Milchick.

204
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,772
Tell him you're unwell
and won't be coming in today.

205
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:37,649
Do it now.

206
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,028
Oh, my God.

207
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,324
If he smells chicanery,
he'll lock you out of the building.

208
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,201
- How about fuck off? How about that?
- Wait.

209
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,911
- I mean...
- Mark.

210
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,787
- No, fuck that. No...
- Hold on. Stop. Don't go anywhere.

211
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,997
- ...no fucking way.
- Mark, wait.

212
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,248
- Listen to me.
- Absolutely not.

213
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,502
- Do you have any idea how insane she is?
- Yes, I do.

214
00:22:57,503 --> 00:23:00,839
- Do you know what she did?
- Mark, listen to me.

215
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,799
- Listen to me. Take a breath.
- No, I can't.

216
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,009
- We can't do it.
- Mark,

217
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,054
there is literally no other option than
to do what the fuck she says right now.

218
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,640
For Gemma.

219
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,610
She knows where she is, Mark.

220
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,020
Okay, Irving.

221
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:39,855
Fuck this place.

222
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,717
I never hurt anyone.

223
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,345
I want you to know that.

224
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,351
I drove people places.

225
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,563
I didn't ask what happened to them
once they get there.

226
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,449
Is that what today is?

227
00:25:55,514 --> 00:26:00,561
I'm sure you know this is very
disappointing and reeks of ingratitude.

228
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:07,733
Done.

229
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,944
Anything else?

230
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,029
Key card.

231
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:28,088
Please report to the elevator and wait.

232
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,553
I'm sorry, Dylan G.

233
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,101
I should have facilitated better.

234
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,188
That's enough.

235
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:49,943
It's not your fault.

236
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,415
<i>So this is "tightening the leash"?</i>

237
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:09,087
Our most vital refiner
missing in the wind,

238
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,925
on what was to be Lumon's finest day.

239
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,221
This is your fault.

240
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,561
I have followed protocol, Mr. Drummond,

241
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,607
but I thank you for your remonstration.

242
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:33,153
A needlessly complex
word for a simple idea.

243
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,325
Apologize for the word.

244
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,497
- Sir--
- Apologize for the word.

245
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,339
I apologize.

246
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,800
Shorter.

247
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,598
I'm sorry.

248
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,267
Again.

249
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,855
Mr. Drummond...

250
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,649
Again.

251
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,492
Devour feculence.

252
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:30,335
It means "eat shit," Mr. Drummond.

253
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:39,386
- What did you just say to me?
- I am manager of the severed floor,

254
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,889
which means two things.

255
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:47,644
First, I am owed a measure of respect,
even by my superiors.

256
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:54,902
Second, and more obvious, that said floor
comprises the whole of my jurisdiction.

257
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,740
To put that monosyllabically,

258
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,950
it's not my fault

259
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:07,080
what Mark Scout does
when he is not at work.

260
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,459
It's yours.

261
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,296
Mr. Scout. Where are you?

262
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,050
Well, I'm...

263
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:04,262
I was worried about these nosebleeds.

264
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:08,140
So we drove to this clinic
out in Soil Hill

265
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,562
and, you know,
they want to do a few more tests.

266
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,232
Let me send a car.

267
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,234
You are a priority employee

268
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:19,986
and you should be under Lumon care.

269
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,989
<i>May I get your exact location?</i>

270
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,408
I...

271
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:27,995
Mr. Scout?

272
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:40,257
I'm not sick.

273
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:46,555
I just needed the day, okay?

274
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,019
May I ask why?

275
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:56,731
No.

276
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,817
I've just got life stuff.

277
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,738
<i>Isn't that what Lumon's all about?</i>

278
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,115
Balance?

279
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,912
<i>I mean, work is just work, right?</i>

280
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,750
Do you know what I mean, Mr. Milchick?

281
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:33,852
Mr. Milchick?

282
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:50,244
I have your word
you report to work tomorrow?

283
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:58,669
You do. Yeah, I'll be there. I promise.

284
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,381
Good. And thank you for calling.

285
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,549
Here you go, sir.

286
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,676
Thanks.

287
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,691
This line goes as far as you can go.

288
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:06,778
I can't know where you get off.

289
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,656
And you can never come back to Kier.

290
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,575
Do you understand?

291
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,080
No.

292
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:21,335
Won't Lumon come after you?

293
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,594
You asked me why I severed...

294
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:38,142
I liked the idea that
I could be innocent again.

295
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,268
Part of me.

296
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:43,815
But then my innocent part
fell in love with you.

297
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,451
I want to remember it.

298
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,373
Probably better we don't.

299
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,046
I've never been loved before.

300
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,090
Not really.

301
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,467
Well, now you have.

302
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:13,512
How does it feel?

303
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,100
I don't know. I...

304
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,522
Don't you want to know how it felt?

305
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,774
It's not possible.

306
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,234
Burt...

307
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,320
It's okay.

308
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:32,697
Just go.

309
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,908
I'm... I've never had this.

310
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,660
- I know.
- My whole life.

311
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,037
I know.

312
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,123
I want to.

313
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,500
I wanna have it.

314
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,170
Irving.

315
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:49,755
I'm ready.

316
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,181
I'm ready.

317
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,148
I'm ready.

318
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:11,862
I'm ready.

319
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,281
We can't.

320
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:15,699
I'm ready.

321
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:18,785
We can't.

322
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,247
We can't!

323
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,184
Bon voyage...

324
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:45,395
buddy.

325
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,567
Burt...

326
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,238
bye.

327
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:38,795
Left, left, right.

332
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:57,272
Fuck.

335
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:12,704
You tricked me.

336
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,752
My Helly.

337
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:23,549
What the fuck?

I'm looking for a gold thimble.

Hi, Mark.

347
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:04,733
- Wait. What?
- You're okay. You're fine.

348
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,985
No, no.

349
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,572
If you walk out that door,
he's just gonna come right back in again.

350
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:14,451
- What is this?
- It's gonna be okay.
