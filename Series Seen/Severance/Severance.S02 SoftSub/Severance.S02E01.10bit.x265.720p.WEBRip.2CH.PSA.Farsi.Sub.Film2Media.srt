1
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,553
[Mark] <i>Devon! Devon!</i>

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,264
[Helly] <i>No, no, no. Listen,
we're not happy. We're miserable.</i>

3
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,309
- [knocks on window]
- [Irving, muffled] <i>Burt!</i>

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,977
[Helly] <i>They torture us down there!</i>

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,062
[Mark] <i>Devon!</i>

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,897
- [Helly] <i>We're prisoners!</i>
- [Irving] <i>Burt!</i>

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,399
[Mark] <i>She's alive!</i>

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,506
- [gasps, pants]
- [elevator bell dings]

9
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,971
I suppose you're Mark S.

10
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,975
- I...
- I'm Mark W.

11
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,771
Who are you people?

12
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,773
[speaking Italian]

13
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,568
Would you be open to
using a different first name

14
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,112
to avoid confusion?

15
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,365
Welcome back, Mark S.

16
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,121
Been a minute.

17
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:15,880
[Mark] Where are they?

18
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,965
[Mr. Milchick] I think it's best
to save any queries

19
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,842
till we arrive at the management office.

20
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,093
[Mark] Were they fired?

21
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,180
[Mr. Milchick] You can leave the balloons
in the foyer by my old desk.

22
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,767
We've much to discuss,
and I don't want them distracting you.

23
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,268
I assure you, they won't be taken.

24
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,436
Mr. Milchick, please.

25
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,230
What you all did five months ago

26
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,982
was one of the most painful moments
in the history of this company.

27
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,900
Five months?

28
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,944
I, too, was wounded by it.

29
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:42,573
But we must be cut to heal, mustn't we?

30
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,450
Wait, did you say your old office?

31
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,868
Mark, this is Miss Huang.

32
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,453
Miss Huang, Mark S.

33
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,539
Hello.

34
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,834
She'll be happy to mind your balloons
while we chat.

35
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,378
Right this way, Mark.

36
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,176
You can shut it.

37
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,180
Is it normal for a child to...

38
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,683
Excuse the clutter.

39
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,858
Okay. What's happening?

40
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,778
Ms. Cobel is no longer with this company.

41
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,197
I now manage the severed floor.

42
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,658
What about my team?

43
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,369
We didn't fire them.

44
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,082
Helly R. and Irving B. both successfully
made contact with persons on the outside,

45
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,334
just as you did.

46
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,005
Dylan G.'s outie learned what happened
after the fact.

47
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,301
The four of you
have achieved international fame.

48
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,471
As a group, you've become known
as the face of severance reform.

49
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,474
- Severance ref...
- Have a seat, Mark.

50
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,394
Shortly before your mutiny,
we installed security doors

51
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,980
to keep you in MDR.

52
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:59,860
This accompanied a punitive rendition
of the Kier hymn performed by Ms. Cobel.

53
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:01,695
Do you recall?

54
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,031
I do.

55
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,664
I locked you in a room
like an animal, Mark.

56
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,082
As an unsevered man,

57
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,503
I'll carry that knowledge
the rest of my life.

58
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,963
But for the past five months,

59
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,966
we've been asking how a sadist
like Harmony Cobel

60
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,553
could take fertile root in Lumon soil.

61
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,555
And what that says about us.

62
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,393
We also know Ms. Cobel
was at your sister's home

63
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,854
when you awoke there.

64
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,691
Yeah. W-Why was that?

65
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,237
We believe she'd developed
an erotic fixation on you

66
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,155
and had plans to pursue both you
and your outie

67
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,075
in what might be termed "a throuple."

68
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,078
What?

69
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,539
Thankfully, she failed at this.

70
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,211
You still haven't told me
where my team is.

71
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,883
We tried for weeks to get them back, Mark.

72
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,719
None of them agreed.

73
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,933
We told them of the reforms,
but it wasn't enough.

74
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,645
Except for me?

75
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,859
Your outie insisted on returning.

76
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,445
In fact, he begged us to let him back
right away.

77
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,994
So the others, they... they refused?

78
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:34,997
Yes.

79
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,128
Well, I'd like to hear it from them.

80
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,135
That's not possible.

81
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,353
Enjoy your balloons.

82
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,211
[Mark W.] Yeah. We... We showed up
about an hour before you did.

83
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,172
It's a little cramped
compared to our old MDR,

84
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,673
but I love the green carpet.

85
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,259
Ours was a crème brûlée
and the keyboards were puce.

86
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,177
[employee] They were purple.

87
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,763
No. They were puce.
I know because it makes me nauseous,

88
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,931
and I hate sweets.

89
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,059
Speaking of which, how much do we see
of that Mr. "Milkshake"?

90
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,101
Milchick.

91
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,102
[Mark W.] What?

92
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,943
Uh, it's Milchick, not milkshake.
And I don't know.

93
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:51,280
Marco,
where I can find some ink, uh, pencils?

94
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,366
Uh, supply closet.

95
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,538
[speaking Italian]

96
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,331
I'll show ya.

97
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,423
- So, did you really see the outie world?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,592
[chuckles] How's the sky?

99
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,761
I don't know.

100
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,138
- What, you didn't see it? [chuckles]
- Well, I went outside for a second,

101
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,559
but I was distracted by my brother-in-law.

102
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,685
Seriously?

103
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,521
Because we made a list of
what we'd most like to see on the outside.

104
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,023
And, uh, sky was an easy number one.
[chuckles]

105
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,442
Brothers-in-law weren't even on the list.

106
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,443
<i>Grazie.</i>

107
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,863
Could you tell what state we were in?

108
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,615
Because three of us put Wyoming
on our input survey.

109
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,992
- Did you see any buttes?
- No.

110
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:36,993
Oh, my God. How's wind?

111
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,661
Is it just like getting breathed on,
kind of?

112
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,162
Hello, Refiners.

113
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,706
Hello, Miss Huang.

114
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,959
[Mark W.] Oh, no. It's the ball game.

115
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,161
Let's head to the kitchenette.

116
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,729
Okay. So,

117
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,480
my name is Miss Huang.

118
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,193
It's my first day here as deputy manager.

119
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:16,115
I guess something about me is that
before this, I was a crossing guard.

120
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,201
[chuckles]

121
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,543
Mark W.?

122
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,795
Why are you a child?

123
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,175
Because of when I was born.

124
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,598
Right. I'm Mark W.

125
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,351
I'm from the MDR department of branch 5X,

126
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,354
where I worked with Gwendolyn Y.

127
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,234
Kind of a fun fact about me is that
I thought I'd be permanently retired

128
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,986
when my branch shut down.

129
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,781
So this is a nice surprise.

130
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,034
Mark S.?

131
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,246
[clicks tongue] Okay.

132
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,084
[clicks tongue]

133
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,011
I'm Mark S.

134
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,809
And, uh, I've been here about two years.

135
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,649
Something about me...

136
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,746
is...

137
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:54,173
that I am lucky enough
to have made four new friends today.

138
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,925
- [laughs]
- That's nice, Mark.

139
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,179
But I have to remind you
that I'm a supervisor,

140
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,556
not a friend.

141
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,744
Three new friends.

142
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,250
Okay.

143
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,213
Congratulations to our
two Marks. And now...

144
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,351
[sighs]

145
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,565
[sniffs]

146
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:06,495
[beeps]

147
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,126
[elevator bell dings]

148
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,213
[elevator bell dings]

149
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,508
[elevator bell dings]

150
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,396
What's your perpetuity wing like?

151
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,524
- Do the Eagans move?
- Uh, no.

152
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,901
Huh.
Probably because it's an older branch.

153
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,486
- Ours were animatronic.
- Oh.

154
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,530
They even did
this little choreographed dance.

155
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,741
So yours just stand there? That's weird.

156
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,995
[Italian employee] In my first
perpetuity wing, the Eagans were brooms.

157
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,080
[Gwendolyn] Brooms?

158
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,915
- Each with a face made of a plate.
- A plate?

159
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,959
We were very poor.

160
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,419
[Gwendolyn] Did you guys
have the CPR dummies?

161
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,963
- [Italian employee] Yeah.
- Hmm. What were those made of?

162
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,174
- Brooms.
- [Mark W.] Did you have an elevator?

163
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,468
[Italian employee] We had...
How do you say, um, a rope.

164
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,637
[Gwendolyn] Jesus.

165
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,071
I'm heading out. You good?

166
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,616
Yep. Just about to close out.

167
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,118
Ah, good. Thank you.

168
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,831
You know, my old team
was a bunch of dirtbags.

169
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,213
We never hit quota. Not once.

170
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,344
But it seems like you really liked yours.

171
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,390
So, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,274
Good night, Mark.

173
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,901
Good night.

174
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,897
- [scanner beeps]
- [elevator bell dings]

175
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,396
Hey, everybody.

176
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,523
[Mr. Milchick] "Dear Outie,

177
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,818
I don't know if this will reach you,
but I'm writing to alert you

178
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,112
of the heinous conditions
in the severed office

179
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,073
to which you have transferred me.

180
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,871
The branch is run by a shambolic rube
who goes by Milkshake."

181
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,580
Oh, my God.

182
00:15:55,581 --> 00:16:00,711
"A man whose stupidity is rivaled
only by that of the nine core principles.

183
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,590
If you must continue to send me here,
please consider strapping a bomb to me,

184
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:11,138
so that I may explode both Milkshake
and the very spirit of Kier Eagan.

185
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:15,517
Wrathfully, your innie, Mark W."

186
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,147
Oh, my God. That's... [stammers]
very serious.

187
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,483
Is it earnest?

188
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,447
Mm-mmm.

189
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,783
Do you really think I'm a shambolic rube?

190
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,954
Wait, you think I wrote this note?

191
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:37,872
[speaking Italian]

192
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,541
Were you going to frame all of us
or just Mark W.?

193
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,171
Clever way to secure the name
for yourself, I suppose?

194
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:49,008
- I don't know why you hate this team.
- [Mark] I don't hate this team.

195
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,595
You didn't even
disguise your own handwriting.

196
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,353
You know what?
I don't even know who this team is.

197
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,814
I told you. I want my team.

198
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,484
Which part of that don't you understand?

199
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,403
[inhales deeply]

200
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:16,035
Mark S., at this time,
I revoke your status as Department Chief,

201
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,998
which will be transferred
to your intended victim, Mark W.

202
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,293
I accept.

203
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,254
You will be relegated to the office

204
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,258
and must check in regularly
as to your progress.

205
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,430
Do you even have a brother-in-law, asshole?

206
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,103
What's funny?

207
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,730
[chuckles]

208
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,067
You don't know what I did
to the kitchenette yet, do you?

209
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,654
[laughing]

210
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,375
Goddamn it.

211
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,258
Hey!

212
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,723
You're definitely not supposed to do that.

213
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,103
Mr. Milchick,
I've got Mark S. in your office.

214
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,355
He's got the speaker.

215
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:31,862
Hello? Is anyone there? Is the Board on?
It's Mark S. from Macrodata Refinement.

216
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,446
[static feedback]

217
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,032
Okay. Well... [stammers]
if you're there, please listen.

218
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,785
Now, I know that you want to
do the right thing for severed people,

219
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,705
- which is why I need to see my team again.
- [Mr. Milchick] Mark!

220
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,917
If we truly are the face
of severance reform, as you say,

221
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:49,003
- then they deserve a chance.
- [Mr. Milchick] Mark!

222
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,505
[Mark] Please. They're my friends!

223
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,841
You can't just make them disappear!
Please!

224
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,386
[breathing heavily]

225
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,070
[Mark] Um, look, Mr. Milchick, I only
went to the Board because I cannot...

226
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,074
[Mr. Milchick] The Board
does not converse with innies.

227
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,620
It is clear your outie's fame
has gone to your innie's head.

228
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:27,668
No, my innie just wants his coworkers back
so we can serve Kier together.

229
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,179
- [beeps]
- [elevator bell dings]

230
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,640
Are you firing me?

231
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,851
On you go.

232
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,776
Why can't you just bring them back?

233
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,571
Goodbye, Mark S.

234
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:57,864
Wait!

235
00:19:58,824 --> 00:19:59,908
[elevator bell dings]

236
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:06,748
[elevator bell dings]

237
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,585
[whimpering, panting]

238
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:13,964
[elevator doors open]

239
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,458
- [elevator bell dings]
- [doors open]

240
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,167
- Dylan!
- Mark.

241
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,251
- Did it work?
- It worked.

242
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,837
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

243
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,714
Milchick was... I didn't think
I was coming back.

244
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,674
- I've been back a couple days already.
- What?

245
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,635
Yeah. And they had a whole new team.

246
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,303
- Cobel just replaced us?
- No, no, no, no.

247
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,055
Cobel's gone. Milchick's in charge.

248
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,558
Okay, so the man who just tackled me
and cut up my best belt is our boss now?

249
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,143
- Fuck me.
- Wait, wait. He tackled you?

250
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,479
Yeah, bad. Which... I mean, fair,
I tackled the man first,

251
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,231
but I didn't fuck with his belt.

252
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,358
"Kier pardons his betrayers"?

253
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,946
- [knocking]
- [Irving] Burt! Burt!

254
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,661
[Dylan] Dude, are you okay?

255
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,722
Irving, what happened?

256
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:50,602
The fuck? Irv! Dude, what's wrong?
You poor up there?

257
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,483
Come on. Come on.

258
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,651
[sighs]

259
00:21:58,652 --> 00:21:59,820
[elevator bell dings]

260
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,282
[panting]

261
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,199
[Mark] Helly!

262
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,785
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

263
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,996
I'm okay. [pants] Did you wake up?

264
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,998
- Yeah, yeah, it was crazy.
- Same.

265
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,749
Oh, my God. I was so worried about you.
[sniffles]

266
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,210
- How long has it been?
- [sighs] Five months, maybe more.

267
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,379
Where's everybody else?

268
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,881
Come on.

269
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,760
They're gone.

270
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,762
[Irving groans]

271
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,431
[Helly] Irving?

272
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,891
He won't come out.

273
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:30,893
[Irving groans]

274
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,187
- Hey, Irv?
- [Irving] I'm... I'm sorry, Mark.

275
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,523
I just need a moment, please.

276
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,609
[Mark] Okay. Take your time.

277
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,903
Okay, so what is going on?
We're not in trouble?

278
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,155
I don't think so. I mean,
Milchick said our message got out.

279
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,698
He said we're famous.

280
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,742
All of us equally
or one of us is, like, the star?

281
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,745
I don't know.
But then he tried to fire me, I think.

282
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,079
Why?

283
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,458
[stammers] Well, because I sort of
sabotaged the new people.

284
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,628
- New people?
- So, what the fuck happened up there?

285
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,671
Well, look, Milchick is probably coming.

286
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,299
Good. I owe him a fucking belt cut.
Now tell me.

287
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,551
What if they're waiting for us
to tell each other what happened

288
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,386
because they don't know what happened?

289
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,472
I mean, what if they're listening, Dylan?

290
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,183
Wait, what happened
to the security camera?

291
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,392
- [door unlocks]
- [Irving grunts, sniffs]

292
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,478
I...

293
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,939
I'm sorry, I was, uh...

294
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,400
just, uh...

295
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:24,988
Are you okay?

296
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,992
Hi, everyone. I'm Miss Huang.

297
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,789
Mr. Milchick's waiting for you
in the break room.

298
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,631
[Dylan] What the fuck is going on?
Why is she, like, eight?

299
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:44,800
[Mark] I don't know.

300
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:46,926
Wait, s-so they replaced us?

301
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,094
Uh, for a couple days.

302
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,178
Who was me?

303
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,347
They weren't, like, specific counterparts.

304
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,766
They were, I don't know, weird.

305
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,643
Okay. Well,
I don't think you should feel bad at all.

306
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,521
- Feel bad?
- Yeah, for ending their lives. Fuck 'em.

307
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,064
Well, I wasn't trying to...

308
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,732
[Dylan] No, dude,
I'm saying don't feel bad.

309
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,235
Like, I'm sure they deserved it.

310
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,088
[door beeps]

311
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,288
[door closes]

312
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:32,324
Macrodata Refinement. Welcome back.

313
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,286
Please, take a seat.

314
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,207
Irving, if you wouldn't mind
being in back.

315
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,751
Tall glass of water.

316
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,881
I guess the Board reconsidered my terms.

317
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,551
Guess so.

318
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:58,391
What you're about to see will be shown
to every innie who sets foot

319
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,227
in this building after today.

320
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:04,022
I hope it will give you
a sense of Lumon's feelings.

321
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,403
[whimsical music playing]

322
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,455
[bird screeches]

323
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:26,252
<i>Oh, hi. You probably don't recognize me
from this angle.</i>

324
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:30,006
<i>I'm the Lumon Administrative Building,
branch 501.</i>

325
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:32,800
<i>And you're sitting in me right now.</i>

326
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:36,429
<i>The name's a mouthful,
or as I say, a "doorful."</i>

327
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,891
<i>So you can just call me Lumon.</i>

328
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,896
<i>I've gone through a lot of changes
since my siring here in 1870.</i>

329
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:49,066
<i>But one thing I've always had
is a love for my workers,</i>

330
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,486
<i>both unsevered and severed.</i>

331
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,821
<i>Not to brag,</i>

332
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:57,575
<i>but my basement floor is one
of the premier severed workspaces</i>

333
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:01,746
<i>in the 206 countries
from which Lumon operates.</i>

334
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,583
<i>Hey, no running in my halls!</i>

335
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,418
<i>That tickles.</i>

336
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,794
[gulps]

337
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,380
[chuckles]

338
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:14,885
<i>But what makes a building truly happy?</i>

339
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:19,514
<i>This question came to light
when four MDR workers,</i>

340
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,557
<i>dissatisfied with their severed lives,</i>

341
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,770
<i>conspired to mount
what Lumon historians will forever call</i>

342
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:28,023
<i>the Macrodat Uprising.</i>

343
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:35,030
<i>Under my literal nose unfolded
a human drama of danger and intrigue.</i>

344
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:37,783
<i>Righteous anger.</i>

345
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,702
<i>Let's burn this place to the ground.</i>

346
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,001
[Lumon Administrative Building]
<i>Inspiration.</i>

347
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:53,090
<i>Why are we down here
still working in the dark?</i>

348
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,733
[Lumon Administrative Building] <i>And love.</i>

349
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,683
What the shit?

350
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:09,815
<i>The Macrodat Uprising
yielded bounteous reforms.</i>

351
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,611
<i>These include tasty new snacks,
like fruit leather, cut beans,</i>

352
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,574
<i>Christmas mints, and salsa.</i>

353
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,204
[mouthing] Ah... Wh...

354
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,039
<i>Not sold yet?</i>

355
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,792
<i>The incentives were also reformed</i>

356
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:34,923
<i>and now range from hall passes
to pineapple bobbing...</i>

357
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,557
<i>to our brand-new playful mirror room.</i>

358
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:52,023
<i>You know, it's funny. I've sat by
this reflective pool my whole life,</i>

359
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:58,864
<i>yet it took the quiet courage of four
MDR heroes to show me who I really am.</i>

360
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,325
<i>They made quite a splash.</i>

361
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:07,873
<i>They sure did, Water Tower.
And I thank Kier for them.</i>

362
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:13,629
<i>I thank Kier for the Macrodat Uprising.</i>

363
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,232
I know we have our differences...

364
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:39,738
but I want you to know that
I truly respect each and every one of you.

365
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,659
And I don't wanna be your jailer.

366
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:51,165
By end of day, each of you will choose
whether you want to remain here.

367
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,002
Not your outies, but you.

368
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,005
If you start work on your file,
I'll assume you want to stay.

369
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,718
If not, I'll send you to the surface.
No ill will.

370
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,932
Maybe I'll even buy you
a drink at a bistro one day. [chuckles]

371
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,977
Like the rest of the severed floor,

372
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:14,648
the break room has no cameras
or microphones.

373
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:19,068
Privacy shouldn't mean packing
into a supply closet

374
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,363
like so many sardines. [chuckles]

375
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:30,622
I truly hope you all will choose to stay
and enjoy what you've helped build.

376
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,918
A new quarter. A fresh start.

377
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,671
For all of us.

378
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,267
[door closes]

379
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,311
What the hell was that?

380
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,439
Massive-ass head game is what that was.

381
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,443
So what the hell
did you guys see up there?

382
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:01,777
Well...

383
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,279
He said there were no microphones in here.

384
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,740
Yeah, he says a lot of shit,
so just fucking whisper it.

385
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:06,908
Okay.

386
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:12,205
[whispering] So, I was at a party
at my sister's house for Ricken Hale.

387
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,290
Wait, what?

388
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,124
You know Ricken Hale?

389
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,210
[Mark] He's my outie's brother-in-law.

390
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:18,669
What?

391
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,925
And for some reason, we both know Cobel.

392
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:24,843
[Dylan] That's insane.

393
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,721
Yeah. Well, there's something else.

394
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:32,975
Just before I switched back,
I found a wedding photo.

395
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:36,729
Now, I guess my outie's wife died
a few years ago.

396
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,314
Oh, shit.

397
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,025
Which, apparently, is part of
why I decided to get severed.

398
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,110
Except...

399
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:44,863
[chuckles]

400
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:50,702
the woman in the photo was Ms. Casey.

401
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:57,500
Ms. Casey is your wife?

402
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:58,918
Is my outie's wife.

403
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,503
But she's dead.

404
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,965
No, I know, but it was her.

405
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,720
Then she's down here.

406
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:13,016
No. I went to Wellness. It's gone.

407
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:14,976
What do you mean, gone?

408
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,688
I mean, it's gone.

409
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,150
Oh, my God. Mark, are you okay?

410
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,945
Yeah. Well, I don't know.

411
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:29,199
[stammers] What about you?
What did you see?

412
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:37,123
I saw the inside

413
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:40,836
of a really fucking boring apartment.

414
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,463
[Mark] So, you live by yourself?

415
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:45,549
Yeah.

416
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:51,513
I was watching some nature show on TV,
wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt.

417
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:56,517
[Dylan] What kind of T-shirt?
Did it feature, like, a band or pocket?

418
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,770
It was like a "save the gorillas" shirt.

419
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:00,855
Cool.

420
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,065
I guess.

421
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,319
And then what?

422
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:10,407
Uh, then I went outside and found a guy.
He... He looked like a gardener.

423
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,743
Told him everything. I think
he kind of thought it was bullshit.

424
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,995
But, uh, he said that
his brother was a cop

425
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,373
and that he would tell him everything.

426
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:25,339
I don't know.
Sorry, guys. I... I... I really tried.

427
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,135
A gardener?

428
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,430
Yeah.

429
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,599
A night gardener?

430
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:40,312
I... I think so. I mean, maybe
he has a different job during the day.

431
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,523
Oh.

432
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:44,066
What about you, Irv?

433
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,157
Do you s... suppose he's serious?

434
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:55,953
About letting us leave?

435
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,211
Irv, what did you see?

436
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,716
It's not our world up there.

437
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,262
That's what I saw.

438
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:16,723
Come on, man.

439
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,768
You can tell us.

440
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,940
[Helly] Yeah, it's okay.

441
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,777
Even if it's bad.

442
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:04,854
Irv.

443
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,441
I just wanna walk for a bit.

444
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,068
- I'll talk to him.
- No, no. We should all go.

445
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,320
No. He's fine, okay?

446
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:15,323
Let me talk him down. You go back to camp.
I'll get you if I need you.

447
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:16,844
- Are you sure? You...
- [Helly] But...

448
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:32,007
Hey, Irv's gonna be okay, right?

449
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,051
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

450
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:35,928
Dylan's on it.

451
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,972
And we have till the end of the day.

452
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,058
Yeah.

453
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:52,319
Did you guys look happy
in the wedding photo?

454
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:55,489
Yeah, we did.

455
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,665
You know, I never, like...
Ms. Casey and I never felt that way.

456
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:07,584
Okay.

457
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,713
So, what are you gonna do?

458
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,092
Well, uh...

459
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,138
I gotta get her out of here.

460
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:24,685
Right? I mean,
if she's my wife... [stammers]

461
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,896
Right. Of course.
I mean, assuming she's still here.

462
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,528
Though technically, strictly speaking,
she's not your wife.

463
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,489
I'm pretty sure
your outie bought the ring.

464
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:39,616
Sure.

465
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,538
Except, you know,
we're the same-ish person.

466
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,666
So, it's, uh, mushy.

467
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,252
[scoffs] It's m... It's mushy?

468
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:54,005
- Is that what it is? Mushy? Okay.
- It's... Yeah. Listen, Helly...

469
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:56,175
We're not the same, actually.

470
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,221
Us and the outies, we're not.

471
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,892
And speaking for myself,
I don't think we owe them shit.

472
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:10,147
But Ms. Casey is...

473
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:12,983
Well, she's one of us.

474
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:19,489
So, if you wanna help your outie
and find out what happened to her...

475
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,951
I'll help.

476
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,123
So you're staying?

477
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:33,128
I think I'm staying.

478
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,727
- Irv. Hold up.
- Leave me alone, Dylan.

479
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:54,525
Oka... Dude. Is it...
You can't leave until the end of the day.

480
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,069
Are you sure?

481
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,154
Irv.

482
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,698
I failed at the objective.

483
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,368
What?

484
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,828
I went to go find Burt.

485
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:09,831
Okay. Did you see him?

486
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:16,964
He's married,
or, at least, he's with someone.

487
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,634
I... I saw them through the window.

488
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:22,219
Shit.

489
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:25,722
I should be happy he's happy.

490
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:31,979
Yeah. But, um,
seems like you're probably not, right?

491
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,276
The last time I was happy
was when all I knew was MDR.

492
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,820
When I was good at my job

493
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,739
and not trying to be happy.

494
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,158
I'm going to leave, Dylan.

495
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,703
It is not leaving.
So stop fucking calling it that.

496
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,706
- I know, you want... I know...
- Just fucking try.

497
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,509
You're a good friend, Dylan.

498
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,681
[breathing deeply]

499
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,811
Before I went to Burt's,
I woke up in my apartment.

500
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:14,980
What?

501
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,525
I was standing in front of
some kind of easel.

502
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,444
Fuck. There's easels up there?

503
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:26,824
Yeah. My outie was working on
a painting of a hallway. A black hallway.

504
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,159
Like the break room one?

505
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,037
[Irving] No, it was different. Darker.

506
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:34,166
There was an elevator at the end
with a downward arrow.

507
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,334
He painted dozens of them.

508
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,251
Fuck. Why?

509
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:42,423
I don't know.
And I wanted you to know before I left.

510
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,091
- Okay. Well, you're not. You... No.
- [straining]

511
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,844
Stop it. Stop it. Listen to me.

512
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:51,015
Look, I'm sorry that outie Burt
has a hot husband or whatever.

513
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:54,435
But he is not the point.
Innie Burt is the guy you fell for,

514
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,730
and I know
because I encouraged the courtship.

515
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,066
I...

516
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,902
I want it to be over.

517
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:06,822
Okay. So then after you find
the black hallway or... [stammers]

518
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,701
I want the pain to be over.

519
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,413
If he's gone and I'm gone...

520
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:15,540
Stop saying that.

521
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,500
Then somehow, we'll be together.

522
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,668
He wouldn't want that.

523
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,753
How do you know?

524
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,007
Because I don't want that.

525
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,762
Because I would be sad,

526
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,889
and I would be less productive,

527
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,351
and I'm really good at what I do here,
whatever it is.

528
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:39,106
And you're part of what makes me
good at it. So please, do not go.

529
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,988
Dylan.

530
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,122
I'm your favorite perk.

531
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,625
Don't bring them into this.

532
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,295
All I'm saying is, if Burt was still here,

533
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:06,049
he would be telling you to stick around
and figure out what the fuck this is.

534
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:08,719
[Miss Huang] Dylan G.

535
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,685
Mr. Milchick would like to see you.

536
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,529
Right.

537
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:56,767
I know, but they said it would be
corrected by now.

538
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:59,728
It should be Mr. Milchick.

539
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:06,193
M-R-period-space-M-I-L-C-H-I-C-K.

540
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:09,987
- Well, I sympathize...
- Mr. Milchick...

541
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:14,409
but could you please see
that it's taken care of? Yes. Thank you.

542
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,578
If someone calls about my welcome screen,

543
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,288
I need you to put
that call through immediately.

544
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,374
Yes, sir.

545
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,377
You wanted to see me?

546
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,296
I did.

547
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:30,092
Thank you, Miss Huang.

548
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,143
You gonna apologize about the belt?

549
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,488
Your wife's name is Gretchen.

550
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:56,618
What?

551
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,246
She wanted you to know.

552
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:01,832
Come with me.

553
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:17,014
And I do apologize, Dylan,
for not being a better listener.

554
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,058
For not hearing your needs.

555
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:25,314
[chuckles] Take a look.

556
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,029
These are blueprints for a new renovation,

557
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,616
of which I chose
not to inform your colleagues.

558
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,870
It's called
the Outie Family Visitation Suite.

559
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:46,668
[chuckles] Are you saying
I could see my family here?

560
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:53,091
If you take the name of the room
at face value, I'd say yes.

561
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:57,386
Holy fuck.

562
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:59,431
[chuckles] The holiest.

563
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:03,477
Sadly, everyone else
in your department is single.

564
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:07,355
As such, I'm asking that you
keep this between us...

565
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:10,609
- Are... Are you...
- only to avoid resentment.

566
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:14,905
I'd hate for your friends to turn against
you after all you've done for them.

567
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,414
You okay?

568
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:49,749
[Dylan] I'm okay.

569
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,834
Where's Irv?

570
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:55,756
[Irving] Right here.

571
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:06,808
Irv. You okay?

572
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:09,520
I'm okay.

573
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:14,066
["God Walked Down" playing]
