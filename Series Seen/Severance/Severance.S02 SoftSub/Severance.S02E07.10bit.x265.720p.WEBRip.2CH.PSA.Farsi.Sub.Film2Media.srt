1
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,052
All set.

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,055
Thanks.

3
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,107
What do you got there?

4
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,068
Sorry. What do you got there?

5
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:13,823
Themes of religious conversion
in Tolstoy's <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>.

6
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,783
Oh, my God. Spoiler alert, please.

7
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,077
What about you?

8
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,329
- Are you reading...
- Me? Well... It's...

9
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
Oh, yeah, this is a real treat.

10
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,002
"All Quiet on the Western Blunt:

11
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,671
Drug Use by Enlisted Soldiers
during World War I."

12
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,257
- No, stop.
- No, that's what it is.

13
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,467
Kid's a genius.
You should flunk every other child.

14
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,053
I couldn't agree more.

15
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,893
I'm sorry. Who are you?

16
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,062
Gemma.

17
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,610
All right.

18
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,737
Mark.

19
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,490
- Nice to meet you, Mark.
- You too.

20
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,297
Gemma, where did you go?

21
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,214
He'll be okay.

22
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,633
There might be some deficits.

23
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,010
Hopefully, nothing long term.

24
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,095
Are you a doctor?

25
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,347
Do we need an ambulance?

26
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,059
Can you answer
one of my questions, please?

27
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,812
- Do we need an ambulance?
- No.

28
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,189
He's gonna sleep for a while.

29
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,732
Okay. How long?

30
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,108
Hard to say.

31
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,236
We'll need some equipment
from downstairs. Are you clumsy?

32
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,948
What? Why do you have equipment
in Mark's basement?

33
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,409
Your brother's reintegrating.

34
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,536
No, he's not.

35
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,787
- I know that was troubling.
- Okay.

36
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,206
I can tell that you're smarter than me,

37
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,291
so forgive me if I say this,
like, super plainly,

38
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,503
but if you give one solitary thought
to messing with my brother again,

39
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,756
I will throw you off a fucking bridge.

40
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,049
- Devon--
- We don't do that again.

41
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,800
- We'll discuss it later.
- Nope!

42
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,803
No. It's settled fucking law, lady, okay?

43
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,097
Just accept it.

44
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:25,933
The end.

45
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,227
It's what he wants.

46
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,020
What he wants is to know
whether Gemma's alive or not.

47
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:31,980
She is.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,442
Please don't mess with me.

49
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,987
She is alive.

50
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,363
You've eaten today, honey?

51
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,365
Yes.

52
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,077
Done your reading?

53
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,829
Fifty pages.

54
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,626
Calisthenics?

55
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,503
Yes.

56
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,467
If you were caught in a mudslide,

57
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,264
would you be more afraid
of suffocating or drowning?

58
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,352
Drowning.

59
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,045
How many rooms today?

60
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,798
Six.

61
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,403
Shit.

62
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,473
Ready?

63
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,691
There she is.

64
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,821
Could I please get a break?

65
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,656
Just for a little while.

66
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,451
But it's been six weeks.

67
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,205
I was just here.

68
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,332
I know.

69
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,626
Nobody likes the dentist.

70
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,129
I should have been an accountant
like my mom wanted.

71
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,510
Please, have a seat.

72
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,662
Excellent.

73
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,003
Now, let's see how we're doing.

74
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,674
Open wide, please.

75
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,065
How long was I in there?

76
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,608
Two hours.

77
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:01,930
Okay.

78
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,440
Oh, bud.

79
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,109
I need you back, m'lady.

80
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,112
Please come back.

81
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,993
- Hey. Oh, bless you.
- Hey.

82
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,286
Excuse me.

83
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,872
- Hi.
- Hey.

84
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,415
That was fun last night.

85
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,584
It was.

86
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,753
I'm sorry. I have a lecture at 3:00
on <i>Hadji Murad</i>

87
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,257
- and my notes are all over the place.
- No. That's... It's okay.

88
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,635
I just... I brought you something.

89
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,640
It's an ant farm.

90
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,520
Last night you said you liked ants. So...

91
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,315
I said I liked... I like plants.

92
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,776
Plants.

93
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,363
- I hate ants.
- Oh, shit.

94
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,701
- But I... I love farms.
- Good.

95
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,162
I'm so fucking behind.

96
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,539
I'm not even here.

97
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,376
You're not here? Okay.

98
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,547
What are you doing? What are you doing?

99
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,055
Yeah.

100
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,769
- Really?
- Well, I mean, you know, it was on sale.

101
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:17,732
And who's putting it together,
Mr. Handyman? You?

102
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,984
I happen to be quite handy.

103
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,360
No, you're not.

104
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,779
- What? How dare you.
- Handsy.

105
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,948
Handsy?

106
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,910
All right. Maybe I am kinda handsy.

107
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,621
- Yeah?
- I like it.

108
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,262
Yeah. Well...

109
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,097
This is what I was hoping would come up.

110
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,014
What happened?

111
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,058
It really, truly wasn't that bad.

112
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,394
For you. That's 'cause you can
scale walls like a gecko.

113
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:40,022
This... It was like half a mile
of just exposed rock face.

114
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,482
- Boulders. Fine.
- It sounds fun.

115
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,276
There were a few boulders.

116
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,279
Boulders? Babe, come on.
It was like the death zone of Everest.

117
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,905
Like Chomolungma.

118
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,824
- Any frozen bodies?
- No, I looked.

119
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,702
But I do have photo evidence.
Look at them.

120
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,662
- Oh, my God. What's wrong with you?
- Look.

121
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,497
- Yeah, Ricken, what is wrong with you?
- Yeah.

122
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,000
Hey, I belayed my first couloir
in middle school.

123
00:15:59,001 --> 00:15:59,917
- So, I...
- What?

124
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,252
What?

125
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,171
- That sounds painful.
- We all know what that means.

126
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,130
I'm sorry he said that.

127
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,257
Outdoorsmanship courses through my veins.

128
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,758
- I think it's hot.
- I make no apology for it.

129
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,468
Wait, how did you get down?

130
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,888
- I scooted on my ass.
- Are there photos of that?

131
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:12,889
No. It was a no-photo zone.

132
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,432
A no-photo death zone.

133
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,058
Exactly. Thank you.

134
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,519
You and I will ramble together someday.
The two of us.

135
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,812
It will be a grand adventure.

136
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,898
I feel like we spend
a lot of time together.

137
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,691
- Not enough. No, Mark.
- Really?

138
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,401
- Are you not drinking?
- What are we gonna do there?

139
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,445
Did you know you can purify urine into...

140
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,738
- Oh, fuck right off.
- ...drinkable water?

141
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:29,947
Why would I do that?

142
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,742
To experience the beauty
and wonder of nature.

143
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,368
But why is it you want to do this so bad?

144
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,245
- Okay.
- I want to know you better.

145
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,499
Why is it you need
to have me come with you...

146
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,583
Hey, hon. Do you know
where I put the keys?

147
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,006
- Are you okay? Oh, baby.
- No.

148
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:31,904
Ms. Casey.

149
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,531
I'm here to observe Helly R.

150
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,159
No one told me.

151
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:42,288
Ms. Cobel's orders.
I am to watch her for signs of sadness,

152
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,584
and verbally encourage her
to forgo further suicide attempts.

153
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,576
Are the severance barriers holding?

154
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,496
Yes, the technology is working.

155
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,960
You like her.

156
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,046
She's easy to like.

157
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,550
She is fond of me too, of course.

158
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,554
Didn't she try and break your fingers?

159
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,164
Hi. I'll be right with you.

160
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,249
Thanks.

161
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:27,788
You know...

162
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,376
it's the next step for a lot of people.

163
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:37,756
I love you.

164
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,217
I love you too.

165
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,679
I'm sorry.

166
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,390
You ready?

167
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,225
It's time.

168
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,608
Locked and loaded.

169
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,109
Third time's the charm.

170
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,485
That's what they say.

171
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,030
I'll write you a thank-you note.

172
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,657
You hate writing thank-you notes.

173
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,785
Oh, my God. I'm a little nervous.

174
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,871
Baby?

175
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,997
I said I'm a little nervous.

176
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,458
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

177
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,794
it's the final step and, you know,

178
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,841
there's a kid that's out there
just waiting for us.

179
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,719
Just got to reach out and grab her. Right?

180
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,554
What if it doesn't work?

181
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,224
Turn around and bend over.

182
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,647
Sorry. You okay?

183
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,258
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

184
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,719
<i>My mouth hurts.</i>

185
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,931
<i>Which room caused your mouth to hurt?</i>

186
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,225
<i>The first one.</i>

187
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,561
Wellington.

188
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,946
How many rooms did you visit today?

189
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,616
Six.

190
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,827
The Billings room, the Lucknow room,

191
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:18,124
St. Pierre, Cairns, Zurich, and...

192
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,792
The Wellington room.

193
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,712
The Wellington. Excellent.

194
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:27,092
And what happened in the rooms?
You remember nothing?

195
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,262
Nothing.

196
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,189
How did you feel in the hall?

197
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:45,444
Did you exit any of the rooms
feeling despair?

198
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,198
Fervor? Gaiety?

199
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,743
There's only one room
I haven't been to yet,

200
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,329
and today it had a name on it.

201
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,334
Cold Harbor.

202
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:06,882
So, what happens,
once I've been in all the rooms?

203
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:16,725
You will see the world again,
and the world will see you.

204
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,941
So, I'll see Mark?

205
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,529
Mark will benefit
from the world you're siring.

206
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,200
Kier will take away all his pain,
just as Kier has taken away yours.

207
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:43,001
Can you please just talk
like a normal person?

208
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,718
Good night, Gemma. Dream sweet.

209
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,034
Gemma, coffee's ready!

210
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:36,137
Is he okay?

211
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,305
He's stable.

212
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:38,932
It was an isolated event.

213
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,976
He's journeying now.

214
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,853
When will he wake up?

215
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,147
When he's ready to.

216
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:46,982
Great.

217
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,153
You really think this is gonna work?

218
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,572
There's no other choice.

219
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,830
There's an innie cabin.

220
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,582
Come again?

221
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,374
There... I mean, it's technically...

222
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,252
It's a cottage where severed people
become their innies,

223
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,545
and there was this woman--

224
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,881
Damona Birthing Retreat.

225
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,468
Well, so maybe if we go to the cabin,
we could talk to his innie, and he could--

226
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,721
They're two completely different things.

227
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,348
This is how you get Gemma out.

228
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,893
Really, this? Because this looks like
how you kill my brother.

229
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,647
You two are definitely related.

230
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,989
- I could call her.
- Who?

231
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,492
- Harmony Cobel.
- What? Why would you do that?

232
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,035
She runs the severed floor.

233
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,996
Not anymore, she doesn't.
She might know how to get in the cabin.

234
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,207
And, fuck, she might know
how to get to Gemma.

235
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,042
She's Lumon through and through.

236
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,670
She was raised by them. She's a soldier.

237
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,630
- It's a risk. I get that.
- A risk?

238
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:55,007
- Yeah.
- She will turn you over to them.

239
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,300
Both of us.

240
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,511
Everything I've done to fight, gone.

241
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:01,222
We resume the treatment
as soon as he wakes up.

242
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,517
Okay. I have custody
of his brain now. You don't.

243
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,769
I'm calling her.

244
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,742
- Well, then, I can't be a part of this.
- What?

245
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,495
If you do that... If you make that choice...

246
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,621
What are you...
No, seriously, what are you doing?

247
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,291
- Good luck.
- You can't leave him like this.

248
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,669
No, no, no, I can't do this without you.

249
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,922
You... Are you kidding?

250
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,091
You're leaving now?

251
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,969
This... This isn't my choice. It's yours.

252
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,846
No, I need you to stay. I can't...

253
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,682
I don't know what to do with this.
What do I do if he wakes up?

254
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,351
Do not call that woman.

255
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:47,895
Oh, my God.

256
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:00,908
Hey.

257
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,035
Chi...

258
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:07,288
- Mark?
- Chikha... Chikha...

259
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,583
- What are you trying to say?
- Chikhai...

260
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:12,960
Chik...

261
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,379
<i>Chikhai bardo?</i>

262
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,174
I don't know.
It looks like two guys fighting.

263
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:23,639
No, it's the same guy fighting himself,
defeating his own psyche. Ego death.

264
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,224
How do you know it's the same guy?

265
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:28,185
Well, the hair's the same.

266
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:31,522
That thing came in the mail?

267
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:35,483
Yeah. It's one of those things
where you have to draw a duck

268
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:37,110
or a rabbit or whatever.

269
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,697
I think I got onto the mailing list
at the clinic.

270
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,742
Why are you wasting your time with this?

271
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:49,121
Why are you being an asshole?

272
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,542
I'm not. I'm just... I don't know.
It seems kind of...

273
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,921
- weird.
- I'm enjoying this.

274
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,423
Or was, until you ruined it.

275
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,593
I think you might be
overreacting a little bit, Gemma.

276
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,470
Don't do that.

277
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,097
Do what?

278
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,767
- Tell me how I'm feeling.
- I have no idea how you're feeling.

279
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,228
Like shit. Beat to shit.

280
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,231
So let's stop.

281
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,849
It's okay. This is perfectly normal.

282
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,229
Let's get you set up with that meal.
Bon appétit.

283
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:38,523
Can I get you anything else? Coffee? Tea?

284
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,025
Another pillow...

285
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,201
He's stuck at 96%.

286
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,871
The nose bleeds set us back.

287
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,709
When he's done,
you're gonna have to say goodbye to her.

288
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,588
<i>I'm aware.</i>

289
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,677
<i>For Kier.</i>

290
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,433
For Kier.

291
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,900
Why are you wearing that stupid sweater?

292
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:56,393
<i>Dear Mr. Tisdale,</i>

293
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,606
<i>I cannot thank you enough...</i>

294
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,694
<i>for the thoughtful Christmas gift</i>

295
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,907
<i>you sent my husband and I this year.</i>

296
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,834
We have never owned

297
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:24,796
an electric grouter.

298
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:30,301
And we look forward

299
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:36,642
to the many happy

300
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,520
memories

301
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:43,398
it will

302
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,317
provide.

303
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,492
Come on now, sweetheart.
It's the last one.

304
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,461
Nothing...

305
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,463
says...

306
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,759
Christmas like...

307
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,554
grouting.

308
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,351
It's actually a de-grouter,

309
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,478
but close enough.

310
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,569
How much longer do I have to do this?

311
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,654
I told you, you're done.

312
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:37,077
But Christmas has a funny way
of coming back around each year.

313
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,170
It's always Christmas.

314
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:51,884
Let's go.

315
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:04,897
I love you.

316
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,613
I said, "I love you."

317
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,120
I love you too.

318
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:35,547
Hello, Gemma.

319
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:37,633
Dr. Mauer.

320
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:39,843
How are you feeling?

321
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,388
My hand hurts.

322
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:48,060
And what room caused your hand to hurt?

323
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,149
Allentown.

324
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:05,994
I want to go home.

325
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,550
Your husband remarried last year...

326
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,264
and he has a daughter now.

327
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,562
I don't believe you.

328
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,815
You've been gone a long time, Gemma.

329
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,192
He's moved on.

330
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,487
Maybe you've moved on too.

331
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,157
In one of the rooms. What do you think?

332
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:54,084
Do you feel yourself gravitating
towards one room or another?

333
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:58,797
Maybe you felt things behind those doors
you never felt with Mark.

334
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,467
Maybe I've seen it.

335
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:10,558
<i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>.

336
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,228
Let me guess. He dies at the end.

337
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:54,913
Gemma!

338
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,630
Gemma! Stop!

339
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:05,507
Gemma!

340
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,566
Hey.

341
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,277
You sure you don't want to come?

342
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:29,030
- It's charades.
- That's gonna be, like, 20 minutes of it.

343
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:30,699
Yeah. But, you know.

344
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:33,951
Or I could stay?

345
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,245
No, you should probably go.

346
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,665
I mean, this thing's
gotta be in tonight anyway, so...

347
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:44,045
Okay. Did you get the Denali thing I sent?

348
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:45,713
The... No.

349
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:49,175
I'll look at it. I'll check it out.

350
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:52,346
All right. Well, I'll be back
at, like, 10:00.

351
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,222
Okay.

352
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,349
I love you.

353
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,813
- I said--
- Oh, no, I love you too, hon. I'm sorry.

354
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,734
- Bye.
- See you.

00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,451
What's happening?

360
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,536
Nothing.

361
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,873
Your outie came in
for a public art exhibition

362
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,585
and found herself in the wrong elevator.

363
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,008
How long have I been--

364
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:15,052
If you wouldn't mind turning around
and heading back in,

365
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,680
it would be greatly appreciated.

366
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,683
- But--
- On you go.

367
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:38,660
- Where's--
- Thank you, Ms. Casey.

368
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,042
No.

369
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,122
Mark.

370
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:35,963
- Come on.
- Mark.

371
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,515
Mark?

372
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:32,769
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

373
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:35,939
Hi.

374
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,362
Hey.

375
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:52,039
Careful. Easy.

376
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,464
Oh, Mark.

377
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:03,926
Where'd you go?
