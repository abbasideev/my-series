1
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,641
You hear about that
clusterfuck up on North Pine?

2
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,392
Dutch Stevens' kid.

3
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,604
How the fuck do you flip
a two-ton snow plow?

4
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,023
With stupidity.

5
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,776
The apple don't fall far from the gutter.

6
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,402
Well, that's kind of you.

7
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,571
On the house.

8
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,448
Thank you.

9
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,869
Hey, Rose.

10
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,788
You want a refill?

11
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,668
You can top me off anytime.

12
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,838
I like the new do.

13
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,423
<i>Très chic.</i>

14
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,075
Harmony Cobel.

15
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,455
Well, flip my toboggan.

16
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,380
You want coffee?

17
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,091
No.

18
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,222
Tables are for paying customers.

19
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,351
Fine. Then buy me a coffee.

20
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,321
The town is older than I remember.

21
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,204
Frailer.

22
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,835
Yeah, well, with the market readjustment
from a few years ago

23
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,461
and the fluctuating interest rates,

24
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:04,550
there was a retrenchment from some
of the core infrastructure investments.

25
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,769
I need a favor.

26
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,398
But not here.

27
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,944
Meet me at the factory.

28
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,216
- Hey, Dot. Close up for me.
- Sure.

29
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,976
You know how fucked it is
to ask me to come here?

30
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,273
I need you to drive me to Sissy's.

31
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,698
No, thanks.

32
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:22,164
If they're watching the house,
they'll recognize my car.

33
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,085
How much trouble are you in?

34
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,299
Enough.

35
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,311
You know she still lives by the nine?

36
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,273
I assumed.

37
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,486
Then you know she's a fucking pariah here.

38
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,782
You can stay in the truck.

39
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,287
I need to get something.

40
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,084
Why would I help you with anything?

41
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,509
We were once chums.

42
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,682
Old colleagues lift each other up.

43
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,143
Colleagues?

44
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,608
Child fucking labor.

45
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,204
Kier and Imogene met at the Ether Mill,

46
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,707
you know that?

47
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,252
Was she hacking up a lung at the time?

48
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,087
I can smell it on your breath.

49
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,964
Pathetic.

50
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,924
Fuck you.

51
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,261
You can help me or not.

52
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:04,850
But I'll not be the punching dummy
for your resentments.

53
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,119
Coast is clear.

54
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,172
You're higher than a bearded vulture.

55
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,097
Tell her to drop dead for me.

56
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,693
You are not welcome here.

57
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,449
This is trespass.

58
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,328
I have a mind to call the authorities.

59
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,791
I do not want that huff peddler
on my property.

60
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,336
You gave him his thirst for it.

61
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,255
You've a liar's mouth.

62
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,319
Do you want to come down here
and tell me what this is all about?

63
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,875
What have you done with my things?

64
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,004
Sold. To the poor.

65
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,882
They weren't yours to sell.

66
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,217
I sit in this house.

67
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,302
You do not.

68
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,014
Has anyone been here?

69
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,059
No one comes here.

70
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,938
Or telephoned?

71
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,862
A Mr. Drummond.

72
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,824
And what did he want?

73
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,749
What have you done, little mouse?

74
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,629
Harmony!

75
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,089
I want the key to Mother's room.

76
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,552
That room stays shut
until all who remember her sit with Kier.

77
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:10,762
You know this.

78
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,598
Give me the key.

79
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,727
Why do you bring nothing but woe
into my life?

80
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,190
No, it is you who cursed this house
with woe.

81
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,735
I will not have this quarrel.

82
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,365
What were her last words?

83
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,204
Child, do not test me.

84
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,497
What were they?

85
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:46,256
She said nothing after you pulled the tube
from her gullet.

86
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:06,777
There was gratitude in her eyes
to be freed from her suffering.

87
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,449
If only she had been a believer.

88
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,119
Perhaps she would have found solace
in the nine.

89
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:37,891
You didn't have to listen to her wheezing
as I did, day after day.

90
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:49,653
I would have cared for her myself,
had I not been at school.

91
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,031
Where you belonged.

92
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,873
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

93
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,917
Your studies were more important.

94
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,629
Mr. Eagan saw Kier in you.

95
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,882
He really did.

96
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,760
And the Wintertide Fellowship--

97
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:18,974
Even at the factory, no apprentice
was more industrious than you.

98
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,356
Such a disappointment you've proven to be.

99
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,033
What did Drummond tell you?

100
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:42,455
Return and plead forgiveness, child.

101
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,249
The Eagans will grant it.

102
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,879
And show me mercy,

103
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,757
just like you did with Mother.

104
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,600
Where is the key?

105
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,991
All you will find in there is pain.

106
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,902
Where is it?

107
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,172
I found it!

108
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,098
Come on.

109
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,780
Don't! Stand away!

110
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,365
Get your harpy hands off me.

111
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:13,202
You've no salutation here,
you blighted snuff slave.

112
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,246
All right, I missed you too.
You smell like crow skin.

113
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,914
I'll phone somebody. I swear it!

114
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,542
Yeah, call everyone.
We'll have a fucking kegger.

115
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,793
This is a pure house.

116
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,463
Back off or I'll put you in the bay!

117
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,261
What is it? What happened?

118
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,430
Nothing. Came to get you.

119
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,057
She's not too happy about it.

120
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,976
Did you see something?

121
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:40,147
No, but it's cold as shit in the truck,
and I gotta get back.

122
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,609
I have to find it.

123
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,944
Find what?

124
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,824
Just give me a minute just to think.

125
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:11,970
I liked her.

126
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,898
You barely knew her.

127
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,984
She hated Lumon more than I did.

128
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,904
That's all I needed to know.

129
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,662
At least she doesn't have to live
with Sissy anymore.

130
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,237
You wanna get high?

131
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:27,898
Wow.

132
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:38,033
I haven't done that since I was eight.

133
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,164
You ready to man the vat for ten hours?

134
00:27:55,175 --> 00:28:00,430
It's so shameful that you sell it.

135
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,264
I don't think it's here.

136
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,685
What you're looking for.

137
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,111
Get out of here!

138
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,828
She wouldn't throw it away.

139
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,373
Find it?

140
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,879
Get the truck ready. And watch my head.

141
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,724
I'm going. Don't tell them I was here.

142
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:35,270
I would never bear falsity
to a steward of the Eagans.

143
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:41,276
Lumon destroyed this town.

144
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,654
You owe them no loyalty.

145
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,366
There was no town before the factory.

146
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,662
And what about your own employ?

147
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:57,376
Everything that you have,
you owe back to the Eagans as fealty.

148
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,547
Fealty?

149
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:09,471
Mine!

150
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,808
My designs!

151
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:14,768
Circuit blueprint...

152
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,937
Base code...

153
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,980
Overtime contingency...

154
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,941
Glasgow block. All of it.

155
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,987
Jame Eagan was the inventor.

156
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,322
So I've heard.

157
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:38,929
<i>Subtitle extract by: Dream Ports</i>
insta: @Dream_Ports

158
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,591
Extraordinary.

159
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,221
Why have you never spoken of this?

160
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,518
It was told Kier's knowledge is for all.

161
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,854
That is true.

162
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:06,069
That if I sought credit,
I would be banished.

163
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,670
I hope you die as painfully as she did.

164
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:29,051
It was her hand that removed the tube,
not mine.

165
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:31,386
No!

166
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,723
Your mother was a coward.

167
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:38,769
More sick in the soul than in the body.

168
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,648
Filled with malice and resentment.

169
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,654
I don't believe you!

170
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,115
I thought you were different...

171
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:55,911
my flower.

172
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:59,331
I tried to help you grow.

173
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:06,672
But now I see you are a weed,
just as she was.

174
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,342
Hey! Someone's comin'!

175
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:28,318
You better get going.

176
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,076
Hampton.

177
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:37,828
I'll see you around.

178
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,184
Come and tame these tempers, assholes.

179
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,697
<i>Mrs. Selvig? Thank fuck,
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

180
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,992
Yes, I'm aware.

181
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,953
<i>So, listen, Mark has been reintegrating.</i>

182
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:21,747
Reghabi?

183
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,456
<i>Yeah.</i>

184
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:25,625
And she hasn't killed him yet?

185
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,960
<i>No. I mean, I think he's okay?</i>

186
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,962
<i>But listen, we wanna try something else.</i>

187
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,089
Is Mark with you?

188
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,718
- <i>Uh-huh. Yes.</i>
- Put him on.

189
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,139
<i>Yeah. Hello?</i>

190
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,393
