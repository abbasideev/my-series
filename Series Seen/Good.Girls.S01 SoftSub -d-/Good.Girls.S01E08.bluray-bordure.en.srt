00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:50,077
you think it worked?

890
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,038
She got her wake-up.
Yeah?

Oh.

906

Yeah, he's dumb, too.

What does that mean?

912
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,332
He's part of some gang
that the feds got their eye on,

913
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,586
and, uh, we put him to work
for the good guys.

How'd you unload all that stuff?

Not gonna tell me, huh?

926
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,500
No, I am not.

927
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,294
I probably deserve that.

But I'm gonna ask for 15%
when we're up and running again,
