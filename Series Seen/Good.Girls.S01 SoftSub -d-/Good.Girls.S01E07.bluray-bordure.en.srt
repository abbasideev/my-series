533
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,443
since Jeff passed.

534
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,155
Oh. We didn't Know.

535
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,492
Yeah, he had a heart attack,
um, six months ago.

536
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,452
Oh, God, that's...
That's terrible.

537
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,537
We're so sorry.

538
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,039
And I'm so thankful
for your shopping club.

539
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:15,208
You know, I feel like
I finally have a shot

540
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,418
at getting my head above water. You know?

541

(SIGHS)

542
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,967
I'm just gonna rip off
the Band-Aid here, uh...

543
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,345
We know what you've been doing.

544
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,098
I don't understand.

545
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:34,769
(SIGHS) You've been
turning in the same cash, and it's okay.

546
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,522
You know, you obviously
have a lot on your plate,
and you're not in trouble.

547
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:41,234
But unfortunately,
we do have to let you go.

548
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,534
He's very cute.

549
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,414
(BABY FUSSING)
I'm so embarrassed.

550
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:55,748
Oh, please don't be.

551
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,041
You know, I ran out of time,

552
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,751
and I really needed the money.
(BABY CRYING)

553
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:01,004
No judgment here.
Uh-uh.

554
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,213
Oh, my God.

555
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:06,801
We'll just, uh, let ourselves out.

556
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,970
ANNIE: You take care, okay?

557
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:10,179
Good night.

558
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,264
(DOOR OPENS)

559
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:14,058
Wait, what...

560
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:16,895
What did you...

561
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:21,190
What did you mean when you said that
I turned in the same cash?

562
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,568
What?

563
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:26,696
I mean, how would
you know that I turned in
the exact same cash?

564
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,492
Obviously, we don't know that.

565
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,455
But we know from your survey
that you weren't

566
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,040
actually doing the shopping.

567
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,667
But that's not what she said, though.

568
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,628
Well, that's what I meant.

569
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,421
But it's not what you said.

570
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,257
I mean...

571
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,218
Do you guys check
serial numbers or something?

572
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,596
No.

573
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:53,222
Now, that...

574
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,016
That'd be crazy.

575
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,396
Girl, it is never easy to be let go.

576
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,815
Mmm.
Trust me, I know.
I've been there.

577
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,860
And we would've kept you on, but
it was corporate's call.

578
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,779
Right.

579
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,323
You know, um,

580
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:12,492
come to think of It, if I am being fired,

581
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:15,244
it seems like I should
probably hear that from corporate.

582
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:16,913
Right?
Not you guys.

583
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:18,748
So what, um...

584
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:21,084
What's their number?
ANNIE: They're closed.

585
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,795
Yeah.
I mean, it's what time?

586
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:25,755
Come to think of it, what's their name?

587
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,384
I...
I know... I Know you're upset.

588
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,885
No, I'm not upset.

589

But, you know, who I think might be
is the Better Business Bureau.

00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,558
Just hold on a minute.

00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,102
BETH: No, no, no.

592
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:40,353
Let her do it.

593
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,230
We don't have anything to hide.

594
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,731
Go ahead.

595
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:47,777
I don't Know what you've
gotten me involved in,

596
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,239
but it's something super-shady.

597
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,703
I'm calling the police.

Put down the phone.
Ashfield Police.

601
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:19,892
Put down the phone.

602
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,479
Hello. Hello, this is
the Ashfield Police,
do you have an emergency?

603
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,652
What do you want?

604
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,785
Who even let this bitch in?

605
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,870
Is she Tracy's friend?

606
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:41,456
Elena. Carpool or something.
(GROANS) Wow.

607
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,874
Yeah.
I mean,

608
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,168
we could let Rio
"handle it."

609
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,296
I'm just saying.

610
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:52,133
I don't want to, but,
you know, it would solve
the problem cleanly.

611
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:53,718
She's a single mother.

612
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,762
With a dead husband.
She's probably drowning in debt.

613
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,139
Oh, my God, you guys, it's not like
she's this great person.

614
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,432
She's blackmailing us.

615
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,142
I mean, that's illegal.

616
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:03,394
So is washing counterfeit money.

617
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,771
And robbing a grocery store.

618
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,606
And crossing the border
with counterfeit money.

619
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:08,357
(SIGHS) Okay! Okay.

620
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,236
(SIGHS) I mean, I hate to be the one
to say I told you so...

621
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,321
Then how about you don't.

622
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,698
But did I not tell you
this was a bad idea?

623
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,701
We never, ever should have brought
other people into this.

624
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,036
The system works.

625
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:22,580
Uh, clearly it doesn't.

626
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:24,248
Someone found the one flaw.

627
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,794
And is extorting us
to the tune of $10,000.

628
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,379
Okay, I know it would be
really nice and neat
to just make it my fault...

629
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,965
We were out.
We were done with the gang.

630
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,425
We were done with all of it.

631
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,262
Are you serious?
And then we went back and asked for more.

632
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,516
Because we needed the money
and you got on board real quick.

633
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,851
And now you're rolling
like some evil mastermind.

634
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,103

Don't you call her crazy!
Okay, pause.

638
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,113
You call her out all the time.

Okay. Thank you.

00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:58,449
But...

00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,284
Okay.

642
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:03,162
I see.

643
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,331
Okay,

644
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,084
I mean, I'm just the one
that held your hand

645

the hell of signing your divorce papers,

You know what?
Do what you want.

Pay her, don't pay her.
Just leave me the hell out of it.

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,770
Wait. Where are you going?

651
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,690

My blood.

00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:36,154
You can't just bail when things get bad.

654
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,656

that grocery store.

for like the last hour,
and I... I got worried.

Yeah, I couldn't sleep, and then I...

664
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,668
couldn't shower, So...

665
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:38,883
Do you mind if I turn off
the shower? Just...

666

gonna be insane.

667

00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:24,470
I mean, are you doing this for the kids?

Yes.

676
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:34,063

Yeah.

that I'll forget stuff,

685

so she writes them down on Post-its.

I would never forget that.

689
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,820
Because I have the Post-it.

690

It's just, like, our shtick, okay?

692
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,328
Yeah, but she doesn't know that
because she's only 11.

I have had a really tough week,

you could spare me the judgement...

really have a defense, but...

It's all coming back to me now.

So, do you want something to eat or...

703
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,609
Uh, what do you got?

704
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,612
Cheese and crackers.
Oh.

705
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:05,905
Mmm-hmm Okay.

706
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:06,989
Okay.

707
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,783
Ooh, what if...

It was so damn hot down there,

842

to separate.
