RUBY: Previously on Good Girls...

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,421
Why does a grocery store
even have this kind of money?

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,672
Because it's hella shady.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,383
Call your friends over
SO we can have a little talk.

5
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,094
He wants us to pick something up
for him in Canada.

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,888
It's just wrapping paper.

7
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:17,558
We have a business proposition
to clean your fake money.

8
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,477
What are you proposing?
Let us do it.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,396
Right here.
Fake money in, real money out.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,940
(WHISPERS)
What do you want?

11
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,441
You can't just walk in here.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,609
Your door was open.

13
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,694
DEAN: Beth, who's your new friend?

14
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,363
Is he the reason you're
not wearing your ring?

15
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:31,614
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:32,949
I want you out.
What?

17
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,283
Yeah, I want you gone now.

18
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,368
I have cancer.

19
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,371
Agent Turner.
I saw this guy.

20
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,790
Okay? He was with
the three of them before,
and I saw him again yesterday.

21
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:41,874
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,876
Whatever they're into, he's involved.

23
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:46,587
TURNER: Hi. I'm looking for Mrs. Boland.

24
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,589
Can I help you?
I'm hoping you can.

25
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,635
Cute kids.

26
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,095
Oh, thanks.
We like them.

27
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:55,680
Yeah, most of the time.

28
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,640
How's the neighborhood treating you?

29
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,016
Pretty quiet mostly, or...

30
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,142
Is something going on?

31
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:02,937
Just some ugliness
bleeding in from the city.

32
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,230
We try to stay on top of it.

33
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,856
Well, that sounds scary.

34
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,234
Yeah. Have you guys seen anything weird?

35
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,318
Like what?

36
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,029
You know, people that don't
quite go with the vibe here.

37
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,742
Actually, I have.
That guy.

38
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,412
(STUTTERS) The guy...

39
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:23,791
Question. Is it illegal
to throw dog poop into
other people's trash bins?

40
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,127
Because we have this guy
in the neighborhood who...

41
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,422
(CHUCKLES) It's probably
not FBI jurisdiction.

42
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,756
I'm guessing not.

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,384
Those are government bins, right? So...

44
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:34,927
(CHUCKLES)

45
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,638
Let me know if you see anything
out of the ordinary.

46
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,808
Copy that. We will be your eyes and ears.

47
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,061
Yes. And thank you, Agent Turner.

48
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,606
Jimmy.

49
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,609
DEAN: Here, I'll show you out.

50
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,612
So, yeah, this guy,
he walks his dog, and...
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

51
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:02,663
BETH: We shouldn't do it.

52
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,206
What do you mean we shouldn't do it?

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,500
I mean, we shouldn't clean
a bunch of counterfeit money

54
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,127
when the FBI is on our trail.

55
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,211
It was your idea.

56
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,339
Will you all keep it down, please?

57
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,341
Look, they're not on our trail.

58
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,925
He was in my kitchen.

59
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,093
Stan is in my bedroom.

60
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,220
If the guy knew anything,
he would have just said it.

61
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,223
He gave his card to me, and not to Dean.

62
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,060
Well, maybe he didn't know
if Dean could read.

63
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:28,439
Look, I got fancy lawyer bills
coming out the wazoo, dawg.

64
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:31,317
I talked to her for 15 minutes,
it cost me $800.

65
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,778
You know how much a criminal lawyer costs?

66
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,614
I need this payday.
We didn't get the last one.

67
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:39,533
We all need it. But let's
not be stupid about it.

68
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,243
What's stupid is if we screw this up

69
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,829
because gang friend
is not gonna give us another shot.

70
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,247
Gang friend?

71
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,250
Probably some teenagers,
like, stolen Xbox or something.

72
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,752
I promise you it was nothing.

73
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:50,878
It wasn't nothing.

74
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,880
It was the FBI.

75
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,049
Okay. So, it was two Xboxes.

76
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:56,425
STAN: Freeze, ladies.
(ALL GASP)

77
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,843
(EXCLAIMS)
Whoa.

78
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,471
Hey, look at you.
Uh-huh.

79
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:02,973
What's up, y'all?
ANNIE: Hey. (LAUGHS)

80
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,226
First day as an Officer in training.

81
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,728
Mm-hmm. Now, tell me, would you pull over

82
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,397
if you saw this coming at you
in the rear-view?

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,856
Oh, I'd pay the ticket on the spot.

84
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,942
I! mean, I'd run, but you'd catch me
in five seconds.

85
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,069
Hear that?
Getting real now, huh?

86
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,488
Oh, yeah.
Realer by the minute.

87
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:25,705
What about sunblock?

88
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,081
Nancy has the spray kind.

89
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,125
I guess if you can afford to go to Hawaii,

90
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,751
you can afford the spray kind.

91
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,378
Don't eat just mac and cheese, okay?

92
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,463
I Know how to make at least two to five
other dishes.

93
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,881
And set your alarm for work.

94
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,176
I am a fully functioning adult human.

95
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:41,637
You're not good alone.

96
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,347
(CHUCKLES) I can take care of myself.

97
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,017
I mean, sometimes.

98
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,020
Okay. I love you.
I'm going to miss you.
Have the best time.

99
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,398
I promise I will not call
unless it's an emergency.

100
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,482
Okay.
Okay?

101
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,984
Okay. Hey.

102
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,402
Love you.
Love you.

103
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,654
BOTH: Never put no one above you.

104
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,367
Miss you. Miss you. Bye.
Miss you. Okay.

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,292
Well? Amscray.
I'm, like, dying for some alone time.

106
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,461
I love you so much, Mom.

107
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,879
I love you, baby.

108
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,505
(SMOOCHES)

109
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,299
Bye.
Bye.

110
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,176
(IN CUTESY VOICE)
Bye. Bye.

111
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,180
(SIGHS)

112
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,228
(EXHALES)

113
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:45,409
Okay. What if I just
mark you down for, like,
clean up or something?

114
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,245
I'd really love to.
I just don't have any time right now.

115
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,332
Oh, my God, what happened to your car?

116
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,461
Oh. Got Kenny a BB gun.

117
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,049
When did we start this service?

118
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,928
Anyway. Think about it, B.
I'll call you.

119
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,012
Okay.

120
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,141
What do you want?

121
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,159
Careful with those snacks.

122
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,246
I don't wanna spend my weekend
cleaning up this car.

123
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,141
Yeah. I'm not sure I see the problem.

124
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,434
ANNIE: You and me both, brother.

125
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,519
Annie.

126
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,231
(SIGHS) I just would
like to take this moment

127
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,483
to personally thank you
for this opportunity.

128
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,236
I promise you, we're going iron this out.
We're going to make you proud.

129
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,529
Okay. Hold on, Annie.

130
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,322
Y'all asked for a piece of this.

131
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,324
Yes, we did, sir.
That's true.

132
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,118
That was before the FBI dropped by.

133
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,578
Okay, let's just calm down.

134
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,122
Sorry. She just kind of does this.
It's all part of the process.

135
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:14,957
What is that supposed to mean?

136
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,585
Hmm. I don't know.
You begged our parents for a piano,

137
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,129
and they dropped three grand
on a baby upright.

138
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,339
And guess who decided
she'd rather play violin.

139
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,633
I'm staying out of it.

140
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,136
It sounds like y'all
got a lot to work out. So...

141
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,596
(STAMMERS)
Wait a second.

142
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,763
Don't you want to take your product?

143
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,603
This ain't the Girl Scouts.

144
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,438
You can't give the cookies back.

145
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,398
Aren't you worried about the FBI?

146
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:40,816
Nah.

147
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,901
See?

148
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:45,487
There's a distribution system.
You've been distributed to.

149
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,323
What does that mean?

150
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,575
It means you're on the hook now.

151
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,328
It's, like, 100 grand.

152
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,495
Oh, you don't got to wash it.

153
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:55,831
Then, what do we do with it?

154
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:57,833
Burn it. Eat it.

155
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,293
Wipe your ass with it.

156
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:00,669
And then, write me a check.

157
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,212
Because, either way,
I'm coming to collect.

158
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:04,006
ANNIE: Hey.

159
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,425
Guess who ended up
taking the piano lessons.

160
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:10,220
Six years.
It's gonna be fine.

161
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,310
(CLEARS THROAT)

162
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,355
What?

163
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,775
Okay, the pins represent the stores
with the biggest ticket items.

164
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,779
We've got blue for electronics,
yellow for appliances.

165
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,656
Is this the same map
you used for Black Friday?

166
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,324
Yes. But I expanded it.

167
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:33,369
Because it is way too risky
to shop locally right now.

168
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,329
Damn. Really upped
your crafting game, Martha.

169
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,748
Hey! Hey!
There is a system.

170
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:41,001
I am trying to keep us organized
so that we don't get caught.

171
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,378
Okay.

172
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,921
What if they test the bills?

173
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:47,383
I once saw a guy at 7-Eleven
get straight-up tased.

174
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,427
Well, at least, he wasn't arrested.

175

So, I guess he just didn't
want me to call him again.

would love a solution

crawling back to Brad-Brian.

and the flatscreens.

with the Hummels.

to give me his address.

393

I think he works again next week.

394
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:03,052

our headless bodies will be
badly decomposed.

00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,415
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah.
Hey, do you want me to heat up your plate?

701
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,834
Sara's in the hospital again.

702
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,586
I'm gonna shower,
and then head back there.

703
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,880
All right. Hey, Beth.

704
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,717
I'm really, really trying here.

705
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,761
I Know.

706
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,097
Think I can fix it?

707
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:08,142
I think it's gonna take more than

708
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:10,310
filling up the car and Rachel Ray.

709
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,478
Right.

710
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,524
If it never happened...

711
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:17,109
You know, Amber, the money.

712
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:19,653
Would you still be with me?

713
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,907
I don't even know how to answer that.

714
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,372
I think you just did.

715
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,429
Mrs. Boland, can I
get you anything? Coffee?

716
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:49,391
Oh. (CHUCKLES) You
drink coffee at this hour?

717
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,477
I don't sleep much anyway. You?

718
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:53,604
I had an affair.

719
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:55,898
You had an affair?

720
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,400
I'm not proud of it, and it's over now.

721
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,612
But that's why he was
at the house, and that's

722
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:04,865
why I couldn't say anything
in front of my husband and my children.

723
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,074
Oh.

724
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:08,410
Well...

725
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:10,496
Okay, then.

726
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,915
Okay.
Okay.

727
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,878
Just out of curiosity,
where'd you meet him?

728
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,637
I'm just wondering where
a nice lady like you meets
an inner city gangbanger.

729
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,097
PTA? Or is it like a speed dating thing?

730
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,475
What's that website?
It's Just Lunch?

731
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:32,559
At a bar.

732
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,811
What was he wearing?

733
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,437
Jeans.
What about you?

734
00:38:35,854 --> 00:38:37,189
Dress.
Where'd you meet him?

735
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:40,317
At a restaurant.
You just said bar.

736
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,986
A bar restaurant.
They had food.

737
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,321
What was the name?

738
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,031
Lucky's.

739
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:48,200
I bet they'd remember
a pair like you. Who drove?

740
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,285
You or him? Who drove?

741
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,745
Um, we both did.

742
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,038
What kind of car does he drive?

743
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,541
Black BMW.

744
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,042
It'd be registered.
I'll check it.

745
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,210
It might be a Cadillac.

746
00:38:58,293 --> 00:38:59,461
Maybe.

747
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,800
Have a good nigNt, Mrs. Boland.

748
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:19,106
It was a one-night stand.

749
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:21,108
I had just found out that my husband

750
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,027
was cheating on me with a child.
More or less.

751
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,865
And I was lonely and angry.

752
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:30,617
And

753
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,829
normally, sleeping with
a complete stranger would repulse me.

754
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,873
But it didn't that day.

755
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:40,419
I dropped the kids off
at school and I went straight to the bar.

756
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,422
Where was your husband?

757
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:45,465
Screwing his secretary
and losing all our money.

758
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,635
Fair enough.

759
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,096
We drank a little,

760
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,641
and I invited him back to my house.

761
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,977
We drank a little more.

762
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:01,398
And then, I realized
what I was doing was insane.

763
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,984
And I told him to go.

764
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,530
And he kissed me.

765
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,074
I kissed him back.

766
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:16,872
He pulled my panties down
and we screwed right on the kitchen table,

767
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,124
on the breakfast dishes.

768
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,294
The kids had pancakes.

769
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,881
Blueberry, if you were wondering.

770
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:29,885
It only happened once.

771
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,138
And I've never seen that man again.

772
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:35,724
And I don't plan to.

773
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:42,773
Thank you for coming in.

774
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,365
Mrs. Boland.

775
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,079
Just be careful
who you bring into your home.

776
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,332
I'm tougher than I look.
