That is not what I meant

183
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,396
when I said we'd do another job.

184
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,814
Who is that guy?

185
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,982
He works for me.

186
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,400
(STUTTERS) Does he wash the money?

187
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,194
Regardless, there's been
a miscommunication.

Oh, so you think you can pick
and choose what you wanna do

You're shaking your head.
Why are you shaking your head?

'Cause that kid
ain't going to no hospital.

Why not?
'Cause there's people looking for him.

I'm pretty sure it'll
cover a new mattress.

So, would we get that money now, or...

When I pick him up.

00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,021
Okay, let's just try
to get through this, okay?

358
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,691
Oh, Carl.
No.

359
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,984
Carl who?

360
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,735
BOTH:
Emma's favorite bunny.

361
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,279
BETH: He was on the dash.

362
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,738
Now he's on a drive-by.

363
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,823
Ugh.

364
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:50,907
Mom?

365
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,872
Hey, sweetie, what are you doing here?

366
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,248
Just don't be mad at Dad.

367
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,749
Why? What did he do now?

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,293
He told me all about the party

369
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,627
with the bounce house
and the water slide,

370
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,337
and I invited, like, all my friends.

371
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,631
Five can't come, but... But 32 can.

372
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,300
Hey!

373
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,593
Don't be mad.

374
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,434
Do you wanna go play some video games?

375
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:18,810
Yeah, definitely.
Let's do it.

376
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:22,939
You're a dead man.

377
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:27,235
Go upstairs right now
and tell him we can't afford it.

378
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,867
You didn't see his little face.

379
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,328
I see his little face every day.

I have to say no
to those kids because of what you did.

383
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,544
You Know what he wants for his birthday?

384
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,131
I don't know, probably
an Xbox or Minecraft

385
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,549
or something very expensive.

386
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,468
His mom and dad back together.

387
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,598
That's what he asked for?
That's what he asked for.

00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,939
Yeah.

391
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:06,942
I would've gone for the Xbox.

(SNICKERS)

393
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,281
Least we can do is throw him a damn party.

00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,663
Happy retirement?

395
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,998
They were on clearance.
No one will notice.

396

Yeah.

397
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,377
Potatoes are dirt cheap.

398
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:26,836
Hmm, what am I gonna do

399
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,129
with potatoes at a birthday party?

400
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,006
Um, hot potato, Mr. Potato Head.

401
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,091
Two uses.

402
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:32,884
Bake 'em.
Ah! Three uses.

Wait, is that on anything in the store?

00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,360
Yeah, anything in the store.

why she punched him in the face?

not to warn him that plate was hot.

You, uh, like to take baths, huh?

537
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,103
Okay.

538
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,355
Get yourself all squeaky clean?

539
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,898
Okay.

540
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:03,650
Ah, you managed to make that disgusting.

541
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,360
(CLEARS THROAT)

542
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,737
Hey, you got turkey pinwheels, huh?

543
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,323
Yeah. Feel free to grab
some on your way out.

544
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,455
Hey, how much do you think
they'd pay for this party?

545
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,708
I have no idea.

546
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,089
MAN: (ON TV) He's lined up
in the shotgun...

547
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,341
Oh, oh, oh, are we still up?

548
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,426
No, tied 21-21.

549
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,429
Wester caught a two-yard
end zone pass, wide open.

550
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,223
Ah, come...
That's Pl, that is PI.

551
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:36,432
Come on, fellas.
Every single time.

552
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,642
We never get the call.
Really?

553
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:38,851
Why don't we get that call?

554
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,812
Look at this. (SIGHS)

555
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,522
So how you holding up, man?

556
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:44,273
You know, with everything
that's going on.

557
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,610
Great.
Good.

558
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,153
Yeah, we're doing great.
All right.

559
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,488

take your eye off the road,

you're gonna hit a speed bump
every now and then, right?

564
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,250
No doubt.
Just gotta keep moving on.

565
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,334
You know?
For sure.

566
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,669
But I think she'll come back.

567
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,130
Well, pssh, bro, for sure.

568
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,425

00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:19,058
Tell me one thing.

571
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:20,226
Yeah.

574
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,648
I mean, he gets it done.
He always does, right?

575
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,858
Right. Yeah.

576
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:31,946
Ice. Dripping.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.

577
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,114
An!

578
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,198
It's a good play, finally.

579

Yes. One stop.

BETH: Dude.
ANNIE: Can they even do that?

581
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,000
Isn't there some kind of, like,

582
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,501
HR protocol or something?

583

(SCOFFS) It's a diner, not Microsoft.

584
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,172
It's so unfair.

585
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,007
What did Stan say?

586
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,301
I can't tell Stan.

587
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,512
Oh, honey.
Not when we're this deep underwater.

588
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,891
I just, you know, I gotta get
something else going first.

589
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,852
Well, good news is
there are plenty of other

590

extremely depressing
and unpleasant jobs out there.

591

Right? (CHUCKLES)

592
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,691
What? I'm just...

00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,859
I'm just saying, you know.

Hey, does, um...
Daddy.

Does Mommy ever have any, like, you know,

608
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,132
new friends come over?

609
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,800
Just a man in bed.

610
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:17,677
I'm not supposed to tell you that.

611
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:20,054
Huh.

00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,184
You can't just walk in here.

613
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,352
The door was open.

614
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:27,812
It's because I'm having a party

615
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,397
with children and their parents.

616
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,774
Oh, my God, you brought a gun?

617
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,859
Of course you brought a gun.

618
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,152
Is this your husband?
Yes.

619
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,319
What's he do?

620
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,404
He sells cars.

621
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,613
Is he good at it?

622
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,325
(STAMMERS) Why does that matter?

623
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,286
Yeah, he don't look too trustworthy to me.

624
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,874
What do you want?

625
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,877
What do you want?

626
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,962
Came to pick up my boy.

627
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,840
That's hilarious.

628
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,508
He's not here.

629
00:27:57,925 --> 00:28:00,761
And by the way, when he left,
he held me at gunpoint,

630
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,513
and then stole my car.

631
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:04,807
So I'm gonna need payment for that, too.

632
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,185
Oh, I'm sorry, what payment?

633
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:08,394
Excuse me?

634
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:10,521
Yeah, you get paid when you do a job.

636

He left.

637
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:14,734
Then that's on you.

638
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,112
What am I supposed to do?
Chain him to a bed?

this is, Little League?

640
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,533
And you get a trophy just for playing?

00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,910
I tried.

642
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,538

No, I don't think so.

not wearing your ring?

Don't worry about that.

716
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,503
I'll do it.

717
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:04,046
Where's the receipt?

718
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,506
In my purse.

719
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
Okay.

10 grand on a party.

Twelve and a half.

894
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:38,435
Okay. Deal.
Cool.

895
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:41,813
I usually pay 30.

(MOUSE CLICKING)

897
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,200
Hey, what are you doing?

898
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,995
Um...

899
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:01,291
Just playing Dr. Google
and freaking myself out.

900
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,752
Yeah, maybe don't do that.

901
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,087
Yeah, right?

902
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,380
When will you know more?

903
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:10,217
I got a bunch of scans
and tests next week.

904
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,096
Okay, well, I'll go with you.

905
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,143
You don't have to.
But that would be great.

906
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,814
Um, hey,

907
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,484
I just wanna say thanks
for letting me come home.

908
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,447
You're gonna be okay in here?

909
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,658
Oh, yeah, totally.

910
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:37,119
Kenny's psyched, so am I.

911
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:38,996
I get to sleep on the top bunk.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

913
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,291
Uh, I better go get that.

914
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,086
Yeah. Hey, Bethie.

915
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,382
Don't worry.

916
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,591
I got this.

917
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,095
I Know.

918
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:15,824
MAN: Hi, I'm looking for Mrs. Boland.

919
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,409
That's me.

920
00:42:18,076 --> 00:42:19,077
Can I help you?

921
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,829
I'm hoping you can.
