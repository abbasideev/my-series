Because you're insane.

179
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,863
I mean, you never think anything through.

180
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,700
This is exactly why Nancy and I
should have custody.

181
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,702
Because you are not stable.

182
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,454
Yeah, because who cares
about real love and connection

183
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,457
when you can make a child
a fresh pico de gallo?

184
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,669
Why do you keep saying that?

185
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:28,215
Thank you for making me
completely humiliate myself
for no reason.

186
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,635
These are cold.
They're not mine.

188
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,891
What do we do now?

189
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,476
I have no idea.

190
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,772
What is it?

191
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,025
You okay?
Stay here.

192
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,626
I got a question for you.

193
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,671
The two, two, and two meal.
How much is that?

194
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,257
$7.95.

195
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,718
Yeah, see, but if I order two hot cakes,

196
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:16,346
two sausages and two eggs a la carte,
it's cheaper.

197
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,141
You get a garnish.

198
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:20,809
Like parsley or something?
(LAUGHS)

199
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,065
It's an orange slice.

200
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,608
You tell the owner that ain't right?

201
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,403
Cheating people like that?

202
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,617
We're gonna get you your money.

203
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,243
All of it. I swear.

204
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,496
Now would be great.

205
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,581
We need more time to get it.

206
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,383
Thank you.

207
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,927
I'll come by tomorrow.

208
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,096

Eesh! Something bad.

216
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,956
It's real sterling.

217
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,793
$50. You can keep the picture.

218
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,546
Okay. I have to take home
at least 2 grand for all of this.

219
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,798
Okay.

220
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,390
It was his great-grandmother's.

221
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:43,600
How much do you hate him?

Hi.
Hey. How you doing?

227
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,619
Good. How are you?
Everything is good.

228
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,663
So, what are you driving now?

229
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,790
A 2007 Celica GT.

230
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,917
Ooh. Well, this thing's quite an upgrade.

231
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,754
Fully loaded.
I mean, she handles like a dream.

232
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,839
She's gorgeous.

233
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,550
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Right?

234
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,597
My Celica's been good to me,
but she's pushing 100,000 miles. So...

235
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,848
She's dependable.

236
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:27,019
It's sad to see her go,
but I think it's time
to change things up a bit.

237
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,979
I mean, I thought the exact same thing.

238
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,105
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,442
You know, you see something
shiny and new, and you just
forget about what you got.

240
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,611
Once you upgrade, those memories,

241
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,529
they come back and they...
they haunt you.

242
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,742
You know, like, uh,
road trip with the kids.

243
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,076
I don't have kids.

244
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,706
The fun stuff you did
in the... in the back seat
in high school.

245
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,292
I haven't had it that long, so...

246
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,337
The crazy thing is, you thought you were
the one sick of her,

247
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,589
and now you'd do anything
to get her back.

248
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,135
You do sell cars here, right?

249
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,221
Don't give up on your Celica.

250
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,848
Maybe... Maybe if we test drove it...

251
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,933
You'll regret it.

252
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,144

damn drug anymore?

339
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:34,641
and then, you just expect everyone else
to clean it up,

340
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:38,103
and then, you just ignore it, for hours.
