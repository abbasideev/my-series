to miss out on any Two-for-Tuesday deals.

00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,401
Just give me a minute.

522
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,863
I hope I wasn't speeding,

523
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:29,115
I've been rushing around
like crazy all day.

524
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:30,199
Why's that?

525
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:32,243
Um...

526
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,164
Little bit of a domestic situation.
Not a good guy, you know?

527
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:38,791
Had to get out of there
as quickly as possible.

528
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,586
Hashtag, time is up, am I right?

529
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:43,171
It's one of those.

530
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,424
This your truck?

531
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:50,428
I borrowed it. From
a friend who's helping me
with the domestic thing.

532
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,472
Am I in trouble here?

533
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:54,766
First off, you're driving
without a license plate.

534
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,226
My friend's a little bit
of a mess, too. (CHUCKLES)

535
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,063
What's her name again?

536
00:24:01,397 --> 00:24:02,398
Sorry?

537
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,192
The friend who loaned you the truck.

538
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,403
Oh, it's more of a friend of a friend.

539
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,238
I need you to get out of the car.

540
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,452
You got a key to this lock?

541
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,122
Must be one of these.

Hey, give me five!

Well, it was really nice
to meet you, Leslie. And...

You know, you have a really good voice.

grab a coffee or something, ever?

566
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,097
I can't.
Oh, yeah. No, totally, I get it.

567
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,265
It's not you...
No, no, no, that's fine.

568
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:00,475
You don't have to...
I get it. Totally.

569
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,519
No, I... It's not...
Sorry for bothering you.
Have a great night.

My husband's dead.

He passed away six months ago.

00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,448
Do you think you could come back closer,

573
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,075
so I don't have to shout about it?

574
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,327

back out there, but I'm...

You know, it'd just be downhill
from here, so... (CHUCKLES)

579
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,095
How did he pass?

580
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,179
Heart attack.

581
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,809
He was, um, playing water guns
with the kids.

582
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:44,644
My son thinks that he killed him

583
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:46,813
because he shot him in the chest
with a Super Soaker

584
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:48,815
right before he actually died.

585
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,899
Oh.

586
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,861

Ew.

No, that's not...
That's not a true...

596
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,551
That was a joke.
That was a bad joke. Sorry.

597
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,511
Oh. No, that was funny.

00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:21,514
No, you...
You're funny. (CHUCKLES)

I just got pulled over!
RIO: So?

603
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,448
So I barely talked myself
out of being arrested.

604
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:41,325
For driving an empty truck?

605
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,535
Why didn't you do it yourself?

606
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:44,537
Why did you need us
to bring you an empty truck?

607
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,998
I had a kid.
The Feds turned him.

608
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,544
So, this is a test?

609
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:54,172
I needed to know if he talked.
I guess he didn't.

610
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:56,549
And now we're back in business.

611
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,134
You're catching on.
Give me the keys.

612
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:01,137
I have a family.
I have children.

613
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,805
Yeah, you love telling me that, huh?

614
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,849
If you think you can use me
like a worm on a hook

615
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:05,975
so that you don't get caught...

616
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,394
I don't got time to hold your hand through
this. Give me the keys.

617

That family you're always talking about?

618
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,915
Go home to 'em.

619
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,168
What me and you had is done. Over.

620
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,171
You can't just fire us.

621
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:36,631
You think I need you?

622
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:38,841
Ain't nothing but
a damn charity case to me.

623
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,176
We need the money.

624
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,637
I need more of your bitch-ass drama
like I need a hole in my head.

625
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:45,306
Go home.

626
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:57,068
What do you mean, you had a kid?

627
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,072
What happened to him?

628
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,243
What's that you're always saying

629
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,370
about your rotten eggs
and how you have to handle 'em?

630
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:08,454
Go home.

631
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,463
I don't see how you're
gonna let me do that.

632
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,514
Is it gonna be you?

633
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,892
Or do I come home one day and your boys
are in my kitchen?

634
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:31,727
Elizabeth...

635
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,273
Go home.

636
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,993
ANNIE: Chimney fell on
an old lady in Wixom.

637
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,162
Fatal accident on Southfield Freeway. Hmm.

638
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,456
Drowning. What kind
of nutjob goes swimming
this time of year?

639
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,624
RUBY: You're kind of asking for it.

640
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,834
ANNIE: Ugh.

641
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,544
I don't see anything
about a dead gang kid.

642
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,004
You're sure he's coming for us?

643
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,132
We know too much now.
He'd be an idiot not to.

644
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,676
I mean, homie has made this
threat before.

645
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,179
I'm telling you, it's different.

646
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,556
We're no good to him now.

647
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:10,391
He said the actual words?

648
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,101
He just looked at me funny.

649
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,023
Sadie just did a project on great whites.

650
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,441
They have these inky black eyes

651
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,484
that turn white
right before they kill you.

652
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:23,612
Was it funny like that, or...

653
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,197
RUBY: Okay, glass half full.

654
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:28,451
He's just upset, and when he calms down,

655
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:31,579
he realizes we're good earners.

656
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:32,747
What's half empty?

657
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,207
Getting put in a woodchipper.

658
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,710
I feel like he's more creative than that.

659
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:42,048
He'll probably drop us
into molten steel or feed us to pigs.

660
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,717
Everything's a joke to you?

661
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,135
I just deal with it in my own way, okay?

662
00:30:46,218 --> 00:30:47,219
What do we do?

663
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,846
Why are you looking at me?

664
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:51,599
Because, you know,
last time this happened,
you were all like,

665
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,727
"Yeah, just try to hurt us. We eat
at P.F. Chang's, bitch."

666
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,020
Can't you...

667
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,865
You feel really strongly about this.
(LAUGHING)

668
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:11,535
I've Got the Joy just...
It just sounds better
on an electric guitar.

669
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,163
No offense to Leonore's organ playing.
(CHUCKLES)

670
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:16,082
Jeff used to play it on guitar.

671
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,750
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

672
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,710
He was also really into hard rock.

673
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,421
Like, he knew every Creed song
by heart, you know?

674
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,761
I was doing so good.

675
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:31,180
You made it the whole night.
Yeah, till now.

678
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,439

683
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:51,450
Where?

684
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,535
Down in my heart

685
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:53,994
Where?
Down in my heart

686
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,121
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

687
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,914
With a little electric riff,
that would sound so good.

688
00:31:56,997 --> 00:31:58,707
It would be so good.
(CHUCKLES)

689
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,212
Uh...
Should I put on some tea?

690
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,382
I, um...

691
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:08,217
Oh, I don't mean to...

692
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,470
I mean, if you have an early morning or...
Like, no pressure if you...

693
