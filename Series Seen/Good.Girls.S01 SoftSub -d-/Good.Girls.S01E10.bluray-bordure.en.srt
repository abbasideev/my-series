NARRATOR: Previously on Good Girls...

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,422
DOCTOR: I would suggest
we put Sara ona list for a transplant.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,548
A girl in Madison just got hit.

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,258
She's a perfect match.

5
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:10,801
Are people pulling your pants down?

6
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,345
SADIE: They want to know what I am.

7
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:13,763
We could send her to St. Anne's.

8
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,473
She's an atheist who enjoys a bow tie.

9
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:17,183
I don't think that
Catholic school is a good fit.

DR. HARPER: It's cancer in your prostate.

11
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,770
Couldn't make it sound
a little more serious?

12
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:22,021
Can I call you Big Mike?

(GUNSHOT)
(SCREAMS) Oh, my God!

14
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:25,316
You shot me in the foot.

15
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,652
Just stay away from me.
Take what you came for
and get out of here.

16
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:28,819
MARY PAT: We'll just put the whole thing

17
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,739
on the,
"I'm what's keeping you
out of jail account."

18
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,783
Would you ever wanna grab a coffee?

19
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,867
I had fun tonight.

20
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,661
MARY PAT: Should I put on some tea?
BOOMER: Yeah.

21
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,204
RUBY: Who's the boy?

22
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,414
It's that fool we arrested.
He's ours now.

23
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,582
They have him!

24
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,709
The FBI! And he is talking to them!

25
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,794
You think I need you?

26
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,837
Ain't nothing but a damn charity case
to me. Go home.

27
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,589
I don't see how you're gonna
let me do that.

28
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:50,091
You're sure he's coming for us?

29
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,425
We know too much now.

30
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,969
ANNIE: Maybe we should turn ourselves in.

31
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,887
It's better than waiting to be murdered.

32
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,430
He's the one who should be in jail.

33
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,723
Then let's put him there.

34
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,359
ANNIE: We hire a hitman.

35
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,443
Seriously?

36
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,362
We don't need him dead.

37
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:12,446
We need him in jail.

38
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:15,992
Let me finish.
We hire a hitman,

39
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,910
and then we frame Rio

40
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,830
for the murder that the hitman commits.

41
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,748
Oh, well, when you
put it like that, then...

42
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:24,166
Who's the hitman gonna hit?

43
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,128
A random innocent?
Someone who cuts in line
at the Starbucks?

44
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,338
Oh, there are candidates.

45
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm sure there are.

46
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,050
Look, nobody said
this was going to be easy, okay?

47
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,761
If it was, the FBI would have done it.

48
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,191
Mind control.

49
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,402
Turns himself in.

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,404
And, I'm done.

51
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:56,115
It's called brainstorming.
You throw stuff out, you see what sticks.

52
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:57,658
I've got something in the morning.

53
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,243
More important than being murdered?

54
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,829
We're meeting with the finance people
from the hospital.

55
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,122
What are you gonna do?

56
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,501
Say we can pay for that kidney.
No problem.

57
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:12,131
Write a bad check
and hope they don't realize

58
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,424
until she's open on the table.

59
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,301
It's a good plan.
Go with God.

60
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,349
(SIGHS) I'll call you tomorrow.

61
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,059

62
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:24,518
Yeah, and don't let anybody

63
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,853
pull up next to you at a stoplight.

64
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,188
How am I supposed to do that?

65
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,231
Just keep inching forward.

66
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,316
You know what?
Don't even stop.

67
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,734
Yeah, run the reds.

68
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,197
Do you want to just...
I'll tell Stan I drank too much.

69
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,698
It doesn't have to be a lie.

70
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,159
ANNIE: Yeah, you can crash on my couch.

No, thanks.
I'm not staying.

73

If you waiting on my boy,
you're wasting your time.

74

He ain't coming tonight.

75
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,189
Yeah, so, if I were you,

76
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,317
I'd go back home to that beautiful family
in Baltimore.

77

You know, let's just
call this thing what it is, yeah?

I! mean, not that I mind
having my picture taken,

79
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,616
but it must be getting pretty old
for you people

80

to Eddy myself, if you don't mind.

Good luck with that.

Her match was removed
from life support late last night,

86
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,181
so I'd say we're in a 24-hour window.

you sign consents,

89
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,978
you deposit the payment,

90
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,563
and Sara goes straight to surgery.

91
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,192
Um, how much of that
does insurance cover?

92
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:58,404

20% after deductible.

94

$87,400.53.

Yes, right now is...

201
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,511

that we know about this guy
that the cops don't?

239
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,319
He wears his hoodie funny.

240
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,695
Like half on, half off.

00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,905
Yeah, make up your mind, bruh.

That's correct.

243
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,534
But he also launders money at my work.

We can tell your FBI guy.

And what do we say
when he asks how we know?

say we robbed the joint
and got more than we expected.

252

to look.

Oh, hell no!

00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,395
It's already familiar territory.

255

It's right up there with the hitman idea.

256
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,274
But all we have to do
is get the vault open

257
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,526

No upgrades on Tyler.

284
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,051
Although, he did lose seven pounds,

285
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,595
so he might run a little faster.

286
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,306
But he just discovered pho.

290
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,188

00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:46,357
I mean, it's a walking billboard for...

714
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,068
S-E-X.

715
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,402
So you raped her?

716
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,446
No, no. (SCOFFS)

717
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,616
See, I... I feel like
you're not even listening to me, okay?

718
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,661
Uh, Annie...

719
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,371
(SCOFFS) I mean, she's no...

720
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:02,998
She's not like you.

721
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,209
She's not a good Christian like you.

722
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:07,419
I mean, girls like that,
they want that kind of attention.

723
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,423
Rape?
No!

724
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,594
Just...

725
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:20,182
The rough stuff.
Look, there's a difference.

726
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,726
You know me, I'm a gentleman.

727
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,688
But when a tease like that

728
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,939
pushes my buttons,

729
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:28,440
and you know what button
I'm talking about,

730
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,025
I'm apt to give her
what she came looking for.

731
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,987
And I'm sorry if that's not
pretty or romantic,

732
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,156
but it's human nature, you know?

733
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:38,117
It is science.

734
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:43,622
(SCOFFS)

735
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,679
Do you have anything you want to add?

736
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,222
You recorded me?

737
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,308
Why would you do that?

738
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,602
I could ask you the same thing.

739
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,312
That was before.

740
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,230
Before what?

741
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:10,316
Before I liked you.

742
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:14,320
I think you better go.

743
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:24,079
I want that back.

744
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,627
Just because you want something,

745
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,420
doesn't give you the right to take it.

746
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:38,802
(DOOR SLAMS)

747
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:43,932
Went old school

748
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,769
Cinnamon Schnapps.
(GASPS)
My personal favorite.

749
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,229
That's like bat mitzvah old school.

750
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:53,150
Oh! Sadie's almost that age.

751
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:55,527
(EXHALES) Damn!

752
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,572
We old.
Dude.

753
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:06,664
She just looks so happy, you know?

754
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,790
Stop.

755
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:11,335
It was like there was
this whole other planet
called St. Anne's,

756
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,961
that she never knew about

757
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,713
where everyone's cool with her.

758
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,674
They play hacky sack.

759
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,553
I've literally been keeping her from it.

760
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,721
She's there now.

761
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,518
She could've been there months ago.

762
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:38,237
Do you promise you won't be a dick?

763
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:41,448
No.

764
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:47,246
Maybe I'm not the only person

765
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,331
who knows what's best for her.

766
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,751
I'm... I'm sorry.
Say that again?

767
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,044
Dick!

768
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,547
(CHUCKLES)
I just wanna make sure
it's not the Schnapps.

769
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,801
She needs you, too.

770
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,095
Not the Schnapps.

771
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:07,391
That is literally
exactly what I needed to hear.

772
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,810
"Not the Schnapps."

773
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,274
Well, we just did it in two seconds,

774
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,359
what they pay lawyers for in blood.

775
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,861
Leveled up.

776
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,029
Like some grown-ass folk.

777
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,073
Yeah, except grown-ass folk

778
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,909
don't use the term
"grown-ass folk."

779
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,369
Mm. True.

780
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,294
I should go.

781
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,172
Me, too.

782
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,473
Chocolate shakes, chocolate chip cookies.
Mm-hmm.

783
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,016
Burgers.

784
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,144
What's the one that comes
on a doughnut, Mom?

785
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:54,438
The doughnut burger?
Those look nasty.

786
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:55,564
I want one now.

787
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:57,691
Mm-mm.
RUBY: Okay, okay.

788
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,943
Now, your new kidney's
gonna quit before it even takes.

789
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:01,695
Yeah, let's not do that.

790
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,572
Can I have more Jell-O then?

791
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:05,157
Jell-O is good.
You can eat Jell-O,

792
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,492
till your ears turn blue.

793
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:08,702
I'll get the nurse.

794
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,788
I love you, Boo-Boo.

795
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,080
I love you, Mama.

796
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:20,714
(SIGHS)

797
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:23,008
I got this.

798
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,093
You can stay with hungry-mungry.

799
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,431
What's wrong?

800
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:32,059
You know that guy
that I collared a while back?

801
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:33,811
The one with the goofy mustache?
Excuse me.

802
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,938
Yes?
Can we get some Jell-O for 111?

803
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:37,022
NURSE: Of course.

804
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:39,358
Yeah, the, uh, the Feds and the DPD

805
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:40,818
took his gang down last night.

806
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,236
That's good.
(SIGHS)

807
00:38:44,696 --> 00:38:45,781
What?

808
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,616
Tell me what to do here, Ruby.

809
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:50,828
I don't...
See we got them,

810
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,455
because they were laundering their money
through this grocery store,

811
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,208
and, uh, we wouldn't
even have known any of it,

812
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,085
if, uh, these two women

813
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,212
hadn't robbed the place
a couple nights ago.

814
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:02,756
That's lucky.

815
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:04,299
Mm.

816
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,260
I don't think we should leave her alone.

817
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:08,262
It's the same store Beth's little sister
works at.

818
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,308
Oh, my God, was she there?

819
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,438
That's how you're gonna play this?

820
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,898
I mean, I haven't talked to her...

821
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,359
It's the same damn store,
the same damn night,

822
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,278
that you and your friend, Beth,

823
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,781
were going down to Ohio
to collect 87 grand in cash.

824
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,575
Hang on. You think...

825
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,285
There's no business, is there?

826
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,829
No corporate.

827
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:36,540
All this was just a bunch of BS.

828
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,501
How could you think I would ever do that?

829
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,669
Your face.

830
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:43,463
Right now.

831
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,218
I did it for us.

832
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:50,345
I'm a cop, Ruby.

833
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,014
I had no choice.

834
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:53,557
What the hell am I supposed to do?

835
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,269
I don't know.

836
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:00,230
You asked what it would take
for me to walk out the door.

837
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,941
You knew the answer.

838
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,109
(BREATH TREMBLING)

839
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:06,403
And you did it anyway.

00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,781
(BREATH TREMBLING)

841
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,085
RIO: Hi, honey, we're home.

842
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,893
Would have been here sooner,
but I got tied up.

843
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,941
Surprise.

844
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,446
I'm sorry, Beth.

845
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:52,282
He didn't do anything.

846
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,450
RIO: Oh, he tried.

847
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,786
(CHUCKLES) He tried.

848
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,622
Got more fight in him than I thought.

849
00:40:58,705 --> 00:40:59,748
Ain't that right, champ?

850
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,709
Oh, I'm sorry.
Does this...

851
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:04,211
Does this bother you?

852
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:05,837
Let him go.

853
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,506
What, you can't even handle
a little blood?

854
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,634
I thought you wanted to be me.

855
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,512
I mean, that's what all this is, right?

856
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:14,721
You're trying to put me away and all.

857
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,348
You must got big plans.

858
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,727
But see, you didn't think things
all the way through.

859
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:24,022
It takes balls to do what I do.

860
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,024
You want to be the king,
you got to kill the king.

861
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,693
This stuff's medieval, darlin'.

862
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,531
Please, don't do this.
Please, don't kill us.

863
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,119
(LAUGHING) I...
I ain't gonna kill nobody.

864
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:40,789
Nah, man, you are.

865
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,084
(COCKS)

866
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,515
So, what you think?

867
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,060
You got what it takes?
