"Go big or go home"?

I don't know. It's something
Kenny's coach always says.

191
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,189
Yeah.
When he says it, he means home.

192
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:03,273
As in, your house,

193
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,733
not the big house.

00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,485
Okay.

195
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:08,946
What were you thinking?

196
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,447
I was thinking about our future.

197
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,574
We didn't come all this way to just quit.

198
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,953
I robbed a grocery store.
I didn't do it for nothing.

199
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:18,372
God. When did you get so cool?

200
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,249
You guys, we can do this.

201
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,168
We just need some extra hands.

202
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,798
You wanna bring
other people into this now?

203
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,508
We've got a system that works.

204
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,678
If we could just do it on a bigger scale.

205
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,179
What if they get caught?

206
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,305
They won't.

207
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,807
We haven't.

208
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,351
This cash is that good.

209
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,603
So, what?

210
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:45,065
I just ask Harry's Spanish teacher

211
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,859
if she wants a side hustle?

212
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,068
I mean, she probably does.

who could use extra cash.

This isn't Mary Kay.

You can't just serve
a bitch a mini muffin

and invite her to join you
in a life of crime.

219

What if they didn't know it was a crime?

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

221
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,380
So, what's a secret shopper?

222
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,923
Well, stores hire companies

223
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,133
like the ones we work for

224
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,177
to send in people
to pretend to be shoppers.

225
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,513
That way they can tell
how good or bad the customer service is.

226
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,931
Mini muffin?
Yes.

227
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,935
So, you'll pay us to buy a bunch of stuff
and then return it?

228
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,353
They're mostly interested
in the customer experience.

229
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,105
So, every time you make a return,

230
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,608
you fill out a survey and you get paid.

231
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,235
It's that easy.
(CHUCKLES)
Crazy, right?

232

(CHUCKLES) So crazy.

233
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,489
How long does the survey have to be?

00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:21,985
outside of this store, Nana.

362
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,029
You would be real shocked.

363
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,367
It was just nice to have someone

364
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,659
to talk to.

365
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,371
BOOMER: I mean, you can talk to me, Nana.

366
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,415
Oh, that's different, Leslie.

367
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,627
A woman needs the companionship
of other women.

368
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,713
What about your friends, Marion?

369
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,839
They're dead.

370
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,300
TYLER: Yo, Annie.

371
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,593
Uh, yeah.

372
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,261
You got a sec?

373
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,222
Yeah, what up?

374
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:52,724
I bought all the merchandise

375
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,809
and filled out all the surveys,

376
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,018
just like you guys said.

377
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,521
Okay.
And it was super chill

378
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,106
and they didn't even know I was
a secret shopper,

379
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,691
just like you guys said.
Okay, great.

380
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,985
And then I went
to return it all, you know,
just like you guys said.

381
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,404
And what happened?

382
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,824
Some of the stuff was stolen from my car.

383
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,536
But your windows aren't broken.

384
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:13,787

385
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,205
Yeah.

386
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,084
Well, how much did they take, Tyler?

387
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:21,920
Um, well...

388
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:23,922
a lot.

389
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,383
Well, how much is a lot?

390
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,427
Pretty much all of it.

391
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,346
We gave you $20,000.

392
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:33,348
Yeah.

393
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,768
You guys could just call corporate,
right?

394
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,812
I! mean, this stuff
must have happened to them before.

395
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,439
You know? They're probably insured for it.

396
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,607
You know? Man, I generally think
the best in people.

397
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,067

398
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,193
Oh, yeah.

399
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,945
All gone.

400
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,321
So...

401
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,325

...for you.

404

Now, we're gonna need a Sharpie.

405
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,459
No. Uh-uh.
Not happening.
Because we can't

406
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,961
have any more of these
pesky orange tippies poking through.

407
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,046
We are not robbing another store.

408
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,590
Or any more little old ladies.

409
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:07,757
Well, I actually agree with that.

410
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,301
Marion came into the store earlier,

411
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,970
and it was like Driving Miss Daisy,
only sadder.

412
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:13,930
Okay, then.
So I figured

413
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,724
we could rip off a check-cashing place,
because...

414
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,434
We're not robbing anything!

415
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,104
Fine. We'll just stiff the gang.

Hey. Do you guys know what, uh, happens

417
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:27,360
when they need to dump your body
in an oil drum?

418
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,987
They soak you in lye

419
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,113
and they make you into soup.

420
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,198
And then the cops can't tell

421
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,241
if you used to be a human or a large dog.

422
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,620
That's really not necessary.

423
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,121
Well, actually, it is,

424
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,040
'cause oil drums are real small.

426
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,630
I have an idea.

427
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:48,215
Oh, do you?
I do.

428
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,384
Love to hear it.
We pay the gang back in full.

429
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,429
And how do we replace the 20 grand?

430
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,723
We stiff our secret shoppers instead.

431
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,141
We can't do that.

432
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,768
At least we don't end up in an oil drum.

433
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,312
No, just prison when they report us
for fraud.

434
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,980
Yeah, and it wouldn't be enough.

435
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,774
We would have to dip into our profits
to cover it.

436
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,817
And that would basically leave us
back where we started.

437
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,569
!am not going back there.

438
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,695
Me either.

Stop it.

441
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,957
We don't need that.

442
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,625
Then how are we supposed to get
the money back?

443
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,252
We don't need the money.

444
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,003

And that little wifey of yours

904
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,192
who lived to make you dinner

905
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,778
has left the building,
and she is not coming back.

906
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,617
I mean, I'm sitting here
watching... (GRUNTS)

907
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,078
What is this?

908
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,498
Where did...
Where did this come from?

909
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,793
Yeah, I did forget the milk.

910
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,713
Beth, what the hell is going on?

911
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,516
And let Fred go back to his babies.

912
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,601
I'm not afraid of the dark.

913
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,694
