Take everything out.

177
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,681
Oh, my God!
Can you please

178
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,975
just listen to me for one damn minute?

179
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:18,103
Shame on you.

180
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,107
Shame on all of you. (CRYING)

(SIGHS) Eculizumab.

182
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,323
That's the name of the drug
you're talking about?

183
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,992
Yes.
It does.

184
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,328
It improves renal function dramatically.

185
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,622
It's also 10 grand a month out of pocket.

186
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:39,625
And I'm guessing
that may not be an option.

187
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,462
Well, I'll talk to my husband.

188
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,714
We might be able to swing it.

189
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,175
Okay.

190

halfway through my wax.

191
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,264
So, what happened?
Well, now I'm very uneven.

RUBY: I don't even wanna know.
(CHUCKLES)

193
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,271
Dean maxed out their credit card at
some lingerie store.

194
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,731
Do you think he's sleeping around?

195
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,942
Don't nobody want Dean.
It's a Christmas gift.

196
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,194
BETH: In October?
Maybe it's your anniversary present.

197
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,405
He already gave me
100 coupons to Bed, Bath & Beyond.

198
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,614
Ew. Really?

199

Son of a bitch.

200
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,283
No, I really do love it there.

201
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,869
No. That old guy is stealing your tip.

202
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,915
He can't even walk.

203
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,917

At my old job, we got robbed all the time.

207
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:38,434
So I got the sixth sense now.

00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:39,518
Are you serious?

209
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,729
I mean, it's no big deal.
All the stores I work at
eventually get hit.

210
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,231
You could get shot.
Ugh. One can hope.

These guys, they don't wanna
hurt anybody.

212
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,735
They just want the money.
So we let them have it.

Nobody's trying to be a hero.

214
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,237
Do they get caught?

215

(SCOFFS) Yeah, the dumb ones do.

I'm just keeping my options open.

223
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,420
How much is in the vault?

224
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,505
30 grand, give or take.

00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:10,883
Damn, I could use that money.

Oh, my God. Me, too.

227
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,096
So, when you wanna do this?

228
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,848
Well, I already bought three automatics

229
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,308

is a good fit.

Could you just tell me
exactly what was bought?

It's against policy to divulge information
on previous purchases,

for privacy concerns.

345

Oh, but it's on her bill, so...

346

Then she should remember what she bought.

347
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:24,821
Well, I remember that I bought it
for a friend.

348
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,032
And she loved it so much,

349
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:29,993
she really went nuts for it. Um...

350
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,206

the other driver texting,

353
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,004
not my friend.
She would never do that.

354
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,591
But, anyway, she's been in
a coma ever since,

355

like, 10 times the size it should be.

00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,652
Did you just hit me?

884
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:50,364
No! No!

885
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,326
(GRUNTING) No!

ANNIE: (GRUNTS)
Stop! No!

887
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:00,415
You're hurting me!

888
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,209
That's how you like it,
right, tough girl?
Come on.

889
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,502
You're gonna rob a store, right?

890
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:04,586
Get off of her!

891
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,546
Whoa! Hey.

892
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,090
Hey, hey, easy.

893
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,759
All right. No need to get upset.

894
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:12,803
All right? No need to get upset.

895
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:14,388
Oh, do I look upset?

896
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:15,722
Why would I be upset?

897
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,517
Because every man in the world

898
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,769
thinks he can do whatever he wants
whenever he wants?

899
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:23,105
Okay, okay. Hey, we were
just having a little bit
of fun. All right?

900
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:24,815
Oh, was that what that was?
'Cause you see,

901
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,652
when a lady screams "Stop,"

902
00:41:28,735 --> 00:41:31,738
it is usually because
she is not having the time of her life.

903
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,865
But what do I Know?

904
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:36,660
Now, you're gonna pull up your pants

905
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,831
and you are gonna
get the hell out of here.

906
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:43,041
Get out!

907
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,796

No, it's not.

913

Okay, then.

914
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:08,525

You stupid bitches.

917
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,164
You're going down.

918
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:24,791

No, Boomer. Please.

You're gonna rot in jail.

925
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,390
Yeah, you think you're so much better
than everyone.

926
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,267
Well, now you are finished.

927
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,686
It is over!
No, please! (SCREAMS)

928
