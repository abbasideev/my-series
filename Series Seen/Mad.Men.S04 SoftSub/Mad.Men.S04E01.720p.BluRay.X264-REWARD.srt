1
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,175
Who is Don Draper?

2
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:52,550
Excuse me?

3
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:55,342
Who is Don Draper?

4
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,675
What do men say when you ask that?

5
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:02,842
Well, they usually take a minute
to think about it,

6
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,675
and then they do something cute.

7
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:07,508
One creative director said
he was a lion tamer.

8
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:10,717
I don't want to do that.

9
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,008
In the third person?

10
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:14,758
I don't know.

11
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,967
Knockout wife, two kids,
house in Westchester.

12
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,633
Take the train, maybe take your car
now that you can afford it.

13
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,800
And who told you that?

14
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:27,467
Anything? I mean, now's your chance.

15
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:32,758
Well, as I said before, I'm from the Midwest.

16
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,467
We were taught that it's not polite
to talk about yourself.

17
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:44,092
Obviously your Glo-Coat floor wax
commercials caused a bit of a squeal.

18
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:45,925
On the creative side, anyway.

19
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:47,758
What made you think of this idea?

20
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:52,217
I wanted it to be indistinguishable
from the movies.

21
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,133
I wanted people to be watching it and say,

22
00:01:56,008 --> 00:02:00,383
"What's happening in the story right now?
It's something else."

23
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:03,175
It's not an ad.

24
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:07,592
At least not for the first 30 seconds of it.

25
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:11,592
Very good, then. I think I have all I need.

26
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,133
It's only a few hundred words,

27
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,758
but on the bright side,
the picture may be bigger than the article.

28
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:20,592
You all should meet. This is Jack Hammond
from Advertising Age.

29
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,008
Roger Sterling and Pete Campbell.

30
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,342
I hope we're not interrupting this crisp
and engaging portrait you're painting.

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,592
Steady there.

32
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,508
-What happened there?
-Korea.

33
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:38,883
We're grateful for your sacrifice. Peter.

34
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,175
Jack. Well, it's nice to meet you all.

35
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:45,883
Yeah, I'd love to bend your ear
when I finish my book.

36
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:47,800
Certainly.

37
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,342
Don, it was a pleasure.

38
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,467
-I look forward to the article.
-We all do.

39
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:00,508
My uncle lost his leg hitching a trailer.

40
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:04,383
He used to ask me to scratch his toes.
He didn't have any.

41
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,467
-We don't have time, Roger.
-One quick pop, Louise.

42
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,008
All right. Where is this party?
The Sheraton?

43
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,383
A wooden leg.

44
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:16,508
They're so cheap
they can't even afford a whole reporter.

45
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:23,217
I'm Peter Campbell,
and I'm assuming you're Jim.

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,092
-Yeah.
-And this must be Murray.

47
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,842
Bob. Murray stayed in Portland.

48
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:30,508
Too bad. Missing jackhammer season.
Roger Sterling.

49
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:34,717
-And you must be Donald Draper.
-Don.

50
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:36,342
Bob.

51
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,258
We're very, very excited
you had time to meet with us, Don.

52
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,550
Murray told us Y&R had done Glo-Coat.

53
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:48,008
Turns out everybody in New York,
except him, knows it's you.

54
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,383
And I think they're a little jealous.

55
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,675
Can't tell who the client is here.

56
00:03:55,592 --> 00:04:00,133
I know a little, but what we need to know,
what Don needs to know is,

57
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,258
what exactly is your concern?

58
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,758
Well, I must say I'm getting tired of
saying this today.

59
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:06,633
Next time, just have one meeting.

60
00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:12,092
We at Jantzen have had
a steady 25% bite of the apple.

61
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:14,175
But the two-piece is most of our concern.

62
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,425
You have a great bikini.

63
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:20,258
I've spent some time with the catalog,
and I would say no concerns at all.

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,508
It's not a bikini.

65
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:25,758
Bikini is underwear you wear to the beach.

66
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:27,758
We make a two-piece bathing suit.

67
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,342
We're a family company.

68
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:35,842
And nowadays it's tough to make a dent
if your ads don't look like a girlie magazine.

69
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:40,050
Do you want women who want bikinis
to buy your two-piece,

70
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,217
or do you just want to make sure

71
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,092
women who want a two-piece
don't suddenly buy a bikini?

72
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:51,342
My Lord.
That question just tied a knot in my brain.

73
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:57,092
Our competitors get bigger
the smaller they make that swimsuit.

74
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,925
We don't do that.

75
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,092
We would like to find a way
without playing in the gutter.

76
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,717
And that's just who our customers are.

77
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:06,508
Right now.

78
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:11,592
I love how they sit there
like a couple of choirboys.

79
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:14,883
You know one of them is leaving New York
with VD.

80
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:18,592
-Where the hell have you been?
-What's the problem?

81
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:20,675
-Don!
-Can you give me a minute?

82
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,217
I don't mind waiting.

83
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,550
How'd it go?

84
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,258
Get back to work.

85
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:48,717
How was your interview?

86
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,258
Count to 100 and buzz me.

87
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:58,925
You missed Jeff Atherton.

88
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,967
He came here expressly to see you.

89
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:05,217
I'm sorry, I didn't know he was coming,
and I don't know who that is.

90
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:08,925
You have no idea
how tiny this place looks to a stranger.

91
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,592
Did you tell him about the second floor?

92
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:14,008
I refuse to be any part of that charade.

93
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,967
I wanted an office downtown. We overspent.

94
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,883
We could have got a lot more for our money.

95
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,592
And we could have had a conference table.

96
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:25,467
Atherton thought the lack
of a conference table was deliberate.

97
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,300
He felt that a circle of chairs
demands a conversation.

98
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,842
About why there is no table.

99
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:40,550
They loved you.
What exactly is the problem?

100
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,925
Well, first of all, they're prudes.

101
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,758
Second of all, Y&R was standing
in the hallway when we left.

102
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:49,925
-You've been on a cattle call before.
-When the competition was fair.

103
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,925
Every hour of my time has to be accounted
for in the growth of this company.

104
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:56,508
Get me in a room where I have a chance.

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,592
In the end, it's going to come down to
big versus small.

106
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:05,008
There's two firms in the middle,
Kenyon & Eckhardt and D'Arcy.

107
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,258
They'll cancel each other out.

108
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,925
Y&R has six floors of creative.

109
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,258
They can throw bodies at this account
for weeks.

110
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:12,675
We don't have that kind of firepower.

111
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:16,175
We don't have to. We're the scrappy upstart.

112
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,592
You don't say that to the clients, do you?

113
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:22,842
-Your accountant is waiting.
-Send him in.

114
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,425
Creatively, Y&R is not capable of living
in this neighborhood.

115
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:29,008
You know why?

116
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,550
Because you don't work there.

117
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,550
John.

118
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:41,383
Marsha.

119
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,342
John.

120
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:45,008
Marsha.

121
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,175
John.

122
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,842
Happy Thanksgiving.

123
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:53,092
My mother's gonna be over the moon.

124
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:55,675
Enjoy it. it's the last thing
we're going to get from them.

125
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,425
-What?
-Did you kill Sugarberry?

126
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,675
That's a third of my work.

127
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,550
Stop jumping to conclusions.

128
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,008
I guess when Kreutzer said
they were going to send us all hams,

129
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:07,133
he really meant one in a cardboard box
with no note.

130
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:09,300
It's about as subtle as an atomic bomb.

131
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:10,633
Maybe they're cheap.

132
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,675
Do you honestly think this is a good sign?

133
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:16,508
-The work was old-fashioned.
-And whose fault is that?

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,258
Well, testing at four supermarkets
in Queens.

135
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:22,342
How much were they spending? Nothing.

136
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,883
If the test was a success,
they would have gone national,

137
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,258
and it could be a big account.

138
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:28,675
Damn it!

139
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,050
I thought we were getting on a streak.

140
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:35,175
Does this mean
I'm down to two days a week?

141
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:37,008
Don hated the work.

142
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,258
Put the ham on his desk.

143
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:40,300
He's probably having Thanksgiving dinner
alone in there.

144
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:42,425
That's not nice.

145
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:44,342
Marsha!

146
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,300
I'm serious.

147
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:51,842
I have a life insurance policy.
It's a company policy.

148
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:54,258
It pays the company, not the family.

149
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:55,883
What do you think?

150
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:59,592
It wouldn't be bad
to have a little security for the kids.

151
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,758
According to this,
I'm already a wealthy man.

152
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,717
Uncle Sam will take a healthy bite.

153
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,342
He already has.

154
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:10,217
And the only other issue is the house.

155
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
What about it?

156
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,842
Well, October 1st,
she was supposed to be out.

157
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:18,258
It seemed so far away
when we agreed to that.

158
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,925
Get her and him out of there and sell it.

159
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:25,925
I can call Ben Michaelson
and have him draft a doozy.

160
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:28,717
Start World War III?

161
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:34,383
You're carrying a mortgage, plus insurance,
and taxes for a house you don't live in.

162
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,175
Leave it alone.

163
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:42,758
So how are your balls?
Are you enjoying yourself?

164
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,008
Come on.

165
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:48,717
"I don't want it like this. I want it like that.

166
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
"Not too much of that, just a little like this."

167
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,133
And then they look at it,
and they don't like it.

168
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,342
Two of their test markets
are in Jewish neighborhoods.

169
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:56,967
They're idiots.

170
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:00,592
How much does it cost
for us to buy all the product?

171
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:03,633
Too much, and we'd have to do it every day.

172
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
So how much does it cost for us to get

173
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:12,425
100 women to line up at one store
one afternoon,

174
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:13,633
clean them out once?

175
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:17,050
One hundred people?
Do you know how big a line that is?

176
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,550
People would talk about it.

177
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,425
-It's a PR stunt.
-We don't do that.

178
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,383
-Why not?
-Because you can't charge for it.

179
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,842
So what?

180
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:31,800
Two women fighting over one ham,
but they have to really fight.

181
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,925
They have to get arrested or something.

182
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,508
Because it's the last ham.

183
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,842
We don't have to write a play.

184
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:40,717
It's Thanksgiving.
They're shopping, the stakes are very high.

185
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,675
Old Chuck Dewey could probably get a story
in the Daily News for a case of something.

186
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:48,842
$25 per actress.
We could get Gladys what's-her-name.

187
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,800
Who's the old lady
who never takes off her mittens?

188
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:52,425
I don't have any money.

189
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,675
-John!
-Marsha!

190
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:57,925
I can use my expense account
if I say they're whores.

191
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,967
Top-shelf liquor, what's that gonna run?

192
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,258
Harry gets a case a month for sticking
his nose up some guy's ass at NBC.

193
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,800
Should I run it by Don?

194
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:08,258
Really?

195
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:13,092
We'll see. I'll call casting.

196
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:22,383
Good. I got you when you're vulnerable.

197
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:26,342
What do you need?

198
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:28,550
Someone white to carve our turkey.

199
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,925
I can't, Roger. I have plans.

200
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,592
You told me that.

201
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,133
Then you told me you had the kids
the day after.

202
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:37,633
But you never said no
to Jane's friend Bethany.

203
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,008
No.

204
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:41,758
I was thinking the other day
about what happens when you leave here,

205
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:43,258
and it made me very upset.

206
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,383
I could say the same thing.

207
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:48,342
I'll paint you the picture that's in my mind,

208
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:49,925
but if it's true, I might kill myself.

209
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:52,092
I've hardly been a monk.

210
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:56,008
Forget that she knows Jane.
This girl's terrific.

211
00:11:56,092 --> 00:12:00,342
She looks like Virginia Mayo, she's 25,
Mount Holyoke gymnastics team.

212
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,217
See her this weekend.

213
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:05,008
You hit it off, come Turkey Day,
maybe you can stuff her.

214
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,508
Sweetheart, 8:00 Saturday night,
Jimmy's La Grange.

215
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:16,592
For beauty and the beast.

216
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:17,675
Roger.

217
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:21,508
They have chicken Kiev.
The butter squirts everywhere.

218
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:34,758
Hello, Mr. Draper.

219
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:36,550
Hello, Celia.

220
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,717
I made you some pork chops.
They're good cold, too.

221
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:48,092
I look forward to it.

222
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,508
But you don't eat nothing.

223
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:53,800
Have you seen my shine kit?

224
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,592
I put it on the top of the closet.

225
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,175
The children coming this weekend?

226
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,342
No. You need to put things back
where you found them.

227
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,675
I didn't want to leave it
in the middle of the floor.

228
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,425
Okay, good night.
You have a good weekend.

229
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:23,800
And eat something.

230
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:55,008
Let me out of here!

231
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:58,258
Let me out of here!

232
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,883
Let me out of here!

233
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:09,008
Footprints on a wet floor
That's no longer a hanging offense.

234
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,342
Glo-Coat's patented formula
goes on easy and dries in seconds.

235
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:21,008
So how do you know Jane?

236
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:25,592
Before you ask me all the questions,
you have to let me finish one glass.

237
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,675
I don't have to ask you any questions.

238
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:35,258
I think I'm actually nervous.
I haven't done this since college.

239
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:38,467
Not that it was so long ago,
although it seems like it.

240
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,300
I borrowed a dress.

241
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:43,133
You sat down so fast
I didn't get a good look.

242
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,675
Do you want to see it?

243
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:02,133
I can't believe I did that.

244
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,133
It's hard to believe there are two girls
who can wear that.

245
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,883
Don, I want to lift a shadow off this evening.

246
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,342
I Know this is your first date.

247
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:15,383
First that Roger was involved in.

248
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,092
Of course. I'm sure. It's just...

249
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:23,342
I'm breaking a lot of my rules
seeing a divorced man.

250
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:27,883
But Jane has made you her personal cause.

251
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:33,050
And there are so many real problems
in the world.

252
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,092
I know. The world is so dark right now.

253
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,508
The country?

254
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:46,300
My goodness, you've made me
feel very serious all of a sudden.

255
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:49,592
I don't know if I can make you feel better
about the world.

256
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:54,383
One of the boys killed in Mississippi,
Andrew Goodman, he was from here.

257
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:58,258
A girlfriend of mine
knew him from summer camp.

258
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:01,300
Is that what it takes to change things?

259
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,050
What do you do?

260
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,675
I'm an actress.

261
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:10,758
But right now I'm a super in the opera.

262
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,300
And what is that?

263
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:14,467
A supernumerary.

264
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,883
We're the actors that till the stage.

265
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,008
Like the chorus?

266
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:21,217
No singing.

267
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,633
I do a lot of mock drinking. I'm a wench.

268
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:28,758
I'm a courtesan. Part of a harem.

269
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,758
It depends on the opera.

270
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,675
That is truly fascinating.

271
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:39,717
I love the music, and I love backstage.

272
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:42,967
Our costumes are as good as the singers'.

273
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,425
And I love the stories.

274
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,425
They're very romantic.

275
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:50,592
Have you been?

276
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,133
I have.

277
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:56,175
But only for business,
so I've never enjoyed it.

278
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,050
Well, then you must come as my guest.

279
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:05,008
They give the supers tickets
instead of paying a decent wage.

280
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,508
Madam?

281
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,425
I don't even need to look. Chicken Kiev.

282
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,092
They make you wear a bib.

283
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,008
Come on. Let's have some fun.

284
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,175
Two chicken Kievs.

285
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:28,092
The Barbizon.

286
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,633
I bet that would make a great opera.

287
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,008
It would.

288
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,508
Well, I guess this is "good night."

289
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,175
Okay.

290
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,342
Good night.

291
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,842
So am I gonna see you
at Roger and Jane's for Thanksgiving?

292
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,633
It's tempting, but I have plans.

293
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,425
I'm sure the holidays must be very complex.

294
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:17,092
It may have been a while since you've had to
pick up on messages,

295
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:19,800
but I want to see you again.

296
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:22,092
How about right now?

297
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:26,092
I stopped the meter. We can start it again.
It'll be like I just picked you up.

298
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:28,675
Will you please take a weak no?

299
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,258
Let's see where we are New Year's Eve.

300
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:35,550
-If it's meant to be, it'll keep.
-Let me walk you in.

301
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,800
No. I know that trick.

302
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,633
Waverly and 6th Avenue.

303
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,508
I think you both
really acquitted yourselves well.

304
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:15,633
She doesn't know when to stop.
You don't know when to stop.

305
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:18,217
My objective was to get the ham.

306
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,175
No one told you to hit me.
That wasn't part of it.

307
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:24,717
The important thing is that...
Here's Mr. Campbell.

308
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:30,342
I've been assured
that you ladies can look for your names

309
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,675
and perhaps your picture
in Monday's Daily News.

310
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:33,925
What section?

311
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:36,342
It's the Daily News. it's one big section.

312
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:41,175
All in all, not a bad way to spend a Sunday.

313
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,925
Can you go back to the market
and get me some aspirin?

314
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:49,925
We probably shouldn't have
any more contact for the time being.

315
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,092
Shall we?

316
00:20:56,675 --> 00:21:00,425
We really appreciate your talent
and, of course, your discretion.

317
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,508
You hurt me.

318
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,175
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

319
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,592
Daisy!

320
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:07,883
Walk her to the train.

321
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:11,800
-Are you okay, dear?
-Yeah.

322
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,300
Let's get you in a cab.

323
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:20,675
Morning.

324
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,842
Welcome back. How was Los Angeles?

325
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:24,592
Very hard to leave.

326
00:21:25,842 --> 00:21:27,508
I would love a vacation.

327
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:31,258
It wasn't a vacation.
I had a lot of tsuris with Lucy and Desi.

328
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:33,342
Has someone been using my office?

329
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,217
Mr. Sterling doesn't have a television.

330
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:39,175
I'm calling a meeting for 11:00.
No, make it 1:00.

331
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:42,383
-Do we have a table yet?
-1:30, and no.

332
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,550
-Hi.
-Yes?

333
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:46,758
Do you know where the Secor rough cut is?

334
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:48,092
I got it!

335
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:51,925
Don't you want to know why?

336
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:55,508
I sold the Jai Alai TV special.

337
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:57,758
Really?

338
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:01,800
ABC, they're moving towards all these
eccentric sporting events, go-karts.

339
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,008
Well, that's very exciting.

340
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:05,925
Can you get someone to track down
a cup of coffee for me?

341
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,342
And I'd love a grapefruit juice-

342
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,508
And, Joan, that is my news.

343
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,008
I won't even tell people after it's aired.

344
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:18,550
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

345
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,592
Don, can I speak with you for a minute?

346
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:31,133
Morning.

347
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:35,258
-Lane, would you excuse us for a minute?
-Of course.

348
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:37,133
Good morning, Don.

349
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:47,050
You know, no one who's ever been
associated with an actual event

350
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,300
has thought it's been portrayed honestly
in the newspaper.

351
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:57,550
"Donald Draper, or Don as he is known,
perhaps in an attempt to appear humble,

352
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,008
"is a handsome cipher.

353
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:02,508
"One imagines somewhere in an attic

354
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:05,717
"there's a painting of him
that's rapidly aging."

355
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:08,258
For a guy from Ad Age, he can really write.

356
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:10,883
-He also says you're married.
-Jesus.

357
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:14,008
He never asked me that.
Did he check any facts?

358
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,508
You didn't give him any facts.
He had to make some assumptions.

359
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:21,842
My job is to write ads,
not go around talking about who I am.

360
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:24,092
Who knows who you are?

361
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:27,675
This was supposed to be
an advertisement for the firm.

362
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:30,175
-Why do you have so many copies?
-I bought one to read.

363
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:33,883
I was going to buy one
to frame in reception, and then I read it.

364
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,050
I just wanted to get them all
before anyone else did.

365
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,258
It'll be lining bird cages by Friday.

366
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:39,842
This is a missed opportunity.

367
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:43,967
You turned all the sizzle from Glo-Coat
into a wet fart.

368
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:45,842
Plus, you sound like a prick.

369
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,050
Well, it's done.

370
00:23:49,342 --> 00:23:51,300
I learned a valuable lesson.

371
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:52,842
Stay away from one-legged reporters.

372
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:56,842
Yeah, I was thinking about that.
Who is he to criticize anybody?

373
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,008
Just so you don't kill yourself,
there was some good news.

374
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:04,967
Jane's friend found you to be charming.
Although a little grabby in the car.

375
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:07,217
That is good news. Thank you.

376
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:09,842
She liked you. Maybe you should have
fondled Peg-Leg Pete.

377
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,758
They raise you up and they knock you down.

378
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,258
I don't know
what I could have done differently.

379
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:17,675
I believe that you were being modest,
but he didn't.

380
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:21,717
I'm sorry, but after the year you've had,
it's just not appropriate anymore.

381
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,467
He's expecting us!

382
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:32,342
-Is Joey coming?
-I'm here.

383
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:35,508
Why can't you come to our office?

384
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:37,675
Do you want to hear
what Sugarberry said or not?

385
00:24:37,758 --> 00:24:38,842
Shoot.

386
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:41,800
It was uproarious. First it's Darryl,

387
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:44,258
and he tells me about how they
stared at the article all day yesterday,

388
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:45,842
worrying about a lawsuit.

389
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:49,217
So I hang up and debate whether or not
to tell Don, throw myself on my sword.

390
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,258
And then Kreutzer calls to tell me
other papers picked up the story.

391
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,342
And I think, "He knows it's us,"
but how could he?

392
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:58,342
And he said everyone, especially Darryl,
was very excited.

393
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,133
And then he gets Christian.

394
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:03,175
He's sorry someone got hurt,

395
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:06,925
but more people will taste their ham now,
and they'll love it.

396
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:08,633
It's beautiful.

397
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,383
How do you put something like this
in your book?

398
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,967
You can't. We can't even charge them.

399
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:15,217
Well, it wouldn't be a bad idea for them
to increase their media budget.

400
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,717
-Seize the moment.
-With more crappy ads?

401
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,925
-Hopefully not.
-You use it.

402
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:23,758
"The winner of the ham battle is you."

403
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:24,967
Can you imagine?

404
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,175
Lane's dentures would drop out of his head
if we came in with an additional buy.

405
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:33,842
"Our hams are worth fighting for."

406
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,342
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indian
in a tug of war with the ham.

407
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:42,967
Old ladies will smile.

408
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,758
Why didn't you pitch that two months ago?
It's good on its own.

409
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:48,008
A slogan's nothing
when you have a good idea.

410
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,758
Black crayon. I need it in an hour.

411
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,467
Chop-chop, Joey.

412
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:58,092
Clara, could you get Darryl for me
at Sugarberry?

413
00:25:58,175 --> 00:25:59,467
Tell him it's urgent.

414
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,342
I may need you.

415
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,383
Horace Cook, Jr. It's urgent.

416
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:08,675
Ho-Ho. How was Tijuana?

417
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,842
I have to say, it's a very flattering picture.

418
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:15,467
And I don't think I'd mind
being described that way.

419
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,925
Mr. Crane, you're a salesman.

420
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:20,342
You do not want to be known as mysterious.

421
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,383
There'll be no further discussion.

422
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:26,217
I just got off the phone with Ho-Ho.
Jai Alai is leaving.

423
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:28,508
-What?
-it's over.

424
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,258
Bullshit. I just sold a TV special to ABC.

425
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:34,758
Well, apparently Don didn't mention them
in the article.

426
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:39,092
I didn't mention anyone.
That's the reporter's job.

427
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:42,925
Spectacular.

428
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,300
What the hell's Ho-Ho doing
reading Ad Age?

429
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:46,383
Fix it.

430
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,342
Todd got all the partners from CGC to call,
and they worked them up and down.

431
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:53,258
-They told him we laugh about him.
-I don't!

432
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:56,425
Get him on the phone, get him in here
or camp out in his driveway.

433
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:57,717
He hung up on me.

434
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,050
I think he was crying.

435
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:06,508
How much was left in Ho-Ho anyway?

436
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:09,633
We'll survive with Jai Alai off our list.

437
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,425
We will survive, but for how long?

438
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:16,508
The loss of Jai Alai
makes Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.

439
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:18,842
It's an untenably insecure position.

440
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:24,675
Harry, why don't you call
and pretend like you don't Know any of this.

441
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:27,175
Give it an hour so he'll take the call.

442
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:30,967
I wish we really had a second floor
so I could jump off it.

443
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:41,883
I'm going to have to get you
another interview.

444
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:44,383
The Wall Street Journal.

445
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:47,758
And what do I do differently?
I told him the truth.

446
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:51,508
Who gives a crap what I say anyway?
My work speaks for me.

447
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:55,508
Turning creative success into business
is your work.

448
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,133
And you've failed.

449
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:08,633
It'll pass.

450
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,383
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

451
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:19,258
Happy Thanksgiving.

452
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:21,258
We started without you.

453
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:24,342
Grandma Pauline, I told you Mother's
was at noon. We already ate.

454
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:27,508
Well, you're supposed to overeat
on Thanksgiving.

455
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:29,258
Thank you.

456
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:31,342
Jamie, you'll have something?

457
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,342
We missed dessert.

458
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:36,508
You're next to your father.

459
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,800
Put up some coffee, dear.

460
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,425
-Hi, Daddy.
-Isn't that sweet?

461
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:45,508
We didn't forget you.

462
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:49,633
What do you say?

463
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:51,050
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

464
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,633
After you eat.

465
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,342
The traffic was simply murder.

466
00:28:58,217 --> 00:29:00,383
That's because
that's what's become of this country.

467
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:02,508
Everyone has two Thanksgivings to go to.

468
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:06,675
Maybe we have twice as much
to be thankful for.

469
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,467
Don't you like the food, dear?

470
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:17,342
-No.
-Sally Draper, that's rude.

471
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,008
-You love cranberry sauce.
-It has seeds in it.

472
00:29:21,717 --> 00:29:23,675
-How about the sweet potato?
-I'm not hungry.

473
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:26,842
Look, there's marshmallow.

474
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,175
Oh, Lord.

475
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,758
She might have a fever.

476
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:42,050
-I'm sorry.
-it's all right, dear.

477
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:44,383
Isabel, can you bring a rag?

478
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:46,842
Stop pinching me!

479
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:54,175
I love sweet potatoes.

480
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:00,342
Isabel.

481
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:05,217
Happy Thanksgiving.

482
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:13,217
Do you want a drink?

483
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,050
I don't have much time.
I have supper with my family.

484
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:18,425
Of course you do.

485
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:20,550
Should I not have mentioned my family?

486
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:22,050
I never know how you're going to react.

487
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,175
No, that's fine.

488
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,717
-Let me take off my brassiere.
-No. In a minute.

489
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,342
Stop telling me what to do.
I know what you want.

490
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,758
So do it.

491
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,675
Harder.

492
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:51,592
Again.

493
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,633
Hold on.

494
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:13,842
Surprise. It's for you.

495
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,425
Why did you answer it?

496
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:22,300
It was the third try. I couldn't take it.

497
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,425
-Hello?
-Happy Thanksgiving.

498
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:30,633
Happy Thanksgiving.

499
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,675
I'm sorry to bother you.
I didn't know you'd have guests.

500
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,133
What's wrong?

501
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:39,050
I need $280 for bail.

502
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,383
Bye.

503
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:43,675
Where are you?

504
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:45,842
It's not for me.

505
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,758
Spit it out, honey.

506
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,133
You're going to laugh.

507
00:31:56,842 --> 00:32:01,842
Pete and I hired some actresses
to get in a fight over a Sugarberry ham.

508
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:04,008
You know, as a stunt.

509
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:07,342
We got them to increase their media budget.

510
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:09,675
Hello?

511
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:11,508
I'm here.

512
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:15,633
Well, one of them pressed charges
against the other for assault.

513
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,508
It's $80 bail and $100 apiece
to keep their mouths shut.

514
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,675
And it has to happen today.

515
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:23,758
Call Pete!

516
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,050
Do you think you're my first call?

517
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:33,008
Hello. I'm so sorry to bother you.

518
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,258
-I ought to let you twist in the wind.
-It still worked out.

519
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:38,758
-You'll be very happy.
-I'm not happy.

520
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:42,383
And I don't think it's funny or cute.
You run something like that by me first.

521
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,717
I would have kept you
from looking like an idiot,

522
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,883
or worse yet, making me look like one.
Is that what you want?

523
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,092
You want people
to think we're idiots, Peggy?

524
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:54,633
Hey, there's no reason for name-calling.
She's been agonizing.

525
00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:55,758
Who are you?

526
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,175
I'm her fiancé.

527
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:00,217
Mark, don't.

528
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,425
Why'd you bring him up here
if you didn't want him involved?

529
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:07,008
I know. I'm sorry, Don.

530
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,592
-Fiancé?
-It just came out.

531
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,925
Did you put the dog out?

532
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:26,550
It's cold outside.
But I locked her in the laundry room.

533
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:34,175
It's not cold in here.

534
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:50,842
Sally.

535
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:53,300
I was calling Daddy.

536
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:55,342
Hello?

537
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,508
I wanted to wish him a happy Thanksgiving.

538
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:00,925
You'll see him tomorrow.

539
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:03,925
You want to call him to complain
about how awful I am?

540
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,758
Don't expect any sympathy
when he hears my side of the story.

541
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,800
-Don't!
-Go to bed.

542
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:19,675
I'm going to have them
take that phone out of the hallway.

543
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,258
Tomorrow, when the kids go,

544
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:34,217
why don't we have Carla take the baby,
and we'll drive to a nice dinner?

545
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:36,800
Maybe Essex.

546
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:39,717
The Griswold Inn.

547
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:42,717
Okay.

548
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:49,342
I'm really full, Betty.

549
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,008
Daddy!

550
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:02,175
Dad.

551
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:08,217
-How much turkey did you eat?
-I ate everything.

552
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:12,217
-Hello, Daddy.
-Hello.

553
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:17,508
9:00 tomorrow night.

554
00:35:17,758 --> 00:35:20,258
-Where's the baby?
-I had Carla take him.

555
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:22,550
You weren't going to.
Henry and I have plans.

556
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:23,717
I'd like to see him.

557
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,175
-Hello, Don.
-Henry.

558
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:31,675
Come on, let's go.

559
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:51,675
Garage door.

560
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,175
What are you doing?

561
00:35:58,008 --> 00:35:59,175
You know what I'm doing.

562
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:09,508
The button fell off my pajamas.

563
00:36:11,258 --> 00:36:14,092
-I'll sew it on in the morning.
-You know how to sew?

564
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:16,592
I can do a button. I'll show you.

565
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:26,175
I'll leave the light on in the bathroom
so there won't be any more problems, okay?

566
00:36:26,258 --> 00:36:27,425
Okay.

567
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:28,925
Good night, Daddy.

568
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,008
Good night, both of you.

569
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,342
Do you have your key?

570
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:37,717
-Hello?
-Maybe they're asleep.

571
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,258
Go upstairs.

572
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,258
What the hell is the dog doing in the house?

573
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:19,383
You run up to bed. I'll wait.

574
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:20,967
For what?

575
00:38:24,758 --> 00:38:25,758
It's almost 10:00.

576
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,592
-I thought you said 10:00.
-She didn't.

577
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:30,467
I've waited for you plenty of times.

578
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:33,258
Henry, do you mind?

579
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:36,342
-Betty?
-it's okay.

580
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:38,383
Does that mean I should stay or not stay?

581
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:39,758
Stay.

582
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:45,800
When are you moving out?

583
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:47,675
I don't know.

584
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,258
Well, you were supposed to be out
a month ago.

585
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:52,175
We haven't found the right place
for the kids.

586
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:55,383
Well, either do as we agreed,
or I'm gonna need to collect rent.

587
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,467
What?

588
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,883
Or you could just buy it from me
if you want to.

589
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:03,175
-I can't believe you.
-Don, it's temporary.

590
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,508
Believe me, Henry,
everybody thinks this is temporary.

591
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,925
Good night.

592
00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:16,175
He has some nerve.

593
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,842
I know you don't want to hear this,
but he's right.

594
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:25,800
Haven't the kids been through
enough change already?

595
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:30,300
-I can't just uproot them with no place to go.
-You're not even looking.

596
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,717
There's nothing out there,
and he doesn't decide.

597
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,342
Miss Olson is here to see you.

598
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,717
Send her in.

599
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:00,217
They sent one for each of us.

600
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:04,425
Could have just as easily fired us.

601
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,508
But they didn't,
because they sold more hams.

602
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:10,925
And now you get to tell them why
if you want.

603
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,175
I think they'll be impressed.

604
00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:15,383
Well, I'm not.

605
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,967
I try and stay away
from these kinds of shenanigans.

606
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,967
But I guess you knew that
or you would have told me.

607
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:25,217
It was going great until it wasn't.

608
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,175
Thanks for the ham.

609
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:32,008
I should have told you.

610
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:35,842
Since when do you have a fiance?

611
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,300
I don't.

612
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:41,967
But you didn't have to do that that way.

613
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,592
You brought him with you because
you thought I wouldn't embarrass you.

614
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,842
At least I'm thinking ahead.

615
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,675
Doesn't always work, does it?

616
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:55,258
You need to think a little bit more
about the image of this agency.

617
00:40:56,342 --> 00:40:57,925
Well, nobody knows about the ham stunt,

618
00:40:58,008 --> 00:41:01,342
so our image remains
pretty much where you left it.

619
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:05,175
I won't need you
in the Jantzen presentation.

620
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:06,842
Now you're being spiteful.

621
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,883
No, I just think it would be better
not to have a girl in the room.

622
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,383
You know something?
We are all here because of you.

623
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:22,633
All we want to do is please you.

624
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,967
Why don't I put them in the pantry?
Christmas is around the corner.

625
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,050
Put them in the basement.

626
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,842
Did the children like their gifts?

627
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,383
They did.

628
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:48,633
It's nice the holiday is memorable
in some other way.

629
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:52,300
I'm sorry a little girl
spoiled your Thanksgiving.

630
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:54,050
Next time I'll tell her not to get sick.

631
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:58,842
I've raised children in my life, Henry.
They're terrified of her.

632
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:01,383
You don't know any of the people
you're talking about.

633
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:03,842
Well, I know what you see in her.

634
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:06,342
And you could have gotten it
without marrying.

635
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:10,675
Why can't you give her a chance?
She loves you.

636
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:12,675
She's a silly woman.

637
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:18,217
Honestly, Henry. I don't know
how you can stand living in that man's dirt.

638
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:28,758
You go to the swimming pool,
you go to the beach,

639
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:31,342
take off your robe,
you head into the Cabana.

640
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:34,967
There's no other way to slice it,
you're getting undressed.

641
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,467
Can I put my feet on this?

642
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,675
-Pretend like it's your living room.
-Thank you.

643
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:43,092
What separates a bathing suit
from underwear?

644
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:48,550
The cut and the print of the cloth
and some sort of gentlemen's agreement.

645
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:58,008
"So well built,
we can't show you the second floor."

646
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:09,550
I think that's a little suggestive.

647
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,717
Good. That's what I was going for.

648
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,675
A wink, but it's not a leer.

649
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:17,175
We don't want a wink.

650
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:20,633
I think I explained
our product is for modest people.

651
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,800
Modest people want to be stimulated, too.

652
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,758
This draws them in in a way

653
00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:27,800
that will make your competitors
seem crude and obvious.

654
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:29,800
Plus, they'll be dying to see the suit.

655
00:43:29,883 --> 00:43:31,967
They'll be dying to see the girl.

656
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,842
And for all we know,
she's not even wearing a top.

657
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:38,008
You'll get them into the store.
isn't that the point?

658
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:42,175
It's not wholesome. It's not...

659
00:43:43,175 --> 00:43:44,842
Did I tell you we're a family company?

660
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,592
I think I know what you're looking for.

661
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,675
A couple of women bouncing a beach ball,

662
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:51,842
little girl in front of them
building a sandcastle.

663
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:57,592
Your competitors are gonna keep killing you
because you're too scared of the skin

664
00:43:57,675 --> 00:44:00,508
that your two-piece
was designed to show off.

665
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:05,342
Well, it's somehow dirtier
not seeing anything.

666
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:09,133
You need to decide
what kind of company you want to be.

667
00:44:09,217 --> 00:44:12,967
Comfortable and dead,
or risky and possibly rich.

668
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:15,508
All I know is we don't want that.

669
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:20,383
Well, gentlemen, you were wondering
what a creative agency looks like,

670
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:22,133
there you have it.

671
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:25,300
Hope you enjoyed looking in the window.

672
00:44:26,717 --> 00:44:28,342
Give me a minute.

673
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:32,633
Where are you going?

674
00:44:33,008 --> 00:44:35,717
Control yourself. Cool off.

675
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:39,925
And hopefully Campbell can talk them into
hearing a few more ideas in a week or so.

676
00:44:40,008 --> 00:44:42,717
What? No. That's not the point.

677
00:44:45,675 --> 00:44:46,883
Out. Get out.

678
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,383
-Don.
-Excuse me?

679
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:50,925
Get your things
and get out of my office now.

680
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:54,008
Come on. Let's go.

681
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:05,342
Call Bert Cooper's man at
The Wall Street Journal.

682
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:16,258
There's always a name in every partnership
that defines who they are.

683
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:20,592
In the case of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,
would you say that's Donald Draper?

684
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:23,342
Yes.

685
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,383
Really?

686
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:29,175
Last year,
our agency was being swallowed whole.

687
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,925
I realized I had two choices.

688
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:35,675
I could die of boredom
or holster up my guns.

689
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:41,258
So I walked into Lane Pryce's office
and I said,

690
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:42,508
"Fire us."

691
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:50,050
Two days later,
we were operating out of the Pierre Hotel.

692
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:53,508
Within a year, we had taken over two floors
of the Time-Life Building.
