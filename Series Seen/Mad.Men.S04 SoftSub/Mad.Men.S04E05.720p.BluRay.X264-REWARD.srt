1
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,717
Donald Draper's office.

2
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:56,092
In addition to the two major cough drop
users, smokers and cold sufferers,

3
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:58,925
is another group that eats them as candy.

4
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:01,467
The technical term is "hypochondriacs."

5
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:07,842
Donald Draper.

6
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,217
Donald Draper's office.

7
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:16,842
Hello?

8
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:22,008
You said not to buzz you all the time,
but I don't know how else to do this.

9
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:23,467
You have a phone call.

10
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:25,217
You can buzz me for a phone call.

11
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:29,008
Things like coffee after I've said no,
you don't have to ask again.

12
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:31,092
You're always asleep in here.

13
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,550
Walter Hoffman from The Times.
He's a reporter.

14
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,175
What's it regarding?

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,758
You want me to go ask?

16
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,467
I think we're done here.

17
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:44,717
New York Times.

18
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,133
This is Don.

19
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:51,883
Hi. it's Walter Hoffman
from The New York Times.

20
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,675
I write the advertising column.

21
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:56,300
I know who you are.
What can I do for you, Walter?

22
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,675
I just wanted to know if you'd heard

23
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:00,133
that Cutler Gleason and Chaough
just signed Clearasil.

24
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,300
I don't keep track of accounts
once we resign them.

25
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,633
I just think it's kind of interesting

26
00:02:06,717 --> 00:02:10,467
that first CGC takes the Jai Alai
Association from you and now this.

27
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,133
-How do you explain it?
-I don't think about it.

28
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,175
Well, I talked to Ted Chaough

29
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:19,008
and he said, "Every time Don Draper
looks in his rearview mirror, he sees me."

30
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,633
You have a partners' luncheon.

31
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:22,717
What's your point?

32
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:24,967
My point is do you have a response?

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,258
On the record?

34
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:27,342
Please.

35
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:30,175
I've never heard of him.

36
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:31,967
Anything else?

37
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:35,925
No. Have a good day.

38
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:43,508
This Selma thing is not going away.

39
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:46,508
You still don't think
they need a civil rights law?

40
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,758
They got what they wanted.
Why aren't they happy?

41
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:51,383
Because Lassie
stays at the Waldorf and they can't.

42
00:02:51,508 --> 00:02:53,133
Please tell me I missed everything.

43
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,967
I now call to order a meeting of the partners,

44
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,925
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
In attendance...

45
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,425
Everybody.

46
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,258
Very well then, Mr. Campbell.

47
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:08,383
Secor Laxative has finally agreed to produce
a television commercial and test market it.

48
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:12,633
How'd you ease them into it?
Must've had to loosen them up first.

49
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:15,675
We've had that client for 18 years, Roger.

50
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:18,092
Pete has other news.

51
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:21,800
A Deerfield chum of mine
roped me into a dinner for the Asia Society,

52
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,217
the result of which was a series
of interesting phone calls and one lunch

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,758
regarding the Honda Motorcycle Company.

54
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,675
They control over 50% of the US market.

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,008
I've seen them. They're cute.

56
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:34,300
They're miserable at Grey.

57
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,467
Well, 50% of the market, who wouldn't be?

58
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,508
"Where's my other half?"

59
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:43,217
They're taking meetings and as of 9:00
this morning, we're on the books.

60
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,633
Three million dollars in potential billings,

61
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,842
and they're venturing
into automobiles as well.

62
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:48,967
When can you bring them in?

63
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,967
Listen, let me spare you the agony
and the ecstasy

64
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,550
and tell you we are not doing business
with them.

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Excuse me?

66
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,675
Look, I don't expect you to understand this,
because you were a little boy,

67
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,883
but I used to be a man with a lot of friends.

68
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:05,008
Then World War II came and they were
all Killed by your new yellow buddies.

69
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:10,508
Look,

70
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:12,675
if Bernbach can do business
with Volkswagen,

71
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:14,092
we can do business with anybody.

72
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,758
The war is over, Roger.

73
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,758
Why don't we just bring
Dr. Lyle Evans in here?

74
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:19,300
That'll be enough of that.

75
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,758
Lucky Strike is great. Meeting adjourned.

76
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:34,092
We don't usually put new business to a vote,
do we?

77
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,467
Does anyone really
have a problem with this?

78
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,300
No. When can you bring them in?

79
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:41,425
Immediately, if possible.
I don't want to lose our spot.

80
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:44,175
So far I've been advised to read
The Chrysanthemum and the Sword.

81
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,508
From what I can tell,
they have their own way of doing business.

82
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:51,050
Bert, I'm hoping you'll help us
navigate these waters?

83
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:55,050
I'll prepare a few salient points.
Keep Roger out of the loop.

84
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,842
Another rather exciting possibility.

85
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,008
Good work.

86
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,008
Joan, get everybody that book.

87
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,092
I at least want them
to see it on people's desks.

88
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:06,842
Who the hell is Dr. Lyle Evans?

89
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,717
I have no idea.

90
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,967
The body of a 38-year-old Unitarian minister

91
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,758
was cremated within hours
of his death last night.

92
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:18,633
He had been clubbed by white men
who resented his coming to Selma

93
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,967
-to join negro civil rights demonstrations.
-Come in.

94
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,758
-Hi.
-Hi.

95
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,758
Sally?

96
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:28,675
Hello.

97
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,925
I brought my doctor kit.

98
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:36,883
Okay, I'm gonna go.

99
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:40,092
Enjoy yourself. Which one is it?

100
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,633
I mean, which restaurant,
in case I need to reach you.

101
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,008
Benihana's.

102
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:47,425
You're going to see a girl, aren't you?

103
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:48,758
Yes, I am.

104
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:51,008
-What's her name?
-Bethany.

105
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:52,633
I don't like that.

106
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,592
Well, you don't have to.

107
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,967
Bed by 9:00?

108
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:04,592
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

109
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,133
Jesus. What did you do?

110
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,508
You look like a mongoloid.

111
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:19,883
-Is it that bad?
-Bobby, go to bed.

112
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,175
Sally, get over here.

113
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:22,383
No.

114
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,383
Good night.

115
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,217
Come over here.

116
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:30,383
I'm not mad. Come on.

117
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,717
Your dad is gonna kill me.

118
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,675
He's actually gonna kill me.

119
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,217
You have short hair and Daddy likes it.

120
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:48,425
That doesn't matter.

121
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,675
You're not allowed to do this
and you know that.

122
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:53,967
Are you and Daddy doing it?

123
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,092
What?

124
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:57,383
I know what it is.

125
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:59,800
I know that the man pees inside the woman.

126
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:01,925
Where did you hear that?

127
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:03,717
A girl at school.

128
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,175
You should talk to your mommy.

129
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:07,717
I don't want to.

130
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,342
You don't need to know right now,
so stop changing the subject.

131
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:12,758
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,800
Do you understand
I'm in worse trouble than you are?

133
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,550
I just wanted to look pretty.

134
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:25,383
Come on.

135
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,675
We're gonna try and fix this, okay?

136
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:42,383
You're not impressed.

137
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:45,383
-My hair smells like I've been frying chicken.
-It does?

138
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:47,842
Stop it.

139
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:50,758
This place is very expensive.

140
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:53,550
That's not it. it's just not very intimate.

141
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,467
Three dates in five months?
Don't think I don't know why.

142
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:59,342
If it isn't the inscrutable Don Draper.

143
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,508
Ted.

144
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,592
-This is my wife Nan.
-This is my friend Bethany.

145
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:06,800
Ted Chaough.

146
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:09,175
-Don Draper.
-Pleasure.

147
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:10,258
Pleasure.

148
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:13,342
We just booked Howard Moses to shoot
Clearasil. Have you ever worked with him?

149
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:15,342
Not yet.

150
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,550
I thought I was clever,
but it looks like you and I had the same idea.

151
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:19,883
What are you talking about?

152
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,633
What do you think? Honda?

153
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:25,008
You think the rest of these tourists
are from J Walter Thompson?

154
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,425
I suppose it's possible.

155
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,633
Well, the good news is,
I think it's gonna be between us.

156
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,800
The bad news is the best man's gonna win.

157
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,050
Enjoy your dinner.

158
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:36,342
-We will.
-Nice to meet you.

159
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,675
-What are you doing, Ted?
-My job.

160
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:48,842
-Who's he?
-Some fly I keep swatting away.

161
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:52,217
They haven't done half of what we have.

162
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,800
The minute he declared himself
the competition, suddenly we were equal.

163
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:59,967
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
he's no competition at all.

164
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,175
Hello?

165
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:07,967
We're not gonna let this
spoil our evening, are we?

166
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,717
No.

167
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:15,842
-Do you know how to use those?
-Yes.

168
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,300
You think you could teach me?

169
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:36,800
-What time did they go to bed?
-I'm really, really sorry.

170
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:40,633
-They still up?
-No.

171
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:45,258
It's just, I was watching I V with Bobby
and I turned around for a second

172
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:47,092
and Sally cut her hair.

173
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:48,633
What?

174
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,883
It's pretty bad.

175
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,800
I could've just left them alone.

176
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:57,467
-She was in the bathroom. I didn't know.
-You're supposed to watch them.

177
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,175
Don't.

178
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,675
I finally got her to sleep.

179
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:05,592
Do you know the river of shit
I'm gonna get from her mother?

180
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:08,008
I'm sorry about that. I tried to fix it,

181
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,383
but you'll probably
need to take her to the beauty parlor.

182
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:13,092
Why the hell did she do that?

183
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:16,342
She probably wanted to look older
like Hayley Mills.

184
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:19,008
I don't know. I really shouldn't.

185
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:21,008
Consider it severance.

186
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,175
-Look...
-I don't want your advice, okay?

187
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,050
Good night.

188
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:51,717
It's probably the kids.

189
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:57,592
Hi, Mom.

190
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,342
-Did you have a nice time?
-Yeah.

191
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:07,383
Take that hat off.

192
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:12,800
Let me explain, okay?

193
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,758
-What the hell happened to you?
-Calm down.

194
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,092
-You cut her hair?
-No.

195
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:17,758
I cut it. I'm sorry...

196
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,008
-Hey!
-Betty.

197
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,425
It was an accident.

198
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,967
Jesus. Betts, is that necessary?

199
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,883
I'm really, really sorry.

200
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:27,425
Damn right you're sorry.
Get up to your room.

201
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:29,300
-Hold on.
-No, now.

202
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:32,342
It'll be okay.

203
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:35,300
Bobby, take your
little brother outside and play.

204
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:41,717
You didn't have to hit her.

205
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:44,925
You're right, because it doesn't do anything!

206
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,092
You have picture day.

207
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:49,758
-And forget about your sleepover.
-Kids do this.

208
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,758
-You never did this?
-All I wanted was to have long hair.

209
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,842
In fact when my mother was mad at me,
she would threaten to cut my hair.

210
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,758
-Where the hell were you?
-Look, it just happened.

211
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:00,217
The sitter wasn't paying attention.

212
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,467
You know what?
I don't want to know about your life.

213
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,717
You can't even watch them for a second.
it's like leaving them with nobody.

214
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,842
Because you're so good with them?

215
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:10,050
Take her to the hairdresser.

216
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:12,092
Goodbye.

217
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,633
-Betty.
-Henry, I don't want to hear it.

218
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,883
I want him dead!

219
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,467
You don't think I feel that?

220
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:29,050
I was divorced, Betty.

221
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,675
My weekends with Ellie were sacrosanct.

222
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:35,175
I probably paid for a building in playland
and he couldn't take a night off?

223
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:39,758
And who knows who he had watching her?
Some secretary, another whore?

224
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:41,550
But...

225
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:45,633
That's him, not Sally.

226
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:52,008
And little girls do do this,
and not just ones from broken homes.

227
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,842
I know.

228
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:00,967
I was impulsive.

229
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,675
I'll apologize.

230
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:05,342
Having had a girl this age,

231
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:09,008
I can tell you that punishment
will only make this worse.

232
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:12,842
So maybe, when you're apologizing,

233
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:16,342
you let her know she's going to go
to the hairdresser

234
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,758
and she can go on her sleepover.

235
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,383
Reward her? Really?

236
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,217
Really.

237
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:33,717
You're soft, you know that?

238
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:45,342
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
May I help you?

239
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,842
There you are. The Honda meeting's today,
and before you bite my head off,

240
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,217
I'm up to date on the protocol
with the help of Cooper

241
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:54,842
and we don't have to do anything
but avoid criticizing them or giving advice.

242
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:57,050
I ran into Ted Chaough.

243
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:59,425
How are they in this thing
and how could you not know that?

244
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,925
This guy's drafting off of us.

245
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,175
For the record, it's JWT, CGC and us.

246
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:07,175
Now if you don't mind,
I have to get some gifts wrapped

247
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:09,300
and get these chrysanthemums
out of the building.

248
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,008
Apparently they symbolize death.

249
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,675
So much conflicting information.

250
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,342
Allow me to show you around.

251
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:25,258
Our offices are probably more modern
than you've seen,

252
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,925
but that's the kind
of company we are, forward-thinking.

253
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:34,217
This is what we call the creative lounge.

254
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,758
We can't tell you how it happens,
but it does happen here.

255
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,925
This is too difficult.

256
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:42,008
Well, tell them something.

257
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,425
This is Joan Harris, our chief hostess.

258
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:50,675
I'd like you to meet
Ichiro Kamura and Hachi Saito.

259
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:54,425
Nice to meet you.
I hope no one's taken you to Benihana.

260
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:56,508
David Ogilvy.

261
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,175
I've got a very good list of steakhouses.
Just ask.

262
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,217
Not very subtle, are they?

263
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,383
No, they are not.

264
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:18,717
We are most happily
looking forward to presentation.

265
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:21,258
Not now, I hope.

266
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:26,050
We want more driver for motorcycle.

267
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,383
And we shall endeavor to make that happen.

268
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:35,175
And now that we are finished,
please accept our modest gifts.

269
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:38,342
I cannot accept.

270
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:40,758
A small token.

271
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,592
No, thank you.

272
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:47,342
Please. You are our guests.

273
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:49,342
Thank you.

274
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,592
-Open it.
-No.

275
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,675
Later, of course.

276
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:58,675
It's a cantaloupe.

277
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,633
Johnnie Walker Red.

278
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:10,383
Thank you very much.

279
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,508
Thank you.

280
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:15,925
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,758
I didn't know this meeting was happening.

282
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:21,925
Then again,
I know how some people love surprises.

283
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:25,550
I apologize, gentlemen,
but for some reason I was not informed.

284
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,175
In fact, someone set a long lunch for me
with Randolph.

285
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:32,842
Well, it was last minute
and now, unfortunately, drawn to a close.

286
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,675
I have to warn you they won't know
it's over until you drop the big one.

287
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:37,758
Twice.

288
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:39,550
The meeting is not over.

289
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,050
We have yet to present the rules.

290
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,133
So now you're dictating terms.

291
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Mr. Kamura, Mr. Saito, this is Roger Sterling.

292
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,842
And this is their translator, Akira Takahashi.

293
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:03,883
We give each firm $3,000

294
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:07,675
for a competitive presentation.

295
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:11,092
In this packet
are the conditions for the competition.

296
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:14,425
We don't want any conditions.
We want it to be unconditional.

297
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:17,633
Akira, go ahead, tell them what I said.

298
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,675
Roger, stop it. These men are our guests.

299
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:21,800
I know exactly who these men are.

300
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,092
You think you can just come in here
and we'll fawn all over you?

301
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,717
We beat you and we'll beat you again.

302
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,717
And we don't want any of your Jap crap.

303
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,258
So, sayonara.

304
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:42,675
If you could only know my embarrassment.

305
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:48,008
His wife's very sick. He's been drinking a lot.

306
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,050
You have our rules.

307
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,008
We very much look forward
to your presentation.

308
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,925
You don't get to kill this account.

309
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,758
You know how they are. Maybe it'll kill itself.

310
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:16,800
Enough.

311
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:18,217
I'm not even talking about money right now.

312
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,508
I'm talking about the kind of work
you could do for those people.

313
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:22,467
Have you seen that motorcycle?
They love design.

314
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,300
As long as my name's in that lobby,
I get to choose whom I do business with.

315
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:28,883
And I've got a lot better reasons
than you had with Jantzen.

316
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,467
Jantzen was over.

317
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,633
Well, I made a pledge to a lot of men
you'll never meet

318
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,508
not to do business with them.

319
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:36,842
Christ on a cracker, where do you get off?

320
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,342
You know what? You weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.

321
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:40,883
I'm sorry you can't understand.

322
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,508
It's been almost 20 years

323
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:45,508
and whether you like it or not,
the world has moved on.

324
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,008
These are not the same people.

325
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,883
How could that be? I'm the same people!

326
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,467
You don't think I know what you're doing?

327
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,925
You're wrapping yourself in the flag

328
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,883
so you can keep me
from bringing in an account

329
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,008
because you know that every chip I make,
we become less dependent on Lucky Strike

330
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,092
and therefore less dependent on you.

331
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,842
-Why, you little shit!
-Roger!

332
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,675
Get him out of here.

333
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:12,467
The rest of us are trying to build something.

334
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,300
He's right.

335
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,633
You know what to do.

336
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:36,008
Where would you hide a coin?
You'd spend it, wouldn't you?

337
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,217
I do know where it is. I'll tell you.

338
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,842
-Then tell me.
-I'll make a bargain with you.

339
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:45,342
Let these two go. Keep me. I'll tell you.

340
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:50,008
-Promise.
-No.

341
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:52,175
Then no deal.

342
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,842
What if you won't tell me where that coin is?

343
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,342
I refuse to talk in this...

344
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:15,675
What are you doing?

345
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,175
Nothing.

346
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,550
Laura.

347
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,592
Someone else was here...

348
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:21,842
Go upstairs.

349
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,217
Hold Still. I'll get it.

350
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:42,592
What's the problem? Is she sick?
I would've come and gotten her.

351
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,342
No. The slumber party ended early.

352
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,592
I'd like to speak to Betty.

353
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,717
Okay. Honey?

354
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:59,217
Is everything all right?

355
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,217
No, it's not.

356
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:04,633
Could you leave us alone for a moment?

357
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:12,842
I found Sally behaving inappropriately.

358
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:15,717
What'd she do?

359
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,383
She was in our den on the couch
playing with herself.

360
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:23,425
What?

361
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,258
I don't know what goes on here,

362
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:28,175
but that kind of behavior
is not allowed in my house

363
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:30,675
and certainly not
in the presence of my daughter.

364
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:34,675
I am

365
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:42,175
very sorry for this behavior and so is Sally.

366
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:47,508
I would've done the same thing.

367
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,258
Well...

368
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:54,300
I'm sorry about that.

369
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:58,133
I should go.

370
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,425
What is wrong with you?

371
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:15,508
You don't do those things.

372
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:19,425
You don't do them in private
and you especially don't do them in public.

373
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,550
You have nothing to say?

374
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,633
I didn't do anything.

375
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,008
Don't you dare lie to me
or I'll cut your fingers off.

376
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:30,467
Go to bed.
We'll deal with this in the morning.

377
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,133
What happened?

378
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,175
I'm mortified.

379
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:46,050
I'm so embarrassed.

380
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:48,675
What happened?

381
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:51,675
She caught Sally

382
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:56,508
playing with herself.

383
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:06,633
What's wrong with her?
That woman will tell everyone.

384
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:10,842
Why is she doing this?

385
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:15,300
I told you if it got serious,
there is a solution.

386
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:18,592
I don't want to do that, Henry.

387
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:20,758
It's one thing after another.

388
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,675
What's wrong with her?

389
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:26,592
Maybe it's time
we let a professional answer that question.

390
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:27,883
Henry,

391
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,258
I went to a psychiatrist once.

392
00:23:35,008 --> 00:23:36,800
What? why?

393
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,508
Because I was unhappy
and I don't think it helps anything.

394
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:50,258
I hate to think how much worse
it would have been for Eleanor without one.

395
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:54,008
They train them just for kids.
We got ours from the school.

396
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:58,467
I'm saying this not because I'm so sure
there's something wrong with her,

397
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,342
but I think this is very hard on you two.

398
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:06,967
-When did you go?
-Years ago.

399
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:09,508
I was bored.

400
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:13,508
-Can we leave it at that?
-Of course.

401
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:41,008
Miss Blankenship,
any luck on that call to California?

402
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:43,175
I'm sorry. No answer

403
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:46,300
Misters Peters and Pryce to see you.

404
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,592
Send them in.

405
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:52,925
I think we're okay,
but everything they do is inside out.

406
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,508
I got a call this morning
from my contact there, Masao,

407
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:58,675
telling me that the meeting
was a Margaret Dumont-sized disaster,

408
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:00,675
but then... Lane?

409
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:06,092
Then, nearly 20 minutes later, Masao called
me and set a time for our presentation.

410
00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:08,633
Look, there's probably a guy like Roger
at every firm.

411
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,633
They've outgrown it and we haven't.

412
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,925
Roger has something to say.

413
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:18,842
Mn Cooper and Mn Sterling.

414
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:23,717
I realize that I should not, at this point,
limit our potential clients in any way.

415
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:27,592
Next account, no matter what it is,
you'll have my full support.

416
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:28,758
And?

417
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:35,592
Look, I know it's an old one and I
have to let it go just for my health alone,

418
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:38,300
and, well, hell, it's over.

419
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:41,967
Your contrition wouldn't have gotten you
out of this, but you're lucky.

420
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,592
They called us today
and gave us an appointment anyway.

421
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,217
That means nothing.

422
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:49,758
-it's over.
-No, Bert, I said we have a meeting.

423
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:54,425
It's most likely that they are expecting us
to come in and resign.

424
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:57,717
How do you get there from here?

425
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,258
Have we received a gift?

426
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:05,883
-We should have gotten one yesterday.
-I haven't.

427
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:09,592
Miss Blankenship,
have I received any packages today?

428
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:10,717
Yes.

429
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:13,508
Could you bring it in, please?

430
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,175
It says "Don" on it.

431
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:24,008
Give it to him.

432
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:34,342
"Help me, Honda. Help. Help me, Honda.
Love, Teddy Chaough."

433
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,883
-So, there is no gift.
-That's how they work.

434
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:43,717
They want us to go in there, bow down
and beg them to chop our heads off

435
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,092
because we disgraced ourselves.
How could you admire these animals?

436
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:49,550
Would you shut up? They're businessmen
and you insulted them to their face.

437
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,217
I'm expecting a child.

438
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:55,592
Jai Alai, Clearasil, now Honda.

439
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:57,925
Chaough wins another one by default.

440
00:26:58,008 --> 00:26:59,217
He's not going to win.

441
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:01,175
I'm not wasting that appointment.

442
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,675
We need to do something
that will make them notice us. Fireworks.

443
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:07,175
-Do you have a campaign?
-No.

444
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,383
But I will and we're gonna
shoot a whole commercial for it.

445
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:11,092
Something outrageous, something graphic.

446
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,842
The rules limit us to boards and copy.

447
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,300
It specifically says, "No finished work."

448
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:18,550
Because no one's ever won an account
by breaking the rules?

449
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:20,883
Not with the Japanese.

450
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,092
You're trying to tell me if we put our backs
into this thing,

451
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,217
we couldn't turn their heads?

452
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,633
Three thousand dollars is all we have.

453
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,717
That should buy
about four seconds of your commercial.

454
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:31,883
You don't think it's worth
going out of pocket?

455
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:33,008
What pocket?

456
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:37,758
A spec commercial will eat up our ability
to pitch any more new business this year.

457
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:39,258
And it's only March.

458
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:41,383
I would be willing to risk
bankrupting this place

459
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,842
if I didn't think
we were already dead in the water.

460
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:46,383
But we are.

461
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:52,008
Come on, Bert.

462
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:09,258
Hello?

463
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,133
Am I catching you alone?

464
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,175
What do you want?

465
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:16,258
I prefer not to talk about this on the phone,

466
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,133
but it's our feeling
that Sally needs to see a psychiatrist.

467
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:21,050
"Our feeling."

468
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:23,633
Why, because she cut her hair?

469
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:25,425
No, it's more serious this time,

470
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:28,550
and I'm telling you because I found
someone through the school.

471
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,050
A children specialist.

472
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,175
What exactly did she do?
She set the house on fire?

473
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,300
She was masturbating, Don,
in front of a friend.

474
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,925
Does that seem normal to you?

475
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,675
Really?

476
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:42,717
Boy or girl?

477
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:45,050
Jesus. What's the difference?

478
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:49,258
The doctor needs to speak with us,
individually of course.

479
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,092
So you've made up your mind.
Why are you even calling me?

480
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,675
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

481
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:57,175
I am.
I just don't know that she needs a doctor.

482
00:28:57,258 --> 00:28:58,342
Can't you talk to her?

483
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:01,050
You think I want this?
I don't know what else to do.

484
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,217
You know what kind of little girls do that?

485
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,258
Fast ones.

486
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,467
She's 10 years old.

487
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,925
Well, don't think she doesn't understand.

488
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:08,800
She understands a lot of things,
thanks to you.

489
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:10,508
What?

490
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:13,008
I don't care what you do,
but just don't do it with her there.

491
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:15,883
You brought another man
into your bed, into her house.

492
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,300
You don't think she noticed that?

493
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:20,967
One man, Don. How many have you had
in your bachelor pad?

494
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,508
That girl you had watching her? Who's she?
I'm married.

495
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,300
Jesus. You ever hear yourself?

496
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,967
I'll give the information to your secretary.

497
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,842
-Perfect.
-Good night.

498
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:49,467
Yes!

499
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:55,675
Have you seen these?
I'm trying to figure out what makes it work.

500
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:57,675
I'm still wondering what makes you work.

501
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:00,050
Joan, Pete, Peggy.

502
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:06,675
Don't touch it.
I want to see how long it goes.

503
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,383
What's wrong?

504
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:23,133
"A man is shamed
by being openly ridiculed and rejected.

505
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:24,842
"It requires an audience."

506
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,008
What is that? Fortune cookie?

507
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:29,092
It's from that book
you were all supposed to read.

508
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:33,175
Apparently making a commercial
for the Honda pitch would bankrupt us.

509
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:34,425
And it's against the rules.

510
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,008
Forget the rules for a second.

511
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:37,842
CGC is the same size as us.

512
00:30:38,092 --> 00:30:40,967
So, if we can't afford to do anything,
they can't afford to.

513
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,383
So everybody's bankrupt.

514
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,925
Chaough said he's in my rearview mirror.

515
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:46,217
Well, guess what?

516
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,633
I'm gonna make a left turn right off a cliff.

517
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,883
All I have to do is let Chaough think
I'm making a commercial and he'll make one.

518
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:56,758
So what's our campaign?

519
00:30:56,842 --> 00:30:59,300
We don't have a campaign.
We're not doing anything.

520
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,258
He just needs to think we are.

521
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,508
So what? He's going to make a commercial.

522
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,967
What if it's fantastic? He'll win the account.

523
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,758
You let me worry about that.

524
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:13,592
I know she's the best rep there is,
but she told me you were unavailable.

525
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:18,550
I am. Clearasil doesn't wrap until
Friday night, but maybe you could push it.

526
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:20,675
It sounds interesting.

527
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,883
Well, Howard, I'm going to insist
on your discretion at this point.

528
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,425
Of course.

529
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:28,800
It's going to be four to five days.

530
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:31,967
-Just a minute.
-Could you get the door?

531
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,967
I'm sorry. I thought I'd put this in here.

532
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,217
Later.

533
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:44,925
-Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

534
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:49,133
-You didn't see that.
-No, of course not.

535
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,300
That's Draper, isn't it?

536
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:52,383
Yes.

537
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:57,300
Anyway, it's 12 scenes.
One of them obviously has a crowd.

538
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,758
You'll need to figure out
how to shoot on the Staten Island ferry,

539
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:03,133
to it and from it,
and how you're going to close Fifth Avenue.

540
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:08,550
I'll be honest. I'd give anything to do this,
but right now I'm too busy.

541
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,967
Anyway, you know I'd much rather
shoot your Honda commercial.

542
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:14,592
I don't have one.

543
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:18,092
Why the hell did they call you in?
They know I've got you booked.

544
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:19,633
How can they afford that?

545
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:23,508
Get that kid in here who worked for Draper.

546
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,592
Anticipation.

547
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:28,800
Suspense.

548
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:37,842
A Honda tears through a subway tunnel,
the train nipping at its tire.

549
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:41,508
He keeps looking back,
the train roaring at him.

550
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:46,508
He's wearing a racing helmet.
And then you see him head up the steps.

551
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,842
-Can they do that?
-Howard'll make them do that.

552
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,550
And then he gets out on the sidewalk, stops,

553
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:55,842
kicks down the kickstand,
takes off the helmet,

554
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:58,592
and he is a she, California blonde.

555
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,592
Hands down, that's your best idea.

556
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:03,092
We'll bring a guy to the pitch
in a racing helmet,

557
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:05,508
have him take it off, it's a sexy girl.

558
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:06,633
What?

559
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,675
We only have $3,000,
we're not shooting shit.

560
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:15,092
How long did you work for Draper?

561
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:16,758
A little over two years.

562
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:19,133
When you were in a bake-off,
he ever break the rules?

563
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,633
I don't know.
He wouldn't have shared it with me,

564
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:24,133
but he definitely doesn't think
the rules apply to him.

565
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,883
He once disappeared for a month.

566
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:27,550
Does he like to play games?

567
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,383
He's always thinking
on the edges of where you are.

568
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,008
I don't know. He's a genius.

569
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,967
You ever talk that way about me?

570
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:40,300
You know what? Why don't you go
work for your boyfriend? Get out.

571
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:43,758
And give me 20 different words
for "pimples." Out!

572
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,925
Call Barbara about Howard here
and contact the city of New York.

573
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:51,342
We need a subway.

574
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:16,925
How are you doing?

575
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:20,008
Excuse me. Can I help you?

576
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:23,008
-We're late.
-No, you're not.

577
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:25,342
Closed set. Sorry.

578
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,258
You scared me.

579
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:58,842
Who are you feeding today?

580
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,550
World travelers, Samsonite.

581
00:35:06,508 --> 00:35:07,675
This is like a coconut.

582
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:09,842
Be careful.

583
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:14,217
There was a trapeze artist.

584
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,300
He made more in an hour here
than he makes in a week at the circus.

585
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:23,842
-Have you ever had this? Sake?
-No.

586
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:30,217
I don't know how people drink
the way you do around here.

587
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,883
I'd fall asleep.

588
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,633
So what's it like being a trapeze artist?

589
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:42,383
Or did you just ask him about his luggage?

590
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,800
It's good.

591
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:48,383
He was surprisingly modest.

592
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:51,133
His father does it better than him.

593
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,842
He actually said that?

594
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:54,675
Best part of my job.

595
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:59,092
You'd be surprised what people
will say to an interested stranger.

596
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,508
Why does everybody need
to talk about everything?

597
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:03,383
I don't know but they do.

598
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:07,842
And no matter what happens while they're
talking, when they're done they feel better.

599
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,550
You have kids?

600
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,467
No.

601
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,842
What does your husband do?

602
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:22,842
I'm not married.

603
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:26,008
But you're wearing a... Are you divorced?

604
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,092
No.

605
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:32,258
This is just a stop sign.

606
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:38,092
I walk into a lot of offices and it's helped me
avoid a lot of distracting conversations.

607
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:40,008
But you told me.

608
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,592
Do you have children?

609
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:46,508
I do.

610
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:50,092
Two boys and a girl,
one-and-a-half, seven and 10.

611
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,508
I'm sure it must be hard to be apart.

612
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,758
I don't see them enough.

613
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,175
And when I do, I don't know what to do.

614
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,342
And when I drop them off I feel relieved.

615
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,050
And then I miss them.

616
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:11,592
I'm sorry.

617
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,425
It is not going well.

618
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,342
My ex-wife thinks
my daughter needs a psychiatrist.

619
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,467
And I assume you're against that.

620
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:32,217
I don't know.

621
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:36,383
Well, I can't say there's
any evidence to support this,

622
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:40,675
but I'm pretty sure that if you love her
and she knows it, she'll be fine.

623
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,508
Well, thank you for the drink.

624
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:54,425
I should be going.

625
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:57,342
Fake dinner plans with your fake husband?

626
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,175
Good night.

627
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:09,758
Now from what you told me on the phone

628
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:12,425
this year has been quite eventful
for your family.

629
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:18,217
I know it seems fast,
but I felt children had no concept of time

630
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,967
and Henry's really taken to them.

631
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:23,758
He has a daughter and she's such
an exceptional young woman.

632
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:29,050
If you choose to have Sally work with me,
I'd like to meet her,

633
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,467
and then interview
you and your ex-husband.

634
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,467
I doubt you'll ever meet him.
That's his level of interest.

635
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:42,050
Is this most recent incident
of the most concern for you?

636
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:44,800
Well, I know the divorce is mostly to blame,

637
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:49,008
but she's been different
ever since my father died.

638
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:52,175
He lived with us briefly.

639
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,258
They were very close.

640
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:05,925
I wish he had met Henry.
That's my husband.

641
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,550
They would've gotten along.

642
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:12,967
My mother... I don't know.

643
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:17,342
My goodness, if I had done what Sally did,
my mother was very strict about it.

644
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:24,717
My brother, he saved his money and bought
a nudist magazine and showed it to me.

645
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:29,842
And then, my mother found it
and she nailed it to his bedroom door.

646
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,092
What about you?

647
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,050
I was private and mostly outgrew it.

648
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:42,092
I see.

649
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:47,508
-Dr. Keener...
-Call me Dr. Edna. That's what the kids do.

650
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:54,383
Of course I know children do this.
But not in public.

651
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:02,842
I feel like Sally did this to punish me
somehow, for everything.

652
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:06,925
That must be a terrible feeling.

653
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:09,175
It is.

654
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:14,133
You have to believe me.
I had to get divorced.

655
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,717
I felt it best for them
to have some stability in their life

656
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,508
and in the end,
she doesn't understand that it'll be better.

657
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:27,425
Sounds to me like it wouldn't be bad
for you to talk to someone.

658
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:30,633
No. No, I'm okay.

659
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:37,092
Well, I think it'd be helpful if you and I
were to meet once a month

660
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:39,800
just to keep up with Sally's progress.

661
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:43,550
Will you tell me
what she talks about in here?

662
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:44,800
No.

663
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:46,842
And the other way around as well.

664
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:48,925
That's better.

665
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,342
So I think we should start
at four days a week.

666
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:55,508
Let me go get my date book.

667
00:41:25,342 --> 00:41:27,383
-Where's your film?
-What film?

668
00:41:27,842 --> 00:41:29,883
That's how you're shaking it?
I heard it stunk.

669
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,092
We didn't make one. it's too expensive.

670
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,342
Well, then you're out of luck, Donny.

671
00:41:34,508 --> 00:41:36,092
'Cause I sure wouldn't
want to follow what I showed them

672
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:38,800
with a speech and a couple of posters.

673
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:56,383
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

674
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:58,008
Donald Draper.

675
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:02,675
Where is Mr. Cooper and Mr. Campbell?

676
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,258
And Sterling?

677
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:06,342
They couldn't make it.

678
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:12,008
You created this set of rules
to even the playing field.

679
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:16,008
It says specifically, "No finished work."

680
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:20,592
I understand not everybody
has observed this.

681
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:24,592
I don't really want to be a part
of a competition like that

682
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,967
so I'm withdrawing us.

683
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:45,967
Thank you for thinking of us.

684
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:48,050
Good afternoon.

685
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,550
The voiceover announcer for Lucky
has a severe case of chest congestion.

686
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:04,383
Get the boy wonder on it.

687
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:05,675
Greg, accounts?

688
00:43:05,758 --> 00:43:06,758
No, Pete.

689
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:10,133
Have a drink. it'll make me look younger.

690
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,967
I'm not gonna watch you
feel sorry for yourself.

691
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,592
I feel sorry for all of us.

692
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,008
Don's over there surrendering right now.

693
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,842
Would you stop?

694
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:26,342
There was a kid on the destroyer,
PFC Brycen,

695
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:29,425
and he was an honest-to-goodness poet.

696
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:32,592
-And then during...
-Roger, I don't want to hear it.

697
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,008
My husband's gonna be in uniform
any day now.

698
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:38,008
But how do you think he's gonna feel

699
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:42,092
when one day some Pete Campbell
goes to some Vietnamese doctor?

700
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:47,258
Since when is forgiveness
a better quality than loyalty?

701
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:50,967
Roger, I know it was awful,

702
00:43:51,217 --> 00:43:54,633
and I know it'll never seem
like it was that long ago,

703
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:59,550
but you fought to make the world
a safer place and you won and now it is.

704
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,633
You think so?

705
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:03,925
Really?

706
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,883
I have to.

707
00:44:07,175 --> 00:44:09,217
-Anything else?
-No.

708
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:21,342
Good afternoon.
Your daughter's psychiatrist called.

709
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:24,508
Lower your voice, please.

710
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:39,758
Congratulations.

711
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:41,800
I just spoke with Mr. Saito.

712
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:44,883
It seems Honda was never
going to leave Grey,

713
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:48,342
but of the three princes
invited to meet the princess,

714
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:50,508
you were the most charming.

715
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:52,550
We're first in the door on their little car.

716
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:53,758
And CGC?

717
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:55,717
Out of the running.

718
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,300
We killed him.

719
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,258
That stunt you pulled was unseemly.

720
00:45:03,592 --> 00:45:05,133
The only reason I let you continue was...

721
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:06,217
Let me?

722
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:10,675
Do you think Joan can rent stage space
without talking to me?

723
00:45:12,592 --> 00:45:16,342
I let you because I realized
that our financial future

724
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,800
was related to Mr. Chaough's demise.

725
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,425
So what is it?

726
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:23,258
Are you thanking me or reprimanding me?

727
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:27,508
-Let's not pretend like this wasn't a big risk.
-We're thanking you.

728
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:31,592
Send over what you have on the car.

729
00:45:32,175 --> 00:45:37,342
It redlines at 9,500 RPM,
but it only has 57 horsepower.

730
00:45:37,592 --> 00:45:38,592
What?

731
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,758
It's a motorcycle with doors.

732
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:45,050
The nice thing is it has windows,

733
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:48,092
so you can see your brains spatter against it
when it crashes.

734
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:50,508
They're working on it.

735
00:45:50,592 --> 00:45:51,800
Cheers.

736
00:46:04,842 --> 00:46:05,883
Hello, Sally.

737
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,592
I'm Dr. Edna.

738
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:11,550
Why don't you come inside?
