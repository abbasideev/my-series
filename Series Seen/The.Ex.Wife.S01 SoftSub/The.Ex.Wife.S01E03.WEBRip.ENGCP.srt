1
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:09,234
Look, it's daddy's ex-wife,

2
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:13,274
agh! What the hell!

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,792
Jen, I need you to go.

4
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:16,552
Ooh, it's a ducky.

5
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:19,952
She had pouches

6
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,632
You thought you saw Jen.

7
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:25,911
Jen! What the hell do you think
you're doing with my child?

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,951
It's not yours, Sam.

9
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:30,511
I saw Sam your Sam outside the
house

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,791
you followed Jack?

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,709
If he didn't think something
was going on between us before,

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,950
- I'd say he might now.
- I'll let you get back to Sam.

13
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:38,989
I'm gonna be gone for three
nights.

14
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:42,349
Emily's already

15
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:44,747
what did she look like?
The woman who took my child!?

16
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,627
Here.

17
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,706
Right. Here.

18
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:58,626
Jen! Who verified her?

19
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,745
Who verified her
as a carer for my child?

20
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:03,825
Let's have a look.

21
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:08,784
Jack did.

22
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:11,463
Okay. Okay...

23
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:12,823
Wait.

24
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:14,144
Mrs warrington, wait.

25
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,462
Last week?!

26
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:19,822
Last week, and you didn't think
to

27
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:21,901
That's not nursery

28
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,218
Jen! Jen, are you in there,
please?

29
00:01:58,296 --> 00:01:59,816
I need to get hold of
Jack warrington.

30
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:03,095
No, no, no.
Someone has taken our child.

31
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,175
Tasha!

32
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,374
Lola!

33
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,893
Lola, I need to know
where Jack is.

34
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:13,173
A number for him in New York.

35
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:15,053
Where he is?
Oh, is everything all right?

36
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,134
No, it's Emily.

37
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:20,332
Something's... I just need to
get a hold of him.

38
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:21,773
His mobile isn't working and
I...

39
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,068
Sorry I don't have time
for this.

40
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:25,572
I understand, I just need to
tell you

41
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,668
it seems you aren't aware...

42
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:27,771
The situation?

43
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,531
Please sit down, Tasha,
seriously.

44
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,889
Jack isn't here.

45
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:40,969
I know he's not here.
He's in New York.

46
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:43,168
No, Jack isn't here anymore.

47
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:45,728
He isn't with the company.
He doesn't work here.

48
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:47,207
What?!

49
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:50,607
What are you talking about?
Of course he works here.

50
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:52,926
No, he quit two weeks ago.

51
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,646
It was a bit of a thing.

52
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:58,646
And he took quite a few clients

53
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:03,806
Okay.

54
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,004
Okay.

55
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:14,163
He just quit?

56
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:17,042
- Left, yeah, resigned.
- Why?

57
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:26,161
And you don't know a phone in
New York, or a hotel anything?

58
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,480
No disrespect Tasha but...

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,880
Are you sure he's even in new
York?

60
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,671
Jen warrington.

61
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:50,828
- Through there.
- Thank you.

62
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:55,148
Where's Emily?

63
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:57,707
You can't just barge in here.

64
00:04:57,787 --> 00:04:59,626
Where the fuck is she, you mad
bitch?

65
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,586
Is that him?

66
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:07,025
It's on mute

67
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,785
if you could stop
shouting in my face.

68
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,600
- This is my place of work.
- I really don't give a shit.

69
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:13,784
Where's my daughter?

70
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:16,904
Emily.

71
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:18,743
Emily?

72
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:27,542
Tasha, please stop! Okay!

73
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,222
Look, I know you're upset

74
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,221
and clearly this is very
difficult

75
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
okay?

76
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,180
Jack asked me to collect her
for him.

77
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
Oh, he has her?

78
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,580
Where is he?

79
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,938
He's quit his job, did you know
that?

80
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,219
I think he's in some kind of
trouble.

81
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,778
No, he's not in any kind of
trouble.

82
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:52,417
Actually, I think he meant to
leave

83
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:54,898
oh, he told you that, did he?

84
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,176
He was planning on leaving?

85
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,136
What is going on? Where is he?

86
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,791
Jack collected Emily
about half an hour ago.

87
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,335
Okay, so he's not in New York?

88
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,095
Okay. It seems I am caught in
the middle of something here.

89
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:17,334
Jack told me that he discussed
the

90
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,413
and you agreed to...

91
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:26,092
Okay. That doesn't appear
to be the case.

92
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,092
I'm really sorry, I can't do
this.

93
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,651
Jen, you need to tell me
what the hell's going on here!

94
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,331
I'm going home
and you should too.

95
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,570
This is not at all appropriate,
okay?

96
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:39,890
I can't.

97
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,488
- He's changed his number.
- No he hasn't.

98
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,009
Yes, he has.

99
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:48,769
Why is he doing this?

100
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:51,568
I don't understand.

101
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,487
I'm sorry, Tasha, but I really
don't

102
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:00,046
oh my god!

103
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,246
This is because of whatever you
think you heard

104
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,045
between me and Sam
the other day.

105
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:06,365
This is exactly

106
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:07,725
you did this to get him back.

107
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:09,005
Oh my god.

108
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:10,885
Of course I ha...

109
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,965
You know, if Jack found out
something was going on

110
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,899
between you and Sam,
that's between the two of you.

111
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,043
Excuse me.

112
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,958
Come on, Jack! Let me in!

113
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:29,351
Jack?!

114
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,470
Jack?!

115
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,270
Emily?!

116
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:06,465
Hello?

117
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,744
Fuck!!

118
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:35,340
Hello, ma'am.
Is

119
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:37,421
can I ask if you're the house
owner?

120
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,620
Yes. Yes, this is my house.

121
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,781
Okay. We've been alerted
to a possible break in

122
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,300
via your home security company.

123
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,499
Is there a problem?

124
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,020
There's no problem, my husband
changed the code

125
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,659
and I'm just about to reset it,
but thank you.

126
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:51,659
Ma'am, would it be alright if
we took

127
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:52,939
yeah, sure.

128
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,737
Wait - is that normal?

129
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,497
All part of the service.

130
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:57,817
I smashed the door.

131
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,498
It's a long story
but my husband and I...

132
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,033
We're having problems and...

133
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:04,777
God this is really embarrassing
but...

134
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,735
He changed the locks and the
alarm.

135
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:10,815
Right. Have you got any ID
ma'am?

136
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:12,135
Driver's licence?

137
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,614
I don't have a driver's licence
but

138
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:21,733
can I?

139
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:31,132
My husband covers the bills.

140
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:34,132
I had a baby last year,
I haven't gone back to work.

141
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,651
If you've got a mortgage
statement,

142
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,090
yes. Yes, yes, I have that.

143
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,608
Is there a problem?

144
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,769
No. Um, I don't know.

145
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,728
I... I'm not on the mortgage
statement.

146
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:54,888
My name's not on it.

147
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:56,528
What does that mean?

148
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,367
I know that he put me on it last

149
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:05,326
I've just spoken to your
husband.

150
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:08,022
Yes, the security company
connected me to mr warrington.

151
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:11,445
The good news is he's not going
to be

152
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:12,780
for the criminal damage to the
door.

153
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:17,245
However, you are going to have
to

154
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:21,683
I'm sorry, what?

155
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,284
You can't stay here.

156
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:26,163
But I live here.

157
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:27,802
No, sorry. I live here.

158
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:32,122
I'm his wife. I know I'm not on
the

159
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:34,522
I have rights, don't I?

160
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,440
Seems he applied for
an occupation order yesterday.

161
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,761
Legally you can't be here.

162
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,759
No, no, no. No, sorry...

163
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,477
He's got my child.

164
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:57,957
He's got my daughter.

165
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,957
I... I don't know where they
are.

166
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:02,316
Is he the child's legal father?

167
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,037
He has parental responsibility
as much as you.

168
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,516
Do you have any concerns
over the baby's safety?

169
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,092
Could she be at risk from your
husband?

170
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:11,116
No, no, nothing like that. I
just...

171
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,031
Tah-dah. The spare room.

172
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,830
Thank you so much for this, Sam.

173
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:43,709
I appreciate it.

174
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:46,390
Honestly... it's the least I
can do.

175
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,788
I can't believe he's doing this.

176
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,708
Yeah.

177
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:54,629
What did they tell you?

178
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,908
- The police?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,467
That I'm screwed.

180
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:04,227
And what did they tell you to
do?

181
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:07,426
Go see his family tomorrow...

182
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:11,226
Okay. Are you gonna call first?

183
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:14,505
No. I'm not giving anyone else
the chance to hangup on me.

184
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,664
If I'm right in front of them,
they can't ignore me.

185
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:18,385
Right.

186
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,423
I can't let this go down
the legal route.

187
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:21,720
I don't have any savings or
money

188
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:23,943
what are you talking about?

189
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:26,224
- Jack's loaded.
- Yeah, he is.

190
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,302
And what, you don't have
a joint account?

191
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:31,182
No. I didn't want anyone to
think

192
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,022
you...

193
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,142
Okay.

194
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,301
Okay. No, okay.

195
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,501
How're you getting there?

196
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,740
Do you need me to drive you?

197
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,939
He thinks we're having an
affair,

198
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,579
because of the stalking thing...

199
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:53,619
Oh.

200
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:57,858
Okay.

201
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,177
Okay, okay.

202
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,497
Yes.

203
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:13,976
Um, did you mention anything to
him

204
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:18,215
us in the past?

205
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,654
No. Did you?

206
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,614
No.

207
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:27,853
Okay, good...
Because there was no us, Sam.

208
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:31,452
It was one time, when we were
drunk.

209
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,451
Yeah.

210
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,811
So, I didn't mention it.

211
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:43,050
The point is I can't show up
with you

212
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,730
oh god, I know, I'm sorry.

213
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:48,169
This is a lot to deal with.

214
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,330
No, it's fine.

215
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,489
Listen, I know this... is
really bad,

216
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,647
and I fucking hate that I have
to do

217
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:00,767
yes.

218
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,128
Yeah.

219
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:08,127
And I'll get one of the guys
from

220
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,285
thank you.

221
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:14,726
- I won't forget this.
- It's okay.

222
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:16,164
And I'll pay you back. Okay?

223
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:18,085
Sure.

224
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:22,204
Don't worry.

225
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,522
- Just here is fine.
- Okay.

226
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:34,281
Thank you.

227
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,641
- I'll be 30 minutes Max.
- No problem.

228
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:05,276
Ah. Okay.

229
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:08,877
Best get the boss.

230
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:11,035
Hayles! Incoming!

231
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,794
Right, I think you should leave,

232
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,955
he's not here and we'd said
we'd stay out of it so...

233
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:27,314
I just need to speak to him.

234
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:29,272
I'm sure he'll call when he's
ready.

235
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:31,713
As far as I can tell,
he's well within his rights...

236
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,792
You've made your bed.

237
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,671
- Sorry, my bed?
- Yeah.

238
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,631
He told us... about your
boyfriend.

239
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,390
Sam isn't my boyfriend.

240
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:48,629
Okay, not sure it's any of
my business, but sure.

241
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,830
Hayley, I need to see my
daughter.

242
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:55,829
You know how good Jack is with
her,

243
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,508
what will?

244
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,588
The divorce - mediation,
whatever.

245
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:04,868
The divorce?

246
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:07,626
Yeah.

247
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:09,547
Hayley, this is ridiculous.

248
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:13,266
I'm sorry but...

249
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:15,786
How can he? We haven't even...

250
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:19,345
I think we all know you've had
problems for a while now.

251
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:22,384
Jack said as much the other week

252
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:26,183
I'm sure someone will call
in the next few days.

253
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:27,983
In the meantime,

254
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:31,863
oh god, the water works...

255
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,462
Tasha, you'll forgive me
if I don't buy it.

256
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:37,661
You are a fucking bitch Hayley.

257
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:43,140
You think it's endearing but
it's

258
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,021
I hope something like this
happens

259
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,100
and when it does, I hope that
you

260
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,899
and when you do,
I hope they fucking ruin you!

261
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,698
Well...

262
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:03,098
That's some real mother of the
year

263
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,098
get off my property,
before I call the police.

264
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,212
How about that one?

265
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,773
Hard no.

266
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:35,853
That's a certified ten, mate.

267
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:38,532
Nah.
She's got the crazy eyes.

268
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:50,209
Fuck off.

269
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,730
Oh, feisty.

270
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,928
I'm serious lads, I am not in
the fucking mood, so fuck off.

271
00:18:58,489 --> 00:18:58,928
Can I buy you a drink?

272
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:02,288
What? Fucking what?

273
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,447
You wanna fuck me,
show me the world,

274
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:06,927
whack me in a huge fucking
house,

275
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:09,567
and then break my legs
like fucking 'misery'.

276
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:12,287
No.

277
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:20,165
Yeah, didn't fucking think so.

278
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:25,164
Fuck off, you shit bag.

279
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:50,041
Hello?

280
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,639
Who is this?

281
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,560
It's me. I just need to talk to
you,

282
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,839
just five minutes of your life,

283
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,695
then you never have to see me
ever again. I promise.

284
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,637
Fucksake, Tasha.
Go home to your family.

285
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,158
I can't, I don't know where
they are.

286
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,157
You're all I've got right now.

287
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:22,874
Let me in, let me in, let me
in...

288
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:24,194
Jesus Christ.

289
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:27,353
Let me in, let me in, let me
in...

290
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,714
You can come up if you shut up.

291
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,153
How much have you had to drink?

292
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,631
I'll make coffee.

293
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,388
I'm sorry Jen, I am -
about everything.

294
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:01,908
About what I did to you.

295
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:07,828
Your husband. Your house. Your
life.

296
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,626
I just didn't think.

297
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,506
No, sorry, you're right.

298
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,146
That was a lie; I did think.

299
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,505
I knew exactly what I was doing,

300
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:30,903
I was okay with hurting you
because

301
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:36,622
you weren't a person with
feelings

302
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:40,661
and that's unforgivable.

303
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:42,102
But I came here to tell you that

304
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:46,940
but I came here to tell you that

305
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:50,261
if that's what this is,
then I want you to know,

306
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,899
that I will go so easily...

307
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,020
Really, I will.
I'll... leave you guys to it.

308
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,178
I just...

309
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:02,858
I need you to tell me
where he has her.

310
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:06,897
Please.

311
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:08,778
I need to see Emily.

312
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:12,096
You're drunk, Tasha, and I
don't want

313
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,376
I don't owe you anything.

314
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:30,694
I didn't even want Emily,

315
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:32,893
I didn't want a kid.
I'd booked an abortion.

316
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:34,573
I didn't plan for any of this.

317
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:39,412
I was so young,

318
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:42,091
no means to look after her,
but the point is I did

319
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:45,411
and she is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

320
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,010
You have everything I ever
wanted.

321
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:00,928
We wanted.

322
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,087
Three miscarriages.

323
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:10,288
The first was the worst.

324
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:12,807
She even had a name.

325
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,446
We had our whole lives mapped
out.

326
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,125
And then I kept losing them.

327
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,644
A dull ache,

328
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:26,884
blood, weeks and weeks of
waiting.

329
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:33,643
Hope and then trying not to hope

330
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:36,922
until honestly, you're not sure

331
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,121
I should hate you.

332
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:48,761
But, you want to know the truth?

333
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm tired.

334
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,079
I'm just so fucking tired
of trying to make life happen.

335
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:04,638
I could fill an arena, Tasha,

336
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:09,478
I'm old enough and weathered
enough

337
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:13,277
you can't change the way things
are

338
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,237
I'm not a bad person.

339
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,315
But I'm not your friend either.

340
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:36,552
Look, I don't know
where they are Tasha...

341
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:38,993
But I will try to find out.

342
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:45,831
Okay.

343
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:49,390
Right now, I want you out of my
house. Okay?

344
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:54,990
Of course.

345
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,069
Thank you.

346
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:11,547
- Thank you.
- For what?

347
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:15,467
Changing my life, kiddo.

348
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:31,863
For fucksake.

349
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:37,383
Sam.

350
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:11,018
Hey.

351
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:27,134
Look, I've done some digging.

352
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,015
The thing is she thinks he's
at whitsford

353
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,094
which I know that can't be true

354
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,974
because that would've been

355
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,053
what? What's whitsford?

356
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,373
You don't know what whitsford
is?

357
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,532
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

358
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:45,212
He never told you about
the second home?

359
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,091
The holiday house...
The whole time you...

360
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:53,850
I suppose things did move
rather quickly, didn't they?

361
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:57,770
Well, whitsford is in surrey.

362
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,089
It's bigger than the London
place,

363
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,450
it's actually very beautiful.

364
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:04,368
- Sounds nice.
- It was.

365
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,969
It was going to be our forever
home.

366
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:09,688
Okay, so he's there, is he?

367
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,167
It would certainly seem so.

368
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:16,846
Excuse me, can I borrow your
pen?

369
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:20,207
Thank you.

370
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,003
Here's the address.

371
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:43,483
Do you have any way of getting
there?

372
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:45,762
I will figure it out.

373
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:46,841
Thank you Jen, so much.

374
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,681
Tasha, wait.

375
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:53,761
When you get there,
what are you going to do?

376
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Do?

377
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,879
I mean are you going to see her
or take her?

378
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,038
If I see her,
she's coming home with me.

379
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:06,518
I'm sorry, that's the honest
truth.

380
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,719
I understand.

381
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,478
But then you'll leave the
marriage?

382
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:12,877
Yes.

383
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:19,516
Do you have a way of getting
there?

384
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:43,072
Thank you for doing this.

385
00:28:45,913 --> 00:28:47,351
I really appreciate it.

386
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:49,191
You don't need to thank me.

387
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,951
There's not much point me
giving you

388
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:58,070
you didn't tell anyone
I was driving you, did you?

389
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,589
Oh no, of course not.

390
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,629
Good.

391
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:14,867
When we get there, I think we
should

392
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:18,947
what do you mean wait?

393
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,826
Until it's dark, until he's
asleep.

394
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:27,545
Tasha, I thought you wanted me
to talk to him.

395
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,425
I told you I'd help bring him
round,

396
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:31,544
I didn't say I'd help
break into his house.

397
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,504
He's not gonna just hand her
over.

398
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:35,503
You said yourself,
he's terrified of losing her.

399
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:39,904
I think we go in there, get her
and

400
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:45,782
reassure him that...
I'm on the level with this.

401
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:47,462
I'm not going to disappear.

402
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:51,021
And you are on the level with
this?

403
00:29:52,662 --> 00:29:54,141
He'll still be able to see her?

404
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:24,335
Shit.

405
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:29,975
Hey, this is Tash.

406
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:44,933
Uh...

407
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:15,567
This is it.

408
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:19,286
We should probably leave the
car,

409
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:23,127
I've been thinking...

410
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,686
Maybe I should go in alone.

411
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:28,606
I mean, I'm the one who knows
where

412
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,324
I know the lay out of the house,

413
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,324
there's a nursery on the first
floor.

414
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:37,684
You can wait here.
I'll bring her to you.

415
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:48,522
I'm just not sure
how he's going to react

416
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:52,481
if he finds you

417
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:54,882
if it's me, it's different.

418
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,880
I swear to god if this is a
trick...

419
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,960
If you warn him...

420
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:10,998
I'll fucking fight this
to the bitter end.

421
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,638
I just don't want a situation,
Tasha.

422
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:18,757
Not if we can avoid one.

423
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,796
Okay. I'll wait outside.

424
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:24,157
I won't come in.

425
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,512
What if he's not here.

426
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:46,552
He's here.

427
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,508
Creature of habit.

428
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:26,627
Stay put.

429
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:30,505
I'll go in and find her, bring
her

430
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:32,505
don't go too far.

431
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:39,495
Oh, shit.

432
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:30,205
Emily! Emily!!

433
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:33,765
Fuck! Jack, open the fucking
door!

434
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:35,245
Fuck.

435
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:38,685
Jack, if you don't open the
door,

436
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,045
Emily!

437
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:42,283
She's gone.

438
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:44,883
Alright, she's gone.

439
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:55,122
Look, I never wanted to hurt
you,

440
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:07,520
She's magical, you know...
Emily

441
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:14,519
you've made a beautiful little
girl.

442
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,038
Perfect.

443
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:25,477
So, you see I can't let you
take her from me.

444
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:31,715
And honestly, Natasha...

445
00:36:33,436 --> 00:36:35,436
All of this was for her.

446
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:38,595
Our marriage.

447
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:41,793
All of it was to ensure
that legally I'd be her father.

448
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,752
Jen and I should be together.

449
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:53,993
You're a wonderful young woman,
Natasha

450
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,471
but what I felt for you
was never love.

451
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:13,868
This wasn't the ending I'd
planned,

452
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:17,109
I'd hoped for a smoother
transition

453
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:19,668
you forced me...

454
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:23,108
When you said that you'd take
Emily.

455
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:27,826
There's a line, all right, I'm
not

456
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:35,345
and also, you've had been
lying to me

457
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:37,265
spying on me,

458
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:39,665
bringing another man into my
house.

459
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,544
Yeah.

460
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:46,024
Don't think I don't know history

461
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:47,823
I know you were together.

462
00:37:48,943 --> 00:37:50,318
Right, so here is
what's going to happen.

463
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:53,702
You are going to walk away
from this marriage.

464
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:56,102
You're not gonna try and fight
it

465
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:58,701
my resources far outweigh yours

466
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,581
Besides, you're young.

467
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,420
You can walk away and start
again.

468
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:16,059
Here's what you will get in
exchange:

469
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,858
Nothing outrageous
but it'll be fair.

470
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:22,777
You will get to see Emily on
birthdays and special occasions

471
00:38:22,857 --> 00:38:24,257
and holidays,

472
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,216
until she is old enough
to make her own choices.

473
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:29,776
And in return for this access,

474
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:35,096
you will have to give up any bid

475
00:38:37,096 --> 00:38:38,096
do you understand@

476
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:43,893
She lives with me.

477
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:46,893
That's it, that's the offer.

478
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:53,852
I can hear the cogs turning.

479
00:38:57,452 --> 00:39:00,851
All right, I'll make it simple,

480
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,611
if you try and fight me on this,

481
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,369
I will make sure you get
nothing.

482
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:09,289
Nothing.

483
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:12,650
You've had a very busy few days,

484
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,208
leaving Emily with strangers,

485
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:18,848
causing a scene at my place of
work,

486
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:19,688
you know my sister...

487
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:22,488
Had to call the police, don't
you?

488
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:27,726
You broke in here too.

489
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:32,127
I had to defend myself -
Jen will back me up.

490
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:37,206
No court will ever believe you.

491
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:41,605
They'll see you as
an unfit mother.

492
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:47,844
I'll drag you through the filth.

493
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:51,682
Do you understand?

494
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:56,443
I'll make sure you'll never
see Emily unsupervised again.

495
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:00,482
Okay.

496
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,521
What was that?

497
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,561
Okay.

498
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,719
I'll... I'll do it,
I just honsetly need more.

499
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,079
More?

500
00:40:18,238 --> 00:40:19,798
Yeah, I'll sign whatever, but...

501
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,357
I need half.

502
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:26,797
Half of everything?

503
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:30,156
Jack...

504
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:35,315
I've read up on this,
spouses get half by default

505
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:38,116
unless there's a pre-nup,
which there isn't.

506
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:43,274
I'd have to write a letter
to the judge, explaining why,

507
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:44,714
if I took any less than half.

508
00:40:45,753 --> 00:40:50,594
I think it's there to protect
people

509
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:51,712
I see.

510
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:56,752
Good for you.

511
00:41:00,912 --> 00:41:05,031
Well, I'm sorry to see you
boil our

512
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:13,030
but if you want to sell her for
half

513
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,749
she's worth much more to me
anyway.

514
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,188
I know.

515
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:17,949
I know.

516
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:08,381
Fuck!

517
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:18,979
Fuck!

518
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,177
You're not taking her!
You're not fucking taking her!

519
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:26,177
You're not gonna fucking take
her!

520
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:28,018
You don't take her!

521
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,537
- Jack!
- You don't win!

522
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:35,096
Do you hear me?!

523
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,814
Fuck!

524
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:39,125
Pick up you bitch, pick up.

525
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:49,243
You fucking bitch.

526
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:52,643
Fuck!
