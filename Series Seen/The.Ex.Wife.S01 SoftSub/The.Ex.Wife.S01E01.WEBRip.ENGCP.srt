1
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,961
We're sold a lie from birth.

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,200
The idea that there are
good people and bad people.

3
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,680
But there aren't.

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,880
We all have the best of
intentions.

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,641
We need some help!

6
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:46,641
Love can justify almost
anything.

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,360
If you believe in it hard
enough.

8
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:58,800
It can make us all do
terrible things.

9
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,600
Hey you.

10
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,440
Jack?

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,761
Yeah, coming.

12
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,921
No, of course. Of course.

13
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:59,281
No, I understand.

14
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:04,400
No, she'll be fine.

15
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,400
She'll be fine.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,400
It'll be fine.

17
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,879
I'll make it fine.

18
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,280
Just leave it up to me.

19
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,400
Yeah, no. I'll tell her myself.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,080
No, I think I'll wait and
tell her in the morning.

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,719
Because tonight's our
wedding anniversary, Jen.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,039
No, not ours.
Mine and Tasha's.

23
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,719
All right. Yeah.

24
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,319
You know?

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,440
No, I appreciate the call.

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,000
All right. Okay.

27
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,759
I'm going now.
Bye bye.

28
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,520
- You don't wanna know.
- I do. Tell me.

29
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,879
Look at this.

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
What have I done to deserve
this?

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,680
Emily's asleep.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,680
One story. Milk. Conked out.

33
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,840
So what was she saying?

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,280
She called about my sister.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
- Hayley?
- Mm-hm.

36
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,680
A heads up.

37
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,360
Wine first, I think.

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh, a heads up...
Tonight.

39
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,415
She knows exactly
when we got married, Jack.

40
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,319
Trust me.

41
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,919
So what was she saying about
Hayley?

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,680
Well, apparently she wants
us to be Ethan's godparents.

43
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,919
Oh, wow. That's so nice.

44
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,520
No, sorry.

45
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,560
Me and Jen - she wants me and
Jen to be Ethan's godparents.

46
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,240
- Hence the heads up.
- Oh yeah.

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,639
Wait, your sister wants
you and your ex-wife

48
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,599
to be her only child's
godparents?

49
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,199
And I'm...

50
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,479
You're auntie Tash.

51
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,800
They definitely want you there.

52
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,319
It's just Jen and Hayley have
been best friends for 20 years.

53
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,039
All right.

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Okay. Okay.

55
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,560
I know it's not the most
glamorous wedding anniversary gift

56
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,480
and I know you hate
receiving handouts.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,480
It's always in the back of your
head.

58
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
Now it's gone.

59
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,800
The rest of my student loan.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,839
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

61
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,720
Fuck!

62
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
Fucking idiots.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,160
Thanks for all your fucking
help.. Nice one.

64
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,015
I said you needed a criminal
lawyer, not a media one.

65
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,679
Why didn't you hammer home
the mitigating circumstances.

66
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:03,958
That's all you needed to...
Oh.

67
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,239
Didn't do mitigating
because they didn't play well.

68
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:08,599
How would bringing that up
have helped us?

69
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:11,119
I don't know. You're the one
arguing the case, not me.

70
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:12,614
Now I can't even drive
my wife and child home.

71
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,599
So thank you.

72
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,599
Look what you've done to my
baby, prick.

73
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,638
- Look.
- Well, I gotta dash, mate.

74
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,614
We'll talk later, yeah?
Still on for climbing Friday?

75
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:23,638
Yeah, of course.

76
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,479
Lola?

77
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:29,174
Yeah. Could you get someone from
the office to pick me up please?

78
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:30,919
- Let's go!
- Yeah, anybody who's free.

79
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,039
Yes, they banned me for three
years.

80
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:42,359
Ssh!

81
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,919
Tasha? Jen's here.

82
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:50,318
Oh god.

83
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:53,719
Look! Look!

84
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,919
It'd daddy's ex-wife...
Again.

85
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:06,198
Who's afraid of the big, bad
wolf?

86
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:07,278
The big bad...

87
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:15,479
- Hey.
- You smell fabulous.

88
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,678
Wait, did I buy you that?

89
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,878
Probably.

90
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,999
I brought your favorite.

91
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,078
Oh, I haven't had this in ages.

92
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,599
This is fancy. Thank you.

93
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,695
- Thank you so much.
- I knew you'd love it.

94
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:29,559
You love your reds.

95
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:30,878
Hi. How's it going?

96
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,799
Hi. How are you?

97
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,198
Oh, you poor thing.

98
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,318
A three-year driving ban?

99
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:40,638
God, that's outrageous.

100
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,078
And Tasha can't drive either,
can she?

101
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,438
Oh, I can drive.

102
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:45,878
I just, I don't have a license.

103
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,054
Wait, Jack, how are you
gonna get to the christening?

104
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:50,318
We'll just get the train.

105
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,559
The train on a Sunday?

106
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,438
Jack hates the train.

107
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,599
Plus the station is nowhere
near the church.

108
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:58,775
Well, I guess we'll have to
rethink going then.

109
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:03,878
Or Jack, maybe you can go and I'll
just stay behind here with Emily.

110
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:04,958
No, no.

111
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,078
Then Jack's mum and dad
will miss out.

112
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,399
God, they'll be heartbroken
if they don't get a squeeze.

113
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,359
Listen, why don't I just
drive us all?

114
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,159
I mean, I've certainly got the
space.

115
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,599
Problem solved.

116
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,414
You know the church we're going
to is where I was christened?

117
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,958
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,215
Do you think
they still remember you?

119
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,719
It was such a long time ago.

120
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,999
Hey, we're practically the same
age.

121
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:33,838
Oh, this is gonna be so fun.

122
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,158
And I have the perfect playlist.

123
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,878
Oh god. Brace yourselves.

124
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,439
You remember this song, right?

125
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,918
- Oh shit!
- Yes!

126
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,399
Do you remember when we were
in that beach bar in mykonos?

127
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,614
- This is all they played.
- Yes.

128
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,479
They only had one cd,
I'm sure of it.

129
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,278
Of course I remember.

130
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,359
And the waitress who
kept dropping our drinks.

131
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,558
Oh yeah!

132
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:53,918
And you wondered why
I didn't tip her.

133
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,119
Oh, she was so sweet.

134
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:58,038
Absolutely ruined your
shirt though. Remember?

135
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,839
Listen, you know how my dad
loves a little dance.

136
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,558
- Yes.
- He will probably wanna...

137
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:34,278
Hello?

138
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:36,678
Any news?

139
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,359
Sam, the interview was last
week.

140
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:40,455
They're not gonna give me a
full-time position that quickly.

141
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,239
Why?

142
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,518
'Cause it is a proper job
with proper grownups

143
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,678
and proper grownup money.

144
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:47,999
Okay.

145
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,878
I mean, I'm no employment guru,

146
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,774
but I'd say probably don't
tell people at the coffee shop

147
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,359
you think it's a fake job?

148
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:56,198
Or you'll end up like me,
gaming in your boxers.

149
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,998
Yeah. You're living your
best life though, right?

150
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,718
Continue.
See you tonight.

151
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,037
Yes. Okay. Yeah.

152
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,118
All right, later.

153
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:14,718
You okay?

154
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:17,838
Can you hear me?

155
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,358
Call an ambulance.

156
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:20,877
Oh, no, I'm okay. I'm fine.

157
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,638
Actually, I've gotta get to work.
- No, no.

158
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:28,814
I don't think you should move.
You might have a back injury.

159
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,397
No, I'm pretty sure I don't.

160
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:32,318
I'm so sorry. I didn't see.

161
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:33,637
You popped out nowhere and...

162
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,718
Yeah. Alright. Alright.

163
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:38,653
If you can move, we should
probably get you off the road.

164
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,917
- Yep.
- Come on.

165
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,677
Here, let me help.
Let me help you up.

166
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,318
Thank you.

167
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:45,718
You all right?
Can you walk?

168
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:46,277
Yeah.

169
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,718
Can you walk?

170
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,198
- Do you want an arm?
- No.

171
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,037
Fuck's sake.

172
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,637
- Here.
- Thanks.

173
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:06,917
You don't have the time, do you?

174
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:08,397
10:17.

175
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:11,238
- Why? Work?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:16,557
Well, I can call them
and explain everything.

177
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,814
Okay. Yeah, actually that'd be
really good, thank you.

178
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,757
- Okay.
- Fuck...

179
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:24,517
Sorry. Do you mind just...

180
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:26,917
Oh, yeah. Okay.

181
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:29,438
Ah, fuck!

182
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:31,318
Ah.

183
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:37,958
Do I have to get this
checked out or...

184
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,637
No, it just needs cleaning,
that's all.

185
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:44,238
Listen, I live 15 minutes that
way.

186
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:46,838
So if you like, I'm happy to...

187
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,958
I'll get you fixed up.
I'll put that in the boot.

188
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:51,037
I'll get that fixed up.

189
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:53,917
I'll throw in a cup of tea
and a taxi home if you like.

190
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,318
- Okay. Okay. Yeah.
- Sure?

191
00:11:58,397 --> 00:11:59,397
Thank you. Yeah.

192
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,397
Kay. Come on in.

193
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:22,478
I think I've got a first-aid
kit... somewhere.

194
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,198
Not bad.

195
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:41,318
Thank you.

196
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,037
Here.
I'll leave this here for you.

197
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,118
- Tea?
- Yeah, please.

198
00:12:58,238 --> 00:12:59,598
You all right there?

199
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:04,917
Here.

200
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,078
All right?

201
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,358
Milk?

202
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:11,277
Yes, please.

203
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,037
That's the fridge.

204
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,198
Sorry.

205
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:33,877
So listen. I'm happy to pay
for your bike to get repaired.

206
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,637
Or if you prefer,
I can just give you cash.

207
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,037
You could get a new one.

208
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:39,677
Is 400 quid...

209
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,958
I dunno how much they cost.

210
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:43,677
What about my smashed phone?

211
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:45,478
Cost like a grand.

212
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:48,557
Did it?

213
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,318
No, not really.

214
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,557
It's refurbished.

215
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,037
800 will cover everything.

216
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:56,837
That'll do.

217
00:13:58,036 --> 00:13:59,036
Here.

218
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:04,636
No, come on.

219
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,876
We start with this.

220
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:10,357
Here we go.

221
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,357
It's gonna sting.

222
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:16,756
Doesn't sting?

223
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:20,717
Is that your wife?

224
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:23,997
Yep. That's Jen.

225
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:27,477
She's very young.

226
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,556
We both were.

227
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:32,676
Here, swap.

228
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,237
Hello?

229
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:46,997
How are the war wounds?

230
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:49,717
Hey.

231
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:52,036
Yeah, they're healing up
nicely. Thanks.

232
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,237
Good, good.

233
00:14:56,357 --> 00:15:00,997
Listen, I've got a meeting in town,
but I should be done by about 6:00.

234
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:07,117
So if you're free, we could
get an early dinner maybe.

235
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:10,117
As a thank you. Or a sorry.

236
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,757
I've gotta check on that arm,
haven't I?

237
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,916
Okay.

238
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:20,837
This is just a sorry, right?

239
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:22,237
Of course.

240
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:35,077
So graphic design...
I know what it is, but what is it?

241
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:38,156
It's an umbrella term, really.

242
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:42,796
But personally I'm into
pictographs or pictograms.

243
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:47,396
And so now pretend that
I have absolutely no idea

244
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:48,492
what you're talking about.

245
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:50,957
They're images that we all
agree on.

246
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:56,036
Like road signs or...
Labels or... warnings.

247
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:00,117
Their meaning has to be
crystal clear,

248
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,756
unambiguous, purely functional.

249
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:07,717
And, right. And you like that?

250
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:09,636
What? Functionality?

251
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:12,957
Lack of ambiguity.

252
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:17,516
Yeah. I do.

253
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:22,997
Noted.

254
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:25,717
Here we are.

255
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:28,237
And yours.
Enjoy.

256
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,676
You can ask about her.
It's fine.

257
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,516
What does she do?

258
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,197
Interior design.

259
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:41,837
It's like hotels and
restaurants.

260
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:43,636
Couple of bars.

261
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:45,597
She loves it.

262
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:48,276
She's very good,
she's pretty sought after.

263
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,957
Well, that explains why
your house is so beautiful.

264
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:54,317
No kids?

265
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:56,197
No, no. No kids.

266
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:03,636
Okay. There was a bit of a
problem there.

267
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:07,676
And ivf didn't, wasn't working,
so...

268
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:11,637
She can't.

269
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,556
- Oh, she can't.
- No.

270
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,596
I'm sorry.
Is this too much?

271
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,397
No, no, no, no. Of course not.

272
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:24,276
I just, I don't really wanna
bombard you with all of this stuff.

273
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,356
It's not your problem,
it's, my marriage is...

274
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:34,316
We've been together a really long
time and we've been through a lot.

275
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,437
And I wanted to make her happy.

276
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,836
I tried to make her happy,
but...

277
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:44,556
Life doesn't always work
out that way, you know?

278
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:50,156
You can't force someone to be
happy if fundamentally they're...

279
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,315
It's okay for you to
want to be happy, Jack.

280
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,835
Jen's agreed to a trial
separation.

281
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:11,396
It's nothing big now,
it's just separate rooms.

282
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:16,795
So we can think about
what we actually want.

283
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,755
And you can see other people?

284
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:30,156
If that's what I want.

285
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:35,156
Is it something you might want?

286
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,075
Is it something you want?

287
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,635
That was three months ago.

288
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,996
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

289
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:22,636
And you did the test yesterday?

290
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,716
It estimates about seven weeks.

291
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,196
I did the entire pack.

292
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,916
Well, that's two months ago.

293
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:32,676
So when we...

294
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,916
- You and him...
- It's not yours, Sam.

295
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:38,075
Please don't do this right now.
- Okay.

296
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,476
So what are you gonna do about
it?

297
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:47,196
I'm pregnant
with a married man's child.

298
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,196
What do you think I'm gonna do?

299
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,115
Have you told him yet?

300
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:58,035
Are you certain?

301
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,795
Yes, but it's fine.

302
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,196
I've already called a clinic.

303
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:07,595
Obviously I'm getting rid of it.

304
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:09,555
Tasha, come here, come here.

305
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,396
Okay. Talk to me properly.

306
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,676
Really properly.

307
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:17,996
It's fine.

308
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:20,396
I'll be fine.

309
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:23,956
- It takes less than an hour.
- Shut up now.

310
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,115
Shut up.

311
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,676
This is amazing.

312
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:30,515
This is perfect.

313
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,396
This is so amazing.

314
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,795
It's perfect.

315
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:37,876
Really?

316
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:39,555
Yes, of course...

317
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:47,315
I mean, what the fuck?

318
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,035
- Amen.
- Amen.

319
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,834
- Dad. Cin cin.
- Thank you.

320
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:18,514
Oh my goodness. I think you
should take him upstairs.

321
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,875
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

322
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:28,050
Thank you.
- Oh, that one's for me, actually.

323
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:30,514
You can have mine.
There you go.

324
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,074
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize.

325
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:33,651
- Anyone else? Top ups?
- Oh, yes, please.

326
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,675
Me, Jackie.

327
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:37,875
Thank you.

328
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:40,515
There you go.
- Oh, I'm drinking like a fish.

329
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:44,114
Guys. Picture please.

330
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,195
Come here.

331
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:46,715
Ready?

332
00:22:46,794 --> 00:22:48,435
- Perfectly timed.
- Huh?

333
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:49,195
Oh...

334
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:51,754
H, darling. Oh, it's okay.

335
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:52,834
It's me.

336
00:22:57,754 --> 00:23:00,794
Gorgeous.

337
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:04,195
- Oh, let me have a look.
- I knew you'd wanna have a look.

338
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:05,834
See?

339
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:07,995
- Oh, look at her!
- Love these, by the way.

340
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:10,114
Thank you.

341
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:13,435
I know. I know.

342
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:25,354
Are you having an... okay time?

343
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,715
I'm having a great time.

344
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:30,435
Jen's wandering around
like she's still your wife.

345
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:32,955
Hayley's been ignoring
me since I got here.

346
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:35,034
Oh, and your parents
haven't even said hello yet.

347
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:36,395
It's not deliberate.

348
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:38,395
There are... hello.

349
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:41,274
Very spooky old people
they've not seen for years.

350
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,475
Pretty sure they all think
I'm the nanny.

351
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:44,794
They don't.

352
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:47,715
You know she did this
deliberately, don't you?

353
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:48,915
The godparent thing.

354
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:51,955
She's trying to make a point.
I'm not welcome.

355
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:53,354
She is not trying to make a
point.

356
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:57,754
Look, come on, you know they've
been best friends since preschool.

357
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,995
- So...
- Not that long then.

358
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:03,395
How much of this have you had?

359
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:05,754
Not enough, clearly.

360
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:08,675
If you're gonna have a domestic,
do it somewhere private, please?

361
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:10,955
We're not having a domestic,
you witty old cow.

362
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:14,554
Oh, here we go.

363
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:23,794
He's fine.

364
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:27,875
I think it's just difficult
having...

365
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,915
You know?

366
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,035
Having both me and Jen here.

367
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:36,074
Well, it's just a party,
Natasha.

368
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:38,554
Jen seems okay with things.

369
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,875
If anything, she should
be the one with the issue.

370
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:41,955
I know.

371
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,034
But maybe for the next
big family thing,

372
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:45,554
it's better if only one of us
comes.

373
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:48,114
It's just a little bit...

374
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,155
Yeah.

375
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:55,754
Yeah. Maybe next time it would
be better if you didn't come.

376
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:00,794
Oh fuck off.

377
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:02,955
Classy.

378
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:07,235
You know, we all know
what you did to get here.

379
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,594
To get that ring. That house.

380
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:14,034
Jack and Jen tried for years
to have kids.

381
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,114
He couldn't.

382
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:18,034
His chances were incredibly low.

383
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:21,314
And then you, conveniently,
show up pregnant.

384
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,371
You might have got everything
you wanted,

385
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:28,354
but you don't get to choose
my friends.

386
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,195
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

387
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,155
Okay. What happened?

388
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:44,154
This needs to stop.

389
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:48,154
No more Jen coming to the house.

390
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:50,434
It's weird for me and for Emily.

391
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:53,553
- Okay.
- Okay?

392
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:55,954
Of course. I'll speak to her in
the morning.

393
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:59,273
But I'll let them have today.

394
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:06,593
Should we get pissed?

395
00:26:06,674 --> 00:26:08,394
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

396
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:16,553
Hayley said something today.

397
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:18,753
Oh god.

398
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:22,714
Whatever it was, it was probably
just Hayley being Hayley.

399
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:25,113
You'll learn to ignore it.

400
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:26,313
I do.

401
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,914
About you and Jen.

402
00:26:28,994 --> 00:26:31,353
She said it was you not Jen
who had fertility problems.

403
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:38,113
You said it was Jen
when you were trying for kids.

404
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:43,113
Okay.

405
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:48,634
Well, yeah, she's right.

406
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:54,914
Plenty of swimmers.
Just not the best athletes.

407
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:59,113
So hard, but not impossible.

408
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,714
We could have kept going,
but she wanted to stop.

409
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:03,793
So we stopped.

410
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:11,593
Why didn't you tell me?

411
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:14,073
Why do you think?

412
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,714
You're a lot younger than I am.

413
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,874
And I'm a big, stupid bloke.

414
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:27,474
I quite liked you.

415
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,154
I quite liked you too.

416
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:33,434
Yeah, I know.

417
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:32,474
Hey, do you know where
I can find pumpkin seeds?

418
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:33,474
Yeah. Come. I show you.

419
00:28:33,553 --> 00:28:37,513
Thank you.

420
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:40,513
Hey.

421
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:46,194
Oh, hey.

422
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:47,273
Natasha.

423
00:28:47,954 --> 00:28:49,073
You shop here?

424
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:51,690
Yeah. It's the closest
one to the house so...

425
00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:54,313
- Ae you local?
- Ish.

426
00:28:55,593 --> 00:28:56,673
Bit of a creature of habit.

427
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,874
It's a bit of a drive,
but I do like it here.

428
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:01,914
Speaking of which,

429
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:05,674
thank you very much for
driving us to the christening.

430
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:07,833
Hello, beautiful.

431
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,113
Are you helping mummy? Yeah.

432
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:12,994
Oh, those things are great,
aren't they?

433
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:14,249
I've got friends that swear by
them.

434
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:17,313
Who has the time to make things
fresh anymore?

435
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:19,113
Oh, I think...

436
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,394
- Oh.
- Do you still want them?

437
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:21,874
Yes, I do.

438
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:24,513
It's all right.
I'll watch her.

439
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,674
Hello, darling.
Yeah.

440
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:27,353
What's in my basket?

441
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,394
Sorry.

442
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:41,552
Here.

443
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,913
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

444
00:29:42,993 --> 00:29:43,993
Thanks.

445
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:25,032
Hey, hey!

446
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:29,072
Have you seen a woman?
Brunette but older.

447
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:30,913
And I left my baby with her.

448
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,633
- You left your baby?
- No. No, she has my baby.

449
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,352
She's taking care of my baby.
I...

450
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:36,792
Natasha.

451
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,552
- Verything okay?
- Hey. Hey.

452
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:42,592
Oh gosh.

453
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,488
I just went to get some bread
from another aisle.

454
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:45,792
I didn't mean to...

455
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:49,752
Okay. You know what, we'll just
call this a misunderstanding.

456
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:52,953
But Jen, in future, when you are
looking after other people's kids,

457
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:54,713
you don't just play it by ear.

458
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,913
Right, I'll certainly bear that
in mind.

459
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:02,272
Hey.

460
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:04,193
Hey.

461
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:05,873
Oh yeah.

462
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,433
What else have we got?
A frog.

463
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,153
Daddy loves frogs. Daddy loves
frogs.

464
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,233
Look at the time.

465
00:31:15,953 --> 00:31:17,153
You keep reading.

466
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:19,713
Baby.

467
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,832
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Come on, come on through.

468
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:37,713
She's through here.
Tasha, you've got a visitor.

469
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:39,913
Surprise!

470
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:44,552
Oh my god.

471
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:51,153
- Jack, Sam. Sam, Jack.
- Yes.

472
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:52,609
Yeah. Yeah. We met at the door.
- Yeah. Good to meet you.

473
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,473
- Jack.
- Finally.

474
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:55,832
Yeah, you too.

475
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,233
Just like sealed.

476
00:31:57,312 --> 00:31:58,512
And throwing krill.

477
00:31:58,592 --> 00:32:00,873
You that's what you...
That? Throwing krill...

478
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,328
- That's nothing to do with me.
- Instead of having...

479
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:03,768
- That's nothing to do with me.
- It's nice to meet you.

480
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:05,473
Right. I'm gonna go
and grab a quick sauna

481
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:07,409
and leave you two to just catch up.
- Yeah, yeah.

482
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:09,752
Listen, don't let me get in the
way. Seriously.

483
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:11,352
Thank you for your hospitality.

484
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:12,752
No, no, no. It's no worries.

485
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,433
There's wine in the fridge
if you want.

486
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:22,633
Did he say say sauna?

487
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,753
- I wanted to surprise you.
- Oh, right.

488
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,873
Well, I'm here now.

489
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:31,953
You said you were lonely.

490
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:33,673
If I'd asked you,
you would've put me off.

491
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,352
Sam, he's not an idiot.

492
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:36,832
He knows you don't like him.

493
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,552
You didn't come to the wedding.

494
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:39,953
Wait, what?

495
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:42,473
He's not an idiot?

496
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,153
Stop it.

497
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:47,032
Oh, come on. He doesn't care.

498
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:49,673
I'm here now.
Can't hate him that much.

499
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:51,112
Yeah, but you could have texted.

500
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:54,032
It's the middle of the night.
A bloke coming to see me.

501
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:55,768
Okay. It's not the middle
of the night, mum.

502
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,993
You need to get out more.

503
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,512
And plus, have you seen his
face? That beard?

504
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:03,592
He doesn't care about
the competition.

505
00:33:04,393 --> 00:33:07,953
Hey, at least your ex-husband
isn't showing up. Right?

506
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,792
- All right. That's it.
- Too far? Was that too far?

507
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:12,633
- You're out. You're out.
- Okay. I'll go.

508
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:13,713
I'll go.

509
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:17,312
Seriously though,
what's it like being rich?

510
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:20,552
I'm not rich.

511
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:23,473
Sure. Okay, Drake.

512
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:25,473
Do you wanna show me
the rest of the house or...

513
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:28,272
Where's your priceless
collection of birkin bags?

514
00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:30,272
- Upstairs.
- Don't joke.

515
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:32,193
- You being serious?
- Yeah. I'm dead serious.

516
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:33,551
They're so expensive.

517
00:33:35,831 --> 00:33:37,071
Still doesn't like me, does he?

518
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:41,271
Sam?

519
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:49,031
At least he's honest.

520
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,351
How'd things go with him.

521
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:53,311
Are you patching things up?

522
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,111
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of.

523
00:33:57,992 --> 00:34:01,591
You know, it's really
nice to see an old face.

524
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:05,351
The nct girls are great, but
you know, they're mum friends.

525
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:08,271
And he doesn't hate you.

526
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:11,791
He's just protective,
like an older brother.

527
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:14,752
Or a judgmental aunt.

528
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:16,832
Yeah. I see it. I see it.

529
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,591
Listen, I know it's not ideal,

530
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:22,992
but they need me to go
to New York next week.

531
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:24,992
Just Thursday to Sunday.

532
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,207
So I was thinking I could
get you and Emily a ticket

533
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,231
if you don't want to
stay here on your own.

534
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:34,711
I mean, obviously I'll be busy
but we'll have the nights

535
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,552
and you two can explore
the city in the day.

536
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:40,191
I don't know that it's a good
idea

537
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:42,952
taking her on a long-haul
flight just yet.

538
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,432
Because I wanna get her
into a proper routine

539
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,151
in case we start nursery soon.

540
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:55,792
Wow.
Yeah, no, you're right.

541
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,312
Don't wanna throw her off her
sleep.

542
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:02,328
Oh, you don't mind me
going though, do you?

543
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:03,472
Uh-uh.

544
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,752
Listen, I spoke to Jen
after the christening

545
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:13,111
and I explained everything.

546
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:15,392
And she won't be coming around
anymore.

547
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:31,111
Thanks for this, Sam.
I appreciate it.

548
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:32,792
- It's all right.
- Oh.

549
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:35,912
Oh. Oh.

550
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:37,872
Oh, she wants her rabbit.

551
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:40,591
Damn.
Rabbit is upstairs.

552
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,312
- I will just...
- No, no, no.

553
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,432
I'll get her. Him. Where is he?

554
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:46,352
- In her room.
- In her room. Right. Cool.

555
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:47,432
- Got it.
- Yeah.

556
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:06,352
Oh.

557
00:36:21,752 --> 00:36:23,912
Sorry. Right under the bed.

558
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:25,872
Always under the bed.

559
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:32,352
You got your rabbit now. Are
you happy?

560
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:35,392
Watch this.

561
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:39,992
Oh, mate. What are you?

562
00:36:40,071 --> 00:36:41,071
Some mastermind villain?

563
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:45,432
Wish I had a garage.

564
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,992
What, so he goes away
a lot, yeah?

565
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:51,231
Does that bother you?

566
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:52,832
Yeah, obviously.

567
00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:54,111
I miss him.

568
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:58,671
It was much worse
straight after she was born.

569
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:00,511
Yeah.

570
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:01,832
What does he actually do?

571
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:04,472
- He's a media executive.
- No. Yeah. I know that.

572
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:05,952
You told me that.

573
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:07,511
What does he actually do?

574
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,151
Ah, very funny.

575
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:11,872
Not sure I was trying to be.

576
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,191
Do you guys ever talk
about what you wanna do?

577
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:18,631
You know, jobs? Applying for
things?

578
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:22,392
- Not yet.
- Why?

579
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,711
Why? Does he not know
it's important to you?

580
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,392
No, Sam, it's not him.
It's me.

581
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:29,671
I just...

582
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,070
I don't know.

583
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:36,431
I don't want to leave here just
yet.

584
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,991
It doesn't feel right.

585
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,311

I'm sure you could.

614
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:41,791
Jack told me to keep keys.

616
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,351

Yes. I know. New York.

621
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,991
I just spoke to him.

622
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,791
I couldn't find some documents
in my flat.

623
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:04,670
So I assumed that they must be
here.

624

And ta-da, here they are

625
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:12,431
Jack told me to let myself in
if you weren't home.

626

that I owe thousands in tax,

I thought we'd been burgled.

00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,686
I didn't know you had
a friend with a car.

632

I heard you outside.

633
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,431

him.

company,

635

- How do you know Sam's name?
- What?

660
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:36,926
Jack must have brought him
up after the christening.

661
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,549
You know when we had that talk.

662
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:42,790
One about giving you space? I'm
assuming that was your idea.

663
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:44,270
He wasn't around then.

664
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:47,269
- What?
- Sam wasn't around

665
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,830
when Jack spoke to you
after the christening.

666
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:55,310
Have you two been speaking
since then?

667

No.

No.

outside or...

670
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,669

671
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,229

you just happened to be there?

672
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,270
Excuse me?

673
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,870
I think I'm gonna leave.

674
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,629
I think you should, and I'm
gonna need those keys back now.

675
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:30,750
Fine. Here.

676
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:33,149
You need to stop all of this,
Jen.

677
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:37,189
Seriously.
You need to leave us alone.

678
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,229
Oh, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

679
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,870
You know, when you talk to Jack,
tell him I can't do this anymore.

680
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,790
It's all gone on for too long.

681
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,270
What has?

682
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:51,709
All of this.

683
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,509
She said what?

684
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,766
Why didn't you call
me as soon as it happened?

685
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,029
Sh!

686
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:10,310
Because you were working
and I was dealing with it.

687
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,589
I changed the locks,
the alarm, everything.

688
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:16,029
What did she mean?

689
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,870
I don't know.

690
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,069
I haven't seen her since the
christening, you know that.

691
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:22,629
But she said you'd just spoken.

692
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:25,310
You told her to come by
the house and get her things.

693
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,870
Well, yeah, I spoke to her
briefly on the phone.

694
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,549
And yes, I told her to come
over.

695
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:31,470
She said it was urgent.

696
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,790
I expected her to knock on the
door,

697
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,470
like a normal fucking human
being.

698
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:43,830
But she said that you gave her
a key for emergencies.

699
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,310
Something about money
problems or unpaid tax.

700
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:50,830
She told you about that.

701
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,589
Wow. Right.

702
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:57,509
Well, yeah, she's really worried,
this tax thing's gonna hit her hard.

703
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,430
I don't care, Jack.

704
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,390
She was in my house, drunk.

705
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,926
She showed up at our
supermarket the other week.

706
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,430
She lives fucking miles away.

707
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:12,790
Now she's saying that she knows
Sam or at least recognizes him.

708
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,350
So either she's hanging around
here, staking the place out,

709
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,910
or you're lying to me
about talking to her.

710
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,390
I'm sorry?

711
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,790
Well, tell me I'm imagining
things.

712
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,310
Have you spoken to her or been
to see her since your chat?

713
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,790
No.

714
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:30,870
And no.

715
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,029
Now listen, I don't know
what she's playing at,

716
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:36,749
but whatever it is, it has to
stop. Okay?

717
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:41,310
But if she says she knows Sam,
that's nothing to do with me.

718
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,750
You're gonna have to talk to
him.

719
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,709
Fuck!

720
00:44:49,149 --> 00:44:51,109
Right. I'm gonna talk to her
again.

721
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,750
And I'm gonna be clearer.

722
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:56,149
Because maybe the way we've
been...

723
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:58,309
The way I've been has given
her the wrong impression.

724
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:03,629
But if she's come around
expecting anything,

725
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,149
it just has to stop.

726
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:06,229
It has to.

727
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,149
And if it doesn't, then...

728
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,069
We'll have to address it
more seriously.

729
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:16,910
Call the police?

730
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,910
If you don't feel safe.

731
00:45:49,188 --> 00:45:50,188
(Tap runs

732
00:45:51,068 --> 00:45:52,869
- Is that my car?
- Yeah.

733
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:55,628
All right. 30 seconds.

734
00:46:13,628 --> 00:46:15,588
Okay. Okay. Okay.

735
00:46:16,028 --> 00:46:17,148
Let's do this.

736
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:23,148
It's gonna be a bit of a late
one today.

737
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:26,349
Probably 10:00 or 11:00,
something like that.

738
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:28,349
Okay. See you then.

739
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:07,628
I'm trying to think.
Is there anything else?

740
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:08,805
We've covered
everything. Yeah.

741
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,469
- You've got my number.
- I do. I'll call.

742
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,108
So, I mean, any problem,
big or small.

743
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,188
Thank you for coming
at such late notice.

744
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:17,269
Oh. No worries.

745
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:22,588
I've got her.
You go be with your mom.

746
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:25,869
I hope she feels better soon.

747
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:27,628
Yeah.

748
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,869
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

749
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:30,949
Bye.

750
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:09,668
Maybe just stop here.

751
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:10,829
- All right, love.
- Thanks.

752
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:27,588
Thanks.

753
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:25,187
The time we were in venice.

754
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:29,547
If that's food,
I'm gonna plate up and then...
