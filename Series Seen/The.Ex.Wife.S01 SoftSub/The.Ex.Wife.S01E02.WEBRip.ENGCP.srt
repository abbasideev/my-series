1
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:11,771
I'm so sorry, I didn't see you.

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,251
Is that your wife?

3
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:16,292
Yep that's Jen.

4
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:18,811
Jen's agreed to a trial
separation.

5
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,051
I'm pregnant
with a married man's child.

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,212
We all know what you did
to get here.

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,572
Jen's running around
like she's still your wife.

8
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:27,611
It's not yours Sam.

9
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,372
If there is something

10
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:31,692
Jack'll find out.

11
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,852
She was in my house, drunk.

12
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:35,107
She showed up at our
supermarket the other week.

13
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,172
Have you seen a woman?
I left my baby with her.

14
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,371
You left your baby?

15
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:41,532
Have you been to see her
since your chat?

16
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,211
- No.
- It needs to stop.

17
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,412
Shit.

18
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:57,532
Tasha.

19
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,371
Tasha, please.

20
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,571
Would you wait?

21
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:15,173
Tasha, wait. Tasha

22
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:17,373
- stop it Tasha, stop it.
- You fuck.

23
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,173
- Stop it.
- You fuck!

24
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:22,573
Fuck!
Stop it, stop it!

25
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:26,813
Tasha.

26
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:31,052
It's not what you think.

27
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,132
Okay?

28
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:37,332
Whatever you're thinking, don't,

29
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,373
I'll explain if you let me
alright?

30
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,052
Thank you so much.

31
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:16,372
You're welcome. Anytime.

32
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,693
- Is that her?
- No.

33
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:32,573
- Are you sleeping with her?
- No.

34
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,532
I said no.
I'm not sleeping with her.

35
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:41,612
You followed me tonight.

36
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:45,013
How long have you been doing
that?

37
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:46,253
I didn't follow you.

38
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:49,253
I used the phone finder app.

39
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:51,772
Okay, okay.

40
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,973
All right, here's the truth.

41
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,453
Do you wanna sit down or...

42
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:05,492
You can't spend that much of
your

43
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:07,013
then suddenly feel nothing.

44
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:08,332
I'm sorry, you can't.

45
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:11,932
Now you told me to speak to her
and I did.

46
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:14,029
But one phone call
after twenty years,

47
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:15,933
one phone call,
that's not good enough.

48
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:23,414
Now it appears as though
there's no way to prove to you

49
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:25,670
that I choose you over her
unless I never see her again.

50
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:28,574
And I needed to see her again.

51
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:31,213
So you forced me into
a pretty impossible situation.

52
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,574
Are you fucking with me right
now?

53
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,014
I don't want you going for
date nights with your ex-wife.

54
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,613
I don't think that's
unreasonable,

55
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,734
it was dinner.
It was dinner!

56
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,294
She's got a new contract,
she needed someone.

57
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,854
Tasha I didn't want to let her
down.

58
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:56,734
I didn't want to.

59
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:59,333
Cause it's fucking difficult

60
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,213
alright?

61
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:04,294
And it's different when you're
older.

62
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,174
- Fuck off!
- It is different!

63
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:10,014
She's got all of her friends,
but all of them have families.

64
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:11,213
All of them.

65
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:12,614
They're all doing their own
thing.

66
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,294
It used to be just me and her.

67
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,333
And now what?

68
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,493
I just abandon her.
Is that what you want?

69
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,054
I don't want anything.

70
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,494
You do what you want
and I'll do what I want.

71
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:30,894
Oh, for fuck sake.

72
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:32,973
Well, can I ask where you're
going?

73
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:36,853
I'm taking Emily
away from this shit show.

74
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,173
You're taking her?
No you're not taking...

75
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,653
Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean
that.

76
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,653
I'm sorry. Okay, sorry.

77
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,494
Fuck, I haven't been listening,
but I am now.

78
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,293
I promise you I'm listening now.

79
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:50,374
All right? I'm listening.

80
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:52,934
So...

81
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:04,054
No more Jen.

82
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,093
Okay.

83
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:14,333
And your family have to be
nicer.

84
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:16,934
Yeah, I agree with that.

85
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:18,231
I will definitely talk to my
family.

86
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:22,375
And I promise you
that things will get better.

87
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,654
I promise.

88
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:28,854
You're my priority.

89
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:33,174
What?

90
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:35,734
Come on, tell me.

91
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:41,815
It's this house.
It's...

92
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,294
I'm here all the time.

93
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:50,774
And I miss my life, my job.

94
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,414
Okay, right.

95
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:00,094
Right, this is what we'll do,

96
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:02,935
Emily's old enough for nursery
now,

97
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:05,854
you get your space.

98
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:11,015
I can't lose you.

99
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:14,214
Go on...

100
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,935
Say it.

101
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:19,654
I've got nothing to say.

102
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:22,294
I told you how I felt
about this from the start.

103
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,256
So don't make out
like I'm holding back.

104
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:25,696
Yeah, but this is different.

105
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,335
This is new information.

106
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,735
Well, the point is,
do you believe him?

107
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,735
- I do.
- Okay.

108
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:33,735
Well you know how I feel,

109
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:37,896
but there's no way of knowing

110
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:40,295
I mean, they weren't going at it

111
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,711
- Sam.
- I'm just saying for balance.

112
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,095
I don't trust him but...

113
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:45,896
You didn't catch him doing
anything

114
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:48,975
- no.
- Right.

115
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,496
Now it's all over

116
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:52,696
okay.

117
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,975
So it is a good thing.

118
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:57,816
Yeah.

119
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,496
Great news about the nursery
though.

120
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:05,576
- Yeah.
- Get some time back.

121
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:06,975
Oh.

122
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:11,616
So it's mandatory for companies
to have a pumping room.

123
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:12,696
Lush.

124
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,775
But there is no universal
signage yet

125
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:17,735
so I thought I'd give it a go
for my portfolio.

126
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,335
There she is.

127
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:21,816
I love it.

128
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,376
I'm here for you.

129
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,095
You know... whenever you need.

130
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:31,056
Oi, seriously.

131
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:33,456
Last time I told you
how I felt about Jack,

132
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,615
we didn't speak for a year.

133
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,535
A year!
I'm not risking that again.

134
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:40,016
If you're happy, I'm happy.

135
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:43,175
- Yeah right.
- For real.

136
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,136
Can I use your bathroom
quickly before I go?

137
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:54,935
Yeah just be quiet
because Emily's sleeping.

138
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:56,016
All right, sweet.

139
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,696
Who's gonna go to bed?

140
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:55,617
Me?

141
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,696
You?

142
00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:58,857
Ooh.

143
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:07,217
More?

144
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:09,576
Later, after our sleep.

145
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:11,776
Yeah.

146
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,776
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

147
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:15,696
Gonna sleep long?

148
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:16,776
Yeah?

149
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:19,617
Who's that?

150
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:21,217
Who's there?

151
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,576
Is that daddy?

152
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:25,696
No.

153
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,456
It's not daddy.

154
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:34,936
I come in peace, bearing gifts.

155
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,176
I know I'm an awful witch
but I've driven three hours

156
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,457
and I'm gasping for a coffee.

157
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:44,377
And I promise I'm on
absolute best behavior.

158
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:49,696
Yeah, come in.

159
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:52,576
Hi.

160
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:04,857
I'm just putting her upstairs.

161
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:15,217
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,

162
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:17,097
Jack really went to town on us.

163
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,377
Even mum and dad didn't come out

164
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:21,713
and we'd given up on them years
ago.

165
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:23,176
They probably need water.

166
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:26,617
It's a long drive
and I had the heating blasting.

167
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,177
He must really love you, Jack.

168
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,937
He's not done anything

169
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:42,697
god this is good.

170
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:45,457
This is the one he gets
from Guatemala, right?

171
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:51,258
He told us how unhappy you've
been.

172
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:55,657
It's hard that first year
with a new baby, isn't it?

173
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,297
Yeah it's bloody hard.

174
00:11:58,978 --> 00:11:59,978
It's uncanny...

175
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:03,297
How much she looks like him.

176
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,057
You're in there, of course,
the chin maybe,

177
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:12,338
but his eyes, cheeks, dimples.

178
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,417
Yeah kids are hard.

179
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,978
Can't imagine what it's been
like

180
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,498
no support network.

181
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,033
Hadn't occurred to me
until Jack said it.

182
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:29,817
He said you'd been brilliant,
of course.

183
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:36,537
I've been awful to you.

184
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,777
Not a literal or a figurative
sister, but...

185
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:45,018
I'm here now and I'm sorry.

186
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,777
I really appreciate you saying
that.

187
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:55,937
It's been a little harder
than I expected

188
00:12:58,657 --> 00:12:59,898
but worth it, of course.

189
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,498
I mean, I wouldn't change
it for the world, but...

190
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:12,537
It's funny how we can
create a person in our minds.

191
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,498
You're not who I thought you
were

192
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:20,777
I didn't think somebody like you

193
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:24,138
I didn't realize
you'd be quite so fragile.

194
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:27,177
Don't get me wrong, I could
do with a touch more fragility

195
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:30,338
or I could of course
completely change

196
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,338
but that might run the risk
of a full character implosion.

197
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:38,018
Well, please don't implode,

198
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:44,778
Come here.

199
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:49,578
- Okay?
- Yeah, good.

200
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:54,139
Is Jen... okay?

201
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,698
Jack really loves you.

202
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,739
Okay? He'd do anything to make
you happy.

203
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:07,298
But you said jump, he jumped.

204
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,619
No one's said a word to her.

205
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,259
Cold Turkey after twenty years.

206
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:15,578
I'm not blaming you...

207
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,338
No contact means no contact.

208
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:22,058
You asked.

209
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,219
The answer is no,
she's not really okay.

210
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:31,458
I have to go.

211
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:32,778
Sorry.

212
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,938
Take care. See you soon.

213
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,939
Right, well he said
specifically no purple.

214
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,980
He didn't say anything
about mauve, did he?

215
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,380
So let's get the swatches

216
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,299
and mail them across.

217
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,340
Okay, one second.

218
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,900
I'm sorry to barge in, it's just

219
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,755
she told me Jack had
stopped talking to you

220
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,380
and hadn't explained why.

221
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,860
That's my fault.

222
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,260
So I thought I should
come and explain.

223
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,020
Or... apologize, I don't know.

224
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,819
I don't know what I'm doing,
Jen.

225
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,860
And, up until now,
I've been behaving as though

226
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,579
I'm still this laid back,
easygoing gen z or whatever.

227
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:49,299
But the truth is, I'm not.

228
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,340
You're a lovely person
but the lovelier you are,

229
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,900
the more it

230
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,819
you should hate me.

231
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,260
I stole your husband.

232
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,140
I don't hate you Tasha.

233
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,179
I hate what happened to me...
And Jack.

234
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,860
But that happened
long before you arrived.

235
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,499
Jack needed a fresh start
and you were exactly that.

236
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,860
And, if I'm honest,

237
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,620
I'm not sure I would be doing
any

238
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,900
It's okay, I'm right here.

239
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,699
God, she's just hungry.

240
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,419
Oh, hi darling.

241
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,141
Hello. Hi.
How's my girl?

242
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,740
Beginner's luck.

243
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,901
Yeah?

244
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,901
I've actually forgotten her food

245
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,821
- so I have to go.
- Oh, in the kitchen.

246
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:05,660
The cupboard on the right?

247
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,141
Yes. Oh, it's a ducky.

248
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,340
Quack, quack.
Quack, quack.

249
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,460
Oh look, ba ba ba...

250
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,180
- Did you find it?
- Yep.

251
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
What's this?

252
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:35,821
Everything okay?

253
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,660
Yeah, everything's fine.

254
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:55,740
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

255
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:06,901
Jack brought her here.

256
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,621
A few times actually.

257
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,180
Or I should say he dropped
by and she was with him.

258
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,180
Recently?

259
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,301
No, no.
When she was younger.

260
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Come in for weekend days for a
coffee

261
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,260
or we'd all go for a walk,
wouldn't we?

262
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:27,901
And you thought you'd buy food
for her, just on the off chance

263
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,061
that Jack would pop by
with my daughter?

264
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,740
No, of course not.

265
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:36,236
Jack must have left them here
by accident.

266
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,700
No, I probably should have
binned them actually...

267
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:56,661
All right, here they are.

268
00:19:57,221 --> 00:20:00,501
You should probably have them,
or it's just a waste.

269
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:01,981
I'm sorry Jen.

270
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,342
No, no don't be silly.

271
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:05,062
I understand.

272
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:06,142
Like I said...

273
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:08,461
If the tables were turned.

274
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,981
Tasha, finally.

275
00:20:22,062 --> 00:20:23,917
Hey, sorry I missed
your calls, are you okay?

276
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:27,461
Yes. I've been trying
to get

277
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,582
I know, I know, I was busy.

278
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,181
What's up?

279
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:33,862
I did something.

280
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,981
What? What'd you do?

281
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,598
I needed to talk to you earlier

282
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:39,262
so I went to the house
and Jack was there.

283
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,421
- Jack was there?
- Yes.

284
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,102
- In the middle of the day?
- He was being weird.

285
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:47,558
He was making even less
of an effort

286
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,582
to disguise the fact
that he didn't want me there.

287
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:50,981
So he left and I...

288
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,142
Followed him.

289
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,382
You followed Jack?

290
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:00,981
Yes.

291
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:03,701
But I think he saw me.

292
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:06,822
Sam, you idiot.

293
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:07,902
He saw you?

294
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,661
Why the fuck were you following
Jack?

295
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:13,142
Because I could...

296
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,421
I wanted to get hold of you
and he was acting strange.

297
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,102
- I'm looking out for you.
- He was acting strange?

298
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:22,261
Sam, this isn't looking out for
me,

299
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:24,102
okay.

300
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,342
Okay.

301
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:27,542
Are you sure he saw you?

302
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,582
Yeah.

303
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:35,382
Yeah, I think so.

304
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,181
And?

305
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,902
I drove off.

306
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,261
Oh my god Sam,

307
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,941
if he didn't think that
something

308
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,862
I'd say he might now,
don't you think?

309
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:50,261
I think a certain someone
droppedthis.

310
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,902
I'll let you get back to Sam.

311
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:04,103
Shit.

312
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,783
Shit.

313
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,103
Yeah?
Yeah.

314
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:19,903
Oh, I forgot to say,

315
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:21,799
I forgot to say I have to
go to New York again.

316
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:24,182
Oh.

317
00:22:24,262 --> 00:22:26,422
- Oh right.
- Oh, that's a good one.

318
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,742
It is.

319
00:22:27,783 --> 00:22:30,262
Yeah, I was gonna get you a
ticket

320
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:32,502
beautiful.

321
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,182
Look, we're nearly at the
front.

322
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:36,583
We're nearly at the front.

323
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:38,422
So lookout, fellow drivers,

324
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:41,063
brcause my dad's
got a previous for speeding.

325
00:22:43,182 --> 00:22:44,583
It's fine, here.

326
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:48,903
- Who is it?
- It's Johnny.

327
00:22:50,422 --> 00:22:51,422
Johnny?

328
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:55,783
Sorry, it's a work thing. I...

329
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:58,022
- Yeah, yeah you go.
- Have fun.

330
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,982
Sorry, what is it?

331
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:09,942
Up we go!

332
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,942
Where are we going?

333
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:52,343
Look at you!

334
00:23:54,422 --> 00:23:56,702
Where's your dada?

335
00:23:57,262 --> 00:23:59,222
I don't know where your dada is.

336
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,304
Would you mind watching her?

337
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:26,824
Thank you. Thank you.

338
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,440
Have you seen... there was
a little girl here, just there.

339
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:27,905
Just a second ago.

340
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,385
Tasha? Tash!

341
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:56,984
- What's happened?
- It's Emily.

342
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,984
She was there and then she's...

343
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:00,065
Okay.

344
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:06,785
Jen!

345
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:08,944
Jen!

346
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,825
What the hell do you think
you are doing with my child?

347
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:13,065
Oh my god. Oh my god.

348
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:14,664
No. I'm so sorry.

349
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:17,464
I'm her mother, I'm her mother.
I'm so sorry.

350
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,385
You left her alone,
I was looking for you.

351
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:20,385
I know, there was an emergency.

352
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:22,305
Thank you so much looking after
her.

353
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:25,065
It's a busy place,

354
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:26,545
thank you, thank you.

355
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,345
- Thank you so much.
- I'm glad to help.

356
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:29,625
It's okay, come on.

357
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:31,424
I'm so sorry.

358
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:33,424
I'm so sorry,
I wasn't paying attention.

359
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:34,785
It's okay.

360
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:37,305
Oh, I won't leave you ever
again,

361
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:39,464
- never.
- It's okay. There's no harm.

362
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:40,640
I promise I won't ever do that
again.

363
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:43,184
It's okay. It's fine.

364
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:46,065
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

365
00:27:46,145 --> 00:27:48,385
It's not okay. You were arguing
with Johnny and then I...

366
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:51,545
I saw...

367
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,264
You thought you saw Jen?

368
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:57,625
- Yeah I heard.
- Yeah.

369
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,545
I think half of the soft play
heard.

370
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,785
Tash, you know she's not here
right?

371
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:08,145
- Tash.
- Of course.

372
00:28:09,184 --> 00:28:10,385
I'm so sorry.

373
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:12,704
All right, okay.

374
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:19,386
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

375
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:07,386
And she had
Emily's food in her house.

376
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:10,346
What do you mean?

377
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:11,985
Pouches of toddler food.

378
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:14,146
In her cupboard.

379
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:15,225
It was...

380
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:18,546
She claims that you left them
there,

381
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:22,547
accidentally, the last time
you went around.

382
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:26,266
- Did you?
- Well...

383
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:34,907
I guess I must have if she says
so.

384
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:37,466
I don't know.

385
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,787
It was weird.

386
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:44,587
What did you expect?

387
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:47,387
A broken woman?

388
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,067
Well, she's not like you.

389
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:57,907
Not like me how?

390
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:03,147
She doesn't express emotions
like this.

391
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:05,706
It's just not what she does.

392
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:08,867
No, that's not a criticism of
you.

393
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:09,946
It's just...

394
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:14,506
Her whole world could be
crumbling

395
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:16,347
you'd think she was fine or
joking?

396
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:18,986
Whereas I?

397
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:22,986
Tash I'm not starting anything.

398
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:26,587
She's just older and she's been
through lots of things.

399
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:32,186
Don't do that.

400
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:34,867
Do what?

401
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:42,506
I get it, I'm...

402
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:46,746
You're the wise elders
and I'm this footloose chancer

403
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:48,426
who's lucky to be here.

404
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,706
No

405
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:51,506
The thing is, Jack, I...

406
00:31:53,147 --> 00:31:54,466
Know who I am.

407
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:58,506
I've been a grown up
since I turned 16

408
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:01,986
and started working
to fund my own education.

409
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:05,706
I supported my mother and then

410
00:32:05,787 --> 00:32:08,147
so you're gonna have to
find another angle

411
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,347
if you wanna justify
all of this bullshit.

412
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:13,226
'Cause the truth is that...

413
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:16,147
The truth is...

414
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:23,627
You left your wife but you
didn't leave her, did you?

415
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,747
She's here right now.

416
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:28,068
She may as well be
having dinner with us.

417
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,908
That's a really unfair thing to
say.

418
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,868
Jack.

419
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:49,308
Jack, can we...
Can you come back so we can...

420
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:51,308
It's totally unfair
and you know it is.

421
00:32:58,507 --> 00:32:59,747
This isn't gonna change, is it?

422
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,507
You said things would change
but...

423
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:09,747
I can't do this anymore.

424
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:13,108
If I don't leave...

425
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:18,547
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.

426
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:25,828
Tasha.

427
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:30,108
Tasha.

428
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:31,868
Tasha!

429
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,908
Are you not speaking to me now?

430
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:43,669
I'm gonna go check on Emily.

431
00:34:48,468 --> 00:34:49,588
Jack.

432
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:01,988
Look, you're my wife.

433
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:07,028
There's no one else here,
it's just you and me.

434
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:52,189
We could renew our vows.

435
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:57,068
We'll move somewhere.

436
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,508
Let's move somewhere.

437
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:01,869
We might have to if the glass
bursts.

438
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:03,428
Oh yeah.

439
00:36:05,988 --> 00:36:07,148
I'll get it fixed.

440
00:36:12,948 --> 00:36:14,389
You know what you said earlier,

441
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:16,829
about me being a wise old elder
and you...

442
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:22,309
You know I don't think that,
don't you?

443
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:30,229
It's been such a weird day.

444
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:38,270
I saw Sam earlier, your Sam,

445
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,390
and then again at work.
It was...

446
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:43,710
It was really unsettling.

447
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:47,109
Something's definitely up with
him.

448
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,230
I dunno what it...

449
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,870
Do you think he has feelings
for you?

450
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,870
What?

451
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:57,509
He was at the house?

452
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:58,589
Mm.

453
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,350
No.

454
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,069
No he doesn't.

455
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:06,710
I don't know.

456
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,270
What happened?

457
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,069
Did you speak?

458
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:11,910
Do you want me to say something
to him?

459
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:14,190
We spoke briefly, it was weird.

460
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,710
But no, don't cause a problem
on my account.

461
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,870
I just don't trust him, that's
all.

462
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,109
It was probably a coincidence
him being in town.

463
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,870
He's a cabby, isn't he?

464
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,910
Yeah, weird.

465
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,509
You should be careful around
him.

466
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,670
Morning.

467
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,429
Good morning.

468
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:22,589
I love you.

469
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,469
Are you packed?

470
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:28,549
Have you got everything?

471
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:30,750
Except you.

472
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,509
I'm right here.

473
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,351
Now listen, I'm gonna
be gone for three nights

474
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:45,990
so that gives you
three glorious days to relax

475
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,150
and be creative, find a job.

476
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:51,311
Generally have a lovely time.

477
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,671
And I'll see you when I'm back.

478
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:00,351
Right. Driver's downstairs.

479
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,950
I've got Emily up
and dressed for nursery

480
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,367
so I'll drop her off on
the way to the airport.

481
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:09,831
- Oh, that's okay I can-
- no, it's fine, it's fine.

482
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:12,711
She'll be fine.

483
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:16,590
I packed her nursery bag
with all of her things.

484
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:18,990
A garrot, mace, cleaver, usual
stuff.

485
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:23,430
I am a pretty hands on dad,
I don't know if you've noticed.

486
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,751
I trust you.

487
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,550
Well at least someone does.

488
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,110
Thank you.

489
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:33,470
What for?

490
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,430
Changing my life kiddo.

491
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,351
You too old man.

492
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,950
Old, old, old.

493
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,672
Hello?

494
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:16,752
Oh hey, it's Natasha,

495
00:41:16,832 --> 00:41:20,232
it's Johnny. We met at Jack's
hearing, the driving ban.

496
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:23,832
I'm sorry to bother you at home,

497
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:25,672
he's not there, is he?

498
00:41:25,752 --> 00:41:26,952
Hi, yeah, Johnny, I remember.

499
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:31,071
He's actually just left for
New York on a business trip.

500
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:33,192
Really?

501
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:35,232
Oh, okay.

502
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:37,392
Right.

503
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:39,111
Has he?

504
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:39,431
My mistake then.

505
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:43,392
I'll just try him again later.

506
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:45,511
Thanks Natasha.

507
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,431
The number you have called

508
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:08,233
Hello stranger.

509
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,152
There she is.

510
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:10,673
Back in the game.

511
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:12,753
It's just an interview.

512
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:13,873
It's in the bag.

513
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:15,553
I've got a good feeling about
it.

514
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,393
But listen, I need to speak to
you

515
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,112
sorry hang on.

516
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:23,472
- Emily warrington.
- Great, I'll go get her.

517
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:24,313
Sorry, are you still there?

518
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,472
Always.

519
00:43:26,552 --> 00:43:27,952
How's my Princess doing?

520
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:29,193
Well good, I think.

521
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,032
The algebra's coming along
nicely.

522
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:32,873
Oh, and she speaks Spanish now.

523
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:35,393
Well no one needs
to learn algebra ever.

524
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:38,152
But listen,
I really need to talk to you.

525
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:39,432
Is everything okay?

526
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:42,313
Sorry Sam, I'll call you back.

527
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:49,673
Hi. Sorry, just to clarify,
you're here for...?

528
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,152
Emily warrington.

529
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,793
- I'm her mum.
- Yes, yes.

530
00:43:52,873 --> 00:43:54,512
Emily's already been collected.

531
00:43:55,193 --> 00:43:57,032
What?

532
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,233
W... what do you mean
collected?

533
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:02,952
By who?

534
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:05,592
Who collected Emily earlier?

535
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:07,753
- Emily's mum.
- I'm her mum.

536
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:10,833
Who the hell
did you give my child to?

537
00:44:11,152 --> 00:44:12,873
She was in the pickup book.

538
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:17,632
No, no, no, no, no
this can't be happening.

539
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:19,112
What did she look like?

540
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:20,673
The woman who took my child!
