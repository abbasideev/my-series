0
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:09,641
No you'll not take her.

1
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:11,042
Emily is not here, okay.

2
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:12,122
He has her.

3
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,681
Legally, you can't be here.

4
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,440
You can't change the way things
are

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
what's winsford?

6
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:20,801
He never told you
about the second home.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,640
I swear to god,
if this is a trick.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,318
You forced me when you
said that you'd take Emily.

9
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:47,477
Dr. Morgan,
please come to the front desk.

10
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,076
Dr. Morgan to the front desk
please.

11
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:57,394
Three miscarriages,
three failed attempts at ivf,

12
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:00,875
countless clinics and all the
medication.

13
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,475
And I did that.

14
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:03,649
And no, no, no, I know
what you're gonna say,

15
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:06,673
it's not my fault,

16
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:11,753
so we thought about adoption.

17
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,352
It wouldn't be your child.

18
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:15,393
Exactly.

19
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,871
A lot of men feel that way.

20
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:21,231
I mean, women too.

21
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:23,911
Well, Jen would be fine with
adoption.

22
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,591
We did try a surrogate.

23
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:29,270
- Right.
- In america.

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,470
A hundred grand...

25
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,310
They disappeared.

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,029
I know we need to stop, but...

27
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:40,508
You can't let this go?

28
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,188
I don't know what to do,

29
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:51,706
Jack, can I offer you a
solution?

30
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:53,866
Yes, please.

31
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:57,387
So, from what you've told me,

32
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:02,546
Jen is at the end of
her fertility journey,

33
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,826
you can't have a family with
her.

34
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:07,784
But you do have choices.

35
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:12,304
You can choose to let this go,

36
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,943
this idea of what a family
should be.

37
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:19,942
It sounds as if you have
a wife who loves you very much.

38
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:24,703
She could be your family.

39
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:27,902
Or...

40
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,901
Do you want to start over...

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,660
With someone else?

42
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,539
Because if you need to do that,
then I want you to.

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Okay?

44
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,778
It costs me saying that.

45
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:54,018
But we've been to hell
and back enough times now

46
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:56,497
to know that the truth
has to be faced eventually.

47
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,616
It's your life too, Jack,
you deserve to be happy.

48
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,856
You can't stay with me
just because you promised to.

49
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:10,856
I don't want that.

50
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,494
That's not love.

51
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,015
Love has to be selfish.

52
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,294
And if it's not, then...

53
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,654
It's something else entirely.

54
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:32,532
All I ever wanted was
just a family with you.

55
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:37,892
That's all.

56
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,810
Oh shit.

57
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,209
Are you okay?

58
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:53,529
Can you hear me?

59
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:55,889
Yeah.

60
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,887
It sounds as if you have a wife

61
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:13,806
she could be your family.

62
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:17,446
Or...

63
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,326
Or I start again, with someone
else.

64
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,394
Jack.

65
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,754
Jack.

66
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,593
Jack. Jack.

67
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:47,952
What the hell are you doing?

68
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,233
- You can't go in there.
- Is she's bleeding?

69
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:51,727
- Does she need an ambulance?
- She'll hurt you.

70
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,151
She hates you, Jen.

71
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:54,672
She doesn't.

72
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,848
Do you really think
I'd do something like that

73
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:58,270
unless I absolutely had to.

74
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:00,591
Do you, Jen?

75
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,509
Why did you bring her here?

76
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,470
She wanted to see her daughter.

77
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,309
- See her, to just see her?
- Yeah.

78
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:12,708
Is that what she told you?

79
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,804
No, okay, she was gonna take
her Jack,

80
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:19,307
but she promised, she
promised me.

81
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,308
It's what she does, she lies
all the time.

82
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:24,267
If she takes Emily now,

83
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,946
I'll never see my daughter
again, do you understand?

84
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,787
Now I need you to take Emily
somewhere safe, all right,

85
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,547
somewhere she can't get to her.

86
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,825
Jack.

87
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,264
What are you gonna do?

88
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,184
Make her an offer.

89
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,425
Money?

90
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:48,504
She's not gonna take money.

91
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:51,183
She already has, Jen.

92
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:55,942
I paid off her debt,
I moved her into the house,

93
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,343
I married her.

94
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:00,542
And now she's weaponizing Emily
and...

95
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,782
So what, you've been giving her
money?

96
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,620
And now what,
you're just gonna pay her off?

97
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,180
And what if she won't go?

98
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
She'll go.

99
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:51,374
What the hell happened, Jack?

100
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:00,534
Where is she?

101
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:04,732
Jack, where's Tasha?

102
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,773
I don't know,
I don't know where she is.

103
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,332
She hit me and she ran, all
right.

104
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,051
What did you do?

105
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:18,930
What did I do?

106
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:23,049
What exactly do you think I
did, huh?

107
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:27,489
She hit me and she ran

108
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,649
and pushed me in
a six foot concrete hole, Jen.

109
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:32,209
And you're asking if she's okay.

110
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:33,488
Jesus f...

111
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:38,007
I don't think you understand
what happened.

112
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:42,886
She did this and she left me
for dead, all right.

113
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:46,582
Well then, you have to call the
police.

114
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:48,967
You have to call them.

115
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:51,846
No, no.

116
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,405
Fine, then I will.

117
00:08:56,965 --> 00:09:00,124
No, Jen she'll twist this.

118
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,965
She'll twist it and then it'll
be her word

119
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:05,564
and even... even you don't
believe me.

120
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:11,043
So we have to leave first thing
in the morning, all right.

121
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:15,122
I'm sorry, but I have got
myself involved

122
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:17,682
yeah. This is your wife
you're talking about.

123
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,401
I'm well aware of that
and that's why we have to go.

124
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:21,761
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,441
You and me, go where?

126
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,161
It's always been about you and
me.

127
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,518
I don't understand.

128
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:43,878
I wanted this.

129
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,517
This is what I want.

130
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,877
I want you.

131
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,116
Tell me you want me too.

132
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:00,395
I want you.

133
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:45,430
New contract's in Toronto,

134
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,868
what if Tasha goes to the
police?

135
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,429
She left me for dead, Jen,
she's not going to the police.

136
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:56,068
So if we go to Toronto,

137
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:00,346
custody stays with me,

138
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:05,067
okay, you get us on a flight
tomorrow night.

139
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,705
Right?

140
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:10,985
And then once we're there, the
new company

141
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:13,464
the accommodation,

142
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:16,185
our feet?

143
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:19,905
Yeah.

144
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:22,664
I mean, you've had time
to think about this, but...

145
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:25,264
I just can't help
but think that this is.

146
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:28,303
Reactive.

147
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:31,222
Yes.

148
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:35,621
It is.

149
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:44,100
Look, I don't want to stay here
and fight this out.

150
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,860
I don't want to put Emily
through that.

151
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,619
Tasha's made it perfectly clear

152
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,099
that she will stop at nothing
until she gets what she wants.

153
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,498
I need you with me.

154
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:02,938
I do, I need you.

155
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,818
You kept my name.

156
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:11,696
So tomorrow night,

157
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,336
to their new life.

158
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:15,936
We pretend she's mine.

159
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:23,775
And Tasha?

160
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:27,055
And throws herself from one
thing

161
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:35,014
So you never even loved her?

162
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,692
Your marriage, it was all
just...

163
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,068
I mean, how could you have been
so sure

164
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:45,571
that I would still be here
at the end of all of...?

165
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,812
Why do you think I kept you so
close?

166
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,409
I love you so much.

167
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,447
Right.

168
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:16,887
I'll be back tonight.

169
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:19,366
I need to get everything sorted.

170
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:28,365
Oh... hi.

171
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,354
Tasha, what the fuck, are you
all right?

172
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,995
I'm fine.

173
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:45,194
God no, it's just a cut.
I'm fine, I'm not in pain.

174
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,353
Okay well, we need to
at least go back to mine.

175
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,713
I need to go back to winsford.

176
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:49,874
- I left.
- No, no.

177
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,250
Listen, we're not going back to
winsford.

178
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:54,352
This is fucked up, look what
he's done to your neck.

179
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:57,952
It doesn't matter. If he's
alive, I'm never

180
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,792
he'll find a way,
and if he's dead...

181
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,152
Just... just get in the car.

182
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:24,629
We need to find Emily.

183
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:51,025
So he's not at home or at Jen's.

184
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:52,920
Have you had any luck finding
anything?

185
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,823
I've called all the hospitals.

186
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:59,264
- Yeah, and...?
- Nothing.

187
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:03,223
So now what?

188
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:13,661
If he hasn't reported me,
he's up to something else.

189
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,540
We have to find her soon, or...

190
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Or what?

191
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:23,659
What can we do?

192
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:35,537
Jen...

193
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:40,738
You told me we can't
change the way things are

194
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,377
through sheer willpower...

195
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,977
But it's not true.

196
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,857
I don't know where Emily
and Jack are,

197
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:51,776
but you do

198
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,016
you have that choice.

199
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:16,612
He was manipulating everything.

200
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:18,611
I hope you can see that.

201
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,851
So please do the right thing
and bring her back to me.

202
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,330
I need my baby.

203
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,290
And I promise you,
when you do, I'll be gone.

204
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:33,569
I'll be packed and ready to
disappear

205
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,164
Oh my god.

206
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:23,122
So please do the right thing

207
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:24,923
I need my baby.

208
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:28,162
And I promise you, when you do

209
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:31,482
I'll be packed and ready to
disappear

210
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:39,879
So when were you gonna tell me?

211
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
- Never?
- Oh.

212
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,399
You're a piece of shit, I
trusted you.

213
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:50,278
- Out of everyone, you do this.
- It wasn't like that.

214
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:53,758
You showed up after two years
because you had this idea.

215
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:56,198
- You pretended to help me.
- No, no, I came back for you.

216
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:57,998
Bullshit, you came back for her.

217
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,158
You snuck into my house,
you followed my husband.

218
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:03,876
You spent time with my daughter
and then you stood back

219
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,956
and watched the whole thing
fall apart.

220
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,035
What do you want from me?

221
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,555
You wanted to be a dad?

222
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:15,074
Is that all I am to all of you,
a fucking uterus?

223
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,354
What? No.

224
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,793
No, I just, I needed to know.

225
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:23,954
I told you, Sam.

226
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:27,352
I told you she was Jack's.

227
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,592
The dates don't line up.

228
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:32,673
You thought I'd lied?

229
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,232
You know what?

230
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:42,431
I've had enough of this shit.

231
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,631
No, no, no, look, look,
look, look, look, look...

232
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,589
Look, I made a mistake all
right.

233
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:51,509
I'm here for you.

234
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,108
Look, you know how I feel about
you

235
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,268
and you never say anything
about it

236
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:02,347
because if you acknowledged it,
you'd have to do something.

237
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,027
Sam, you have a pick up.

238
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:06,908
All right, look, I've got...

239
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:10,026
I'm on a night shift.

240
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,042
I'm gonna be back at
7:00 A.M. in the morning

241
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,866
and we're gonna sort this out,
all right.

242
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:14,947
I promise.

243
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:17,706
I fucked up.

244
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,501
Why do you think
I kept you so close?

245
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:48,341
It's always been about you and
me.

246
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,780
- Hey you.
- Hi, just returning your call.

247
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,740
Look, I know it's late.

248
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,779
I'm pretty concerned about
this christening situation.

249
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:05,619
Why don't you come over
tomorrow?

250
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,018
Bring wine.

251
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,817
Oh, I haven't had this in ages.

252
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,618
So fancy, thank you.
Thank you so much.

253
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,697
This is what I want.

254
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,137
I want you.

255
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:23,137
Hi, it's me.

256
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,216
Sorry, I know you're at work.

257
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:28,896
I just need to get those old
tax boxes down from the loft.

258
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:31,574
Oh, well Tasha
should be in, is she not?

259
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,294
She's not answering.

260
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:35,494
Well you've got your old keys,

261
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:36,735
don't worry about it.

262
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:38,573
Are you sure?

263
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,773
Agh! What the hell are doing in
my kitchen?

264
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:44,814
- I think I'm gonna leave.
- Yeah, I think you should.

265
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,812
Tell me you want me too.

266
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:51,612
I want you.

267
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:54,307
You could pick her up
and have her..

268
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:57,412
An hour, no more than two,
I promise, no more.

269
00:21:57,491 --> 00:21:58,771
I've just got a couple of things

270
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,330
Jack, I don't think
I should be the one to...

271
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:04,970
Two hours, I promise.

272
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:06,225
They've got your picture
in their desk thing.

273
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:08,249
I love you.

274
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:13,048
What does she look like,

275
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:14,903
Oh fuck.

276
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
Fuck.

277
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:41,778
Hey, sorry, I know this is crazy

278
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,537
and I just need to,

279
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:46,017
- oh okay.
- Yeah?

280
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:47,098
Yeah, yeah.

281
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:23,972
Agh! How do you turn your
fucking Bluetooth off?

282
00:26:24,052 --> 00:26:25,068
I know where you're going.

283
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:27,811
Don't do it Tash, don't meet
them.

284
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:30,011
You don't know anything.

285
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:32,810
I'm 15 minutes away.

286
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:35,970
Heathrow terminal 2, right?

287
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:39,330
Yeah, look I'm on my way.

288
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,729
I need you to wait for me.

289
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,449
No, you don't get to do this,
Sam.

290
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:46,569
No, no, no.

291
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:49,968
This isn't about, I don't
want you to forgive me or...

292
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:51,488
For what I did.

293
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,207
You cannot go back to him again.

294
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:56,408
It's not safe.

295
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,167
I gotta go. I gotta go.
I think I see them.

296
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,246
No.

297
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:05,638
Jack.

298
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:15,755
Jack, Jack, Jack.

299
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,195
- Jack.
- Oh shit.

300
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:52,750
Grab his leg.

301
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:11,668
Emergency responders

302
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:14,148
at the scene of a crash on the
a4,

303
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:15,587
two miles east of Heathrow
airport.

304
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:18,827
Eyewitness reports suggest a
lorry

305
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,466
carrying flammable
liquids burst into flames

306
00:29:21,547 --> 00:29:23,346
when an SUV traveling west,

307
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:27,386
drove across the central

308
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,225
colliding with the vehicle.

309
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:31,665
At least one man has lost his
life.

310
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:35,424
And five other people are

311
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:37,783
with at least two people
still unaccounted for.

312
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:39,544
They're setting her now.

313
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:45,182
I'm looking for my... child,
baby.

314
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,823
Brown hair, brown eyes, Emily.

315
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:49,742
Okay, whereabout did you lose
her?

316
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:53,862
She was in the car, in the
car with me.

317
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:55,421
Yes, she was in the car.

318
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,221
Did somebody pull her out?

319
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:00,541
I can't even see the car
anymore,

320
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:03,821
- okay, well, which car?
- The SUV, it's black.

321
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,779
Okay. This is Sierra 47.

322
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,419
Anyone got guys in an SUV,
color black, on site?

323
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,419
Okay madam, let's find you
somewhere to sit down.

324
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:12,458
No, no, no, no, no.

325
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,293
Mrs. Warrington.

326
00:30:58,053 --> 00:30:59,411
No!

327
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:01,411
Mrs. Warrington.

328
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:06,571
We know you're in shock...

329
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,730
And I understand
this is incredibly painful.

330
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,530
But as you know, we are looking
into

331
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,969
how this could have happened

332
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,529
we also need to know
how the incident began.

333
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:25,649
Your husband and

334
00:31:25,728 --> 00:31:28,687
when they were pulled from the
vehicle,

335
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:33,966
no one knew to look for a car
seat.

336
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:38,246
The chemical fire burnt
at a thousand degrees.

337
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:41,646
As with the poor lorry driver
who died,

338
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:45,886
there was very little
anyone could have done.

339
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:53,805
Due to the severity of the fire,

340
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:58,403
however, enough evidence of
Emily's DNA

341
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,723
was found on the car seat
and within the vehicle

342
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:03,762
to confirm that

343
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:14,801
So we have Natasha warrington

344
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:16,200
dangerous driving.

345
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:19,881
Paramedics found contusions on
her neck,

346
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,959
they say wasn't caused by the
incident.

347
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,399
Your ex-husband, Jack warrington

348
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,880
as you previously suggested.

349
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,958
You see, we have a written
statement

350
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,079
from one of the motorists

351
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:35,798
but our records show

352
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,157
Natasha warrington wasn't
responsible

353
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:58,394
We've been gradually lifting

354
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,635
in order to give the swelling
a chance to dissipate.

355
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:06,634
But at this stage, we'd hoped
for that

356
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:11,232
we really are at the mercy

357
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:14,992
he could regain consciousness
within the next few days,

358
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:16,951
which we have every hope of
happening.

359
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:22,032
But if not, then we'll have to
start

360
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,744
All mighty god, the
father, the son

361
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,585
come down on you

362
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:12,383
Amen.

363
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:22,463
You're here.

364
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:24,822
Of course you are,
of course she'd bring you.

365
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:26,261
He might not wake up.

366
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:30,502
Do you know that?

367
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:34,381
You might have got to her
somehow

368
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:36,421
- but we all know you did it.
- Hayley, come on.

369
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:40,259
You did this. You killed her

370
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:43,259
but that's what you wanted
all along, isn't it?

371
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,460
You fucking bitch.

372
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:47,818
Okay, Hayley,
that's enough all right.

373
00:35:01,377 --> 00:35:03,417
Tasha.

374
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,376
Come on,

375
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:10,815
I just wanna talk to her.

376
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,375
I just need to speak to her.

377
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:15,854
If I hadn't have texted her,

378
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:18,575
if I hadn't have gotten
involved...

379
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:35,331
She won't accept my calls,

380
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:36,932
you gotta give her some time.

381
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,452
Okay.

382
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:28,938
Sam, something's happened,
I need you to listen to me.

383
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:37,656
Tasha, what are you doing?

384
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:39,016
- Come on.
- This never happened.

385
00:39:40,615 --> 00:39:42,095
I'm trusting you.

386
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,454
Don't go too far.

387
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:10,532
Thank you for trusting me.

388
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,650
Seeing past what you thought I
was.

389
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:22,129
Look, I'm sorry that you got
dragged into all of this...

390
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,010
Our mess.

391
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:30,009
Something good came out of it
though.

392
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:32,648
You have Emily.

393
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:35,928
It did.

394
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,006
It's not your fault, Jen.

395
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:54,406
You know that, right?

396
00:40:55,526 --> 00:40:58,045
You weren't responsible for him.

397
00:40:59,565 --> 00:41:01,084
And everything I've done,

398
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:03,204
the lies I've told,

399
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:05,683
it's not okay.

400
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:09,083
But I had to be sure.

401
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,202
He would've found a way to
blame me.

402
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:14,642
I just...

403
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,482
I wish I'd seen the truth
sooner.

404
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,920
We're sold a lie from birth,

405
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,158
the idea that there are
good people and bad people,

406
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:39,399
but there aren't.

407
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:42,598
We all think we're good people.

408
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:47,358
We all... have the best of
intentions.

409
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:53,357
You know, I have no doubt
that in his mind,

410
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:56,196
he did it for love.

411
00:41:57,357 --> 00:42:01,476
He did it for us, for me.

412
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:05,234
Some misplaced sense of...

413
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:07,835
What that might look like.

414
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:16,354
Love can justify almost anything

415
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:19,833
it makes us all do terrible
things.

416
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:56,587
Oh there she is.
