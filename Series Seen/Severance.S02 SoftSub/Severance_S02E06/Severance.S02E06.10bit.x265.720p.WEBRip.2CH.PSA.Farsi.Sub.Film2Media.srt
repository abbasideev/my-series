1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:13,514
There was this gray hall, but then...

2
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:19,394
everything was, like, so white.

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,940
We're making progress.

4
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,733
It's not just waking up on a table.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,611
It's human interaction.

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,364
This didn't feel human,
this felt like a nightmare.

7
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,368
I mean, why is she
rattling off a bunch of facts?

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,204
What are they doing to her?

9
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,832
All I know is she's essential.

10
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,922
She didn't even recognize me.

11
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,845
The Gemma you know is still in there.

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,684
And when you get her out, it will be
the two of you out here together.

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,574
Bargaining.

14
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,034
You know what that is?

15
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,161
What do you mean?

16
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,332
Well, it's one of the stages.

17
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,921
You think about all the things you'd do,

18
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:34,970
and all the ways you'd change
to get that person back.

19
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:43,228
You'd drink less. You'd listen more.

20
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,901
It's dumb, but you do it anyway.

21
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,027
It's normal.

22
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,112
Yeah.

23
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,242
But for me, it might actually happen.

24
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,418
<i>It was a sketch of a black hallway,</i>

25
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,880
with a black elevator that only goes down.

26
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,135
So there's a floor beneath us.

27
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,845
That must be where they're keeping her.

28
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,890
There were directions on the back.

29
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,642
Well, let's see it.

30
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,229
I left it there, behind the poster.

31
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,064
Why didn't you just take it?

32
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,649
I just didn't, okay?

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,192
I don't wanna get in trouble right now.

34
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,402
Okay. Well, I don't give a shit
about that, so I'll go get it.

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,571
You said it's behind the poster
of you actually being brave?

36
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,615
Okay, yeah. Fuck you.
You don't know everything.

37
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,992
Then tell us.

38
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,162
It's okay.

39
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,382
Okay. Well, I still have a hall pass,
so I can go to the break room now,

40
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,259
- and then we can start after lunch.
- Yeah. Maybe.

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,468
Maybe?

42
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,929
Did everyone sever their balls
in the elevator this morning?

43
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,306
I'm starving.

44
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,999
Mark?

45
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,668
Are you okay?

46
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,304
Sir?

47
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,808
Have a seat.

48
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,609
I had my performance review yesterday.

49
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,947
How did it go?

50
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,168
Many valid concerns were raised,
which I look forward to addressing.

51
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,045
I'm glad for you.

52
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,056
I feel I should remind you,

53
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,141
you cannot graduate from this fellowship

54
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,270
until I have deemed you
Wintertide material.

55
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:02,821
This will mean using your time well,
focusing on your own duties,

56
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,825
and eradicating
from your essence childish folly.

57
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,165
I understand, sir.

58
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,794
I shall be busy for the rest of the day.

59
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,256
I trust you can steward
the floor in my stead?

60
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,592
- Of course.
- Good.

61
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,845
You may sit at your regular desk.

62
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,144
Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

63
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,118
- <i>He threatened you?</i>
- <i>As I was leaving.</i>

64
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,286
In the elevator.

65
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,996
They're trying to intimidate us.

66
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,748
- Divide us.
- And also--

67
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,375
It's so that we won't work together,

68
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,919
because they know what will happen
if we do. I'm gonna go get that map.

69
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,672
Helly, we shared vessels.

70
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,216
What's that?

71
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,512
Well, we...

72
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,476
we had sex.

73
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,771
Okay.

74
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:24,945
You and... Like, in a Wellness session?

75
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,906
No. Not... Ms. Casey.

76
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,703
It was at the retreat.

77
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,832
In your tent.

78
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,088
Yeah.

79
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,053
You mean...

80
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,893
I mean, obviously, you know,
I thought it was you.

81
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,440
'Cause, you know,
I've been having those feelings since,

82
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,734
like, before the OTC.

83
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:09,239
So when she... I just... I had no idea, okay?

84
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,492
- Uh-huh.
- I'm sorry, Helly.

85
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
I... She tricked me.

86
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,829
I mean, I... you know, wanted to, but she...

87
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,875
she tricked both of us.

88
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,050
It's probably another tactic.

89
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,260
Something to drive a wedge between us.

90
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,845
- Like--
- Helly--

91
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,640
I'm gonna go for a walk.

92
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,729
Helly, I'm sorry. I thought it was you.

93
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,688
But it wasn't me.

94
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,734
Yeah, I'm just gonna go walk around.

95
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,480
First date, let me guess.

96
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,608
- Scuba.
- Thai food.

97
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,692
Nice.

98
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,028
Though you did take
scuba lessons last year.

99
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,322
Yeah? Which sea?

100
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,823
It was in a pool.

101
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,868
Okay. Cool.

102
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,120
It was a little expensive.

103
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,999
You've had a lot of phases.

104
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,002
Scuba diving, woodworking.

105
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,213
Wow. So, my outie's really diverse.

106
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,132
Garage beer-making.

107
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:40,933
Maybe I'm trying to find something
I excel in up there, like I do down here.

108
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,105
I sometimes wonder
if you're just not happy.

109
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,526
I'm sure it's not that.

110
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:57,574
'Cause, like, you know... I mean,
here, with you, I'm super happy.

111
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,702
I just, like, wanna hear
about all my offspring

112
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,289
and stare at your face.

113
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,128
- Sorry. That was weird.
- No.

114
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,798
It was really sweet.

115
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,342
I like it.

116
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,886
I like this.

117
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,558
I wish we could really be together.

118
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,520
Like, all the time.

119
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,107
I mean, we are.

120
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,901
Aren't we?

121
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,613
You and him are.

122
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,616
But I'm not.

123
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,882
Is it okay if we try the hug again?

124
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,593
I kind of like the hugging.

125
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,793
Oh, hey. I was coming to find you.

126
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,171
Same.

127
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,799
Look, I am so sorry.

128
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,302
I can't even imagine
what it must be like to--

129
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,721
You thought it was me.

130
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,472
Hundred percent.

131
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,016
Which means you wanted to.

132
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,351
With me.

133
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,105
Yeah.

134
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,318
What sucks is that she got
to have that, and I didn't.

135
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,364
That she used me to trick my friends.

136
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,867
Used my body to get close to you.

137
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,662
That she dresses me in
the morning like I'm a baby.

138
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,165
That she controls me,
and this company, and all of us.

139
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,542
It's disgusting.

140
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:55,144
Hey, do you want me to,
like, describe what happened?

141
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,771
Like, I feel like you
have every right to know.

142
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,565
No. I don't want her memory.

143
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,400
Okay.

144
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,197
I want my own.

145
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,664
Would you like that?

146
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,128
Yeah, I'd like that.

147
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,053
But how?

148
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,730
A tent.

149
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:49,801
I'm nervous.

150
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,429
Me too.

151
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,598
- You too.
- It's okay.

152
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,767
Okay.

153
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,565
Wait.

154
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,582
Yes?

155
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,960
Yes.

156
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:34,675
You must eradicate from
your essence childish folly.

157
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:44,059
You must eradicate from
yourself childish folly.

158
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,367
You must abandon childish things.

159
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,414
You must grow up.

160
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,085
You must grow up.

161
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,379
Grow up.

162
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,798
Grow up.

163
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,218
Grow up.

164
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,638
Grow.

165
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,599
Grow.

166
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,851
Grow.

167
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,520
Grow.

168
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,191
Grow.

169
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,258
Was it different with me?

170
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,356
Oh, no, you're bleeding.

171
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,194
No, you are.

172
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,410
You have two minutes left.

173
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:31,083
Humidity on the severed floor
is maintained at a consistent 45%.

174
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,794
It must be something else.

175
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,214
Did you punch him?

176
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,842
I mean, not today.

177
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,637
What were you doing
when the nosebleed occurred?

178
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,642
We were refining something.

179
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,812
Do you have a deviated septum?

180
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,565
Well, I don't know what that is.

181
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,568
Would you like me to put
petroleum jelly in your nostrils?

182
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,152
No, thanks.

183
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,238
Any other symptoms?

184
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,950
Any auras or hallucinations?

185
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,414
No. I think it stopped. I feel better.

186
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,501
I'm going to take your blood pressure.

187
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,009
<i>Where are you?</i>

188
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,345
I'm at Lumon.

189
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,143
- What?
- What?

190
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,734
- Fuck. I was just--
- <i>Mark?</i>

191
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,904
Wha--

192
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,946
Were you just at Lumon?

193
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,781
What time is it?

194
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,867
Are you at Lumon
or in your basement with me?

195
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,161
I don't know.

196
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,412
Do you remember a hallway?

197
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,496
A black hallway?

198
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:57,960
I remember... Okay.

199
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,505
I remember a desk.

200
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:04,008
I remember a desk.

201
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:09,598
I remember... Shit.

202
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,478
That was another crossover memory.

203
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,313
A recent one. That's good.

204
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,191
You'll feel gaps in time
until it all comes back together.

205
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,777
Well, when the fuck is that gonna happen?

206
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,033
We need to enhance. Speed up the process.

207
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,410
Is that safe?

208
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,830
There's a slight chance of hemorrhage.

209
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,084
Okay. So, me bleeding to death.

210
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,546
Not necessarily.

211
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,424
We'll flood the chip itself.

212
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,051
Flood the chip?

213
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,887
- Through the hole in your head.
- Jesus Christ.

214
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,556
- That you've already got.
- Okay--

215
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,890
You know what?

216
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,642
Get the fuck off me.

217
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,686
- I am not doing this, okay?
- We're close. It's happening.

218
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,896
- Get this shit off right now! Please.
- We need to push!

219
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,398
Get it off--

220
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,942
God. I'm fu... I'm starving.

221
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,610
That's also from reintegration.

222
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,196
Okay, you know what?

223
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,532
I'm gonna go eat.

224
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,037
Fuck.

225
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,244
Hello.

226
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,123
Who the hell are you?

227
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,085
It's a joke.

228
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,880
- Come on in. Hey.
- Okay.

229
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,466
What the heck?

230
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,763
Fields is tending the ham.

231
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,016
I hope you like a cumin glaze.

232
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,184
Yes, of course.

233
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,144
- Do you not?
- No, I do.

234
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,312
Attila.

235
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,855
Yes, Attila?

236
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,899
Did you just ask about the glaze?

237
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,902
- I did.
- Well, don't.

238
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,820
I've already put it on.

239
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,281
I was gonna say we also have corn.

240
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,325
Oh, yes.

241
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:37,371
We could feed him a pile of loose corn.

242
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:45,420
What your innie ever saw
in this Philistine

243
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,090
is beyond me.

244
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,676
Fields, I presume.

245
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:52,802
Yes.

246
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,179
- Irving.
- Irving.

247
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,721
Yes.

248
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,598
Welcome back to our home.

249
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,519
Yes. I'm sorry about the last time.

250
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,148
I'm sure that felt quite invasive.

251
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,484
Nonsense.

252
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,945
What's mine's yours.

253
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,866
And you've brought wine.

254
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:22,248
Irving, no one's ever thrown blood
on you on your way into work?

255
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,168
- No.
- It wasn't blood. It was paint.

256
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,752
Meant to evoke blood.

257
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:27,879
Not what you said.

258
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,049
The Whole Mind people
are off the deep end, is my point.

259
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,220
And, Burt, how did
you come to be at the company?

260
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,432
- Me?
- Yes, I'm very curious.

261
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:43,979
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was guided to Lumon's door by Jesus.

262
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,444
Jesus Christ?

263
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,905
That's the one.

264
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,159
You should just leave it at that, and
let him wonder what the hell you meant.

265
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,955
No, we'd been attending
the Lutheran church for some years.

266
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:06,918
And I should mention that I'd been
what you might call a scoundrel

267
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,669
in my younger days.

268
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,422
To put it mildly.

269
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:14,926
So, one Sunday at breakfast,
Fields asked me point blank,

270
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,720
do I think I'm going to heaven?

271
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,599
As one asks at breakfast.

272
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:27,396
I pretend to think about it,
but I know the answer is no.

273
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:32,528
To which I replied, "What am I supposed to
do up there for eternity all by myself?"

274
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:36,489
- I see.
- So we hop on the train to church,

275
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,034
and it so happens the sermon that day
is about severance...

276
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,079
- Yeah.
- ...which was still very new at the time.

277
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,664
And the pastor says--

278
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:48,210
As if he'd been listening
to our conversation,

279
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,840
he said the church's stance
is that innies are, you know,

280
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:59,137
complete individuals, with souls...

281
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:05,227
that can be judged
separately from their outie.

282
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,148
So, an innie can go to heaven.

283
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,235
Whilst the outie burns.

284
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,240
We're not zealots, I swear.

285
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:22,451
But we figured that if it were true,

286
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,748
it may be a way for part of Burt to--

287
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,085
You know...

288
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:35,966
Wow.

289
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:41,263
- He's looking for the exit.
- No, it's just--

290
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:48,144
So, the hope was for Burt's
innie to go to heaven.

291
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:51,565
Yes. With me.

292
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,901
Gretch, it's the end of the month.

293
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:40,321
Those salesmen are just dying to hit
their numbers and get cars off the lot.

294
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,449
They'll basically be giving me money.

295
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,121
Okay. Fine.

296
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,957
Just test drive only.

297
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,084
I won't commit to anything.

298
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:58,131
- Thank you.
- No.

299
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,677
You didn't tell me how'd it go.
You went back to Lumon, right?

300
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:06,598
No.

301
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:08,767
That good?

302
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:12,813
They canceled it.

303
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,566
I didn't see him... you.

304
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,150
- Happy plate.
- Happy plate.

305
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,027
Go play with your sister.

306
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,738
Canceled it? What happened?

307
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:25,993
They didn't say. Guess you got too busy.

308
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:33,000
- Hey. Buddy. Try it. No. Okay.
- No.

309
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,113
Thank you.

310
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:48,033
Mark Scout.

311
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:52,870
Thought that was you.
I'm Helena Eagan. I work at Lumon.

312
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,415
Yeah. No, I know who you are.

313
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,504
Well, it's nice to officially meet you.

314
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,305
Have you had enough to eat?

315
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,601
Yeah, quite possibly.

316
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,229
I hope they're feeding you at work.

317
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,314
May I?

318
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,651
Please.

319
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,032
It's really great to run into you.

320
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,535
I've heard nothing but good things
about your work, by the way.

321
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,622
Thank you. I've heard nothing at all
about my work, so...

322
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,000
Severance humor. That's so clever.

323
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,252
And so easy.

324
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:49,136
Look, I'm sorry for the systemic error
from the other night.

325
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,095
The systemic error?

326
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:54,266
You mean the overtime thing?

327
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:57,144
Yes. The OTC.

328
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,901
It never should have happened,
and it never will again.

329
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:10,489
We take pride as a company to be better
than that, and we will be better.

330
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,243
- Well, that's nice to hear. Thanks.
- Of course.

331
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,584
So, you know all about it then.

332
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,961
Yes, I know all about it.

333
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,174
I'm, like, the head of the company, Mark.

334
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,970
Right. Dumb. Sorry.

335
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,138
Yeah, you should be sorry.

336
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,390
- Really? Okay.
- I'm kidding.

337
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,226
You're clearly not dumb.

338
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,936
I don't know. You...

339
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,813
You're the one who invented
a revolutionary medical procedure.

340
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,732
Hey, now, that was not me.

341
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,816
That was my father.

342
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,902
Uh-huh.

343
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,239
You should meet him sometime.

344
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,074
Your father?

345
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,158
Sure. Why not?

346
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,245
You wanna take me home to Dad already?

347
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,579
Yeah, I think it's finally time.

348
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,624
Okay. Sure. Let's do it.

349
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,293
You'd be the first.

350
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:07,422
- So, no pressure.
- Yeah. None whatsoever.

351
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,430
But seriously, I'd love to hear
about your experiences sometime.

352
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,016
Okay. Yeah.

353
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:20,475
About severance?

354
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:24,731
I meant the overtime con...
I meant the other night.

355
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:30,528
I mean, I can't imagine how confusing
that must have been.

356
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,989
Traumatic, even.

357
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:38,495
And I know you've already been through
so much with losing your wife and all.

358
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,748
Hanna.

359
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,295
Gemma.

360
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:52,092
Right. Gemma. Sorry.

361
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,346
It was a car accident, right?

362
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,891
That's right.

363
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,394
Yeah, such a shame.

364
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,981
She was so young.

365
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:12,529
Thank you.

366
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,541
Are you all right?

367
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,835
I'm fine. I'm just about finished here.

368
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,546
Okay. Right.

369
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,469
Well, it was nice to meet you, Helena.

370
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:38,055
Yeah. You too, Mark.

371
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:53,278
What is it?

372
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,407
Nothing.

373
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,080
Good night.

374
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,613
We used to call each other hon,

375
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:22,617
then about ten years ago
that became Attila.

376
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,661
Because... Do you know history?

377
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,498
- Yeah.
- He knows history.

378
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,960
And it wasn't ten years ago. It was 20.

379
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,713
- No.
- Yes!

380
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:42,637
Because I remember we were having drinks
with your Lumon partner.

381
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:44,223
Quite startled him.

382
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:51,938
Didn't the first severed office
open 12 years ago?

383
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,649
- Yes, it did.
- Yeah.

384
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:57,903
Maybe that's enough of that.

385
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,462
You know the corn is very special.

386
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:18,256
Do you think you two
ever made love at work?

387
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,050
Fields, Jesus.

388
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,805
Can we not just be
pragmatic adults about this?

389
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,856
There is a nonzero chance that
the two of you had unprotected sex.

390
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:38,527
And so, I felt the right to ask.

391
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:46,451
Are you done humiliating our guest?

392
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,872
Sounds like I'm mad, but I'm not.

393
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,749
Cards on the table.

394
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,335
I've been talking to
Pastor Gale about this,

395
00:38:56,336 --> 00:39:03,010
and I believe that
innies deserve to experience love.

396
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,891
I mean it.

397
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,188
And I hope it was beautiful.

398
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,291
Sorry for being a dick.

399
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,460
Let's do it.

400
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,670
Tonight.

401
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,432
There.

402
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,602
How long will it take?

403
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:43,188
It'll be fast.

404
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,732
Fast. How fast?

405
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,620
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

406
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,456
<i>Yes.</i>

407
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:17,138
What the fuck?

408
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:20,224
Don't move like that.

409
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,269
You have to keep your head still.

410
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,442
Ignore it.

411
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,319
Tell me--

412
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,364
Mark?

413
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,783
My car's in the driveway.
She knows I'm here.

414
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:38,702
No...

415
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,585
- Mark.
- Yeah?

416
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:51,839
Hey.

417
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,133
Dude, I left you, like, five messages.
Are you better?

418
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,010
No, I'm still sick.

419
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:59,138
Well, you can't not pick up when
we're doing corporate espionage shit.

420
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,681
The floodlight thing was a bust, right?

421
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:03,142
Because I have had an idea
that is a little dumber.

422
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:04,227
Okay, Devon...

423
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:05,770
Do you remember
the rich lady from baby camp?

424
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,606
The one I, like, kind of had a crush on?

425
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:10,066
- I was thinking--
- Yeah. Look,

426
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,444
I'm already trying something else.

427
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,532
Okay. What are you trying?

428
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:20,660
Just don't worry about it.

429
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,413
- What the fuck does that mean?
- I'm doing it myself.

430
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,249
Fuck that.

431
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,001
Why are you trying to cut me out of this?

432
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,462
Shit.

433
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:33,339
I'm really not, Devon.

434
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,299
- You literally are.
- Okay, fine.

435
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,177
I am, but I didn't ask for your help!

436
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,470
Fuck you, officially.

437
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,807
And what is that smell?

438
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:44,476
What smell?

439
00:44:51,472 --> 00:44:56,228

440
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:06,540
Oh, my God.

441
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,087
Mark.

442
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,255
Don't touch him.

443
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:15,841
Who the fuck are you?

444
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:17,718
Mark?

445
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:21,554
It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

446
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:22,848
It's okay.

447
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:31,814
Thank you for the spare ham.

448
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:33,399
Is Fields...

449
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,278
He's fine. He'll be embarrassed tomorrow.

450
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:39,280
You know, he gets fuzzy.

451
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,324
Like saying I worked
at Lumon 20 years ago,

452
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,911
which is, of course,
before severance even existed.

453
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:45,996
Of course.

454
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:53,503
- Sorry.
- No, this was fun.

455
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,129
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

456
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,091
So, we should do it again sometime.

457
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,802
You, me, Fields? Or you, me?

458
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,013
No, I meant with Fields.

459
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:06,099
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

460
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:13,440
Yeah. But, you know, it's either way.

461
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,402
Good.

462
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,577
- Good night, Burt.
- Good night.
