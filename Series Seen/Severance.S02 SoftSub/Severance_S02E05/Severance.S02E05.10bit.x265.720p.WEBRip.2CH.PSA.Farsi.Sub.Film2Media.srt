1
00:00:57,928 --> 00:00:59,054
Do you have them?

2
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:17,114
Thank you.

3
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,859
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

4
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,153
<i>How was the weekend thing?</i>

5
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:03,029
Good, I guess.

6
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,948
Although my innie fell off a rope, apparently.

7
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,034
<i>A rope?</i>

8
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,035
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

9
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:11,370
No, I just got a little wet, that's all.

10
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:13,581
<i>Jesus, it's like it never ends
with these guys.</i>

11
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,541
<i>Do you know what the fuck
actually happened?</i>

12
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,793
I have no idea.

13
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:23,467
<i>Fuck. Well, how's the old "burning
shit into your eyeballs" thing going?</i>

14
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:28,471
I still can't get it to last long enough.

15
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:30,891
<i>Okay. So, what do we do?</i>

16
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:34,477
Just keep trying, I guess.

17
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,021
<i>Do you have any other ideas?</i>

18
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:42,527
Hey, I'm sorry. I gotta get to work.

19
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,821
- <i>All right. Bye.</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

20
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:48,492
- Hey.
- You need to get your dryer fixed.

21
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:52,703
Yeah. Or you could just,
like, not live here.

22
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:55,123
I can't keep coming in and out.

23
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,668
You think they're watching us?

24
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:00,337
Depends on how dumb you've played it.

25
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,340
Hey, when do we keep going?

26
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,634
Maybe tonight. I'll decide later.

27
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:09,179
'Cause I haven't remembered anything else.

28
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:12,599
Right. Well, maybe your innie has.

29
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:50,846
You took the rest of the weekend
to recover?

30
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:52,848
I'm fine.

31
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:56,059
Will I be updating Father later?

32
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,858
He should hear it from me.

33
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,074
We have decided to spare him knowledge
of this contretemps.

34
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:20,042
Well, please let him know
that his daughter is alive and well.

35
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:24,129
The medical team
says your tempers will rebalance quickly.

36
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,088
Good to hear.

37
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:31,053
Some residual trauma is to be expected
after such an ordeal.

38
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:35,474
Perhaps we could arrange
another obligement session this evening.

39
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,476
I said I'm fine.

40
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,978
We're close, Helena.

41
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:43,481
What's he at, 78%?

42
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:46,360
Eighty-one. As of Friday.

43
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,487
It won't be much longer.

44
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,280
You can do this.

45
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,077
I'm not going back down there.

46
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:59,122
It won't be you. It will be your innie.

47
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,751
My innie who tried to kill me?

48
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,630
And then the other one tried to kill me.

49
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:11,677
They're fucking animals.

50
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:19,725
I'll just fake it again.

51
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:21,270
We can't take that chance.

52
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,646
We need to clean this up.

53
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,526
Milchick's many errors this weekend
have forced our hand.

54
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:30,445
And Father approves?

55
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,241
Father encouraged it.

56
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:39,830
<i>It's a risk.</i>

57
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,582
<i>We know this.</i>

58
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,085
<i>But there is no other solution.</i>

59
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:48,672
<i>Mark S. won't work without her.</i>

60
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:52,342
And the work is mysterious and important.

61
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,554
So we must give him her.

62
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:03,896
<i>The Board appreciates your sacrifice.</i>

63
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,177
Good morning, Helly R.

64
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:38,722
Who the fuck are you?

65
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:45,729
I'm Miss Huang.

66
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,108
What the hell?

67
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:52,277
Please follow me.

68
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,738
Mr. Milchick will explain.

69
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:26,561
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:29,189
- Is she...
- Her innie.

71
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:32,150
MDR.

72
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:35,195
Together again.

73
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:36,947
Come on in.

74
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:39,824
I need to know what's going on.

75
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:40,908
Like, right now.

76
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:42,326
Where's Irving?

77
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:43,911
And why was he trying to drown me?

78
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,164
'Cause you're a fucking Eagan.

79
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:48,624
- Was she spying on us?
- Wait, what?

80
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,834
The whole time.

81
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,587
It's called a Glasgow block.

82
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,756
- It allows one's outie to--
- Wait.

83
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,634
Are you saying that she was down here?

84
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,135
As me?

85
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:00,469
Maybe she still is.

86
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,306
Hey, I repeat myself. Where is Irving?

87
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:05,349
- Yeah, where is he?
- I'm so confused.

88
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,185
Answer my question!

89
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,896
Excuse me.

90
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:21,200
Helena Eagan, in her executive capacity,
was conducting valuable research.

91
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:24,745
By stealing my fucking body?

92
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:29,500
Irving had no knowledge of what
management's intention was in this action,

93
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,712
and in so doing, he nearly drowned you.

94
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,635
Our only option was permanent dismissal.

95
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,432
So he is dead?

96
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:48,519
No.

97
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,439
Irving B's outie has departed
on an elongated cruise voyage.

98
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:57,277
I don't give three dry fucks
about his outie.

99
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:02,157
She doesn't have
the right to take my identity.

100
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,210
Have you ever heard the story
of the <i>Gråkappan</i>?

101
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,055
Let's assume we haven't.

102
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,897
In ancient times,
the king of Sweden himself

103
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:38,359
was known to go incognito
amongst his people

104
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,697
in the hopes of learning
their true grievances.

105
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:47,744
He would don an old, gray robe,
a <i>Gråkappan</i>,

106
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:50,914
the name for which he was remembered,

107
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:55,460
to disguise his royal vestments.

108
00:11:56,461 --> 00:12:00,464
Kier Eagan himself was known
to do so in his ether factories,

109
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:06,013
and Ms. Eagan
was carrying on this noble tradition.

110
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:13,187
This smells like horseshit.

111
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,900
Yeah. Swedish horseshit,
and Irving is still dead.

112
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:23,070
As I said, Irving B's outie
has departed on an elonga--

113
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:25,156
On an elongated cruise voyage.
Yeah, I know.

114
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:26,909
Is he gonna come back or not?

115
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:42,716
He is not.

116
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:48,388
Wow. Some actual honesty.

117
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,350
You fucking murderers.

118
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,102
You can't do this to people.

119
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,190
It will take time to absorb
all that has occurred.

120
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,278
This went well.

121
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,450
Allow me to escort you to MDR

122
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,704
and help reacclimate you
to your work environment.

123
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:34,059
What in the abominable fuck?

124
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:48,531
This is you.

125
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,617
Hell no. I'm not going near that thing.

126
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,912
Dylan, please.

127
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,543
If you're taking feedback, I hate it.

128
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:01,837
Same.

129
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:12,723
Well, the ORTBO was a challenge for us all
in ways expected and non.

130
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:22,649
You mean like Jame Eagan's daughter
<i>Gråkappanning</i> us?

131
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:28,696
Careful, Dylan. Words have consequences.

132
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:31,325
I'd hate to rescind certain privileges.

133
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,078
As you can see, all of your items

134
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,624
have been moved
to your new work tri-stations.

135
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,875
Hall passes will still be available.

136
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:42,336
Let us have a funeral.

137
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:44,630
I'm sorry?

138
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:48,132
Irving is a person, and he's gone.

139
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,218
So,

140
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,845
we'd like to have a funeral.

141
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:57,059
Not a retirement party, a funeral.

142
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,061
Right?

143
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:02,356
Yeah.

144
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,360
A funeral.

145
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,446
Is this MDR's position?

146
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:11,615
Dude?

147
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:13,575
Little help?

148
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,080
Sure. As long as it's quick.

149
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:21,249
- Quick?
- Quick. Yes.

150
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,626
So it doesn't take up the whole day.

151
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:25,087
Well said, Mark.

152
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,630
I'll see if we can
pull something together.

153
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:32,135
In the meantime, let's make some
forward progress on the files at hand.

154
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:33,637
Shall we?

155
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:35,764
Thank you.

156
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,433
Not you.

157
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,168
Miss Huang, we need to ready
a bereavement kit for MDR.

158
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,712
Meet me in the back office.

159
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:19,725
Mark?

160
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:22,144
Hello?

161
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:25,647
I'm gonna come in.

162
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:28,025
I'm coming in.

163
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:33,697
Hey.

164
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,700
Are you okay?

165
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,494
Uh-huh. No, not really.

166
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,123
Yeah. This is seriously fucked up.

167
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:45,209
Yeah.

168
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:52,382
You couldn't tell?

169
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,343
That she wasn't me?

170
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,596
Obviously not.

171
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:00,557
What was she like?

172
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:07,688
Like you.

173
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,567
Or you're like her? I don't know.

174
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:15,155
I don't know who you are, I guess.

175
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,535
Yes, you do.

176
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,370
Okay.

177
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:27,124
It's not my fault
that my outie hijacked me.

178
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,212
Yeah. No, totally. I get it. It sucks.

179
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,716
- Mark...
- Yeah.

180
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:37,469
What happened to you up there?

181
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:41,013
Doesn't matter.

182
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:42,557
- It doesn't matter?
- No.

183
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,141
Don't you want to hear
what happened to me?

184
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:48,313
No, I don't.
And let's just try to forget it. Okay?

185
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:17,009
I thought bereavement events
were for innies who die on the floor.

186
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:20,053
Yes.

187
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:25,184
Well, the Affections Index for Irving B.
was in the high 60s.

188
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,020
It will help the others to grieve.

189
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:34,860
May I say a question?

190
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:36,653
You may.

191
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:42,242
You shouldn't let them have a funeral.

192
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,954
It makes them feel like people.

193
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:49,750
That wasn't a question.

194
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:51,752
That was an opinion.

195
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:54,463
Unsolicited.

196
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,144
Your first performance review
is today, right?

197
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:21,365
That was a question.

198
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,245
I'll ready the refreshments.

199
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,581
You focus on the mournful signage.

200
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,262
<i>Today we honor Irving B.</i>

201
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:47,431
<i>Normally, when an innie
goes to be with Kier,</i>

202
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:51,270
<i>we hold a retirement party,
which they attend.</i>

203
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:56,316
But given the sudden
and frigid events which brought us here,

204
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:58,569
that's not feasible.

205
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,488
As such, let us each take nine seconds

206
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:07,578
to silently remember Irving
and thank Kier for our time with him.

207
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:16,378
There. You may now lift your heads
and open your eyes.

208
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,840
We will now have a eulogy from Dylan G.

209
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:38,817
It's hard to pinpoint
a favorite Irving story.

210
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:43,238
For the least fun guy in the world,
he was really fun.

211
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:47,659
He put the "dick" in contradiction.

212
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:53,749
One time, he was pissed at me
for watering down the toner,

213
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,710
so he put toner in my water cup.

214
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,378
He stopped me before I drank it, though.

215
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:03,050
He just wanted to make a point,
not harm me physically.

216
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,640
But I did accidentally take a sip of it
later 'cause I forgot he said that.

217
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:17,189
He asked me for help with something
near the end, and I didn't listen.

218
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,108
And in his final moments,

219
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:25,697
he would have been totally justified
in telling me to suck my own fuck.

220
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,033
But he didn't.

221
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:32,246
Yeah.

222
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,459
He was awesome, and I miss him.

223
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,132
Thank you, Dylan G.

224
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:48,595
A little sugar with your usual salt.

225
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,644
Thank you for your attendance
and your participation.

226
00:21:56,562 --> 00:22:00,732
You may now briefly partake
in Irving's fruit head,

227
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:04,736
whose dark hair is courtesy
of the Black Beauty Watermelon.

228
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:07,823
From the country of Malaysia.

229
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:13,662
Miss Huang.

230
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,802
I thought I was going to perform.

231
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:33,182
Yes, well, I feel the theremin
works best in moderation.

232
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:36,101
- But I practiced--
- You can play your piece for me later.

233
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:37,686
Yes?

234
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:03,754
You okay?

235
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:07,591
How about you?

236
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:09,218
Okay.

237
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:14,723
You're not staying?

238
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,726
I gotta get to work,
but great ceremony, guys.

239
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:20,062
Seriously?

240
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,608
I mean, isn't it kind of over?

241
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Mark...

242
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:27,736
Just let him go.

243
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:32,406
- What?
- Irving was your friend, and he's dead.

244
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:35,159
- Why don't you give a shit?
- Because he's not dead.

245
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,829
He's just not here.

246
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,123
You two catch up?

247
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,501
What's that?

248
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:47,172
You tell her Ms. Casey's your wife yet?

249
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:51,969
Wait, what?

250
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:55,763
Yeah, I mean,
it's my outie's wife, but sure...

251
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,683
No, it's pretty crazy.

252
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:01,562
Mark.

253
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,568
Mark, what the hell?

254
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,863
- Why won't you talk to me?
- What do you want to talk about, Helly?

255
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,700
I don't know. Maybe the fact
that Ms. Casey's your outie's wife?

256
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,201
What are we gonna do?

257
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:19,078
Well, we're not gonna do anything.

258
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,163
Not gonna do anything?

259
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:23,207
- Seriously?
- Yes. Seriously.

260
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,127
Come on. We'll work as a team.
We'll figure this out.

261
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:29,213
- "We'll"? There's no "we," Helly.
- What?

262
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:31,716
- It doesn't matter.
- Why?

263
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:32,842
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

264
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:35,511
Because they are smarter than us, okay?

265
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:37,138
They know everything.

266
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,765
Me looking for Ms. Casey,

267
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:42,393
us wandering around,
meeting other departments,

268
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:43,853
mapping the floor, all of it.

269
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:45,813
They know everything we're doing

270
00:24:45,814 --> 00:24:49,902
because Helena told them
everything we're doing.

271
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:51,778
That wasn't me.

272
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:55,657
Mark, lo... I'm not her. I'm not.

273
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,702
I'm me.

274
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:01,830
Helly.

275
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,541
And how do I know that?

276
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:12,341
You don't.

277
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:16,220
You just have to trust me.

278
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:22,142
This is real.

279
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,566
Not everything here is a lie.

280
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:38,659
And stop being a fucking asshole.

281
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:51,296
Your first performance review
as Department Chief. Excited?

282
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:55,175
Very much so.

283
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:57,593
Shall we?

284
00:25:57,594 --> 00:26:00,179
Natalie, just before we begin,

285
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,391
I was wondering
if I could have a word with you.

286
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:10,357
The paintings.

287
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:15,195
I want you to understand
I am grateful for them.

288
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:16,864
Truly.

289
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:20,784
If they're a measure of appreciation,
then I accept that appreciation.

290
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,959
I was just wondering
if you could share with me a little

291
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,922
how you felt
when you received the paintings.

292
00:26:34,882 --> 00:26:35,883
Because I'm thinking

293
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:40,012
our experiences here
have been similar in some ways,

294
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:43,682
we face similar challenges,

295
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:48,854
and perhaps the paintings and the
somewhat complicated feelings they evoke.

296
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:58,780
Mr. Drummond's waiting.

297
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:01,825
Yes, of course.

298
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:05,913
Let us go.

299
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:23,055
Okay, asshole.

300
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:25,807
Guess this is it.

301
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:29,144
Sorry I let you down.

302
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,836
<i>Welcome, Mr. Milchick.</i>

303
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:40,424
Today, I will be conducting
your monthly performance review.

304
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,759
This review can take
anywhere from two to six hours,

305
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,597
depending on the number of atonements
and approbations required.

306
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:50,266
If the review is to take longer
than four hours,

307
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:54,562
there will be a break for lunch,
with the order taken in advance.

308
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,815
Well, I hope that won't be necessary.

309
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:01,028
Here is the lunch menu.

310
00:29:09,953 --> 00:29:11,830
Let's start with the positives.

311
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:16,667
You received the gift
of Kier paintings with grace.

312
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,879
Your attendance and urinalysis
are both in the excellent range.

313
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,380
Wonderful.

314
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:23,966
Alternatively and sadly,

315
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,971
there have been three contentions
reported anonymously

316
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,099
which have been investigated
and confirmed.

317
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,855
"One: uses too many big words."

318
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,317
Well, perchance I may
colloquially employ a--

319
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:44,821
Anti-deflections will be heard
after the lunch break.

320
00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:46,489
Yes, sorry.

321
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,618
Two: on several of your daily logs,

322
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:53,746
the paper clip
was installed back to front,

323
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:58,293
which led to a confusion as to where
in the document to begin reading.

324
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:01,213
Here are the incidents.

325
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:07,219
But the bulk of our day
will revolve around the following.

326
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:12,014
You brought in
a new refining team for Mark S.

327
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:14,017
which failed to coalesce.

328
00:30:14,518 --> 00:30:16,519
You instituted kindness reforms.

329
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,521
Because I'm not Harmony Cobel.

330
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:23,734
Kindness reforms
that seemed to have, in no way,

331
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:28,281
deterred curiosity or idling by the team
once they returned.

332
00:30:28,282 --> 00:30:32,785
You arranged an outdoor retreat
and team-building occurrence

333
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:35,497
which resulted in the termination
of one employee,

334
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,708
and the discovery
of the true identity of another

335
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:41,753
at great risk and harm to the Eagan name.

336
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:04,276
<i>Look, Seth, Mark Scout's completion
of Cold Harbor...</i>

337
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:06,527
will be remembered

338
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:10,365
as one of the greatest moments
in the history of this planet.

339
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:14,494
It will take place under your stewardship.

340
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,455
<i>That's quite a legacy you will leave.</i>

341
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:18,665
<i>Thank you, Mr. Drummond.</i>

342
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,376
That means a great deal.

343
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:27,174
<i>This milestone seems
to have clouded your judgment.</i>

344
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:31,094
I think it's time to go
back to the basics, Seth.

345
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:34,598
To remember these severed workers'
greater purpose...

346
00:31:39,561 --> 00:31:43,232
and to treat them as what they really are.

347
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:32,489
I'm tightening the leash.

348
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,261
Hi, Mark.

349
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:56,220
Mr. Milchick.

350
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:58,723
I see you left work six minutes early.

351
00:32:58,724 --> 00:32:59,933
May I come in?

352
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:10,194
How was the rest of the funeral?

353
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:12,821
Did you get what you needed from it?

354
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:16,033
Yeah, sure.

355
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:21,497
Hey, did Miss Huang take notes?

356
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:26,417
I can't wait to read her article about it
in that newspaper you showed me.

357
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:27,878
What was it called again?

358
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:31,173
<i>The Bullshit Gazette</i>?

359
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:37,762
Hopefully, now we can put
all this grief and tumult behind us

360
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:40,723
and look forward
to some productive workdays ahead.

361
00:33:40,724 --> 00:33:44,060
You mean
putting the numbers in the thing--

362
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:45,478
- Refining.
- Right.

363
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:47,772
Yes. Does that sound good?

364
00:33:47,773 --> 00:33:49,982
Whatever you say, Mr. Milchick.

365
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,235
Praise Kier.

366
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:02,663
Did you and Helly R. catch up?

367
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:05,081
We did.

368
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:08,460
Did you tell her that you
fucked her outie at the ORTBO?

369
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:15,384
Helena Eagan,

370
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:18,679
leader-in-waiting of this company.

371
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,607
Have a restful evening.

372
00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:53,505
<i>"The workers were diligent,</i>

373
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:56,133
<i>focused on the task at hand.</i>

374
00:34:57,634 --> 00:35:01,722
<i>Pleasantly surprised, I noticed
that not a single worker had a watch.</i>

375
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:05,767
<i>They simply referenced
a large standard clock near the door,</i>

376
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:09,188
<i>just hands and numbers
and cogs and purpose.</i>

377
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:13,232
Your sovereign boss may own the clock
that greets you from the wall,

378
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:16,987
but you get to enjoy its ticking
and thus should be happy."

379
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,199
Yes.

380
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,369
Babe, it's the literal opposite
of what you were saying before.

381
00:35:26,163 --> 00:35:27,164
Okay.

382
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:31,167
I see how you'd feel that way.

383
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:33,252
But one point that Nat made was--

384
00:35:33,253 --> 00:35:34,338
Nat, okay.

385
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:40,593
She said that innies tend to thrive
in an environment of structure,

386
00:35:40,594 --> 00:35:42,345
and once that is established,

387
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:45,181
then they are more open to self-expansion.

388
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:47,725
So I am just trying
to speak their language.

389
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:50,144
I know, but this sounds
like Lumon's language.

390
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:52,980
Well, it's a Trojan's horse.

391
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:56,484
If I can get my ideas
to severed workers all across the world,

392
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:59,612
it might beget a revolution.

393
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:01,365
But these aren't your ideas.

394
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,492
These are not your ideas, and also...

395
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:05,577
Whatever.

396
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:07,286
And what?

397
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:10,540
Okay, Lumon hurts people, you know that,
and if you want to water down your work

398
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,750
so they can use it
for their fucking propaganda,

399
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,168
then you're hurting people too.

400
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:17,713
Okay. I will reflect on your words.

401
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:18,841
Thank you.

402
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:23,428
And also,

403
00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:28,516
this is a fiscal and creative opportunity

404
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:30,519
unlike any I have yet seen.

405
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,606
And I'm not inclined
to just walk away from it.

406
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:40,069
Unless me selling
millions of copies of my book

407
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,700
and the life that that manages to give us
has somehow lost its appeal for you.

408
00:36:47,578 --> 00:36:49,496
Okay. Whatever. I'm gonna go to bed.

409
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,456
No. Babe.

410
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:53,625
No, thank you.

411
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,353
It's me again.

412
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,980
So, they fired me.

413
00:37:57,981 --> 00:38:00,566
I think they knew what my innie was up to.

414
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:02,194
I'm telling you to--

415
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:05,322
I have to go.

416
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:15,123
Hey!

417
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,252
Hey!

418
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:22,005
You. Why are you following me?

419
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:27,510
I got this thing.

420
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:33,141
When somebody shows up on my doorstep
screaming my name, I wanna know why.

421
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:35,018
Call it a quirk.

422
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:38,730
You're with Lumon.

423
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,904
Why were you at my house the other night?

424
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:50,534
I don't know.

425
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:54,246
It wasn't you at all, was it?

426
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:55,747
You're severed.

427
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,838
I got canned a couple of weeks ago.

428
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,173
When I pressed them for a reason,

429
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:10,261
they said my innie had an unsanctioned,
erotic entanglement with another worker.

430
00:39:10,262 --> 00:39:11,847
They wouldn't tell me who.

431
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:17,269
Then you show up at my door.

432
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:24,318
You think we were an item?

433
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:27,111
Well, Fields certainly thinks so.

434
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:30,157
We had to cancel our trip to Milwaukee.
Thanks for that.

435
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:34,786
- Fields?
- That's my husband, Fields.

436
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:37,371
I'm sorry.

437
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:38,873
Yeah, well...

438
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:41,376
And I'm sorry I came at you just now.

439
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:45,172
It's fine.

440
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,430
Maybe you could-- I don't know.

441
00:39:54,681 --> 00:39:55,682
What?

442
00:39:57,226 --> 00:40:00,229
We got a ham.
We're planning to have it tomorrow.

443
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:05,359
Might be nice if you come over.
We could sit down, talk through it all.

444
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:10,280
You, me, and...

445
00:40:11,114 --> 00:40:12,115
Fields.

446
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:19,080
I suppose.

447
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:20,290
Great.

448
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:22,960
We like red wine.

449
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,710
Expensive.

450
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:26,839
Okay. Tomorrow.

451
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:30,008
You need a lift?

452
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:32,260
I'll walk. Thanks.

453
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,345
You sure?

454
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,014
I know where you live.

455
00:40:41,562 --> 00:40:44,398
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

456
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:21,643
Sorry there wasn't any eggnog.

457
00:41:22,186 --> 00:41:23,937
Might be out of season.

458
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:27,064
What the fuck are you doing?

459
00:41:27,065 --> 00:41:30,235
I needed some pressure points.
Things to rattle your memories.

460
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:31,903
- Knitting?
- Yeah.

461
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,573
She said it gave her time to think.

462
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:40,370
That her?

463
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:43,999
What I thought was her.

464
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,259
She's not dead. She's just not here.

465
00:41:57,638 --> 00:41:58,972
Who's in there?

466
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:02,433
They know people at the morgue.

467
00:42:02,434 --> 00:42:05,187
On the payroll,
like everywhere else in Kier.

468
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:11,026
You feel all right?

469
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,781
Basically. So, are we gonna...

470
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:17,866
One more day.

471
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,036
Usually that's best.

472
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,372
Usually? You've done this once.

473
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:25,832
I don't wanna rush things.

474
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,083
There's risk.

475
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:28,835
It's not an exact science, Mark.

476
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:32,130
I'm not sure it's science,
period, but okay.

477
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,885
You good on snacks?

478
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:38,512
For now.

479
00:42:58,407 --> 00:42:59,741
Are they hurting her?

480
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,414
I don't know.

481
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,340
<i>Your outie.</i>

482
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:17,426
What?

483
00:43:18,844 --> 00:43:20,262
I didn't say anything.
