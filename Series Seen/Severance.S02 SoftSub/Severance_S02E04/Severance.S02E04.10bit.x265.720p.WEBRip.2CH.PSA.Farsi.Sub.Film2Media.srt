1
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,191
Hello!

2
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,739
Hello!

3
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,580
Irving!

4
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:55,293
- It's me. I'm up here!
- Mark!

5
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:57,127
Yeah!

6
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:58,213
Hey!

7
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,758
What's happening?

8
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,092
Where are we?

9
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:06,388
I have no fucking idea,

10
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:10,892
but there's a path up the cliff
right down there!

11
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,187
Do you want me to come up?

12
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:16,857
Well, yeah!

13
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:23,780
I'm on the ice. I'm on the fucking ice!

14
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,783
Maybe get off of it. Come on!

15
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:34,583
I'm coming!

16
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:43,008
I'm--

17
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,467
I'm coming!

18
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:46,761
Be careful!

19
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:02,694
It's very steep!

20
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:26,635
Irving.

21
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,512
Helly!

22
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:31,848
Where did you come from?

23
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,682
I don't know.

24
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,101
What are we doing out here?

25
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,312
Up here!

26
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:40,732
Follow my voice!

27
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,236
Mark!

28
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:49,950
Mark!

29
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:52,118
Up here!

30
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,831
Mark.

31
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:58,249
Hey!

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,334
Are you okay?

33
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,877
- Did you wake up on the ice too?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:03,964
- What about you?
- On the cliff.

35
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:06,675
Oh, my God.

36
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:11,345
- Is it you?
- Of course it's us.

37
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:12,848
Holy shit!

38
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,600
Out-fucking-side.

39
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:19,562
Oh, my God. I mean,
I knew there was no actual ceiling,

40
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:21,231
but this is fucking insane.

41
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:23,650
Hello?

42
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:26,820
Hello?

43
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:36,788
What is that?

44
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:32,219
<i>Good morning, Refiners.</i>

45
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,347
<i>This is Mr. Milchick from work,
and I'm thrilled to welcome you</i>

46
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:38,516
<i>to your first ever</i>

47
00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:42,979
<i>outdoor retreat
and team-building occurrence.</i>

48
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:49,819
<i>This ORTBO is in response
to your desire to see the outside world.</i>

49
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:51,946
<i>With your outies' blessings,</i>

50
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:56,075
<i>you will spend the next two calendar days
walking the meadows,</i>

51
00:04:56,076 --> 00:05:01,581
<i>thickets, brambles and brooks that
make up the Dieter Eagan National Forest.</i>

52
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,210
Who the fuck is Dieter Eagan?

53
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:09,214
<i>Dieter Eagan?</i>

54
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,884
<i>Some of you may be
quietly yearning to learn more.</i>

55
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,848
<i>The truth you seek lies
within the fourth appendix.</i>

56
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,352
<i>Kier dictated a fourth
appendix in his final hours of life,</i>

57
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:28,275
<i>a text of such sanctity that it
is forbidden upon the severed floor.</i>

58
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,404
<i>It's waiting for you in Scissor Cave,</i>

59
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,738
<i>the very same grotto</i>

60
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:38,827
<i>where Kier Eagan tamed the four
tempers for the very first time.</i>

61
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:41,163
<i>And do remember,</i>

62
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,669
<i>"Stray not from Kier's path,
lest you roil nature's wrath."</i>

63
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:52,048
<i>There will be help along the way.</i>

64
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:56,469
<i>Happy fortunes, MDR.</i>

65
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,313
Scissor Cave.

66
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:18,450
What the fuck is that?

67
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:30,962
He looks like Mark.

68
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:46,061
Milchick said there'd
be help along the way.

69
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:50,064
I wouldn't trust a word out of that
mountebank's mouth.

70
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,525
Not even televisually.

71
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:08,500
Not like we have a lot of
other options right now, Irv.

72
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,286
Wait.

73
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,289
{\an8}"Chapter one.

74
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,502
{\an8}I was not born into this world alone.

75
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:42,506
The lodgings of my mother's
womb I shared with another,

76
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:45,050
a twin brother who was called Dieter."

77
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,720
Kier had a twin?

78
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,474
That's what those things are.

79
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,267
Yeah.

80
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,940
"In infancy, he was my bosom friend.
But as we blossomed into boyhood,

81
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,693
he beseeched me to take to
the wood with him to live as paupers.

82
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:08,156
My love for my twin
unbalancing my judgment,

83
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:12,160
I acceded, and we ventured
into the wood towards"...

84
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,956
"Woe's Hollow."

85
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:28,635
So,
we're to walk in the brothers' footsteps.

86
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:36,768
{\an8}"He always crept like this at this hour.

87
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:41,230
{\an8}- Once concealed by flora, my brother"...
- <i>...flora, my brother</i>

88
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:43,649
<i>unfastened himself.</i>

89
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:50,740
<i>The din of his fervor fell strangely
into concert with the music of the wood.</i>

90
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,326
<i>His every thrust found rhythm</i>

91
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,246
- <i>with the trill of the crickets...</i>
- ..."trill of the crickets"...

92
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:59,916
- <i>...and the moaning of the wind...</i>
- ..."and the moaning of the wind"...

93
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,003
- <i>...and the snowfall's yearly thaw.</i>
- ..."and the snowfall's yearly thaw."

94
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:06,714
<i>Dieter became, on that night</i>

95
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:09,300
- <i>an instrument of nature...</i>
- ..."an instrument of nature"...

96
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:12,970
- <i>...and nature played Dieter...</i>
- "and nature played Dieter with elegance.

97
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:16,307
I had no choice but to listen

98
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:20,437
as he spilt his lineage upon the soil."

99
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,544
Now there's a me one.

100
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:29,798
You okay?

101
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:32,092
Yeah.

102
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:35,053
I just wish I knew where we were going.

103
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,412
Fuck.

104
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:27,272
What were you and Helly
talking about back there?

105
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:38,033
When?

106
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,661
I don't trust her.

107
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,957
I think she might be lying
about what her outie saw.

108
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,792
Why would you think that?

109
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:49,920
Night gardeners.

110
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,632
It's clear you do not have
an objective perspective

111
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,008
due to your feelings for her.

112
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,179
My feelings for her have
nothing to do with anything, okay--

113
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:22,118
What the fuck?

114
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,289
What is it?

115
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,208
I don't know.

116
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:32,003
Looks like a seal.

117
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,844
Why does it look so messed up?

118
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:43,431
I don't know.
Maybe this is what dead things look like.

119
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:47,269
We should eat it.

120
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,270
Pardon me?

121
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,606
We don't know if there's
food waiting at the hollow.

122
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,942
We don't even know where we are.

123
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:56,903
They can't let anything happen to us.

124
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:58,445
It's an ORTBO.

125
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,866
Outdoor retreat team-building occurrence.
Right, Mark?

126
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:03,618
We don't know what this is.

127
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:07,581
- We don't know anything!
- Irving, calm down.

128
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:12,126
We all know you had a bad experience
the last time you were outside--

129
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:14,587
Who said I had a bad experience?

130
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:15,797
Oh, my God.

131
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:19,633
What did you tell him, dumbass?

132
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:22,470
Nothing! What the fuck?

133
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,599
Let's just get to the hollow.

134
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:22,029
Kier's twin was always with him.

135
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:27,035
That's why we provided
the very same for each of you.

136
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,079
Fuck you all. I was right.

137
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,414
Mr. Milchick.

138
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:35,126
This is the tallest waterfall
on the planet.

139
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:42,425
You have followed the path of Kier
and Dieter, and reached Woe's Hollow.

140
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,470
You stand upon sacred earth.

141
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,057
We're starving, Mr. Milchick.

142
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,351
Are you?

143
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,480
I thought the waterfall's
grandeur would satiate you.

144
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:01,111
I'm teasing, of course.

145
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,739
Lumon will always protect and provide.

146
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:06,867
Right this way.

147
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:12,098
Miss Huang has been readying the grill for
which we brought in copious luxury meats.

148
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,187
The fire will be used for
marshmallows and a recital later.

149
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:20,982
The tents, as you can see, are MDR blue

150
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,446
and the outhouse is stocked
with four-ply washroom tissue.

151
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:29,616
Wow.

152
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:32,077
Wow, indeed, Helly R.

153
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:38,416
Also, for your
comfort and safety, torches,

154
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:41,753
which can provide both
a heat and a light source.

155
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:44,256
Double duty.

156
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,551
It's beautiful.

157
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,221
Pretty cool, right?

158
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,142
Yes, lovely.

159
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:03,400
Irving?

160
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,901
Enter.

161
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,041
Made you a snow seal.

162
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:28,967
In case you were hungry.

163
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:32,596
Yeah.

164
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:38,601
I feel silly for suggesting
we eat that animal.

165
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:43,647
I suppose
it sounded alarmist and paranoid.

166
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:44,690
Irrational.

167
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:47,819
No. It was fine. We were all a little...

168
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:55,744
Yeah.

169
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:06,671
What did you really see
during the overtime contingency?

170
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:15,180
I told you.

171
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,600
It's okay.

172
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,561
It won't change anything.

173
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,280
Irving.

174
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,210
Okay.

175
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:09,025
"Dieter lay unwashed in his bedroll,

176
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:12,320
though the hollow's pool
was primed for bathing.

177
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:15,322
We ate of the hare we'd caught

178
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:19,369
and told each other rhyming jokes
till our gullets ached.

179
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,333
But at last,
the thought tickling my mouth emerged.

180
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:29,212
'We must return to Father,' I said.

181
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:32,924
'But I promise to look
after you in the ether mill.'

182
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:39,264
When at last a sound came from him,
it was a bewailing whimper.

183
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:44,978
He believed, I suppose,
that we'd be woodland paupers forever.

184
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:51,318
I was looking at him
when his eye came out.

185
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,737
It popped from the socket,

186
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:59,201
driven by a sudden torrent of pus
from his skull.

187
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:04,788
And he reached up to grasp at his hair,

188
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:09,377
which was suddenly moss that tore
easily from his bleeding scalp."

189
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:11,587
Good heavens.

190
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:15,841
"And as the pus
from his eye thickened into sap,

191
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:20,847
I turned from my gargling brother
and walked to the pool of the hollow,

192
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:26,520
where I knew the waterfall
would drown out my brother's cries."

193
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:29,397
That's actually really smart.

194
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:35,070
"And it was here that I
first encountered the temper Woe,

195
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:41,701
a gaunt bride,
half the height of a natural woman.

196
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:04,099
She spoke to me
directly from her eyes and said,

197
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,726
'This is your doing.

198
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,730
You suffered his wantonness.

199
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:14,150
Now he's no one's brother.

200
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:17,487
Only chaos's whore.'"

201
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:28,748
The end.

202
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,633
Perhaps in the morning,
we'll have time for the next chapter...

203
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:42,512
"Kier and the Thieving Nanny."

204
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:45,557
Creepy.

205
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:51,271
Did his brother really die that way,
Mr. Milchick?

206
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:58,445
The handbook enriches our work
with tales of the founder's life.

207
00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:01,698
Every word is truth.

208
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:09,163
I'm sorry. Sorry.

209
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:10,248
Helly.

210
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:13,418
What?

211
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,634
- Helly R.?
- You guys...

212
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:22,427
He melted, right?

213
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:25,805
He turned into the forest
because he masturbated.

214
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:31,353
I mean, seriously, that's actually
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

215
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:36,733
Right? He jerked off
in front of his brother...

216
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:40,403
and he got punished for it.

217
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,030
Wha... You can't say that.

218
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:45,909
- He just said it.
- Wha... He did.

219
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:49,412
I... It's...

220
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:54,543
You know, we often laugh
at what we don't understand.

221
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:02,717
The team I thought I knew
would have processed more thoughtfully.

222
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:07,305
Miss Huang.

223
00:26:11,393 --> 00:26:12,811
The marshmallows, please.

224
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:23,989
Throw them in the fire.

225
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:27,826
Mr. Milchick, come on.

226
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,620
Now, Miss Huang.

227
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,335
- Oh, my...
- Why?

228
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:41,590
Marshmallows are for team players, Dylan.

229
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,342
They don't just hand them out.

230
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:51,224
What?

231
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:55,270
Good night.

232
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:05,739
Wow.

233
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:08,283
Oh, my God.

234
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:11,328
Hey, what do you think
his dick turned into?

235
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:20,921
It isn't funny.

236
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:23,839
I don't know. It's pretty funny.

237
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,050
- Well, it's not.
- Okay.

238
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:28,929
And stop making goo-goo eyes at her.

239
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:34,391
- I'm not.
- Stop.

240
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:35,477
"Goo-goo eyes"?

241
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,065
Just tell us, Helly.

242
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:42,691
What?

243
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:44,276
Come on. Tell us.

244
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:45,862
Tell us what?

245
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:48,532
Just tell us about him.

246
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:50,909
Who?

247
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:55,330
The night gardener.

248
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,543
Irv, come on.

249
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:01,711
Did he have a flashlight?

250
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:06,757
What was he wearing?

251
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:08,175
What is your deal right now, dude?

252
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,345
What color was his shirt?

253
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:13,181
Did he have on a vest?

254
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:17,726
- A luminescent vest? Tell us...
- Okay.

255
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:19,687
- ...exactly what he was wear--
- Irving. That's enough.

256
00:28:19,688 --> 00:28:21,647
- Enough?
- Yeah.

257
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:24,484
Using your pupils to make love to her

258
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:27,862
while your outie's wife
rots away somewhere.

259
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:29,071
Hey, shut up.

260
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:30,699
Yeah. Fuck you, Irv.

261
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:35,412
So it's three against one now, huh?

262
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,084
It's okay.

263
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:45,839
We all know Irving's upset
because he can't ever see Burt again.

264
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:52,053
And he's really lonely.

265
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:21,040
Hey, Irv.

266
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,334
Fuck you all.

267
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:11,633
Probably a carrot.

268
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:15,053
What?

269
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:21,226
Dieter's penis.

270
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:30,443
Yeah, or some other root vegetable.

271
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:49,713
That was mean of me...

272
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:53,258
to say that to Irving.

273
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:03,560
I mean, he kind of deserved it.

274
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:13,320
And I can make goo-goo eyes
at anyone I want.

275
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,288
Are you okay?

276
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:31,296
Sorry if I'm distracting you from...

277
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:35,175
From what?

278
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:42,182
From looking for your wife.

279
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:47,979
Hey, it's okay.

280
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:52,901
I know we'll find her,
and you've already helped so much.

281
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:01,034
I have?

282
00:32:01,952 --> 00:32:02,953
Yeah.

283
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,292
Okay.

284
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:58,235
Mr. Milchick!

285
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:03,114
Mr. Milchick!

286
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:05,867
Miss Huang!

287
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:10,120
Mr. Milchick!

288
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:18,463
Miss Huang!

289
00:34:59,713 --> 00:35:01,506
Mr. Milchick!

290
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,757
I didn't like who I was on the outside.

291
00:36:31,346 --> 00:36:32,722
I was ashamed.

292
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,651
Who were you?

293
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,586
I don't care who you are out there.

294
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:07,048
I care who you are with me.

295
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:12,304
That's all.

296
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:15,223
Okay?

297
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:27,736
Are you okay?

298
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,076
What happened?

299
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,038
Are you okay?

300
00:37:38,747 --> 00:37:39,748
Yeah.

301
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,711
Okay.

302
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,190
Helly?

303
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:36,443
Helly?

304
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Hey, where's Helly?

305
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:42,740
I don't know. Irv never came back
last night, and he's not in his tent.

306
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:43,908
What?

307
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:45,160
Mr. Milchick?

308
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,119
Helly!

309
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,413
Mr. Milchick!

310
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:51,333
Mark.

311
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,419
Mark. Dylan, what's happened?

312
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,921
Helly and Irv are missing.

313
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,215
What the fuck is going on?

314
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:32,457
Hey, kid.

315
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:35,627
Irving.

316
00:42:40,465 --> 00:42:43,885
What are you doing down here?

317
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,976
What are you doing down here?

318
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:54,145
I slept outside.

319
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:57,399
I almost froze to death.

320
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,073
What you said to me last night,

321
00:43:06,241 --> 00:43:07,576
it was cruel.

322
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,998
Helly was never cruel.

323
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:17,586
I'm right here.

324
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,511
So if you're not her...

325
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:30,182
then who are you?

326
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:36,938
Who would have the power to send
their outie to the severed floor?

327
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:49,242
I'm sorry.

328
00:43:51,077 --> 00:43:52,078
No! Irving!

329
00:43:53,288 --> 00:43:54,747
Mr. Milchick!

330
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:57,042
- No. No!
- Come on.

331
00:43:58,376 --> 00:44:01,337
- Irving. Stop. Irving, no.
- Mr. Milchick!

332
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,422
Please, stop.

333
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:04,424
Help!

334
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,011
- Mr. Milchick!
- No!

335
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:14,142
Irving?

336
00:44:14,643 --> 00:44:16,561
Mr. Milchick!

337
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:18,563
Irving!

338
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,690
Mr. Milchick!

339
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:23,860
- Come!
- Mark!

340
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:25,862
Mr. Milchick!

341
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:29,825
Mr. Milchick!

342
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,076
- Mark!
- Helly!

343
00:44:32,077 --> 00:44:34,745
- Turn her back, Mr. Milchick!
- Help!

344
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:35,830
What are you doing, man?

345
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:39,000
- Turn her back!
- Irv, what the fuck?

346
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,628
She's an outie!

347
00:44:42,128 --> 00:44:44,213
- Hey! Irving, stop it!
- Hey! Irv, cut it out!

348
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,465
- Stop!
- She's been an outie the whole time,

349
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,050
ever since she came back!

350
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:51,762
- Irving, you stop now!
- Stop it!

351
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:53,430
Irving, stop this!

352
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:55,391
She's a fucking mole!

353
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,892
What are you doing?

354
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:59,020
- Irving!
- I'm gonna kill her, Mr. Milchick!

355
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,399
Irving! Irving!

356
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:06,111
Stop! Stop this!

357
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,195
She's not Helly!

358
00:45:08,196 --> 00:45:09,698
She's an Eagan!

359
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:13,951
Turn her back, Mr. Milchick!
Turn her back!

360
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:16,078
Goddamn it, Seth, do it!

361
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,332
Yes! Do it, Seth!

362
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:23,170
Hey!

363
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:32,220
It's Milchick.
Remove the Glasgow block now.

364
00:45:36,308 --> 00:45:37,184
Now!

365
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:49,946
I'm sorry.

366
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:53,366
I'm so sorry, Helly.

367
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,745
What's happening?

368
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,667
Helly!

369
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:12,093
I'm sorry, Helly.

370
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:21,144
Irving B., stand.

371
00:46:26,024 --> 00:46:29,528
You have threatened collegial murder
in the pond of Woe's Hollow.

372
00:46:30,028 --> 00:46:34,366
For this, there can be no penalty
but immediate and permanent dismissal.

373
00:46:35,408 --> 00:46:39,246
There shall be no formal valediction,
catered or otherwise.

374
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:42,666
Your outie will be notified forthwith.

375
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:48,128
Irv! I'm sorry!

376
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:49,798
I should have listened!

377
00:46:51,424 --> 00:46:55,095
It's okay. It's all okay.

378
00:46:58,306 --> 00:47:01,476
Just remember, hang in there.

379
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,813
Please refrain from any further speech,

380
00:47:05,814 --> 00:47:09,859
as you are no longer authorized
to consort with any severed employee,

381
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,277
nor they with you.

382
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:15,907
Leave him alone!
Turn around!

383
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:25,500
Leave him alone!

384
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:58,283
Walk into the forest.

385
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:14,716

386
00:48:30,398 --> 00:48:32,316
Your workspace will be cleared

387
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:35,945
and any personal items discarded.

388
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:40,533
Your file, including any
and all professional interactions

389
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:41,951
and personal relations,

390
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,747
will be purged and destroyed.

391
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:50,125
It will be as if you, Irving B.,

392
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:52,503
never even existed

393
00:48:52,504 --> 00:48:56,758
nor drew a single breath upon this Earth.

394
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:08,603
May Kier's mercy follow you
into the eternal dark.

395
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,151
Now.
