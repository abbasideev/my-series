1
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,052
<i>Do you remember
the last thing that you said to me?</i>

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,100
<i>"She's alive."</i>

3
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,313
Have you finished Cold Harbor?

4
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,110
What is this place?

5
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,571
It's a cabin for giving birth.

6
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,700
Why am I here? Why are you here?

7
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,244
Cold Harbor.

8
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,538
Have you finished it?

9
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,919
No.

10
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,548
Then she's still alive.

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,093
We can save her.

12
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,596
Who?

13
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,641
Ms. Casey.

14
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,684
Gemma.

15
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,399
There's a hallway down there.
It's different than the others.

16
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,319
It's long and black and hidden.

17
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,198
From Irving's drawings.

18
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,784
What?

19
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,038
With an elevator going down.

20
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,835
We know where it is.

21
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,470
What a funny speech you gave at the party.

22
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,772
I was cross with you after.

23
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,153
I threw a tin of candies.

24
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,577
God, you're fucking weird.

25
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,563
I do not love my daughter.

26
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,154
I used to see Kier in her,

27
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,991
but he left her as she grew.

28
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,871
You sound like a great dad.

29
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,209
I sired others in the shadows.

30
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,379
But he wasn't in them either.

31
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,887
Until I saw him again.

32
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,391
In you.

33
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,897
You and your family created hell,
and you're going to burn in it.

34
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,824
There he is.

35
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,080
Tomorrow is a special day.

36
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:52,835
Hey!

37
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,839
Why did you come here?

38
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,508
What do you want from me?

39
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,347
So, wait, when I finish Cold Harbor,

40
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,768
they do a test, and then they kill her?

41
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:16,357
Once that file is done, you'll need
to quickly get to the black hallway,

42
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,317
then down to the testing floor.

43
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,322
They'll not let you leave MDR
till that file is complete.

44
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,533
Okay, but how do I find her
once I'm down there?

45
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,701
No, you won't.

46
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,119
- I won't?
- No.

47
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,707
Your chip is only attuned to your floor.

48
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,252
Once you get down to testing,
you'll be your outie again.

49
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,505
And then he'll find Gemma
and take her up to the severed floor.

50
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,468
Where you will guide her
to the exit stairwell.

51
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,097
Right. Okay.

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,185
Mark...

53
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,606
I know this is a fucking lot, man.

54
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,942
But if we can prove that she is alive,

55
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,696
if we can prove
that they fucking kidnapped her,

56
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,449
it will end them.

57
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,044
Well, what happens to us?

58
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,796
What do you mean?

59
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:28,388
Well, if Lumon ends, then what happens
to every innie on the severed floor?

60
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,269
Yeah.

61
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,866
- You want me to give my life?
- No.

62
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,660
The lives of everyone down there?

63
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,454
No, it's not that simple.

64
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,668
Just to save one person
you happen to care about?

65
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,505
It doesn't have to end your life.

66
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,884
Really?

67
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,345
Right.

68
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,058
There's somebody else
who wants to talk to you, actually.

69
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,700
Okay, just hit the play.

70
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,923
Watch it.

71
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:50,971
Record your response, then step outside.

72
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,516
We'll just be downstairs, okay?

73
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,602
Okay.

74
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,169
<i>Hey, I'm...</i>

75
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,546
<i>Well, I guess you know who I am.</i>

76
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>I think you've spoken
with Devon and Mrs. Sel...</i>

77
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,927
<i>Ms. Cobel.</i>

78
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,347
<i>So y...</i>

79
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,725
<i>you know what it is that we're asking.</i>

80
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,729
<i>But the first thing I need to say to you</i>

81
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,526
<i>is that I am so sorry.</i>

82
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:52,199
<i>You know, I created you
as a prisoner and as an escape.</i>

83
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,245
<i>Lumon told me you'd be happy,
that innies are content,</i>

84
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,330
<i>and because I took their word for it,</i>

85
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,708
<i>you've been living a nightmare
for two years.</i>

86
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,338
<i>It's horrific what they've done to you.</i>

87
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:12,636
<i>And part of the reason I'm here
is to make it right.</i>

88
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,516
<i>And I hope now with all we have in common,</i>

89
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,104
<i>that you'll give me that chance.</i>

90
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,315
<i>Hi.</i>

91
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>Wow, this is...
I never expected to actually speak to you.</i>

92
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,030
Holy shit.

93
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,742
<i>Let alone get an apology, so...</i>

94
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,829
<i>Thank you.</i>

95
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,253
<i>You know, "nightmare"
is the wrong word, actually.</i>

96
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,591
<i>'Cause we find ways to make it work, to...</i>

97
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,469
<i>to feel whole,</i>

98
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,682
<i>which is why what you're asking scares me.</i>

99
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,603
<i>You know, because whatever this life is...</i>

100
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,857
<i>it's all we have,</i>

101
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,402
<i>and we don't want it to end.</i>

102
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,529
<i>Can you understand that?</i>

103
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,686
Of course I can.

104
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,730
It's such a good point.

105
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:14,985
I'd say the same thing
in your position, however,

106
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:20,991
Lumon doesn't have to be your whole life.

107
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,828
<i>Now, you may have been
seeing flashes lately.</i>

108
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,039
<i>Images from my world out here.</i>

109
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,958
<i>I've been seeing yours too.</i>

110
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>It's a process called "reintegration."</i>

111
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:39,092
<i>It's a way to recouple memories
so we can be one person.</i>

112
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,138
I started this because I see now
how unfair this all is to you,

113
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,852
and once my wife is free,
I swear I will finish the process.

114
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,314
'Cause this life, our life...

115
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,901
<i>belongs to both of us.</i>

116
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,905
<i>And I wanna share it with you.</i>

117
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,168
Okay. But what would that mean exactly?

118
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,465
That you get the right side,
and I get the left? Or...

119
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,842
Is it like a top-bottom situation? I'm--

120
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,510
- No.
- I'm honestly trying to understand.

121
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,596
No, it wouldn't be like
a top-bottom situation.

122
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,475
It's, like, both of us.
Like, one person combined.

123
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:34,480
<i>Like, my memories and yours,
and my trauma and yours,</i>

124
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,650
<i>but, like, you know, the good stuff too.</i>

125
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,030
Okay, but...

126
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,159
I mean, you've been alive for, what,
20 times longer,

127
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,455
so whoever this new hybrid person is,

128
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:55,002
it seems like
he'd be way more you than me.

129
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,008
I just don't think that's how it works.

130
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,012
Okay. How does it work?

131
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,244
Look...

132
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:37,252
I mourned Gemma for two years.

133
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,345
I lost my job, my teaching job...

134
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:53,435
because I fucking started
showing up drunk.

135
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,153
<i>You know, I hid all of her stuff
in my basement...</i>

136
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,158
<i>'cause it was easier pretending
that she never existed.</i>

137
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,583
<i>And I thought I was protecting you
from that pain.</i>

138
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:30,764
Hey, Ms. Cobel told me
you like someone down there?

139
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,059
Helena Eagan, right?

140
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,312
I think her innie name's "Heleny"?

141
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,401
<i>Honestly,
I love that you had that experience.</i>

142
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,113
<i>So, now you could imagine,</i>

143
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,116
<i>like, what you and Heleny have</i>

144
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:53,411
<i>but multiply, like, thousands of days</i>

145
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:57,832
of, like, joy, and arguments, and passion,

146
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,502
then you can see why
I have to get my wife back.

147
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,255
I have to have her back.

148
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,738
It's Helly, actually. Helly.

149
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,910
It's the person I'm in love with,

150
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,954
<i>which you'd know if you'd ever
taken an interest in my life.</i>

151
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,333
Before tonight, when you need something.

152
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:45,338
She's the person I'll lose
if I do what you say

153
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:50,761
'cause you know as well as I do
that her outie won't, like, reintegrate,

154
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,473
<i>assuming that's even real.</i>

155
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,893
<i>Assuming every word
outta your mouth isn't a lie.</i>

156
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,603
Wha...

157
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,400
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...</i>

158
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,819
Dude, I'm just trying
to save my wife, okay?

159
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,574
<i>I mean, I can't abandon her,
and if you help me,</i>

160
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,369
I won't abandon you. I promise.

161
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,539
You know what I think? I think
the second you get your wife back,

162
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,416
you forget I ever existed.

163
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:27,005
I think that I disappear
along with every innie down there.

164
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,674
What do you want from me?

165
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,634
We are in this together.

166
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,096
Can't you just trust me?

167
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,351
No.

168
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,313
Devon!

169
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,566
He's a fucking child. He won't listen.

170
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,733
Let me speak to him.

171
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,279
I mentioned reintegration,
he basically called bullshit.

172
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,738
Well, he's not wrong, right?

173
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,491
Let me speak to him.

174
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,244
Alone.

175
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,330
Okay. Yeah.

176
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,173
Okay.

177
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,022
The numbers are your wife.

178
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,031
The MDR numbers.

179
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,866
From your console.

180
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:50,422
They're a doorway into the mind
of your outie's wife, Gemma Scout.

181
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,638
I don't understand.

182
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,603
What do you see every day
when you look at them?

183
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:17,741
What... we feel things.

184
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:22,913
What do you feel?

185
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,669
Different things. Sometimes sadness...

186
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,587
Woe.

187
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:33,590
Frolic.

188
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,594
Malice.

189
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,722
Dread.

190
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,603
So you're saying the...

191
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,272
the clusters are...

192
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,149
Her tempers.

193
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,864
The building blocks of her mind.

194
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,826
What am I building?

195
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,000
Every file you've completed...

196
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,504
<i>is a new consciousness for her.</i>

197
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,762
A new innie.

198
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,063
I've completed 24 files.

199
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,318
Cold Harbor is the last.

200
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,991
Tomorrow will be your final day at Lumon.

201
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:46,580
You will have served your purpose,
and so will she.

202
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,385
Wait, why are you telling me this?

203
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,435
What are you doing here, really?

204
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:15,025
Mark. Mark.

205
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:23,242
There'll be no honeymoon ending
for you and Helly R.

206
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,080
She's an Eagan.

207
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,000
You're nothing to them.

208
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,627
- No.
- Nothing to her.

209
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,128
No, I don't believe you.

210
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,505
They're using you.

211
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,215
No! I don't believe you!

212
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,592
Then they'll discard you like a skin husk.

213
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,345
- I think you're using me!
- Mark!

214
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,848
- Reintegration is your only chance!
- Wait.

215
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,767
- Do you love your brother?
- Mark!

216
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,351
Yes.

217
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,854
Well, then you tell him
that the next thing I see

218
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,480
had better be the severed floor,

219
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,441
or I swear he will never
see his wife again.

220
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,110
I care for you.

221
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,194
Stop!

222
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,321
Mark.

223
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,935
I have to tell you something.

224
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,645
Me too.

225
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,701
Fuck me.

226
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:04,713
"Mark, The Founder wished to witness
the historic completion of your 25th file.

227
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:11,136
Helly R. shall also bear witness
from her chair.

228
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,185
Goodly splendors await upon your victory.
Love, Mr. Milchick."

229
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,436
Jame Eagan was here.

230
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,773
He came to see me.

231
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:10,403
He said some cryptic shit
about the fire of Kier being in me,

232
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:14,116
and that today is a special day.

233
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,373
I know why.

234
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,963
I know why they're doing this.

235
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,022
Hello, Dylan.

236
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,317
He said no?

237
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,155
Follow me.

238
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,363
<i>So, what happens
when they extract the chip?</i>

239
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,539
But how can we trust anything Cobel says?

240
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,166
All she's ever done is lie.

241
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,128
I know, but she seemed different.

242
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:56,008
I mean, she's the same, but,
like, different same.

243
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,511
I don't know.

244
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,185
I mean, I could just not do it.

245
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:09,898
I could just not finish the file,
not get her out.

246
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,027
But if she's telling the truth,
we're screwed either way.

247
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,703
What's happening?

248
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,538
Just get dressed.

249
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,624
Everything is gonna be fine.

250
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:39,344
But if you get her out, maybe that will
take down Lumon, like his sister said.

251
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,142
And maybe you can do this combining thing.

252
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:50,147
Well, yeah, but he could be a total liar.

253
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,900
What if he's not?

254
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,324
At least you'll have a chance at living.

255
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,999
Yeah, but I wanna live with you.

256
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,262
But I'm her, Mark.

257
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,354
I'm her.

258
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:50,916
Okay.

259
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,799
Your outie has responded
to your resignation request.

260
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,139
As it may yield an embarrassing
emotional response in you,

261
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,432
and as I'm duly swamped,

262
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,102
I shall leave you to read it in solitude.

263
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,172
"Dear innie,

264
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:26,053
I've read your request and organized
my response into three points.

265
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,056
Point one: fuck you."

266
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,812
<i>Gretchen is my wife and my beloved,</i>

267
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,442
<i>and your actions with her
were deeply fucking indecorous.</i>

268
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,030
<i>Point two:</i>

269
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,534
<i>I get it.</i>

270
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:56,667
<i>She's perfect, and given our shared
physiology, it tracks that you'd agree.</i>

271
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,087
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

272
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:05,425
<i>I've never been an impressive person,</i>

273
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:12,724
<i>so when Gretch told me that
you're, like, this self-assured badass,</i>

274
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,185
<i>I don't know.</i>

275
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,729
<i>It stung.</i>

276
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,150
<i>So I guess, point three is:</i>

277
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:29,157
<i>I hope someday she sees in me
what she sees in you.</i>

278
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:36,248
<i>In the meantime,
if I'm being really honest,</i>

279
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,043
<i>I guess I like knowing you're there.</i>

280
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:49,011
<i>So if you wanna leave, you can.</i>

281
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:53,348
<i>But I think you should stay.</i>

282
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:03,692
<i>Sincerest regards, Your outie.</i>

283
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:56,995
Been trying to think
of other place names besides Delaware.

284
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:07,297
I've got Europe, Zimbabwe...

285
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:14,888
and the Equator.

286
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,391
The Equator?

287
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,021
Is that a building?

288
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,065
Or a continent.

289
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,238
Maybe it's just a building
that's, like, so big...

290
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,407
That it became a continent.

291
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,742
Yeah.

292
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,664
Yeah.

293
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,931
I just wish we had more time.

294
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,786
Least it's a happy one.

295
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,786
Call Mr. Eagan.

296
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,166
<i>Mark S.,</i>

297
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:35,839
<i>in completing your 25th Macrodata file,</i>

298
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:42,846
<i>you have drawn my grand agendum
nearer to fulfillment,</i>

299
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:46,057
<i>thus making you</i>

300
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:50,562
<i>one of the most
important people in history.</i>

301
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:56,485
<i>Revel now in the fruit of your labors,</i>

302
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,364
<i>and hail your earthbound steward,</i>

303
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,575
<i>your very own...</i>

304
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:09,748
<i>floor manager!</i>

305
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,385
Thank you, Kier.

306
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:27,682
And may I say,
you're looking very handsome, sir.

307
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:28,766
<i>Thank you.</i>

308
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,644
<i>I'd say the same of you,</i>

309
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:34,982
<i>if not for my favorite core principle.</i>

310
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:37,734
Probity?

311
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:41,864
<i>No.
Vision.</i>

312
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:50,163
Well, it's truly special
to host a man so illustrious,

313
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:54,000
so sapient, so magnanimous--

314
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,461
<i>My, you're verbose.</i>

315
00:38:57,296 --> 00:39:00,716
<i>Good thing you didn't write
the first appendix.</i>

316
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,968
<i>It would've burst.</i>

317
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:17,858
It's an honor to receive your barbs,
Mr. Eagan.

318
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:23,946
The legacy you've left behind
is truly and irrefutably larger than life.

319
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,949
<i>You mean my company?</i>

320
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,119
No.

321
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,667
I mean this wax statue that's five inches
taller than you actually were.

322
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:52,351
<i>Thank you for that feedback...</i>

323
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:56,688
<i>Seth.</i>

324
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,777
Thank you, Kier.

325
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:07,698
And now, lady and gentleman of MDR,

326
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:13,705
may I introduce
Choreography and Merriment!

327
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:34,852
Let's go.

328
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:51,785
Mark!

329
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,071
Mark!

330
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:52,471
<i>Welcome, Mr. Eagan.</i>

331
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:56,016
<i>The efficacy test will begin shortly.</i>

332
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,692
Thank you, C&M.

333
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:09,612
Let's keep the Mark S. love going...

334
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:10,988
I have to leave.

335
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,075
...with the Ballad of Ambrose

336
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:15,619
and Gunnel.

337
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:04,877
You ready?

338
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:08,589
Yeah.

339
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:12,176
See you at the Equator.

340
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:16,013
See you at the Equator.

341
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:17,658
Hey. Can I get a little help?

342
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:28,288
Hey!

343
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:36,380
Can I get a little help here?

344
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,097
Helly.

345
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:47,932
Where's Mark?

346
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,184
I don't know!

347
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,486
- Hey.
- Yeah.

348
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,973
Enter the room.

349
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:05,052
Enter the room.

350
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:32,955
Who are you?

351
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:45,634
<i>I don't know.</i>

352
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:13,829
Mammalians Nurturable brings an offering.

353
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,082
Has it verve?

354
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,419
It does.

355
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:23,255
Wiles?

356
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:28,051
The most of its flock.

357
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:59,958
This beast will be entombed
with a cherished woman,

358
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:04,630
whose spirit it must guide to Kier's door.

359
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:06,715
Is it up to the task?

360
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,010
It is.

361
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,841
Then give me its life.

362
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,771
Take it apart.

363
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:11,572
Helly!

364
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:13,740
Excuse me.

365
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:30,299
We commit this animal to Kier,

366
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,927
and his eternal war against pain.

367
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:14,676
How many?

368
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:19,181
How many what?

369
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,811
How many more must I give?

370
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:32,194
As many as the Founder calls.

371
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,321
Mark S.

372
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:24,161
Wrong door.

373
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,706
I'm leaving, okay?

374
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:03,577
Oh, fuck.

375
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:02,803
No more killing.

376
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:57,690
Wait, wait, wait!

377
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,276
Wait! Wait.

378
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:07,826
Please. Please. Please.

379
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,265
The barrier is holding.

380
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,606
<i>She feels nothing.</i>

381
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,950
It's beautiful.

382
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:17,396
Thank you.

383
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:20,023
Emile thanks you.

384
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,028
Emile is the name of the goat.

385
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:28,490
Okay.

386
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,376
Okay.

387
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:43,337
Now, in a second
I'm gonna change to my outie,

388
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:46,008
and then you are gonna take him to--

389
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,367
What are you doing?

390
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:39,830
Those instruments are property
of Choreography and Merriment.

391
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:58,348
Choreography and Merriment,
return to your department now!

392
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,896
Fall back to C&M.
Our performance has been compromised.

393
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:07,648
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

394
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:08,692
Wait.

395
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:12,112
This desk used to have four seats.

396
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:16,700
Our friend Irving is gone,

397
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:18,744
and they want our whole department gone.

398
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:22,539
If he gets out, we're dead.

399
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:27,544
They're gonna turn us off
like fucking machines.

400
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:30,255
You've seen them do it.

401
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,219
I know you've lost friends too.

402
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:39,681
And you could be next.

403
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:42,893
You could be next.

404
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,065
They give us half a life
and think we won't fight for it.

405
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:55,697
Right, Milchick?

406
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:03,538
Please, help us.

407
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:04,957
Please.

408
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:07,125
Help us.

409
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,297
- How did you get in here?
- Jesus.

410
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,550
Open the door.

411
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:17,635
- Step off, fucko.
- Do it.

412
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:21,765
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Now. Do it! Go! Go!

413
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:25,393
No! No, fuck you! Fuck you!

414
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:28,230
No! Dr. Mauer! Fuck you!

415
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,955
Jesus. Fuck.

416
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,256
Gemma?

417
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:43,096
It's okay. It's me.

418
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:00,989
I'm your husband.

419
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,663
I'm your husband.

420
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,999
Okay.

421
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:17,130
<i>Your name is Gemma Scout.</i>

422
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:22,677
<i>We'd been married for four years.</i>

423
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:23,762
No.

424
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:26,014
We were...

425
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,021
We had a life together...

426
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,275
<i>Don't speak to that man.</i>

427
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:38,527
<i>He's here to hurt you.</i>

428
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:44,658
And if you come with me right now,
we can get it back.

429
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:47,202
No.

430
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,081
<i>Stop.</i>

431
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:56,085
<i>This is not a part of the test.</i>

432
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:58,630
- Please.
- <i>Don't let him touch you.</i>

433
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:00,799
We have to go.

434
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:05,679
<i>Stop!</i>

435
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,098
Oh, fuck.

436
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:13,770
Mr. Drummond. Mr. Drummond. Damn!

437
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,191
It's okay.

438
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:24,573
Fuck!

439
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:30,870
It's the fucking spouse!

440
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,748
Call Drummond!

441
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:45,510
Okay. You can come. It's okay.

442
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:46,720
Come on.

443
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:49,765
Come on.

444
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:52,100
Come on out.

445
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:53,644
It's okay.

446
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:04,196
Mark.

447
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:30,806
Come on.

448
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:57,791
<i>Gemma!</i>

449
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:02,171
Gemma!

450
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:25,611
Gemma. Stop!

451
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:28,447
Gemma. Stop!

452
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,783
No, no, no.

453
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:33,744
No.

454
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:35,913
You'll kill them all!

455
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:58,810
Mark S.?

456
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:00,729
Ms. Casey.

457
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,527
What's taking place?

458
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:13,492
Come on.

459
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:26,230
Okay. Come on.

460
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:27,315
Okay.

461
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,610
- You have to go right now. Go.
- Where?

462
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:32,361
Come on! You gotta go right now!

463
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:34,238
Go.

464
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:42,038
Fuck you, Mr. Milchick.

465
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:56,886
Mark. Mark, come on.

466
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,264
Come on, Mark.

467
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:02,475
Come on. We have to go.

468
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:06,522
Mark! Mark, open the door. Come on.

469
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,609
What are you doing?

470
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:12,444
Open the door.

471
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:14,446
Mark, we gotta go home.

472
01:09:15,863 --> 01:09:16,865
Mark.

473
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:20,577
Mark, come on. Mark, open the door.

474
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:25,206
Mark, you have to come.
Open the door. Come on.

475
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:26,500
Mark.

476
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:34,508
Mark!

477
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:38,095
Mark!

478
01:09:42,683 --> 01:09:45,894
What? Mark!

479
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:50,231
Mark! Mark!

480
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:53,526
Goddamn it, Mark,
we have to get out of here.

481
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:57,822
Mark! Mark! We have to get out of here!

482
01:09:57,823 --> 01:10:02,703
