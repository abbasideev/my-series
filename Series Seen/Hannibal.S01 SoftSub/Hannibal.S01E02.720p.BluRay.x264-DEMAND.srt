1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,445
(Lecter)
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,090
(Crawford) 'You make jumps
you can't explain.'

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,283
- The evidence explains.
- Then help me find some evidence.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,640
I wouldn't put him out there!

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,764
Should he get too close, I need you
to make sure he's not out there alone.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,087
(Graham) 'I don't think the Shrike
killed that girl in the field.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,885
'This girl's killer thought
she was a pig.'

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,047
Think this was a copycat?

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,447
I think I can help good Will
see his face.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,128
- Hello?
- They know.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,809
You said he wouldn't get too close.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,160
See?

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,762
(Muffled gunshots)

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,330
We're here.

15
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,127
It could be a permanent installation
in your Evil Minds Museum.

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,641
Well, what we learn
about Garrett Jacob Hobbs

17
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,206
will help us catch
the next one like him.

18
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,449
There's still seven bodies
unaccounted for.

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,283
Yeah, well, he was eating them.

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,767
Had to be some parts
he wasn't eating.

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,090
Not necessarily.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,046
All right, what if Hobbs wasn't
eating alone? It's a lot of work.

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,845
Disappearing these girls,
butchering them

24
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,691
and not leaving a shred of anything
other than what's in this room.

25
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,247
- Someone he hunted with.
- Someone who was in a coma.

26
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,170
Who also happened to be
someone he hunted with.

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,242
Abigail Hobbs is a suspect?

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,727
We've been conducting
house-to-house interviews

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,208
at the Hobbs residence
and at this property also.

30
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,447
Hobbs spent a lot of time here.

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,648
Spent a lot of time
with his daughter here.

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,445
She would make the ideal bait,
wouldn't she?

33
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,329
Hobbs killed alone.

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,251
Ah. Someone else was here.

35
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,969
(Applause)

36
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,604
Thank you.

37
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,208
Please stop that.

38
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,884
This is how I caught
Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

39
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,366
It's his resignation letter.

40
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,248
Does anybody see the clue?

41
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
There isn't one.

42
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,167
He wrote a letter, left a phone number,
no address. That's it.

43
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,890
Bad bookkeeping and dumb luck.

44
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,889
(Gas-ping)

45
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,724
Garrett Jacob Hobbs is dead.
The question now is

46
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,606
how to stop those
his story is going to inspire.

47
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,328
He's already got one admirer.

48
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,163
A copycat.

49
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,406
Hi.

50
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,244
How are you, Will?

51
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,128
Uh, I have no idea.

52
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,131
- I didn't want you to be ambushed.
- This is an ambush?

53
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,969
Ambush is later.

54
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,082
Immediately later, soon to now.

55
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,009
When Jack arrives,
consider yourself ambushed.

56
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,804
Here's Jack.

57
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,968
How was class?

58
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,082
They applauded.
It was inappropriate.

59
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,522
The review board would beg to differ.
You're up for a commendation.

60
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,689
And they've okayed
active return to the field.

61
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,610
The question is, do you want
to go back to the field?

62
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,131
I want him back in the field.

63
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,925
And I've told the board
I'm recommending a psych eval.

64
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,406
- Are we starting now?
- The session wouldn't be with me.

65
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,928
Hannibal Lecter's a better fit.
Your relationship's not personal.

66
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,964
But if you are more comfortable
with Dr Bloom...

67
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,404
No, I'm not going to be comfortable
with anybody inside my head.

68
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,564
You've never killed anyone before.
It's a deadly force encounter.

69
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,251
- It's a lotto digest.
- I used to work Homicide.

70
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,727
The reason you currently
used to work Homicide

71
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,684
is because you didn't have
the stomach for pulling the trigger.

72
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,087
You just pulled the trigger
ten times.

73
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,048
Wait, so a psych eval
isn't a formality?

74
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,288
No, it's so I can get
some sleep at night.

75
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,289
I asked you to get close
to the Hobbs thing.

76
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,687
I need to know
you didn't get too close.

77
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,408
How many nights did you spend
in Abigail Hobbs' hospital room, Will?

78
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,402
- Therapy doesn't work on me.
- Hmm...

79
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,203
Therapy doesn't work on you
because you won't let it.

80
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,049
Because I know all the tricks.

81
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,527
Perhaps you need
to unlearn some tricks.

82
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,642
Why not have a conversation
with Hannibal?

83
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,809
He was there.
He knows what you went through.

84
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,242
Come on, Will.

85
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,886
I need my beauty sleep!

86
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,967
- What's that?
- Your psychological evaluation.

87
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,768
You are totally functional
and more or less sane. Well done.

88
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,282
- Did you just rubber stamp me?
- Yes.

89
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,722
Jack Crawford may lay his weary head
to rest knowing he didn't break you

90
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,764
and our conversation can proceed
unobstructed by paperwork.

91
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,089
Jack thinks I need therapy.

92
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,567
You need a way out of dark places
when Jack sends you there.

93
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,207
Last time he sent me into a dark place,
I brought something back.

94
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,687
A surrogate daughter?

95
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,210
You saved Abigail Hobbs's life.
You also orphaned her.

96
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,322
That comes with certain
emotional obligations,

97
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,283
regardless of empathy disorders.

98
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,131
You were there. You saved her life too.
Do you feel obligated?

99
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,408
Yes.

100
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,245
I feel a staggering amount
of obligation.

101
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,765
I feel responsibility.

102
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,320
I've fantasised about scenarios
where my actions

103
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,886
may have allowed
a different fate for Abigail Hobbs.

104
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,769
Jack thinks Abigail Hobbs
helped her dad kill those girls.

105
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,521
How does that make you feel?

106
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,041
How does it make you feel?

107
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,924
- I find it vulgar.
- Me too.

108
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,206
- And entirely possible.
- It's not what happened.

109
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,041
Jack will ask her when she wakes up,
or he'll have one of us ask her.

110
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,845
Is this therapy,
or a support group?

111
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,762
It's whatever you need it to be.

112
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,564
And, Will,

113
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,729
the mirrors in your mind
can reflect the best of yourself,

114
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,241
not the worst of someone else.

115
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,408
What is that?

116
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,803
- I bet it's marijuana.
- Mushrooms.

117
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,082
Look, they got tubes
to water 'em or something.

118
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,123
No, it's a marijuana plant.

119
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,048
That's not marijuana.

120
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,443
(Gunshots)

121
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,126
I'm pretty sure firearm accuracy
isn't a prerequisite for teaching.

122
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,449
Well, I've been in the field before.

123
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,809
- Now you're back in the saddle. Ish.
- Ish, indeed.

124
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,969
Took me ten shots to drop Hobbs.

125
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,687
Zeller wanted to give you the bullets
he pulled out of Hobbs in an acrylic case,

126
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,643
but I told him
you wouldn't think it was funny.

127
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,524
Probably not.

128
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,087
I suggested one of those
clackin' swingin' ball things.

129
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,968
That would've been funny.

130
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,642
You're a Weaver.
I took you for an isosceles guy.

131
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,765
I have a rotator cuff issue,
so I have to use the Weaver stance.

132
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,850
- You are tight.
- I got stabbed when I was a cop.

133
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,442
Yeah, I got stabbed in the third grade
with a number two pencil.

134
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,409
Thought I was gonna get
lead poisoning.

135
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,564
Uh, no lead in pencils,
it's graphite.

136
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,001
See if that helps with the recoil.

137
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,011
That was better.

138
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,691
You come all the way down here
to teach me how to shoot?

139
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,600
No. Jack sent me down here to find out
what you know about gardening.

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,848
So, Lecter gave you the all-clear.
Therapy might work on you after all.

141
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Therapy is an acquired taste
which I have yet to acquire.

142
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,771
But it served your purpose.
I'm back in the field.

143
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,048
Local police found some tyre tracks
on a hidden service road

144
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,447
and some small animal traps
in the surrounding area.

145
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,649
He wanted to keep his crop
undisturbed.

146
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,047
The only thing missing
is the scarecrow.

147
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,003
OK, we've got nine bodies,
various stages of decay,

148
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,964
and as you can see,
all very well fertilised.

149
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,401
He buried them
in a high-nutrient compost.

150
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,927
He was enthusiastically
encouraging decomposition.

151
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,203
They were buried alive with the intention
of keeping them that way...

152
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,651
I mean, for a little while.

153
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,243
Long enough for the fungus to eat away
any distinguishing characteristics.

154
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,400
Line and rebar were used to administer
intravenous fluids after they were buried.

155
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,608
He was feeding them something.

156
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,169
No restraints?

157
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,961
Just dirt.

158
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,410
The other end of the air-supply system
comes up over there.

159
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,688
It isn't a very considerate
clean air solution,

160
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,247
which clearly wasn't a priority,
cos he isn't lazy.

161
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,049
No, he's not.

162
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,246
- You find any shiitakes?
- No.

163
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,250
Welcome back.

164
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,006
Tell Sam to give me a call, will you?
Thank you.

165
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,730
Excuse me.

166
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,128
I'm one of the parents
of the explorers who found the bodies.

167
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,561
I wanted to thank you
for being so good with all the boys.

168
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,889
- Those boys were very brave.
- They are good boys.

169
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,651
- You're a local police detective?
- Yes, ma'am.

170
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,127
Would it be an imposition
to ask a few things?

171
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,005
The boys are gonna have questions,
and I just wanna be honest with them...

172
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,202
Of course. Yeah, yeah.

173
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,041
Can you tell me what that man
is doing over there by himself?

174
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,323
He's some kind of special consultant.
Works for the FBI.

175
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,965
Huh...

176
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,882
(Electricity buzzing)

177
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,443
(Sound distorts)

178
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,808
(Soft ambient pulse)

179
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,242
(Sound returns to normal)

180
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,770
I do not bind his arms or legs
as I bury him in a shallow grave.

181
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,363
He's alive. But he will never
be conscious again.

182
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,362
He won't know that he's dying.

183
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,249
I don't need him to.

184
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,401
This is my design.

185
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,050
- I think your family's leaving.
- We drove separately.

186
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,409
(Muffled gasp)

187
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,049
(Gas-ping)

188
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,168
Don't touch him!

189
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,766
(Man) Oh, my god!

190
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,842
(Graham) This may have
been premature.

191
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,847
What did you see, out in the field?

192
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,209
Hobbs.

193
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,448
- An association?
- No, a hallucination.

194
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,444
I saw him lying there
in someone else's grave.

195
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,243
- Did you tell Jack what you saw?
- No.

196
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,001
It's stress. Not worth reporting.

197
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,441
You displaced the victim
of another killer's crime

198
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,321
with what could arguably
be considered your victim.

199
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,761
I don't consider Hobbs my victim.

200
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,403
What do you consider him?

201
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,365
Dead.

202
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,323
Is it harder imagining the thrill
somebody else feels killing,

203
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,410
now that you've done it yourself?

204
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,762
The arms.
Why did he leave them exposed?

205
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,290
To hold their hands?
To feel the life leaving their bodies?

206
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,289
No, that's too esoteric for someone

207
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,687
who took the time to bury his victims
in a straight line.

208
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,771
- He's more practical.
- He was cultivating them.

209
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,406
He was keeping them alive.
He was feeding them intravenously.

210
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,006
But your farmer let his crops die.
Save for the one that didn't.

211
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,441
And the one that didn't
died on the way to the hospital.

212
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,409
No, they weren't crops,
they were the fertiliser.

213
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,040
The bodies were covered in fungus.

214
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,640
The structure of a fungus
mirrors that of the human brain,

215
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,047
an intricate web of connections.

216
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,442
So maybe he admires
their ability to connect

217
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,648
the way human minds can't.

218
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,286
- Yours can.
- (Laughs) Yep.

219
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,244
Um... Yeah, not physically.

220
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,764
Is that what your farmer is looking for?
Some sort of connection?

221
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,367
Have a good evening, Will.

222
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,525
- Miss Kimball?
- Yes.

223
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,563
Good evening. Please come in.

224
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,889
I've... never seen
a psychiatrist before.

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,447
And I am unfortunately
thorough,

226
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,810
so you're one of three doctors
I'm interviewing.

227
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,048
It's more or less a bake-off.

228
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,447
I'm very supportive of bake-offs.

229
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,206
It's important you find someone
you're comfortable with.

230
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,689
I can imagine you as my therapist,
which is good.

231
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,203
If I can't visualise opening up emotionally,
I know it would be a problem.

232
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,130
May I ask why now?

233
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,686
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions first?

234
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,962
Of course not.

235
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,845
I love that you've written
so much on social exclusion.

236
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,645
Since that's why I'm here,
I was wondering...

237
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,128
Are you Freddie Lounds?

238
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,002
This is unethical,
even for a tabloid journalist.

239
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,043
I am, uh...

240
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,563
I am so embarrassed.

241
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,766
I'm afraid I must ask for your bag.

242
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,247
- What?
- Your bag.

243
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,966
Please hand it over.

244
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,048
I'd rather not take it from you.

245
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,365
Thank you.

246
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,560
I was recording our conversation.

247
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,044
Our conversation?
Yours and mine?

248
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,091
Yes.

249
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,443
- No other conversation?
- No.

250
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,891
You were very persistent
about your appointment time.

251
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,762
How did you know
when Will Graham would be here?

252
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,882
I may have also recorded
your session with Will Graham.

253
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,810
You didn't answer the question.
How did you know?

254
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,251
I can't answer that question.

255
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,770
Come. Sit by me.

256
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,846
Delete the conversations
you recorded.

257
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,850
Doctor/patient confidentiality
works both ways.

258
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,809
Delete it, please.

259
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,371
You've been terribly rude,
Miss Lounds.

260
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,811
What's to be done about that?

261
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,449
(♪ Johann Sebastian Bach:
"Cello Suite No 4 Prelude")

262
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,331
(Lecter) Loin, served with
a Cumberland sauce of red fruits.

263
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,841
Er... loin? What kind?

264
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,042
- Pork.
- Wonderful.

265
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,085
I don't get many opportunities
to eat home-cooked meals.

266
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,330
My wife and I both work,
and as hard as I tried not to,

267
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,171
I did wind up marrying my mother.

268
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,449
- Your mother didn't cook?
- She did, she did.

269
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,080
I only wish she didn't.

270
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,409
There was this meal she used to prepare.
She liked to call it "oriental noodles".

271
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,849
Spaghetti, soy sauce,
bouillon cubes and spam.

272
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,406
I was very thin as a youngster.

273
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,407
Well, next time, bring your wife.

274
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,609
- I'd love to have you both for dinner.
- Thank you.

275
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,925
Mmm.

276
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,444
Lovely. So, why do you think
Will Graham came back to see you?

277
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,285
I'm sure he recognises the necessity
of his own support structure

278
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,129
if he is to support you in the field.

279
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,211
I believe that Will Graham knows exactly
what's going on inside of his head,

280
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,687
which is why he doesn't want
anyone else up there.

281
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,451
Are you not accustomed
to broken ponies in your stable?

282
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,807
You think Will Graham's
a broken pony?

283
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,129
I think you think
Will is a broken pony.

284
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,210
Have you ever lost a pony, Jack?

285
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,130
If you're asking me whether or not
I've ever lost someone in the field,

286
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,049
the answer is yes. Why?

287
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,322
I want to understand
why you're so delicate with Will.

288
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,001
Because you don't trust him or because
you're afraid of losing another pony?

289
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,803
I've already had my psych eval.

290
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,405
Not by me.

291
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,610
You've already told me about
your mother. Why stop there?

292
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,241
Oh, great. All right.

293
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,210
Mm.

294
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,326
What were they soaked in?

295
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,047
A concentrated mixture of hardwoods,
shredded newspaper and pig poop,

296
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,083
perfect for growing mushrooms
and other fungi.

297
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,965
It was not the mushrooms, though.
They all died of kidney failure.

298
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,764
Dextrose in all the catheters.

299
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,087
He probably used some kind
of dialysis or peristaltic

300
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,726
to pump fluids after their
circulatory systems broke down.

301
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,683
Force-feeding them sugar water?

302
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,451
(Zeller) Know who loves sugar water?
Mushrooms. They crave it.

303
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,967
Recovering alcoholics.
They crave sugar.

304
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,321
- Don't take that personally, buddy.
- Oh, I'm not recovering.

305
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,445
Feed sugar to the fungus in your body,
the fungus creates alcohol,

306
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,285
so it's like friends
helping friends, really.

307
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,610
It's not just alcoholics who have
compromised endocrine systems.

308
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,331
They all died of kidney failure?

309
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,243
Death by diabetic ketoacidosis.

310
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,330
- Did you know they were diabetics?
- We don't know they were diabetics.

311
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,525
No, they're all diabetics. He induces
a coma and puts them in the ground.

312
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,324
How's he inducing diabetic comas?

313
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,442
Changes their medication.
So he's a doctor or a pharmacist.

314
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,887
Or he works somewhere
in medical services.

315
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,924
He buries them, feeds them sugar
to keep them alive long enough

316
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,088
for the circulatory systems
to soak it up.

317
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,682
- So he can feed the mushrooms!
- We dug up his mushroom garden.

318
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,246
Yeah, he's gonna want
to grow a new one.

319
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,011
I'm picking up a prescription
for Gretchen Speck.

320
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,884
Gretchen Speck... (Typing)

321
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,809
- Horowitz.
- Oh, it's just Speck.

322
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,242
We're divorced.
I lost the hyphen, kept the ring.

323
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,567
- Insulin.
- Yes.

324
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,445
Oh...

325
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,409
Oh, it's the wrong one. Just...

326
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,006
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, it's OK.

327
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,168
Just gonna be one second.

328
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,769
There. There you go.

329
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,604
Oh, could you sign here please?

330
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,084
- And that's your correct address?
- Yeah.

331
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,162
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

332
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,845
Mrs James.

333
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,048
If you could sign here, please?

334
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
Thank you.

335
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,764
She's the chain's tenth
diabetic customer to disappear

336
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,530
after filling a prescription
for insulin,

337
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,529
second to disappear
from this exact location.

338
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,449
- And the other eight?
- All over the county.

339
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,682
One pharmacist
all over the county as well.

340
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,121
- Floater, huh?
- Floater's floating right here.

341
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,244
Still logged in at his work station.

342
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,091
Everyone please stop
what you are doing!

343
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,248
Put your hands in the air!

344
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,121
Special Agent Jack Crawford.
Which one of you is Eldon Stammets?

345
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,247
Eldon was just here.
Just now.

346
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,168
Is his car still in the parking lot?

347
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,850
His car!

348
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,083
Give me your baton.

349
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,250
(Coughs)

350
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,010
She's alive!

351
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,282
(Coughing)

352
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,970
EMTs! Now!

353
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,810
All right.

354
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,641
We know his name,
we have his address, we have his car.

355
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,923
Jack. We just checked the browser
history at Stammets' work station.

356
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,202
- Am I gonna wanna hear this?
- No.

357
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,971
And yes, but mostly no.

358
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,527
- Freddie Lounds.
- Tattlecrime.com.

359
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,246
"The FBI isn't just hunting
psychopaths,

360
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,125
"they're headhunting them too,
offering competitive pay and benefits

361
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,130
"in the hopes
of using one demented mind..."

362
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,890
Keep going.

363
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,451
(Katz) It's about Will.
(Crawford) Go on.

364
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,807
"One demented mind to catch..."

365
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,571
- She goes into a lot of detail.
- Son of a bitch!

366
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,561
You are naughty, Miss Lounds.

367
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,283
(Knocking)

368
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,209
Who is it?

369
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,128
(Knocking)

370
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,604
Who is it?

371
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,051
(Zeller) All clear.

372
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,242
I appreciate the pageantry,
Agent Crawford,

373
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,647
but you can't arrest me
for writing an article.

374
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,967
You entered a federal crime scene
without permission.

375
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,845
- Escorted by a detective.
- Under false pretence!

376
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,849
It is as good as permission.

377
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,281
You lied to a police officer.

378
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,402
You can't arrest me for lying.

379
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,367
You got all that information
from a local detective?

380
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,291
Lots of talk about your man Graham.

381
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,607
Not to mention the rivalry
of who gets the collar.

382
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,766
A local police detective looking
for a pissing contest with the FBI

383
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,530
might have some insight.

384
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,041
- (Crawford) And evidently did.
- Sure did.

385
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,640
You know, the unfortunate
timing of your article

386
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,001
allowed a murderer to escape.

387
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,964
(Yelps)

388
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,566
You were in Minnesota.

389
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,331
You were in the Shrike's nest.
You know how I know?

390
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,768
Cos you left one of these hairs behind.
You contaminated the crime scene.

391
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,087
Just like everywhere you go,
you contaminate crime scenes.

392
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,762
That's obstructing justice.
I can indict you for obstructing justice.

393
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,808
I'd appreciate it if you didn't.

394
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,242
You don't write another word
about Will Graham and I won't have to.

395
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,006
(Zeller) You used me.

396
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,443
(Monitor beeps, ventilator pumps)

397
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,886
(Echoing footsteps)

398
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,923
(Bloom) "...he and the Grandmother
discussed better times.

399
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,281
"The old lady said that,
in her opinion,

400
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,927
"Europe was entirely to blame
for the way things were now.

401
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,361
- "She said..."
- What are you reading?

402
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,683
Flannery O'Connor.

403
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,289
When I was Abigail's age,
I was obsessed.

404
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,405
I even tried to raise peacocks
because she raised peacocks, but...

405
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,369
They were really stupid birds.

406
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,562
- You could be reading to a killer.
- Innocent until guilty and all that.

407
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,967
I'm about to broach the subject
of that "Takes One to Know One" article.

408
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,243
Oh, that.

409
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,240
- Did Jack send you?
- No, I sent me.

410
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,605
I don't think we've ever been alone
in a room together, have we?

411
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,968
I haven't noticed. Have we?

412
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,843
Not that we're necessarily
alone now.

413
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,361
Yeah, right. Back to...

414
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,649
- "Jack Crawford's crime gimp".
- It certainly creates an image.

415
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,047
I don't need to talk about it
if you don't.

416
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,848
No, no, we can talk about
or not talk about whatever you want.

417
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,241
Actually, I was... I was just
enjoying listening to you read.

418
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,969
Abigail Hobbs is a success for you.

419
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,766
She doesn't look like a success.

420
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,327
Don't feel sorry for yourself
because you saved this girl's life.

421
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,651
I don't.
I don't feel sorry for myself at all.

422
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,762
I feel, um...

423
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,969
I-I...

424
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,809
I feel, um...

425
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,250
...good.

426
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,243
Don't know where you got
half that information. It wasn't from me.

427
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,922
- I may have made some inferences.
- They think I told you all of it.

428
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,883
They saw you talking to me.

429
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,402
They also think it's my fault
Stammets escaped.

430
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,690
- I'm sorry I got you fired.
- I wasn't fired. I was suspended.

431
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,690
They're gonna fire you.
Jack Crawford will make sure of that.

432
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,802
You...

433
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,844
You stir the hornet's nest,
and I'm the one who gets stung?

434
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,248
I can help you get work
outside the force, if you want me to.

435
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,046
I know people in private security.

436
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,801
Not the first cop you got fired.

437
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,843
Guarantee you it pays better.

438
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
Right now, future you
is thanking me.

439
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,444
I read your article.

440
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,602
Tell me about Will Graham.

441
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,128
(Lounds) Jack?

442
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,208
Miss Lounds?

443
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,601
Go ahead and stand down, officer.
Miss Lounds, are you all right?

444
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,125
Where's Will Graham?

445
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,322
We have an eyewitness to the murder.
We don't need Will Graham.

446
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,602
No, that's not why I'm asking.

447
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,769
Someone find me Will Graham!
This is about Will?

448
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,450
He was talking about people

449
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,285
- having the same properties of a fungus.
- Stammets?

450
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,927
Thoughts leaping from brain to brain.
They mutate, they evolve.

451
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,648
- What does he want with Will Graham?
- Someone who understands him.

452
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,650
Graham was right.
Stammets is looking for connections.

453
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,364
What did you tell him?

454
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,811
I need to know what you told
Eldon Stammets about Will Graham.

455
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,641
- I told him about the Hobbs girl.
- What did you tell him?

456
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,125
Everything-

457
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,323
He wants to help Will Graham
connect with Abigail Hobbs.

458
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,761
He's gonna bury her.

459
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,250
Sorry.

460
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,084
(Phone rings)

461
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,882
- Hello?
- 'It's Jack. Are you at the hospital?'

462
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,571
- Yes, I am.
- 'Stammets knows about Abigail.'

463
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,043
Where is she? Abigail Hobbs,
the girl in 408. Where is she?

464
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,049
- They took her for tests.
- Who took her?

465
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,606
- Who took her?
- I... I don't know.

466
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,401
Hey!

467
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,564
(Grunts in pain)

468
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,648
What were you gonna do to her?

469
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,001
We all evolved from mycelium.

470
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,282
I'm simply reintroducing her
to the concept.

471
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,289
By burying her alive?

472
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,687
The journalist said
you understood me.

473
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,564
I don't.

474
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,968
Well, you would have.
You would have.

475
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,164
If you walk through a field of mycelium,
they know you are there.

476
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,681
'The spores reach for you
as you walk by.'

477
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,084
I know who you're reaching for.
I know.

478
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,689
Abigail Hobbs.

479
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,201
And you should have let me
plant her.

480
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,721
You would have found her
in a field,

481
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,571
where she was finally
able to reach back!

482
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,641
(Lecter) 'When you shot
Eldon Stammets,

483
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,444
'who was it that you saw?'

484
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,640
I didn't see Hobbs.

485
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,923
Then it's not Hobbs's ghost
that's haunting you, is it?

486
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,561
It's the inevitability of there being
a man so bad that killing him felt good.

487
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,603
Killing Hobbs felt just.

488
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,210
Which is why you're here,
to prove that sprig of zest you feel

489
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,926
is from saving Abigail,
not from killing her dad.

490
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,250
I didn't feel a sprig of zest
when I shot Eldon Stammets.

491
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,761
You didn't kill Eldon Stammets.

492
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,249
I thought about it.

493
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,680
I'm still not entirely sure that wasn't
my intention, pulling the trigger.

494
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,723
If your intention was to kill him,

495
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,287
it's because you understand
why he did the things he did.

496
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,448
It's beautiful in its own way...

497
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,601
...giving voice to the unmentionable.

498
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,890
I should've stuck to fixing
boat motors in Louisiana.

499
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,881
A boat engine is a machine,
a predictable problem, easy to solve.

500
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,571
You fail, there's a paddle.
Where was your paddle with Hobbs?

501
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,923
- You're supposed to be my paddle.
- I am.

502
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,163
It wasn't the act of killing Hobbs
that got you down, was it?

503
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,810
Did you really feel so bad
because killing him felt so good?

504
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,362
I liked killing Hobbs.

505
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,444
Killing must feel good to God too,

506
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,841
he does it all the time.

507
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,201
And are we not created in his image?

508
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,561
That depends who you ask.

509
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,243
God's terrific.

510
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,207
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

511
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,290
last Wednesday night in Texas,
while they sang a hymn.

512
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,085
Did God feel good about that?

513
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,764
He felt powerful.
