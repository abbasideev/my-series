1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,729
(Graham) 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,608
Abigail Hobbs killed Nick Boyle.
We can tell no one.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,525
(Lecter) I'm worried about you, Will.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,449
You empathise completely
with the killers

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,602
Jack Crawford has your mind
wrapped around

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,688
that you lose yourself to them.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,567
- Maybe I should get a brain scan.
- Do you feel unstable?

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,681
Is there a problem, Will?

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,768
- You lost time.
- There's something wrong with me.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,930
(Lecter) I don't care about the lives
you save. I care about your life.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,883
Your life is separating from reality.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,725
(Car alarm bleeps)

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,804
(Banging)

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,842
(Whistles)

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,522
(Bird chirps)

16
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,322
(Creaking)

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,284
(Water dripping)

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,931
(She sighs)

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,002
(Shivering)

20
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,051
(Sighs)

21
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,322
(Floorboards creak)

22
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,528
(Gasps and screams)

23
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,802
I can feel my nerves
clicking like roller-coaster cogs,

24
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,641
pulling up to the inevitable long plunge.

25
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,603
Quick sounds. Quickly ended.

26
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,164
Abigail Hobbs ended Nicholas Boyle.

27
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,811
Like a burst balloon.

28
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,530
She took a life.

29
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,649
- You've taken a life.
- Yeah... Yeah, so have you.

30
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,365
You're grieving, Will.

31
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,047
Not for the life you have taken,
but for the life that was taken from you.

32
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,606
If Abigail could have started over,
left the horror of her father behind,

33
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,404
so could have you.

34
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,529
You could untangle yourself
from the madness and the murder.

35
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,170
We lied for her.

36
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,166
We both know the unreality
of taking a life.

37
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,041
Of people who die
when we have no other choice.

38
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,970
We know in those moments
they are not flesh.

39
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,762
But light and air and colour.

40
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,203
Isn't that what it is to be alive?

41
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,290
Do you feel alive, Will?

42
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,441
I feel like I'm fading.

43
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,641
Have you experienced any further
loss of time or hallucinations?

44
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,525
Yeah.

45
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,930
I'd like you to draw a clock face.

46
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,525
Numbered.

47
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,610
Small hand indicating the hour,
large hand the minute.

48
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,447
- Why?
- An exercise.

49
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,051
I want you to focus
on the present moment. The now.

50
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,130
Often as you can,
think of where you are. And when.

51
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,131
Think of who you are.

52
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,802
7:16pm.

53
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,121
I'm in Baltimore, Maryland.

54
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,329
And my name is Will Graham.

55
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,601
A simple reminder.

56
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,885
The handle to reality
for you to hold on to.

57
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,043
And know you're alive.

58
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,762
(Birds squawking)

59
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,725
(Gasps)

60
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,682
(Panting)

61
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,040
(Pants)

62
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,322
Will?

63
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,885
- What happened in there?
- I got confused.

64
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,004
I've seen you confused and upset,
but I've never seen you afraid like this.

65
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,363
Well, I'm an old hand at fear.
I can manage this one.

66
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,329
I just got disoriented.
I can go back in.

67
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,011
I saw the look on your face
when you came out of that room.

68
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,330
Now what did you experience in there
that's got you mute all of a sudden?

69
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,568
I can see and hear better afraid.

70
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,162
I-I just can't speak as concisely.

71
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,205
Will, you contaminated the crime scene.
You've never done that before.

72
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,848
I thought I was responsible for it.

73
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,927
You thought that you killed
that woman in there?

74
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,769
Sometimes with what I do...

75
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,966
What you do is you take all of
the evidence available at a crime scene.

76
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,411
You extrapolate.

77
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,610
You reconstruct
the thinking of a killer.

78
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,801
You don't think of yourself
as the killer.

79
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,764
I got lost in the reconstruction.

80
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,849
Just for a second. Just a blink.

81
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,762
You don't like
to be the cause for concern,

82
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,609
but I am officially concerned about you.

83
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,326
- Officially?
- Yes, that's right.

84
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,845
Hmm.

85
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,163
I thought the reason you had me seeing
Dr Lecter and not an FBI psychiatrist

86
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,764
is so my mental wellbeing
stays... unofficial.

87
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,121
I just wanna be careful with you.

88
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,687
We don't wanna break you here.
Is that what's happening?

89
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,165
Have I broken you?

90
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,323
Do you have anyone that does this
better unbroken than I do broken?

91
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,162
Fear makes you rude, Will.

92
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,285
(Camera shutter clicks)

93
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,962
(Zeller) Her name was Beth LeBeau.
She drowned on her own blood.

94
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,688
And what she didn't drown on
is all over the floor and under the bed.

95
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,404
She was trying to hide from him.

96
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,848
He dragged her there.
He was waiting under the bed for her.

97
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,883
Fought to claw her way out.

98
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,731
He knew her. Someone who cared
about her or thought he did.

99
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,126
(Katz) He cared too much.

100
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,961
So we're looking for boyfriends,
ex-boyfriends, co-workers,

101
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,730
the guy who bags her groceries.

102
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,049
I've got a clean set of prints on
the knife handle. I assume they're yours.

103
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,371
- Sorry.
- Mm.

104
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,285
There's other dermal tissue,
presumably from the killer's.

105
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,281
The skin is so diseased or damaged,
it didn't leave any useful prints.

106
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,688
The victim scratched her killer
to pile tissue under the fingernails,

107
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,450
but never drew blood.

108
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,841
Why didn't he bleed?

109
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,170
After he cut up the victim's face, looks
like he was trying to pull her skin back.

110
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,722
Like he was removing a mask?

111
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,725
I still have the coppery smell of blood
on my hands.

112
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,562
I can't remember seeing the crime scene
before I saw myself killing her.

113
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,167
Those memories sank out of sight,
yet you're aware of their absence.

114
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,843
There's a grandiosity
to the violence that I imagined

115
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,521
that feels more real
than what I know is true.

116
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,210
What do you know to be true?

117
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,402
I know I didn't kill her.

118
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,882
I couldn't have,
but I remember cutting into her.

119
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,729
I remember watching her die.

120
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,765
You must overcome these delusions
that are disguising your reality.

121
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,085
What kind of savage delusions
does this killer have?

122
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,680
It wasn't savage. It was lonely.

123
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,604
It was desperate. Sad.

124
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,690
I caught a glimpse of myself
in the mirror

125
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,009
and I looked right through me.

126
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,361
Past me,
as if I was... was just a stranger.

127
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,367
You have to honestly confront
your limitations with what you do.

128
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,851
(Sighs heavily)

129
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,291
And how it affects you.

130
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,722
If by limitations you mean the difference
between sanity and insanity,

131
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,171
I don't accept that.

132
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,731
What do you accept?

133
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,969
I know what kind of crazy I am
and this isn't that kind of crazy.

134
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,811
This could be... seizures.

135
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,329
This could be a tumour.

136
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,242
A...a blood clot.

137
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,082
I can recommend a neurologist.

138
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,442
But if it isn't physiological,

139
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,571
then you have to accept what
you're struggling with is mental illness.

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,809
You're in very good hands.

141
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,803
Dr Lecter here is
one of the sanest men I know.

142
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,445
I would agree.

143
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,683
Dr Sutcliffe and I were residents
together at Hopkins.

144
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,805
Another life ago. Back when you weren't
afraid to get your hands a little dirty.

145
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,922
I was always drawn
to how the mind works.

146
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,850
I found it much more dynamic
than how the brain works.

147
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,089
The projected image is more
interesting than the projector,

148
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,521
until, of course,
the projector breaks down.

149
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,881
So, Will... these headaches.

150
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,728
- When did they begin in earnest?
- Two to three months ago.

151
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,640
About the time Will went back
into the field, which is when I met him.

152
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,841
- And the hallucinations?
- I can't really say when they started.

153
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,410
Um... I just slowly became aware
that I might not be dreaming.

154
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,284
(Lecter) It's encephalitis.

155
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,529
- That's your pre-diagnosis?
- Yes.

156
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,087
- Based on?
- I could smell it.

157
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,448
So your sense of smell has gone
from calling out a nurse's perfume

158
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,763
to diagnosing auto-immune disease.

159
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,362
He started sleepwalking
and I noticed a very specific scent.

160
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,569
And what exactly does
encephalitis smell like?

161
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,089
It has heat. A fevered sweetness.

162
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,970
If you suspected,
why didn't you say something?

163
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,211
Had to be sure.

164
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,729
Symptoms began slowly
and gradually worsened.

165
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,446
And yesterday,
I asked him to draw a clock.

166
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,890
This is what he drew.

167
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,641
(Sutcliffe) Oh. Spatial neglect.

168
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,209
Headaches, disorientation,
hallucinations, altered consciousness.

169
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,004
It's all the telltale signs.

170
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,684
It is so rare to be able
to study the psychological effect

171
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,849
of this type of malady
on a person's mind.

172
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,365
It's more rare still to be able
to study the neurological effects.

173
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,729
A doctor has to weigh
the ultimate benefit of scientific study.

174
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,162
Even in these times,
we know so little about the brain.

175
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,248
There are great discoveries to be made.

176
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,047
(Scanner whirrs)

177
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,042
(Woman screams)

178
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,610
The right side of his brain
is completely inflamed.

179
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,367
It's anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

180
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,568
The symptoms are only
going to get worse.

181
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,684
I know. It's unfortunate for Will.

182
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,845
What do you smell on me?

183
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,924
Opportunity.

184
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,722
We didn't find anything abnormal.

185
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,606
No vascular malformations,
no tumours, no swelling or bleeding,

186
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,131
no evidence of stroke.

187
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,371
Nothing.

188
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,364
There's nothing wrong with you
neurologically.

189
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,371
So what I'm experiencing
is psychological?

190
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,729
Well, brain scans can't diagnose...
mental disorders.

191
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,411
They can only rule out medical illnesses,

192
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,564
like a tumour,
which can have similar symptoms.

193
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,088
Look, we'll run some more tests.

194
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,202
We'll take some more blood samples,

195
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,006
but I imagine they'll prove
to be just as inconclusive.

196
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,131
You knew from the moment
you walked into his classroom

197
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,687
that you were putting Will
in a potentially destructive environment.

198
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,963
I had eight college girls
dead in Minnesota.

199
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,562
- Will caught their killer for me.
- He also caught that killer's disease.

200
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,925
He can't stop thinking
about what it is to take a life.

201
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,283
I'd rather he go a little mad
than other innocents lose their lives,

202
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,767
and I think he would feel the same way.

203
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,211
Will is an innocent.

204
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,451
(Sighs)

205
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,125
Yes, he is.

206
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
I mean, Will is genuine.

207
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
He'll survive anything
I could put him through.

208
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,440
He will always fight his way
back to himself.

209
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,771
Not always. So far.

210
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,127
He saw a neurologist today.

211
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,323
They found nothing wrong with him.
He was very upset by that.

212
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,167
You're saying
he wanted something to be wrong?

213
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,610
I think he wanted an answer
that wasn't mental illness.

214
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,690
You think he's mentally ill.

215
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,050
The problem Will has
is too many mirror neurons.

216
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,091
Our heads are filled with them
when we are children.

217
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,851
It's supposed to help us socialise
and then melt away.

218
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,930
But Will held on to his, which makes
knowing who he is a challenge.

219
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,441
When you take him
to a crime scene, Jack,

220
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,402
the very air has screams smeared on it.

221
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,722
In those places, he doesn't just reflect.

222
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,171
He absorbs.

223
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,850
It's 10:36.

224
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,208
I'm in Greenwood, Delaware.

225
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,849
My name is Will Graham.

226
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,529
(Gasps)

227
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,843
It's 1:17am.

228
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,531
W-w-we're in Greenwood, Delaware.

229
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,005
And my name is Will Graham.

230
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,171
And you're alive.

231
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,170
If you can hear me... you're alive!

232
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,929
Why did you call me?

233
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,202
Why not Jack? Why not the police?

234
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,810
I called you

235
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,290
because... I'm not entirely sure
what I saw was real.

236
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,250
Then let's prove it.

237
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,566
I grabbed her arm.

238
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,002
And an entire layer of dead skin
separated from the underlying tissue,

239
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,282
like she was wearing a glove.

240
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,324
- That's why she doesn't bleed.
- There's no circulation.

241
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,444
- Nothing alive in the tissue to bind it.
- What did you do with it?

242
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,131
(Panting)

243
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,526
- I don't know.
- You can't remember?

244
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,724
Could be a staphylococcal infection.
That or leprosy.

245
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,083
Her eyes were discoloured.
She was malnourished. Jaundiced.

246
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,204
Her liver was shutting down.
She was...

247
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,565
...deranged.

248
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,286
So she mutilated a woman's face
because she thought it was a mask.

249
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,921
She can't see faces.

250
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,561
If she did kill Beth LeBeau,
she might not even know she did it.

251
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,569
- Then why did she come back?
- To convince herself she didn't.

252
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,171
Is that why you came back?

253
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,285
If I wasn't clear on that issue,
I know I didn't kill Beth LeBeau.

254
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,566
I just wanna know who did.

255
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,966
Me, too.

256
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,851
Yeah.

257
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,611
You're the subject of a lot
of speculation at the Bureau.

258
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,121
Oh, yeah?
What are they speculating?

259
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,561
That Jack pushed you
right up to the edge

260
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,250
and now you're pushing yourself over.

261
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,005
This killer... can't accept her reality.

262
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,127
I can occasionally identify with that.

263
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,127
That said, I feel... relatively sane.

264
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,166
It's 7:05pm.

265
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,886
I'm in Baltimore, Maryland.

266
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,322
My name is Will Graham.

267
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,963
Thank you for humouring me.

268
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,961
I feel like I'm seeing a ghost.

269
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,287
- Regarding this killer or yourself?
- Both.

270
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,609
Well, she's real. You know she's real.
There's evidence.

271
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,885
When you found her,
your sanity did not leave you.

272
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,125
- Time did.
- You lost time again?

273
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,810
I spoke to Dr Sutcliffe. We briefly
discussed the particulars of your visit.

274
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,843
Would you like to discuss them
with me?

275
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,964
There are no particulars.
He didn't find anything wrong.

276
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,401
Then we keep looking for answers.

277
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,931
Perhaps you would permit me
to run some tests of my own.

278
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,526
You wouldn't publish anything about me,
would you, Dr Lecter?

279
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,446
If there were ever anything that
might be of therapeutic value to others,

280
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,809
I'd abstract it in a form
that would be totally unrecognisable.

281
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,286
Just do me a favour
and publish it posthumously.

282
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,605
- After your death or mine?
- Whichever comes first.

283
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,162
Have you considered
Cotard's syndrome?

284
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,050
It's a rare delusional disorder in which
a person believes he or she is dead.

285
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,322
Are you talking about the killer or me?

286
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,602
- The killer, of course.
- Well, of course.

287
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,167
Um... she couldn't see the victim's face.

288
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,090
Or she was trying to uncover it.

289
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,609
The inability to identify others
is associated with Cotard's.

290
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,929
It's a misfiring in the areas of the brain
which recognise faces

291
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,523
and also in the amygdala, which
adds emotion to those recognitions.

292
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,003
Even those closest to her
would seem like imposters.

293
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,091
So she reached out to someone
she loved, someone she trusted.

294
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,690
She felt betrayed, became violent.

295
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,521
She can't trust anything or anyone
she once knew to be trustworthy.

296
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,649
Her mental illness won't let her.

297
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,002
(Breathes heavily)

298
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,442
(Panting)

299
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,962
(Gas-ping)

300
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,084
(Crawford) We matched tissue
samples from the crime scene

301
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,929
to your daughter's medical records.

302
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,884
I was almost relieved
when I got that phone call.

303
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,004
I thought that you had found her
and she was...

304
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,124
- Would be at peace.
- You thought she might be dead.

305
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,131
(Chuckles) Well, that makes me sound
like a horrible mother.

306
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,451
I tried to be a good mum.

307
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,807
I tried to do everything that I could.

308
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,684
I just don't want her to be in pain.

309
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,646
No one's doubting your dedication
to your daughter, Mrs Madchen.

310
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,842
How well did she know Beth LeBeau?

311
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,564
They were best friends,
they went to school together,

312
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,207
until it was unsafe
for Georgia to go to school.

313
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,126
When did you first recognise
that your daughter

314
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,242
was struggling with mental illness?

315
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,685
When she was nine

316
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,247
and she told me that
she was thinking about killing me

317
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,170
and said that
she was already dead.

318
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,283
What sort of symptoms did she have?

319
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,568
She had seizures, hallucinations,

320
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,444
psychotic depression.

321
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,527
I was grateful
when she was catatonic.

322
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,008
- (Crawford) Was she ever violent?
- Sometimes.

323
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,803
What did her doctor say?

324
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,650
Not much.

325
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,401
She spent months at a time
in the hospital.

326
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,451
Blood tests and brain scans,
and all of them inconclusive.

327
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,202
They could never tell me
what was wrong.

328
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,806
And you still don't know?

329
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,007
They would just say
it was this or it was that.

330
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,565
They would just...

331
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,163
They were just always guessing.

332
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,450
And I did my own research.

333
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,570
I wrote down every word
that the doctors said,

334
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,444
the different terminology.

335
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,367
Learned a lot.
But mostly what I learned is...

336
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,442
...how little is actually known
about mental illness.

337
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,891
All they know,
it's rarely about finding solutions.

338
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,765
It's just more
about managing expectations.

339
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,202
Managing your expectations?

340
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,800
Changing my expectations.

341
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,971
You know, when Miriam Lass died,

342
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,890
I had to come back here
to this office to pack up.

343
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,320
But that got to be too overwhelming.

344
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,442
I thought I should just leave,

345
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,807
seeing as how I had gotten
a trainee killed.

346
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,163
That lack of leadership on my part,
that was my responsibility.

347
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,250
You didn't kill Miriam Lass.
The Chesapeake Ripper did.

348
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,408
It didn't feel that way to me.

349
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,928
I pulled her out of a classroom,
like I pulled you out of a classroom.

350
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,647
Oh... No, she was a student.
I'm a teacher.

351
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,161
I'm still just as responsible for you
as I was for her.

352
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,930
I'll take my own responsibility.

353
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,646
Well, not from me you won't.
We can do it together.

354
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,889
I broke the rules with Miriam.

355
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,925
I encouraged her to break the rules.
I am breaking the rules with you now.

356
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,361
By letting an unstable agent
do field work?

357
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,808
Special agent. You represent the FBI.
You still represent me.

358
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,322
- Have I misrepresented you, Jack?
- No, no. But you have me curious.

359
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,286
Why are you still here
when the both of us know

360
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,890
that this is bad for you?

361
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,364
- Do you want me to quit?
- No.

362
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,528
No, you had an opportunity to quit.

363
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,411
You didn't take it. Why not?

364
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,610
Let me tell you what I think.

365
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,202
I think that the work you do here
has created a sense of stability for you.

366
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,770
Stability is good for you, Will.

367
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,248
Stability requires strong foundations.
My moorings are built on sand.

368
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,330
I'm not sand. I am bedrock.

369
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,001
When you doubt yourself,
you don't have to doubt me, too.

370
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,768
(Lecter) The Jamón Ibérico.

371
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,724
Still love your little rare treats,
don't you, Hannibal?

372
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,162
More expensive and difficult
they are to obtain, the better.

373
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,965
(Lecter) It's a distinction that adds
an expectation of quality.

374
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,570
Not always.

375
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,844
Well, for Ibérico, only a few thousand
are selected each year.

376
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,645
But is the pig,

377
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,206
once fattened and slaughtered
and air-cured,

378
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,004
really superior to any other pig?

379
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,090
Or is it simply a matter
of reputation preceding product?

380
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,124
It's irrelevant.

381
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,041
If the meat-eater thinks it's superior,
then belief determines value.

382
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,689
A case of psychology
overriding neurology.

383
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,088
So we know how Ibérico gets his pigs.

384
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,603
How did you get yours?

385
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,008
Are you referring to Will Graham?

386
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,166
We know you're fond of the rarified.

387
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,089
What makes him so rare?

388
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,010
Will has a remarkably vivid imagination.

389
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,725
Beautiful.

390
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,330
Pure empathy.

391
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,370
Nothing he can't understand
and that terrifies him.

392
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,121
So you set his mind on fire.

393
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,682
Imagination is
an interesting accelerant for a fever.

394
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,521
So... how far does this go?

395
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,365
Do you put out the fire...

396
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,529
...or do you let him burn?

397
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,568
Will is my friend.

398
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,729
We will put out the fire
when it's necessary.

399
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,647
He has asked for more tests.

400
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,045
Now that we have confirmed what it is,
it'll be easier to hide from him.

401
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,290
Put these in.

402
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,323
This'll be over before you know it.

403
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,605
Dr Sutcliffe?

404
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,011
You're clean.

405
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,764
You couldn't have done this
without getting something on you,

406
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,245
and there's nothing on you.

407
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,089
I don't feel clean.

408
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,402
The murder weapon has the same
sort of diseased or damaged tissues

409
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,767
that we found
at Beth LeBeau's house.

410
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,089
What's this guy got to do
with the other victim?

411
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,565
Just me.

412
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,205
What do you remember?

413
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,886
I remember coming here,

414
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,961
going into the MRI, getting out
and finding Dr Sutcliffe's body.

415
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,411
No confusion.

416
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,402
Well, not that I'm aware of.

417
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,040
Was your Dr Sutcliffe in the habit
of seeing patients after hours

418
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,128
when he's the only one in the office?

419
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,524
He was very accommodating.

420
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,082
Georgia Madchen
followed you here...

421
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,640
...and while you're ticking away
in the MRI,

422
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,808
she does this to your doctor.

423
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,001
- Why him?
- (Graham) She can't see faces.

424
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,963
Maybe she thought he was me.

425
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
All right, while we're at it, why you?

426
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,763
I don't know.

427
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,201
I have a habit of collecting strays.

428
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,846
I-I told her,
tried to tell her the night I saw her.

429
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,930
I tried to tell her she was alive.
Maybe she heard me.

430
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,251
Maybe that hadn't occurred to her
in a while.

431
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,802
(Dog growling)

432
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,561
(Growling and barking)

433
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,169
(Groans and gasps)

434
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,805
I see you, Georgia.

435
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,244
Think of who you are.

436
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,291
It's midnight.

437
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,441
You're in Wolf Trap, Virginia.

438
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,728
Your name is Georgia Madchen.

439
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,684
You're not alone.

440
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,167
We are here together.

441
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,563
Am I alive?

442
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,400
(Crawford) She'll recover?
(Lecter) Risk of infection is high.

443
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,610
She's lost most of the vital fluids.
Even some bone mass.

444
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,688
She's being treated like a burn victim.

445
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,322
- But she'll recover mentally?
- She has Cotard's syndrome.

446
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,683
Almost all sufferers of this delusion
recover with treatment.

447
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,563
In extreme cases like this one,
electroconvulsive therapy.

448
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,364
I'm more concerned about Will.

449
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,128
I thought you'd be more concerned
about your colleague Dr Sutcliffe.

450
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,609
I am grieving Dr Sutcliffe.
But Will is very much alive.

451
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,328
He's still desperate for an explanation
that can make everything right again.

452
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,967
I'm pretty desperate
for some explanations myself.

453
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,644
I really want to talk to this
young woman when she comes to.

454
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,123
How much do you think
she'll remember?

455
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,843
Well, I sincerely hope, for her sake,
she doesn't remember much.

456
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,804
(Sniffs)
