1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,240
(Lecter)
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,002
"Layers and layers of lies betrayed
by a sad glint in a child's eyes."

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,205
How did you feel like seeing Marissa
Schurr impaled in his antler room?

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,651
Guilty.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,082
- Because you couldn't save her?
- Because I felt like I killed her.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,965
Our friend Will seems haunted today.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,926
(Lecter) We don't know what nightmares
lie coiled beneath Will's pillow.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,203
At night I leave the lights on
in my little house

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,402
and walk across the flat fields.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,167
'When I look back from a distance,
the house is like a boat on the sea.'

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,931
It's really the only time I feel safe.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,850
- Children transport us to our childhoods.
- What do you see, Will?

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,884
Will may feel the tug of life
before the FBI, before you.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,604
He needs an anchor, Jack.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,849
- Where are you going?
- I wanna go home.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,884
(stag snorts)

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,370
(Siren blasts)

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,204
You lost?

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,565
What?

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,089
- What's your name?
- Will Graham.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,963
Do you know where you are,
Mr Graham?

22
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,006
No.

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,891
Where do you live?

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,810
Wolf Trap, Virginia.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,322
We're in Wolf Trap, so that's good.
You're close to home.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,565
Is that yours?

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,089
Oh, hi, Winston. Hey...

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,567
Can I sit down? My feet are sore.

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,363
- Why don't we take you home?
- OK.

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,681
Are you on any drugs? Medication?

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,882
- Prescription or otherwise?
- No.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,241
- You been drinking?
- No.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,249
Uh, yes. Not excessively.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,091
I had two fingers of whiskey
before I went to bed.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,966
Do you have a history
of sleepwalking, Mr Graham?

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,606
I'm not even sure if I'm awake now.

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,925
Although I may be, is it safe to assume
you're not sleepwalking now?

38
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,762
- Sorry it's so early.
- Never apologise for coming to me.

39
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,089
Office hours are for patients.
My kitchen is always open to friends.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,209
Onset of sleepwalking in adulthood
is less common than in children.

41
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,970
Could it be a seizure?

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,082
I'd argue good old-fashioned
post-traumatic stress.

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,089
Jack Crawford has gotten
your hands very dirty.

44
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,680
I wasn't forced back into the field.

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,930
I wouldn't say "forced". "Manipulated"
would be the word I'd choose.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,247
I can handle it.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,681
Somewhere between denying
horrible events and calling them out

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,280
lies the truth of psychological trauma.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,767
So I can't handle it.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,247
Your experience may have
overwhelmed ordinary functions

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,089
that give you a sense of control.

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,851
If my body is walking around
without my permission,

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,281
you'd say that's a loss of control?

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,368
Wouldn't you?

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,524
Sleepwalkers demonstrate
a difficulty handling aggression.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,725
Are you experiencing difficulty
with aggressive feelings?

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,404
You said Jack sees me as fine china
used for special guests.

58
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,531
I'm beginning to feel
more like an old mug.

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,602
You entered into a devil's bargain
with Jack Crawford, it takes a toll.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,768
Jack isn't the devil.

61
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,208
When it comes to how far he's willing
to push you to get what he wants,

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,209
he's certainly no saint.

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,451
(Crawford) Room was registered
to a John Smith.

64
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,888
- Heh! Big surprise there.
- An appalling failure of imagination.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,445
They paid cash.

66
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,241
There are no security cameras on
the premises, another big surprise.

67
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,089
John Smith one of the victims?

68
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,009
Mr and Mrs Anderson,
according to the register.

69
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,248
They were mutilated and displayed.

70
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,604
I thought it was the Chesapeake Ripper,
but there were no surgical trophies taken.

71
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,927
- I need you to prepare yourself on this.
- I'm prepared.

72
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,442
- Prepare yourself more. It's soup in there.
- Soup isn't good for the soul.

73
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,730
Not this kind. All right, look,
there are no jurisdictional rivalries here.

74
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,605
The local police begged us to take this.
Where's your head?

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,326
It's on my pillow. I didn't sleep.

76
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,371
Got just the thing to wake you up.

77
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,362
OK, I'm awake.

78
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,722
Hooks were bored into the ceiling.

79
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,006
Fishing line was used to hold up
the bodies and... the wings.

80
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,851
- At least we know he's a fisherman.
- (Price) And/or a Viking.

81
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,088
Vikings do this?

82
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,602
Vikings used to execute Christians
by breaking their ribs,

83
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,688
bending them back
and draping the lungs over them

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,282
to resemble wings.
They used to call it a "blood eagle".

85
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,610
- Pagans mocking the God-fearing?
- Then who's mocking who?

86
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,044
No, he isn't mocking them...
he's transforming them.

87
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,084
I don't know if it was a good night's sleep,
but he slept here.

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,601
Hair on the pillow
and the sheets are still damp.

89
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,609
He's a sweater.

90
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,882
Madness slept here last night.

91
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,010
- He threw up on the nightstand.
- Couldn't stomach what he did.

92
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,600
Flop sweat
and nervous indigestion.

93
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,451
Not nervous.

94
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,887
Righteous.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,971
He thinks he's...
elevating them somehow.

96
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,566
I need a plastic sheet for the bed.

97
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,886
This is not who you are.

98
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,729
This is my gift to you.

99
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,605
I allow you to become angels.

100
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,962
And now,

101
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,401
I lay me down to sleep.

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,810
(♪ Classical music playing)

103
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,046
A masterpiece foie gras au torchon
with a late harvest of Vidal sauce...

104
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,321
...with dried and fresh figs.

105
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,249
Wonderful.

106
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,250
Mrs Crawford, your husband
introduced you as Bella.

107
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,362
Are you an Isabelle
or an Annabelle?

108
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,682
I'm a Phyllis.

109
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,088
Jack only calls me Phyllis
when we disagree.

110
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,930
So, named Bella for your beauty.

111
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,203
We were both stationed in Italy.
I was Army, she was NATO staff.

112
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,769
All of the Italian men kept calling her,
"Bella, Bella, Bella."

113
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,928
Well, I wanted her to be my Bella.

114
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,245
Mmm...

115
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,603
Cold foie gras with warm figs.

116
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,801
Yes.

117
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,524
Very nice.

118
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,966
Would I be a horrible guest
if I skipped this course?

119
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,048
- Too rich?
- Too cruel.

120
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,609
- Phyllis.
- Jack.

121
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,725
First and worst sign of sociopathic
behaviour: cruelty to animals.

122
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,206
Oh, that doesn't apply in the kitchen.

123
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,848
I have no taste for animal cruelty,
which is why I employ an ethical butcher.

124
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,521
An ethical butcher?
Be kind to animals and then eat them.

125
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,405
I'm afraid I insist on it.

126
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,007
No need for unnecessary suffering.

127
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,242
Human emotions are a gift
from our animal ancestors.

128
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,523
Cruelty is a gift
humanity has given itself.

129
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,965
The gift that keeps on giving.

130
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,650
(Sniffs)

131
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,047
Your perfume is exquisite.

132
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,963
Similar to the aroma on the air
just after lightning strikes.

133
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,086
Is it Dior?

134
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,646
That is some nose
you have there, Doctor.

135
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,604
(Crawford) He really is
quite charming, isn't he?

136
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,850
I first noticed my keen sense of smell
when I was a young man.

137
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,124
I was aware one of my teachers had
stomach cancer even before he was.

138
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,002
Wow, that must've been
some parlour trick.

139
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,964
For our next course,
roasted pork shank.

140
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,291
And I assure you, Bella, it was
an especially supercilious pig.

141
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,206
"Death makes angels of us all
and gives us wings

142
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,403
"where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's claws."

143
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,370
- (Zeller) Robert Frost.
- Jim Morrison.

144
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,528
Even a drunk with a flair
for the dramatic

145
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,008
can convince himself he's God,
or the lizard king.

146
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,602
(Price) God makes angels.
Jesus was fond of fishermen.

147
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,848
Are we talking hardcore
Judeo-Christian upsetting,

148
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,010
- or just upsetting in general?
- This is a very specific upsetting.

149
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,603
Increased serotonin in the wounds is
much higher in the free histamines,

150
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,530
so she lived for about 15 minutes
after she was skinned.

151
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,806
(Price) Powder residue on the neck
of the soda bottle shows Vecuronium,

152
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,003
scotch and soda
and a paralytic agent.

153
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,805
Kneeling in supplication
at the feet of G dash D.

154
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,881
Supplication is the most common form
of prayer. "Gimme, gimme, gimme."

155
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,170
They weren't praying to him.

156
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,964
They were praying for him.

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,082
He's afraid.

158
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,966
What is somebody who could
do something like this afraid of?

159
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,931
- What's in his vomit?
- Uh, Dexamethasone...

160
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,929
(Zeller) That's used for patients
with tumours.

161
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,883
- Kepra...
- He's epileptic.

162
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,809
- Radiation?
- Gamma four.

163
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,085
Steroids for the inflammation,
anticonvulsants for the seizures,

164
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,966
radiation for the chemotherapy.
Our guy has a brain tumour.

165
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,124
He's afraid of dying in his sleep.

166
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,885
He's making angels
to watch over him.

167
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,929
Mrs Crawford...

168
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,281
Please come in.

169
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,684
- How often do you see him?
- Twice a week at first.

170
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,325
Now usually just once.

171
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,643
- You're satisfied, then?
- Enough to keep seeing him.

172
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,206
Your intention is not to tell Jack.

173
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,407
I don't see what good it would do.

174
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,766
Jack sees the world at its worst,
I don't need him seeing me at mine.

175
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,521
He already has too much
to worry about.

176
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,325
He has room for one more worry.

177
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,204
- I feel like you're protecting him.
- I am.

178
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,807
I've had dinner at your home.

179
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,767
You have a professional
relationship with my husband.

180
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,043
There's no conflict of interest,
me being here?

181
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,209
It's unorthodox, but not unheard of.

182
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,810
Given the nature of your problem,
seeing someone who knows Jack

183
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,649
removes some of the guesswork.

184
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,089
This all started
as some misguided stab

185
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,009
at maintaining my dignity.

186
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,203
Nothing undignified about this.

187
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,129
Not yet.

188
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,842
But I have indignity
to look forward to, don't I?

189
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,164
The only indignity I see
is resentment.

190
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,806
Why do you resent your husband?

191
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,371
I resent that Jack...

192
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,886
has too much to worry about,

193
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,207
to worry about me.

194
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,369
But that's your choice, not his.

195
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,081
Then maybe you should see us
both for couples counselling.

196
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,966
I would recommend
another psychiatrist for couples.

197
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,527
I wouldn't want you to have
the home-couch advantage.

198
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,248
It's hard enough dealing
with how I feel about all of this.

199
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,125
I don't need to deal
with how Jack feels about it.

200
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,970
There is no one and only
spiritual centre of the brain.

201
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,401
Any idea of God comes from
many different areas of the mind

202
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,927
working together in unison.

203
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,769
Maybe I was wrong.

204
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,006
How do you profile
someone who has

205
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,044
an anomaly in their head
changing the way they think?

206
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,607
A tumour can definitely
affect brain function,

207
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,722
even cause vivid hallucinations.

208
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,844
However, what appears to be
driving your angel maker

209
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,169
to create heaven on earth
is a simple issue of mortality.

210
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,169
Can't beat God, become him?

211
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,167
- You said he was afraid.
- He feels abandoned.

212
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,206
- Ever feel abandoned, Will?
- Abandonment requires expectation.

213
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,006
What were your expectations
of Jack Crawford and the FBI?

214
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,365
- Jack hasn't abandoned me.
- Not in any discernible way.

215
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,047
Perhaps in the way
gods abandon their creations.

216
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,889
You say he hasn't abandoned you,

217
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,651
but, at the same time, you find yourself
wandering around Wolf Trap

218
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,250
in the middle of the night.

219
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,728
Well...
This should be interesting.

220
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,929
Please, Doctor, proceed.

221
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,364
Jack gave you his word
he would protect your headspace,

222
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,761
yet he leaves you
to your mental devices.

223
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,126
Are you trying to alienate me
from Jack Crawford?

224
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,640
I'm trying to help you understand
this angel maker you seek.

225
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,808
Well, help me understand
how to catch him.

226
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,049
If he were a classic paranoid
schizophrenic,

227
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,606
you might be able to influence him
to become visible.

228
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,610
What, scare him out into the daylight?

229
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,405
Might even get him to hurt himself,
if he hasn't already.

230
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,246
If he were self-destructive,
he wouldn't be so careful.

231
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,762
Unless he's careful
about being self-destructive,

232
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,320
making angels to pray over him
when he sleeps.

233
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,770
Who prays over us when we sleep?

234
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,889
So do you wait until you think
I'm asleep before you come to bed?

235
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,561
It's not intentional. I'm working late.

236
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,641
Nothing personal.

237
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,846
Can we have a conversation or do you
wanna pretend that everything's all right?

238
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,849
Everything is all right.

239
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,089
So, no conversation.

240
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,046
I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment.

241
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,926
- With?
- With things at work...

242
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,042
Etcetera.

243
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,243
I've got some things
I have to sort through.

244
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,091
It's, uh, outside
your jurisdiction, Jack.

245
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,123
You know something...

246
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,411
I'm very good at sorting things out.

247
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,360
At the very least I can underwhelm you
while you're being overwhelmed.

248
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,648
You've never been able
to underwhelm me.

249
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,242
Is there anything I can offer you
romantically or physically

250
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,169
or spiritually that'll help?

251
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,566
Nope.

252
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,362
So, as your husband,
what I can do for you is, um...

253
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,524
leave you alone
and not ask you any questions.

254
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,526
You can ask me anything
you want to.

255
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,285
I won't insult you by asking
if there's someone else.

256
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,808
Thank you.

257
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,285
You'll sort out whatever it is you have
to sort out, we'll get back to being us.

258
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,723
I love you, Bella.

259
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,961
I love you, too.

260
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,245
Why angels?

261
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,409
(Graham) Well, it isn't biblical.
His angels have wings.

262
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,367
Angels in sculptures and paintings
can fly, but not in scripture.

263
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,841
He's drawing from secular sources?

264
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,760
His mind has turned against him
and there's no one there to help.

265
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,928
(Zeller) Uh, Jack... look at this.

266
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,849
Are those...? What are those?

267
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,884
Somebody got an orchiectomy
real cheap.

268
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,402
- (Katz) Doesn't look like the victim.
- So they're the angel maker's?

269
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,085
He castrated himself?

270
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,728
So he isn't just making angels,
he's getting ready to become one.

271
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,161
Angels don't have genitalia.

272
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,410
So he was afraid of dying.
Now he's getting used to the idea?

273
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,211
He's accepting it
or he's bargaining.

274
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,243
Heh! Bargaining chips!

275
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,364
Is he done making angels,
or is he just getting started?

276
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,090
I don't know.

277
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,885
He's not just killing them when
he's sleepy. How's he choosing them?

278
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,968
- I don't know, ask him.
- I'm asking you.

279
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,401
You're the head
of the behavioural science unit.

280
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,565
Why don't you come up with your
own answers if you don't like mine?

281
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,883
I did not hear that!

282
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,285
Did I?

283
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,406
No, you didn't.

284
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,050
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,209
I've never heard anybody talk to Jack
the way you talked to Jack.

286
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,244
- I was out of line.
- You were out of your mind.

287
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,410
My ears rang like the first time
I heard my mum use the f-word.

288
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,562
- (Chuckles)
- Are you OK?

289
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,927
I know it's a stupid question,
considering that none of us

290
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,364
could possibly be OK doing
what we do, but are you OK?

291
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,365
Do I seem different?

292
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,645
You're a little different, but you've
always been a little different.

293
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,685
Brilliant strategy. That way, no one
ever knows if something's up with you.

294
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,371
How would I know
if something was up with you?

295
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,922
You wouldn't, but I would tell you
if you asked me.

296
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,361
Return the favour?

297
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,291
Meet Roger and Marilyn Brunner.

298
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,290
You might recognise them
from such lists as "Most Wanted".

299
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,644
He likes to rape and murder, she likes
to watch. We got a DNA match.

300
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,923
They falsified the motel registry
and were driving a stolen car,

301
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,008
so it took a second to identify them.

302
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,647
I wonder how long it took
angel maker to identify them.

303
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,889
- He didn't choose them randomly.
- He knows something about them.

304
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,606
The murdered security guard
wasn't actually a security guard,

305
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,802
he was a convicted felon.

306
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,402
Could angel maker be a vigilante?

307
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,881
Well, vigilantes are pragmatic,

308
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,210
they're purposeful, they don't lay down
and sleep under their crimes.

309
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,410
- In his mind, he was doing God's work.
- That spells vigilante.

310
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,090
Playing at God has other advantages,
one of them is always being alone.

311
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,727
- So he makes angels out of demons.
- How does he know they're demons?

312
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,127
He doesn't have to know.

313
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,207
All he has to do is believe.

314
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,443
Has Jack begun to suspect?

315
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,523
He's a behavioural specialist,

316
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,608
he must know you're keeping
something from him.

317
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,768
Oh, he knows.

318
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,281
He asked me if I was having an affair,

319
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,529
by reassuring me
that he didn't have to ask.

320
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,123
- I doubt he believes you're unfaithful.
- And why do you doubt that?

321
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,284
It's clear you love your husband.

322
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,370
Women who love their husbands
still find reasons to cheat on them.

323
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,969
Not you.

324
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,364
Still, you seem more betrayed by Jack
than by your own body.

325
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,362
I don't feel betrayed by Jack.

326
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,248
And there's no point in being mad
at cancer for being cancer.

327
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,330
- Sure there is.
- Cancer isn't cruel.

328
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,965
Tiny cell wanders off
from my liver, gets lost,

329
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,969
finds its way into my lung,

330
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,927
where it's just trying to do
its job and... grow a liver.

331
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,409
What it grows and where it's growing it
will likely kill you.

332
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,006
Not likely...

333
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,691
It will kill me.

334
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,647
And no amount of blueberries
or antioxidants can change that now.

335
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,003
But you hold Jack accountable
for his inability to cure cancer.

336
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,927
Should I have said his inability
to save you?

337
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,080
- Would that be more accurate?
- I am slowly shrinking.

338
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,727
While this tiny thing
grows larger every day.

339
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,248
And yet I feel fine.

340
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,045
You will feel fine.

341
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,891
Up until the precise moment
you don't.

342
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,164
It's a... really very dull story,
though, isn't it?

343
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,566
The ending is always the same,
and that same is that it ends.

344
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,881
So, you withdraw from your
relationship with your husband,

345
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,286
the man who strolled along the quays
of Livorno, Italy, and called you Bella.

346
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,886
(Dogs barking)

347
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,525
It's difficult to lie still and fear going
to sleep when it's there to think about.

348
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,362
You listen to your breathing in the dark
and the tiny clicks of your blinking eyes.

349
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,966
I dream more now than I used to.

350
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,448
Your dreams were the one place
you could be physically safe,

351
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,523
relinquishing control, not anymore.

352
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,168
I thought about zipping myself up into
a sleeping bag before I go to sleep but...

353
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,409
It sounds like
a poor man's straightjacket.

354
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,290
Have you determined how this
angel maker is choosing his victims?

355
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,529
He doesn't see people
how everyone else sees them.

356
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,531
He can tell if you're naughty or nice,
or he thinks he can.

357
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,090
So God has given this person
insight into the souls of men.

358
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,806
God didn't give him insight,
God gave him a tumour.

359
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,290
He's just a man whose brain
is playing tricks on him.

360
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,086
- You're not unlike this killer.
- My brain is playing tricks on me?

361
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,966
You want to feel
such sweet and easy peace.

362
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,890
The angel maker wants
that same peace.

363
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,287
He hopes to feel his way
cautiously inside it

364
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,607
and find it's endless,
all around him.

365
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,961
He's gonna be disappointed.

366
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,048
You accept the impossibility
of such a feeling,

367
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,367
whereas the angel maker
is still chasing it.

368
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,405
If he got close to it, that's where
he will look for it again.

369
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,246
I've tried to reconstruct his thinking,
find his patterns.

370
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,365
Instead you find yourself in
a behaviour pattern you can't break.

371
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,047
You realise you have a choice.

372
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,242
What is it?

373
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,922
Angel maker will be destroyed
by what's happening inside his head.

374
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,122
You don't have to be.

375
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,728
Did you just smell me?

376
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,411
Difficult to avoid.

377
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,166
I really must introduce you
to a finer aftershave.

378
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,965
That smells like something
with a ship on the bottle.

379
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,208
I keep getting it for Christmas.

380
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,724
Have your headaches been
any worse lately? More frequent?

381
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,047
Yes, actually.

382
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,727
I'd change the aftershave.

383
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,848
Elliot Buddish, 35-year-old truck driver.

384
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,248
He's got a fishing license too. Match
came from the national cancer database.

385
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,250
Married, two kids.
They haven't seen him in four months.

386
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,362
He was diagnosed five months ago.

387
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,363
Meet the angel maker.

388
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,249
Have you heard from him
since he left?

389
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,081
I left him.
And, uh, no, no, I haven't.

390
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,562
Why did you leave?

391
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,291
Because of his cancer.

392
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,402
It makes me sound like a horrible wife.

393
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,166
I'm sure you had your reasons.

394
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,449
I took a leave from work
to, uh, to be with him.

395
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,841
I wanted to be there for him,

396
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,009
but what he wanted was to be alone.

397
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,409
He just kept pulling away
and pulling away.

398
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,851
He made it clear
he didn't want me there.

399
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,282
And then it wasn't clear.

400
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,886
And then it didn't matter
why he was acting the way he was.

401
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,291
It was weird for the kids.

402
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,891
I mean, what kind of mother
exposes her children

403
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,844
to someone who's losing their mind?

404
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,371
Was he ever violent, Mrs Buddish?

405
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,882
He was angry.

406
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,242
But he never hit me or the boys.

407
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,806
It was hardest on them,

408
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,161
to see him slip away.

409
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,921
He lost himself
and they lost a father.

410
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,601
I thought that, as he got weaker,

411
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,803
as the cancer got worse,

412
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,606
that it would be
less confusing for them.

413
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,930
That they could just see him
as a sick man,

414
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,805
instead of someone
who was so terrified.

415
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,084
And, uh, did your husband's faith...

416
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,726
falter after he was told
about the cancer?

417
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,049
Elliot wasn't ever religious.

418
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,969
- Is he doing something religious?
- He may believe he is.

419
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,090
Your husband is dying, Mrs Buddish,
and soon.

420
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,043
We'd just like to...

421
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,051
We'd like to find him
before he hurts himself or anyone else.

422
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,887
He had a near-death experience.

423
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,970
He suffocated in a fire
when he was a little boy.

424
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,927
Fireman said he must've had
a guardian angel.

425
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,929
Where did this happen?

426
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,567
Um... a farm where he grew up.

427
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,284
- This'll be the last one.
- It's Buddish?

428
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,370
(Graham) He made himself
into an angel.

429
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,086
It wasn't God, it wasn't man.
It was his choice to die.

430
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,329
- His choice?
- As much as he can make it.

431
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,609
I don't know how much longer
I can be useful to you, Jack.

432
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,404
Really? You caught three.

433
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,404
The last three we had, you caught.
You caught three of them.

434
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,009
No, I didn't catch this one.
Elliot Buddish... surrendered.

435
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,169
You know, I'm used to my wife
not talking to me.

436
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,284
I don't have to get used to you
not talking to me too.

437
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,882
It's getting harder and harder
to make myself look.

438
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,607
- Nobody's asking you to look alone.
- But I am looking alone.

439
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,609
And you know
what looking at this does.

440
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,610
I know what happens
if you don't look, and so do you.

441
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,442
I can make myself look,
but the thinking is shutting down.

442
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,410
- What is it about this one?
- It isn't this one, it's all of them.

443
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,370
It's the next one, it's the one
that I know is coming after that.

444
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,842
You wanna go back to your lecture hall?
Read about this on tattlecrime.com?

445
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,171
No, I don't, but that may be what
I have to do. This is bad for me.

446
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,601
I'm not your father, will.

447
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,166
I'm not gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

448
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,410
Seems like that's exactly
what you're gonna do.

449
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,643
You go back to your classroom.

450
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,888
When there's killing
that you could've prevented,

451
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,968
it will sour your classroom forever.

452
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,366
Maybe.

453
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,402
And then maybe I'll find a job
as a diesel mechanic in a boatyard.

454
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,608
You wanna quit?

455
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,965
Quit.

456
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,322
I see what you are.

457
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,403
What do you see?

458
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,963
(Buddish) Inside.
I can bring it out of you.

459
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,889
Not all the way out.

460
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,729
(Coughs)

461
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,725
I can give you
the majesty of your becoming.

462
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,928
Hello, Doctor.

463
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,010
My wife and I need to talk.
May we use your waiting room?

464
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,088
You can have the office. Please.

465
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,929
Thank you.

466
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,082
Just popping in on official business,
or did you follow me?

467
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,250
I called your office.
They said you were at an appointment.

468
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,362
I figured you'd be here.

469
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,366
You know.

470
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,608
I knew you'd find out.

471
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,245
When did you find out?

472
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,762
- 12 weeks ago.
- 12 weeks ago?

473
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,646
Lung cancer.

474
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,647
You don't smoke.

475
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,285
The irony.

476
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,209
Is it treatable?

477
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,323
It's stage four.

478
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,163
And we know there's no stage five,
don't we?

479
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,408
When were you gonna tell me?

480
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,040
Far enough into the future

481
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,970
that I'm really not prepared
to have this conversation right now.

482
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,368
Neither am I, but we're having it.
We're having it right now.

483
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,806
Were you just going to wait until
you were in the middle of chemotherapy?

484
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,400
When you couldn't hide it anymore?

485
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,246
I don't think
I want to do chemotherapy.

486
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,966
- Do I have any say in this?
- No.

487
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,369
No, you don't.

488
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,607
Do you want to be alone?

489
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,967
I don't want you to answer that.
Just think about your answer.

490
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,006
I want you to know that I don't want you
to be alone, not now and not ever.

491
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,690
We'll beat this together?

492
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,282
No, it's your fight, baby,
but I'm in your corner.

493
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,165
I'm not going anywhere.

494
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,000
I appreciate that, Jack.

495
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,565
I do.

496
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,282
But I'm not comforted by it.

497
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,527
I know that's what you need and...

498
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,562
You need to comfort me.

499
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,565
- But I can't give you what you need.
- Don't worry about what I need.

500
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,123
Why wouldn't you tell me?

501
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,010
I thought if I kept it to myself,
our lives wouldn't change.

502
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,086
I didn't count on changing
as much as I did.

503
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,768
What do you want, Will?

504
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,202
I'm gonna sit here
until you're ready to talk.

505
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,242
You don't have to say a word
