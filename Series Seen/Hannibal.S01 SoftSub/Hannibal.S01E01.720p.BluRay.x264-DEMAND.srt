1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,889
(Sirens wail)

2
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,043
(Pulsating heartbeat)

3
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,601
(Sirens blare)

4
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,202
(House alarm blares)

5
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,569
I shoot Mr Marlow twice,

6
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,809
severing jugulars and carotids
with near-surgical precision.

7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,766
He will die watching me take
what is his away from him.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,723
This is my design.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,923
(Woman sobbing)

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,963
(House alarm blares)

11
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,206
I shoot Mrs Marlow expertly
through the neck.

12
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,642
This is not a fatal wound.
The bullet misses every artery.

13
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,287
She is paralysed
before it leaves her body.

14
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,007
Which doesn't mean
she can't feel pain.

15
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,165
It just means
she can't do anything about it.

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,049
This is my design.

17
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,163
(Alarm stops)

18
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,006
(Man on phone) 'This is DDX Security.
Who am I speaking with?'

19
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,243
I need the incident report
for the home security company.

20
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,044
This was recorded as a false alarm.

21
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,082
There was a false alarm
last... week.

22
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,243
He tapped their phone.

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,804
Yeah, it's been tapped.

24
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,810
(Graham) 'He recorded Mrs Marlow's
conversation with the security company.'

25
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,651
(Man on phone) 'This is DDX Security.
Who am I speaking with?'

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,810
(Mrs Marlow) 'Theresa Marlow.'

27
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,083
(Man) 'Can you please confirm
your password for security purposes?'

28
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,043
(Mrs Marlow) 'Tea kettle.'

29
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,290
(Man) 'Thank you, Mrs Marlow.
We detected a front-door alarm.'

30
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,767
(Mrs Marlow)
'Yeah, sorry about that.'

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,884
(Man) 'Is there anyone in the house
with you, Mrs Marlow?'

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,571
(Mrs Marlow)
'I'm just here with my husband.'

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,001
(Man) 'Do you require
any further assistance?'

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,203
(Mrs Marlow)
'No. Thank you so much for calling.'

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,762
And this is when it gets
truly horrifying for Mrs Marlow.

36
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,090
Everyone has thought about killing
someone one way or another.

37
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,446
Be it your own hand
or the hand of God.

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,241
Now think about killing Mrs Marlow.

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,004
Why did she deserve this?
Tell me your design.

40
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,562
Tell me who you are.

41
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,040
Mr Graham.

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,762
Special Agent Jack Crawford.
I head the Behavioural Science Unit.

43
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,120
- We've met.
- Yes...

44
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,971
We had a disagreement
when we opened up the museum.

45
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,765
I disagreed with what you named it.

46
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,723
The, uh, Evil Minds Research Museum.

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,604
It's a little hammy, Jack.

48
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,081
I see you've hitched
your horse to a teaching post,

49
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,646
and I also understand
it's difficult for you to be social.

50
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,084
Well, I'm just talking at them.
I'm not listening to them. It's not social.

51
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,771
(Crawford) I see...

52
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,085
May I?

53
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,607
Where do you fall
on the spectrum?

54
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,762
My horse is hitched to a post

55
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,724
that is closer
to Asperger's and autistics

56
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,241
than narcissists and sociopaths.

57
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,968
But you can empathise
with narcissists and sociopaths.

58
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,525
I can empathise with anybody.

59
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,563
It's less to do
with a personality disorder

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,205
than an active imagination.

61
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,322
Um...

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,206
Can I borrow your imagination?

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,729
Eight girls abducted from eight
different Minnesota campuses,

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,524
all in the last eight months.

65
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,688
- I thought there were seven.
- There were.

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,689
When did you tag the eighth?

67
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,929
About three minutes before
I walked into your lecture hall.

68
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,805
You're calling them abductions
because you don't have any bodies?

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,084
No bodies, no parts of bodies,
nothing that comes out of bodies.

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,851
Then those girls weren't taken from
where you think they were taken.

71
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,329
- Then where were they taken from?
- I don't know. Someplace else.

72
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,285
All of them abducted on a Friday

73
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,129
so they wouldn't have to be
reported missing until Monday.

74
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,404
However he's covering his tracks,
he needs a weekend to do it.

75
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,243
- Number eight?
- Elise Nichols.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,566
St Cloud State on the Mississippi.
Disappeared on Friday.

77
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,843
Supposed to house-sit for her parents
over the weekend, feed the cat.

78
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,291
Never made it home.

79
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,641
One through seven are dead,
don't you think?

80
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,207
He's not keeping them around.
He got himself a new one.

81
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,766
So we focus on Elise Nichols.

82
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,804
They're all very, um...
Mall of America.

83
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,883
- That's a lot of wind-chafed skin.
- Same hair colour, same eye colour.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,571
Roughly the same age.
Same height, same weight.

85
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,682
So what is it
about all of these girls?

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,771
It's not about all of these girls.
It's just about one of them.

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,771
He's like Willy Wonka,
every girl he takes is a candy bar,

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,645
and hidden in amongst
all of those candy bars

89
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,206
is the one true intended victim,

90
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,962
which, if we follow through on
our metaphor, is your golden ticket.

91
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,082
So is he warming up
for his golden ticket,

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,885
or just reliving
whatever it is he did to her?

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,446
The golden ticket wouldn't be
the first taken or the last.

94
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,524
He would hide how special she was.

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,247
- I mean, I would. Wouldn't you?
- I want you to get closer to this.

96
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,284
No. You have Heimlich at Harvard
and Bloom at Georgetown.

97
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,086
- They do the same thing I do.
- That's not exactly true, is it?

98
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,965
You have a very specific way
of thinking about things.

99
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,130
Has there been a lot of discussion
about the specific way I think?

100
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,325
- You make jumps you can't explain.
- No, no. The evidence explains.

101
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,602
Then help me find some evidence.

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,206
That may require me to be sociable.

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,448
She could've gone off by herself.

104
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,082
She... she was a very interior
young woman.

105
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,648
She didn't like living
in her dorm.

106
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,767
I could see how the pressure of school
might have gotten to her.

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,689
She likes trains.
Maybe she just got on a train and...

108
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,408
- She looks like the other girls.
- Yes, she fits the profile.

109
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,047
Could Elise still be alive?

110
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,802
We simply have no way of knowing.

111
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,686
(Graham) How's the cat?
(Mrs Nichols) What?

112
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,688
How's your cat?
Elise was supposed to feed it.

113
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,246
Was the cat weird
when you came home?

114
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,886
It must've been hungry.
It didn't eat all weekend.

115
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,764
I didn't notice.

116
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,930
Could you give us a moment, please?

117
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,881
He took her from here.

118
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,806
She got on a train,
she came home, she fed the cat.

119
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,208
Then he took her.

120
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,889
The Nichols' house is a crime scene.
I need ERT immediately.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,961
I want Zeller, Katz and Jimmy Price.
Yes, and a photographer.

122
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,243
Why is it now a crime scene?

123
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,408
Can I see your daughter's room?

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,924
(Mr Nichols) Police were up there
this morning.

125
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,008
No, I'll get that.

126
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,691
Mr Nichols, please put
your hands in your pockets

127
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,644
and avoid touching anything.

128
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,206
But we've been
in and out of here all day.

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,926
You can hold the cat, if it's easier.

130
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,400
Elise.

131
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,370
I need you to leave the room.

132
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,288
(Crawford) Take your time.
When you're ready to talk, you talk.

133
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,407
If you don't feel like it, you don't talk.
We'll be downstairs.

134
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,246
You let me know when
you're ready for us to come in.

135
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,449
- (Katz) You're Will Graham.
- You're not supposed to be in here.

136
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,047
You wrote the standard monograph
on time of death by insect activity.

137
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,130
I found antler velvet
in two of the wounds.

138
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,211
- You're not real FBI?
- I'm a special investigator.

139
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,804
- Never been an FBI agent?
- Um... Strict screening procedures.

140
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,766
Detects instability...
You unstable?

141
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,524
You're not supposed to be in here.

142
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,644
I found antler velvet in two
of the wounds, like she was gored.

143
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,127
I was looking for velvet in the other
wounds but I was interrupted.

144
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,289
Hold on, excuse me.
Deer and elk pin their prey.

145
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,767
They put all their weight into
their antlers and suffocate a victim.

146
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,201
That's how they'd kill a fox or a coyote.

147
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,290
Elise Nichols was strangled,
suffocated, her ribs are broken.

148
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,563
Antler velvet is rich in nutrients.
It actually promotes healing.

149
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,321
- He may have put it in there on purpose.
- You think he was trying to heal her?

150
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,684
He wanted to undo
as much as he could,

151
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,689
given that he'd already killed her.

152
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,928
He put her back where he found her.

153
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,123
Whatever he did to the others,
he couldn't do it to her.

154
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,762
Is this his golden ticket?

155
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,205
No, no.

156
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,367
This is an apology.

157
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,047
Does anyone have any aspirin?

158
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,330
Hello.

159
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,130
Hey-

160
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,802
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Come on.

161
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,249
Hey-

162
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,325
Come here.

163
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,771
Hey-

164
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,003
Winston, this is everybody.

165
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,566
Everybody, this is Winston.

166
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,444
- (Dogs bark)
- Tss! Tss!

167
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,243
That's right.

168
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,448
What are you doing in here?

169
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,763
- I enjoy the smell of urinal cake.
- Me too. We need to talk.

170
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,360
Use the ladies' room!

171
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,081
- You respect my judgment, Will?
- Mm-hm. Yes.

172
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,250
Good, because we will stand
a better chance of catching this guy

173
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,850
with you in the saddle.

174
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,644
Yeah, I'm in the saddle.

175
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,970
I'm just, um... confused
which direction I'm pointing.

176
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,447
I don't know this kind of psychopath.
Never read about him.

177
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,047
I don't even know if he's a psychopath.
He's not insensitive, he's not shallow.

178
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,447
You know something about him,

179
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,648
otherwise you wouldn't have said,
"This is an apology."

180
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,685
- What is he apologising for?
- He couldn't honour her. He feels bad.

181
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,246
Feeling bad defeats the purpose
of being a psychopath, doesn't it?

182
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,206
- Yes, it does!
- Then what kind of crazy is he?

183
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,681
He couldn't show her he loved her,

184
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,848
so he put her corpse
back where he killed it.

185
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,089
- Whatever crazy that is.
- You think he loves these girls?

186
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,568
He loves one of them,
and, yes, I think by association,

187
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,842
he has some form of love
for the others.

188
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,726
There was no semen, there was
no saliva. Elise Nichols died a virgin.

189
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,241
- She stayed that way.
- That's not how he's loving them.

190
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,283
He wouldn't disrespect them that way!

191
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,200
He doesn't want these girls to suffer.
He kills them quickly and...

192
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,366
...to his thinking, with mercy.

193
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,284
Sensitive psychopath.

194
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,846
Risked getting caught

195
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,645
so he could tuck Elise Nichols
back into bed.

196
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,127
He has to take the next girl soon...

197
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,121
...cos he knows
he's gonna get caught.

198
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,846
One way or the other.

199
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,805
I got you.

200
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,887
(Machine whirrs)

201
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,445
(Crawford) Graham likes you.

202
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,285
Doesn't think you'll run
any mind games on him.

203
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,246
I don't. I'm as honest with him
as I'd be with a patient.

204
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,445
You've been observing him while
you've been guest-lecturing here?

205
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,967
I've never been in a room
alone with Will.

206
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,445
Why not?

207
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,409
Because I wanna be his friend,
and I am.

208
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,406
It seems a shame not to take
advantage. Academically speaking.

209
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,122
You already asked me to do
a study on him. I said no.

210
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,244
Anything scholarly on Will Graham would
have to be published posthumously.

211
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,283
So you've never been alone with him

212
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,802
because you have
a professional curiosity about him.

213
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,644
Normally I wouldn't even broach this,

214
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,401
but what do you think one
of Will's strongest drives is?

215
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,206
- Fear.
- Mm-hm.

216
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,290
Will Graham deals
with huge amounts of fear.

217
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,529
- It comes with his imagination.
- It's the price of imagination.

218
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,406
Alana, I wouldn't put him out there
if I didn't think I could cover him.

219
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,329
If I didn't think
I could cover him 80%.

220
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,445
- I wouldn't put him out there.
- He's out there. I need him out there.

221
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,242
Should he get too close, I need you
to make sure he's not out there alone.

222
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,084
Promise me something, Jack.

223
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,042
- Don't let him get too close.
- He won't... get too close.

224
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,924
(Price) OK. Tried her skin for prints.
Of course nothing.

225
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,122
We did get a hand spread
off her neck.

226
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,288
Report say anything about nails?

227
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,689
Fingernails were smudged and
the scrapings were from her own palms.

228
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,849
- She never scratched him.
- (Katz) Piece of metal is all we got.

229
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,000
We should be looking at plumbers,
steamfitters, tool workers...

230
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,969
Other injuries were probably
but not conclusively post-mortem,

231
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,003
so not gored.

232
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,124
She has lots of piercings that look
like they were caused by deer antlers.

233
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,288
I didn't say the deer was responsible
for putting them there.

234
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,768
She was mounted on them.

235
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,689
Like hooks.

236
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,282
- She may have been bled.
- (Zeller) Her liver was removed.

237
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,201
See that? He took it out,
and then... yep, he put it back in.

238
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,723
Why would he cut it out if he's just
gonna sew it back in again?

239
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,447
There was something wrong
with the meat.

240
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,331
She has liver cancer.

241
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,127
Yeah, he's, um... he's eating them.

242
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,803
(♪ Classical piano music playing)

243
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,561
(Sobs) Please.

244
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,171
Thank you.

245
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,447
(Sobs) I hate being this neurotic.

246
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,128
If you weren't neurotic, Franklyn,
you would be something much worse.

247
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,728
Our brain is designed to experience
anxiety in short bursts,

248
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,765
not the prolonged duress
yours has seemed to enjoy.

249
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,408
That's why you feel as though a lion
were on the verge of devouring you.

250
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,209
- Franklyn.
- Yes.

251
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,608
You have to convince yourself
the lion is not in the room.

252
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,042
When it is, I assure you,
you will know.

253
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,121
Dr Lecter. I'm Special Ag...

254
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,562
I hate to be discourteous, but this
is a private exit for my patients.

255
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,129
Oh, Dr Lecter. Sorry, um...

256
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,565
I'm Special Agent Jack Crawford, FBI.
May I come in?

257
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,651
You may wait in the waiting room.
Franklyn, I'll see you next week.

258
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,809
- Yes.
- Unless, of course, this is about him.

259
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,331
No, this is all about you.

260
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,443
(Door opens)

261
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,921
Please, come in.

262
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,571
So, may I ask how
this is all about me?

263
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,685
You can ask, but I may have
to ask you a few questions first.

264
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,929
- You expecting another patient?
- We're all alone.

265
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,328
Good.
No secretary?

266
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,125
She was predisposed
to romantic whims.

267
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,720
Followed her heart
to the United Kingdom.

268
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,922
Sad to see her go.

269
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,320
Wow.

270
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,281
- Are these yours, Doctor?
- Among the first.

271
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,289
My boarding school in Paris
when I was a boy.

272
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,801
The amount of detail is incredible.

273
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,681
I learned very early a scalpel cuts
better points than a pencil sharpener.

274
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,280
Well, now I understand
why your drawings earned you

275
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,448
an internship at Johns Hopkins.

276
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,091
I'm beginning to suspect
you're investigating me, Agent Crawford.

277
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,649
No, no, you were referred to me
by Alana Bloom

278
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,445
in the Psychology Department,
Georgetown.

279
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,730
Most psychology departments are
filled with personality deficients.

280
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,606
- Dr Bloom would be the exception.
- Yes, she would. Yes, she would.

281
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,729
She told me you mentored her
during her residency at Johns Hopkins.

282
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,842
I learned as much from her
as she did from me.

283
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,928
She also showed me your paper.

284
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,050
"Evolutionary..." uh...

285
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,561
"Evolutionary Origins
of Social Exclusion"?

286
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,842
- Yes.
- Very interesting.

287
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,406
Very interesting.
Even for a layman.

288
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,322
- A layman?
- Yeah.

289
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,329
So many learned fellows

290
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,683
in Behavioural Science at the FBI,
and you consider yourself a layman?

291
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,565
I do when I'm in your company, Doctor.

292
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,686
Um... I need you to help me
with a psychological profile.

293
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,122
(Lecter) Tell me, how many confessions?

294
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,006
Twelve dozen, last time I checked.
None of them had any details.

295
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,681
Until this morning,
and then they all had details.

296
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,122
Some genius in Duluth PD took
a photograph of Elise Nichols' body

297
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,846
with his cell phone,
shared it with his friends,

298
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,282
then Freddy Lounds posted it
on Tattlecrime.com.

299
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,890
Tasteless.

300
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,606
(Lecter) Do you have trouble
with taste?

301
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,728
My thoughts are often not tasty.

302
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,729
Nor mine.

303
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,969
- No effective barriers.
- I build forts.

304
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,084
- Associations come quickly.
- So do forts.

305
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,002
- Not fond of eye contact, are you?
- Eyes are distracting.

306
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,248
You see too much,
you don't see enough.

307
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,762
And it's hard to focus
when you're thinking,

308
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,769
"Oh, those whites are really white,"

309
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,442
or, "He must have hepatitis,"
or, "Oh, is that a burst vein?"

310
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,891
So, yeah, I try to avoid eyes
whenever possible. Jack?

311
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,286
Yes...

312
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,450
I imagine what you see and learn
touches everything else in your mind.

313
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,810
Your values and decency are present
yet shocked at your associations,

314
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,003
appalled at your dreams.

315
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,329
No forts in the bone arena
of your skull for things you love.

316
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,811
Whose profile are you working on?

317
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,207
Whose profile is he working on?

318
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,971
I'm sorry, Will.
Observing is what we do.

319
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,287
I can't shut mine off any more
than you can shut yours off.

320
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,529
Please, don't psychoanalyse me.

321
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,211
You won't like me
when I'm psychoanalysed.

322
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,322
- Will...
- (Graham) If you'll excuse me.

323
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,842
I have to go give a lecture
on psychoanalysing.

324
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,322
Maybe we shouldn't poke him
like that, Doctor.

325
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,411
Perhaps a less, uh, direct approach.

326
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,723
What he has is pure empathy.

327
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,808
He can assume your point of view,

328
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,208
or mine, and maybe some other
points of view that scare him.

329
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,846
It's an uncomfortable gift, Jack.

330
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,401
Perception's a tool
that's pointed on both ends.

331
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,604
This cannibal you have him
getting to know...

332
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,322
...I think I can help
good Will see his face.

333
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,162
(Cawing)

334
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,241
(Crawford) Stag head was reported
stolen last night a mile from here.

335
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,725
Just the head?

336
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
Minneapolis Homicide's
already made a statement.

337
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,331
- They're calling him the Minnesota Shrike.
- (Graham) Like the bird?

338
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,442
Shrike's a perching bird.

339
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,685
Impales mice and lizards
on thorny branches and barbed wire.

340
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,041
Rips their organs
right out of their bodies,

341
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,243
puts them in a little birdie pantry
and eats them later.

342
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,728
I can't tell
whether it's sloppy or shrewd.

343
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,969
He wanted her found this way.

344
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,765
It's... it's petulant.

345
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,570
I almost feel
like he's mocking her.

346
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,160
Or... he's mocking us.

347
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,882
Where did all his love go?

348
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,642
Whoever tucked Elise Nichols into bed
didn't paint this picture.

349
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,967
He took her lungs. I'm pretty sure
she was alive when he cut 'em out.

350
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,729
Our cannibal loves women.

351
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,446
He doesn't want to destroy them,
he wants to consume them,

352
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,285
to keep some part of them inside.

353
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,244
This girl's killer thought
that she was a pig.

354
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,124
You think this was a copycat?

355
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,925
The cannibal who killed Elise Nichols
had a place to do it

356
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,726
and no interest in...
in field kabuki.

357
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,730
He has a house, or two,
or a cabin,

358
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,888
something with an antler room.

359
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,961
He has a daughter.
The same age as the other girls.

360
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,243
Same hair colour, same eye colour,
same height, same weight.

361
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,006
She's an only child.
She's leaving home.

362
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,001
He can't stand the thought
of losing her.

363
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,649
She's his golden ticket.

364
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,206
What about the copycat?

365
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,449
An intelligent psychopath, particularly
a sadist, is very hard to catch.

366
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,728
There's no traceable motive,
no patterns.

367
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,763
He may never kill this way again.

368
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,962
Have Dr Lecter draw up
a psychological profile.

369
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,651
You seemed very impressed
with his opinion.

370
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,325
(Knocking)

371
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,287
Good morning, Will.
May I come in?

372
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,404
- Where's Crawford?
- Deposed in court.

373
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,086
The adventure will be
yours and mine today.

374
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,048
May I come in?

375
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,571
I'm very careful
about what I put into my body,

376
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,763
which means I end up
preparing most meals myself.

377
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,889
A little protein scramble
to start the day.

378
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,923
Some eggs, some sausage.

379
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,642
- Mm, it's delicious. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

380
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,123
I would apologise
for my analytical ambush,

381
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,801
but I know I'll soon be apologising
and you'll tire of that eventually,

382
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,888
so I have to use apologies sparingly.

383
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,731
Just keep it professional.

384
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,208
Or we could socialise like adults.

385
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,085
God forbid we become friendly.

386
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,602
- I don't find you that interesting.
- You will.

387
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,889
Agent Crawford tells me
you have a knack for the monsters.

388
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,646
I don't think the Shrike
killed that girl in the field.

389
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,088
The devil is in the details.

390
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,282
What didn't your copycat do
to the girl in the field?

391
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,641
- What gave it away?
- Everything.

392
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,449
It's like he had to show me a negative
so that I could see the positive.

393
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,527
That crime scene was
practically gift-wrapped.

394
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,611
The mathematics of human behaviour,
all those ugly variables.

395
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,322
Some bad math
with this Shrike fellow, huh?

396
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,770
Are you reconstructing his fantasies?
What kind of problems does he have?

397
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,325
He has a few.

398
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,683
You ever have any problems, Will?

399
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,571
- No.
- Of course you don't.

400
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,126
You and I are just alike.

401
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,928
Problem-free. Nothing about us
to feel horrible about.

402
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,844
You know, Will...

403
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,322
I think Uncle Jack sees you
as a fragile little teacup.

404
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,604
The finest china,
used for only special guests.

405
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,003
(Laughs)

406
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,768
How do you see me?

407
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,131
The mongoose I want under the house
when the snakes slither by.

408
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,849
Finish your breakfast.

409
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,048
(Graham) What are you smiling at?

410
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,011
Peeking behind the curtain.

411
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,885
I'm just curious how
the FBI goes about its business

412
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,287
when it's not kicking in doors.

413
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,210
You're lucky we're not doing
house-to-house interviews.

414
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,766
We found a little piece of metal
in Elise Nichols' clothes,

415
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,201
a shred from a pipe threader.

416
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,446
There must be hundreds of
construction sites all over Minnesota.

417
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,888
A certain kind of metal, certain kind
of pipe, certain kind of pipe coating,

418
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,970
so we're checking all the construction
sites that use that kind of pipe.

419
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,449
What are we looking for?

420
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,650
At this stage, anything really.
But mostly, anything peculiar.

421
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,365
(Woman) 'Two fellas from the FBI.'

422
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,445
They goin' through the drawers now.
Mm-hm. Puttin' papers in file boxes.

423
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,444
Yes, they are takin' things.

424
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,807
No. Well, they didn't say...

425
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,530
Yes, they can.

426
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,246
What did you say your names were?

427
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,402
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs?
- He's one of our pipe threaders.

428
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,851
Those are all the resignation letters
the union requires when they finish a job.

429
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,962
I'll call you back.

430
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,687
- Does Mr Hobbs have a daughter?
- Might have.

431
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,805
Eighteen or 19,
wind-chafed, plain but pretty.

432
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,447
She'd have auburn hair,
about this tall.

433
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,446
Maybe, I don't know. I don't keep
company with these people.

434
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,285
What is it about Garrett Jacob Hobbs
you find so peculiar?

435
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,165
He left a phone number, no address.

436
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,447
And therefore
he has something to hide?

437
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,241
The others all left addresses.
He also missed work for days at a time.

438
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,886
Do you have an address
for Mr Hobbs?

439
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,925
I got it.

440
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,443
(Phone rings)

441
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,604
Hello?

442
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,604
Just a second. Dad, it's for you.

443
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,328
- Who is it?
- Caller ID said it was blocked.

444
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,568
Hello?

445
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,524
(Lecter) 'Mr Garrett Jacob Hobbs?'

446
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,130
Yeah.

447
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,084
You don't know me
and I suspect we'll never meet.

448
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,601
This is a courtesy call.
Listen very carefully.

449
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,445
Are you listening?

450
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,811
Yes.

451
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,410
They know.

452
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,081
(Screaming)

453
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,240
(Gas-ping)

454
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,611
Garrett Jacob Hobbs! FBI!

455
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,807
No, no, no.

456
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,125
See?

457
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,004
You see?

458
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,165
No, no, no.

459
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,926
(Bloom) Biting in lesser assaults
like bar fights, child abuse,

460
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,522
emergency room personnel
may be very helpful that way.

461
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,965
If they have memories of bad bites,
no matter who was bitten or...

462
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,685
Where's Graham?

463
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,570
You said he wouldn't get too close.
