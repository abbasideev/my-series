1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,044
(Lecter)
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,846
- What's that man doing over there?
- He's a special consultant for the FBI.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,803
I asked you to get close
to the Hobbs thing.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,922
'I need to know
you didn't get too close.'

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,123
What you need is a way out of dark
places when Jack sends you there.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,447
Last time he sent me
into a dark place,

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,967
- I brought something back.
- 'A surrogate daughter?'

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,844
Abigail Hobbs is a suspect?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,089
She would make the ideal bait.
Wouldn't she?

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,044
Just a second. Dad? It's for you.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
- Hello?
- They know.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,124
Easy, Abigail.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,368
Be patient. Wait for your shot.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,846
(Gunshot)

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,209
(Soft thud)

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,650
Ready?
And three, two, one. Go.

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,323
(Abigail) She was so pretty.

18
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,330
(Hobbs) She is so pretty.

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,842
Aren't deer supposed to be
complex emotional creatures?

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,041
Yeah.

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,922
I read they're like the equivalent
of a four-year-old human being.

22
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,771
They're smarter than a four-year-old.

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,406
And they care about each other.

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,920
They care about their environment.

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,122
They tread lightly
through the underbrush

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,210
because they don't want to hurt
the plants.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,527
They're a lot like us.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,530
And we're gonna honour
every part of her.

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,530
Her hide is gonna make
a beautiful rug.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,450
Her leg bones
we can carve into knives.

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,251
None of her is gonna go to waste.

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,121
Just like we talked about.

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,642
Start at the sternum.
Keep the blade pointed up.

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,446
Damage the organs...
you ruin the meat.

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,606
I don't know how I'm gonna feel
about eating her after all this.

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,290
Eating her is honouring her.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,643
Otherwise, it's... it's just...

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,366
...murder.

39
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,771
OK.

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,967
Nice and easy. Big breath.

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,323
Good.

42
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,321
(Gasps)

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,250
(Monitors beeping)

44
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,691
(Muffled whimpering and coughing)

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,042
Morning.

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,890
- Didn't hear you drive up.
- Hybrid. Great car for stalking.

47
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,282
- I'm compelled to go cover myself.
- I have brothers.

48
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,641
I'll put a robe on just the same.
Want a cup of coffee?

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,924
- More immediately, why are you here?
- Yes, and Abigail Hobbs woke up.

50
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,528
You know how to bury the lead.

51
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,688
You want me to get you
a cup of coffee?

52
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,805
- No. I want to get my coat.
- Let's have a cup of coffee.

53
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,368
(Ringing)

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,364
(Phone vibrating)

55
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,842
- Is he gonna keep calling?
- Jack wants you to go see her.

56
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,760
- And you don't.
- Eventually.

57
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,129
Jack thinks Abigail was an accomplice
to her father's crimes.

58
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,971
I don't want to get in the middle
of you and Jack,

59
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,129
but if I can be helpful to you
as a buffer...

60
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,846
I... I like you as a buffer.

61
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,851
I also like the fact
that you rattle Jack.

62
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,088
He respects you far too much
to yell at you,

63
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,680
no matter how much he wants to.

64
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,564
And I take advantage of that.

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,082
Abigail Hobbs doesn't have anyone.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,844
You can't be her everyone.

67
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,968
When I said what I was going
to say in my head,

68
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,402
it sounded really insulting,
so I'll find another way to say it.

69
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,961
Say it the insulting way.

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,570
Dogs keep a promise a person can't.

71
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,688
I'm not collecting another stray.

72
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,122
The first person Abigail
talks to about what happened

73
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,686
can't be anyone who was there
when it happened.

74
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,848
So that means no Dr Lecter either.

75
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,442
Yeah, much less the guy
who killed dad.

76
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,807
Jack's wrong about Abigail.

77
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,083
Let me reach out to her
in my own way.

78
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,929
Hi.

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,441
I'm Alana Bloom.

80
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,648
Are you a doctor?

81
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,524
Not medicine.

82
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,324
I'm a psychiatrist.

83
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,802
What do you specialise in?

84
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,130
Among other things,
family trauma.

85
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,126
I asked the nurses
if my parents were dead,

86
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,766
and they wouldn't tell me.

87
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,882
Said I had to wait for you.

88
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,047
I'm sorry you had to wait.

89
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,243
I know they're dead.

90
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,645
Who buried them?

91
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,888
They haven't been buried.

92
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,129
Don't you think they should be?

93
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,767
Your mother was cremated per
the instructions in her living will.

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,561
(Clears throat) My dad?

95
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,241
Your father is more complicated.

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,446
Because he was crazy?

97
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,763
The nurses said you didn't remember.

98
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,690
I remember. I just didn't want
to talk to them about it.

99
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,281
I want to sell the house.
I guess it's mine now.

100
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,688
I can use the money for college,
get an apartment.

101
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,047
What are all those?

102
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,083
I brought you some clothes.

103
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,328
Thought a change might feel good.

104
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,886
I guessed your size,
so anything you don't want,

105
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,526
leave the tags on,
I'll bring it back.

106
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,281
- And I brought you some music too.
- Your music?

107
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,564
If there isn't anything you like,
I've got a stack of iTunes gift cards.

108
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,322
I... I've got a stack of gift cards.
I don't do well redeeming gift cards.

109
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,610
- Probably says something about you.
- Probably does.

110
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,923
I got seven families waiting.
No, let me rephrase...

111
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,042
Demanding that we find
whatever's left of their daughters.

112
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,766
Abigail Hobbs may be the only
person who knows the truth.

113
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,690
You can't ask her right now, Jack.

114
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,646
We have to create a safe place for
her first or you won't get any answers.

115
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,286
I respect your sympathy for her,
Dr Bloom.

116
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,721
I hope one day you'll appreciate
my lack of it.

117
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,287
You really think Abigail Hobbs
helped her father kill those girls?

118
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,687
I think it's a possibility
that needs to be ruled out.

119
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,964
If Abigail didn't help her father,
maybe she knows who did.

120
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,044
- How was she when you saw her?
- Surprisingly practical.

121
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,924
Suspiciously practical?

122
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,088
I would suggest you can be practical
without being a murderer.

123
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,285
- I think she's hiding something.
- (Lecter) It may simply be a trauma.

124
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,644
Yeah, it could also be more.
She has a penchant for manipulation.

125
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,331
Withheld information
to gain information.

126
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,250
She demonstrated only enough emotions
to prove she had them.

127
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,283
You're beginning to appreciate
my lack of sympathy?

128
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,529
You said it may be more
than trauma yet you question

129
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,927
her involvement in the murders
the father committed.

130
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,362
What I'm questioning
is her state of mind.

131
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,005
I want Will Graham to talk to her.

132
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,407
Jack, not yet.

133
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,650
You are not Will Graham's psychiatrist,
Dr Bloom. Dr Lecter is.

134
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,450
Garrett Jacob Hobbs,
the, uh, Minnesota Shrike,

135
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,324
abducted and murdered eight girls
over an eight-month period.

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,011
Each of them had the same hair colour,
same eye colour,

137
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,122
same age, same height,
same weight

138
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,084
as his daughter Abigail.

139
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,127
There was a ninth victim
who also fit Abigail Hobbs's profile,

140
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,050
but Garrett Jacob Hobbs
didn't murder her.

141
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,607
The killer who did wanted us to know
he wasn't the Minnesota Shrike.

142
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,320
He's better than that.

143
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,082
He is an intelligent psychopath.
He is a sadist.

144
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,123
He will never kill like this again.

145
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,891
So how do we catch him?

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,651
Giving a lecture on Hobbs's copycat?

147
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,127
Well, we need every good mind
we can get on this.

148
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,211
This copycat is an avid reader

149
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,961
of Freddie Lounds
and tattlecrime.com.

150
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,243
He had intimate knowledge

151
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,921
of Garrett Jacob Hobbs's murders,
motives, patterns,

152
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,841
enough to recreate them
and, arguably, elevate them to art.

153
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,571
How intimately did he know
Garrett Jacob Hobbs?

154
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,004
Did he appreciate him from afar
or did he engage him?

155
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,761
Did he ingratiate himself
into Hobbs's life?

156
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,602
Did Hobbs know his copycat
as he was known?

157
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,287
Before Garrett Jacob Hobbs
murdered his wife

158
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,971
and attempted to do the same
to his daughter,

159
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,162
he received an untraceable call.

160
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,571
I believe the as-yet unidentified caller

161
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,964
was our copycat killer.

162
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,283
So you're not a doctor, a nurse
or a psychiatrist?

163
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,289
I'm a journalist.

164
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,528
I want to tell the truth.
Your truth.

165
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,927
Sometimes that involves
some deception,

166
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,281
but know this,
I will never lie to you.

167
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,767
Sounds like something
a liar would say.

168
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,290
If you tell me what you know,
I can help you fill in the blanks.

169
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,643
How about you tell me
what you know?

170
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,889
Your dad was the Minnesota Shrike.

171
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,890
Your mother wasn't the first person
your father killed.

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,128
He killed eight girls.

173
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,210
- Eight girls that looked...
- Just like me.

174
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,205
Yes.

175
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,402
Why do they call him the Shrike?

176
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,441
It's a bird that impales its prey,
harvests the organs to eat later.

177
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,641
He was very sick.

178
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,331
Does that mean I'm sick too?

179
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,924
You'll be fighting that perception.

180
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,569
Perception is the most important thing
in your life right now.

181
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,082
- I don't care what anybody thinks.
- You'd better start caring, Abigail.

182
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,567
What you remember,
what you tell everyone

183
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,810
is going to define the rest
of your life. Let me help you.

184
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,845
How did they catch him?

185
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,284
A man named Will Graham.
Works for the FBI but isn't FBI.

186
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,961
He captures insane men
because he can think like them.

187
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,005
Because he is insane.

188
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,243
Would you excuse us, please?

189
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,689
I'm Special Agent Will Graham...

190
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,450
By Special Agent
he means not really an agent.

191
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,764
He didn't get past the screening
process. Too unstable.

192
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,729
I really must insist
you leave the room.

193
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,207
If you wanna talk...

194
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,920
Abigail, this is Dr Lecter.

195
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,247
Do you remember us?

196
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,442
I remember you.

197
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,127
You killed my dad.

198
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,201
You've been in bed for days, Abigail.
Why don't we have a walk?

199
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,402
I'm sorry we couldn't save
your mother.

200
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,646
We did everything we could
but she was already gone.

201
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,603
I know.

202
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,440
I saw him kill her.

203
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,408
He was loving right up
until the second he wasn't.

204
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,248
Kept telling me he was sorry,
to just hold still.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,970
He was gonna make it all go away.

206
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,321
There was plenty wrong
with your father, Abigail,

207
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,649
but there's nothing wrong with you.

208
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,650
You say he was loving.
I believe it.

209
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,047
That's what you brought out in him.

210
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,686
It's not all I brought out in him.

211
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,650
I'm gonna be messed up.

212
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,762
Aren't I?

213
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,924
I'm worried about nightmares.

214
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,771
We'll help you with the nightmares.

215
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,963
There's no such thing as getting used
to what you experienced.

216
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,568
It bothers me a lot.
I worry about nightmares too.

217
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,602
So killing somebody,

218
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,767
even if you have to do it...
it feels that bad?

219
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,446
It's the ugliest thing in the world.

220
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,762
I wanna go home.

221
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,888
Special Agent Graham.

222
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,446
I never formally introduced myself.
I'm Freddie Lounds.

223
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,649
Are you trying to salvage this joke
from the mouth of madness?

224
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,331
Please. Let me apologise
for my behaviour in there.

225
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,922
It was sloppy and misguided
and hurtful.

226
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,441
Miss Lounds, now is not the time.

227
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,881
Look, you and I may have
our own reasons for being here,

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,889
but I also think
we both genuinely care

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,241
about what happens
to Abigail Hobbs.

230
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,048
- You told her I was insane.
- I can undo that.

231
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,289
You help Abigail see me
as more than her father's killer

232
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,689
and I help you
with online ad sales?

233
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,451
I can undo what I said.

234
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,729
I can also make it a lot worse.

235
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,449
Miss Lounds... it's not very smart
to piss off a guy

236
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,207
who thinks about killing people
for a living.

237
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,207
(Crawford) "It isn't very smart
to piss off a guy

238
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,971
"who thinks about killing
people for a living."

239
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,730
You know what else isn't very smart?

240
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,729
You were there with him.

241
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,446
And you let those words
come out of his mouth.

242
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,649
I trust Will to speak for himself.

243
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,649
Evidently you shouldn't.

244
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,445
I'm just happy the story
wasn't about Abigail Hobbs.

245
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,409
Well, then it's a victory.

246
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,642
So Abigail Hobbs wants to go home.

247
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,649
Let's take her home.

248
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,842
What Abigail wants and what
she needs are different things.

249
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,645
Taking her out of a controlled
environment would be reckless.

250
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,649
(Crawford) You said she was practical.

251
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,047
(Graham) That could mean
she has a dissociative disorder.

252
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,640
You take her home, she may
experience intense emotions,

253
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,445
respond aggressively,
or re-enact some aspect

254
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,443
of the traumatic event
without even realising it.

255
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,410
Where do you weigh in on this,
Doctor?

256
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,846
Dr Bloom is right.

257
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,244
But there is a scenario where revisiting
the trauma event could help Abigail heal

258
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,170
and actually prevent denial.

259
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,291
Then we have a difference of opinion,
therefore I am going to choose

260
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,246
the opinion that best serves
my agenda.

261
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,524
I need to know if you're right
about the copycat, Will.

262
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,803
We have no way of knowing what's
waiting for her when she goes home.

263
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,686
(Lounds) Thanks again
for meeting with me.

264
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,522
- I know this hasn't been easy for you.
- Oh yeah? How would you know?

265
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,849
I've been writing about
Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

266
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,009
I've spoken to the relatives
of some of his other victims.

267
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,009
Hobbs is dead.

268
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,771
He deserved a lot worse.
Him and his whole family.

269
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,365
There must be some small comfort
knowing that justice was sewed.

270
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,926
Comfort?

271
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,887
My sister was impaled on a severed
stag head, cut down the middle.

272
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,287
He pulled out her lungs
while she was still breathing.

273
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,406
- There's no comfort in that.
- I'm sorry. I am.

274
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,962
But you have to try not
to remember her that way.

275
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,128
What do you want from me?

276
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,082
I just thought you should know
Abigail Hobbs came out of her coma.

277
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,202
- Is this where my mum died?
- (Graham) Yes.

278
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,128
I was sort of expecting
a body outline in chalk or tape.

279
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,881
They only do that if you're still alive

280
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,368
and taken to the hospital
before they finish the crime scene.

281
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,242
Goodbye, Mum.

282
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,969
If you ever wanna go,
you just have to say so and we'll go.

283
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,209
Go where? The hospital?

284
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,049
For now.

285
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,726
They turned all the pictures around.

286
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,411
Crime scene cleaners will do that.

287
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,806
They did a really good job.

288
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,004
Is that where all my blood was?

289
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,166
Yes.

290
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,682
You do this a lot?
Go places and think about killing?

291
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,449
Too often.

292
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,562
- So you pretended to be my dad.
- And... people like your dad.

293
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,922
What did it feel like?

294
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,890
To be him?

295
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,166
It feels... like...

296
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,120
I'm talking to his shadow
suspended on dust.

297
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,050
No wonder you have nightmares.

298
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,121
The attacks on you
and your mother were different.

299
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,325
They were desperate.
Your dad knew he was out of time.

300
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,570
- Somebody told him we were coming.
- The man on the phone?

301
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,604
It was a blocked call.
Did you recognise his voice?

302
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,801
I'd never heard it before.

303
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,287
(Bloom) Was there anybody new
in your father's life?

304
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,927
Someone you met
or someone he talked about?

305
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,090
Abigail, he may have been contacted
by another killer.

306
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,048
A copycat.

307
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,801
Someone who's still out there?

308
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,410
Yeah.

309
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,844
- Can you catch somebody's crazy?
- "Folie à deux."

310
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,651
- What?
- It's a French psychiatric term.

311
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,001
Madness shared by two.

312
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,211
See?

313
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,081
One cannot be delusional if the belief
in question is accepted as ordinary

314
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,603
by others in that person's culture
or subculture. Or family.

315
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,641
My dad didn't seem delusional.
He was a perfectionist.

316
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,410
Your dad left hardly any evidence.

317
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,882
Is that why you let me come home?
To find evidence?

318
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,331
It was one of many considerations.

319
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,125
Are we gonna re-enact the crime?

320
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,449
You be my dad, you be my mum,

321
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,809
and you be the man on the phone.

322
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,891
Abigail, we wanted you to come home
to help you leave home behind.

323
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,568
You're not gonna find
any of those girls.

324
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,447
- (Graham) What makes you say that?
- He would honour every part of them.

325
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,003
He used to make plumbing putty
out of elk's bones.

326
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,527
Whatever bones are left of those girls
are probably holding pipes together.

327
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,406
- Where did he make this putty?
- At the cabin.

328
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,927
- I can show you tomorrow.
- (Door opens)

329
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,884
Abigail, there's someone here.

330
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,768
Hey, Abigail.

331
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,720
So, uh, does that hurt?

332
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,649
Sometimes.

333
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,123
Everybody on the block was
on the news.

334
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,891
And everyone at school.

335
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,446
Such whores.

336
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,001
- Did you talk to the news?
- No.

337
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,406
No!

338
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,451
My mum doesn't want me talking
to you, much less the news.

339
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,967
Since when do you listen to her?

340
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,404
Well, clearly I don't.
I'm talking to you right now.

341
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,330
Everybody thinks you did it,
you know?

342
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,080
Do you think I did it?

343
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,168
I don't think you're the type.

344
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,649
Then again, I didn't think your father
was the murder-suicide type.

345
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,445
Although I guess the hunting
could've been a clue.

346
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,446
Mine or his?

347
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,001
Both, now that you mention it.

348
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,563
I don't think you did it.

349
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,446
- I do.
- This is private property.

350
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,208
You were the bait, right?
That's how it worked?

351
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,120
You lure them back to daddy for
dinner? How'd you trap my sister?

352
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,005
- Did you chat her up?
- Hey! Piss off!

353
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,446
Did you help your old man
cut out my sister's lungs

354
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,331
while she was still using...?

355
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,084
(Abigail) He said he was
somebody's brother.

356
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,285
- Marissa! Come home.
- No.

357
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,246
- Come home!
- Can you stop being such a bitch?

358
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,002
- See you later.
- Bye.

359
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,444
He's gone.

360
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,849
You've never seen him before?

361
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,122
(Abigail) No.

362
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,767
(Graham) Let's get back to the hotel.
We'll go to the cabin tomorrow.

363
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,562
We should report this, yes?

364
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,170
Yes.

365
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,243
I'm sorry, OK? This must all stop.

366
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,966
I'm gonna make it all go away.

367
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,846
(Alarm beeping)

368
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,168
He cleaned everything.

369
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,722
He said he was afraid of germs,

370
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,411
but I guess he was just afraid
of getting caught.

371
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,006
No one else ever came
here with your dad,

372
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,922
except you.

373
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,007
He made everything by himself.
Glue, butter...

374
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,566
He sold the pelts on eBay
or in town.

375
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,321
He'd make pillows.

376
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,250
No parts went to waste.

377
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,647
Otherwise it was murder.

378
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,847
He was feeding them to us.
Wasn't he?

379
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,241
It's very likely.

380
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,443
Before he cut my throat,

381
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,571
he told me he killed those girls
so he wouldn't have to kill me.

382
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,287
You're not responsible for anything
your father did, Abigail.

383
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,846
If he would've just killed me,

384
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,727
none of those other
girls would be dead.

385
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,649
We don't know that.

386
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,922
Your father...

387
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,408
I need ERT at the Hobbs cabin.

388
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,570
- (Bloom) Abigail...
- (Screams)

389
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,763
Marissa!

390
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,650
Do you think she knew
the guy down by the stream?

391
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,091
Somebody's brother.

392
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,770
Not somebody.

393
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,121
Abigail said he asked
if she helped her dad

394
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,527
take his sister's lungs
while she was alive.

395
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,768
The young woman on the stag head.

396
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,042
Cassie Boyle.

397
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,891
Had a brother, Nicholas.

398
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,321
But Garrett Jacob Hobbs
didn't kill Cassie Boyle.

399
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,205
I know.

400
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,961
Garrett Jacob Hobbs would've
honoured every part of her.

401
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,525
You brought Abigail Hobbs

402
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,007
back to Minnesota to find out
if she was involved

403
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,771
in her father's murders
and another girl dies.

404
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,966
Yep, scraped his knuckle
on her teeth.

405
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,847
There's foreign tissue and
what could be trace amounts of blood.

406
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,850
You said that this copycat was
an intelligent psychopath, Will.

407
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,328
That there would be
no traceable motive, no pattern.

408
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,808
He wouldn't kill again this way.
You said it.

409
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,002
I may have been wrong about that.

410
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,329
Yes, because Garrett Jacob Hobbs
never struck his victims.

411
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,090
Why would the copycat do it?

412
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,770
I think he was provoked.

413
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,607
Nicholas Boyle murdered this girl
and his own sister.

414
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,600
- With or without Abigail Hobbs?
- Without.

415
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,645
Do you think that Abigail Hobbs
knew Nicholas or Cassie Boyle?

416
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,762
No...

417
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,886
You don't think she knew them?

418
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,651
Or don't wanna think
that she knew them?

419
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,603
She said she didn't know them.

420
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,127
Dr Bloom says that
Abigail has a penchant

421
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,449
for, uh... manipulation.
Is she manipulating you, Will?

422
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,204
Agent Crawford.

423
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,129
He said he was wrong
about the copycat killer.

424
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,288
I want to know what else
he's wrong about.

425
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,883
Whoever killed the girl on the field
killed this girl, I'm right about that.

426
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,526
He knew exactly
how to mount the body.

427
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,803
Wound patterns are almost
identical to Cassie Boyle.

428
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,605
Same design, the same...

429
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,441
...humiliation.

430
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,443
Abigail Hobbs is not a killer.

431
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,891
But she could be the target of one.

432
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,006
I think it's time that Abigail Hobbs
left home permanently.

433
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,521
Doctor, would you be good
enough to collect Abigail

434
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,326
and all of her belongings and
escort her out of Minnesota, please?

435
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,081
Not you, Will.
I want you here.

436
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,201
(Reporters) Abigail! Abigail!

437
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,008
You killed my daughter!

438
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,326
- Abigail...
- Why come back here?

439
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,249
Why did you come back here?

440
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,889
Why come back?

441
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,287
Stay here.

442
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,368
(Woman sobs)

443
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,966
Abigail!

444
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,122
Miss Lounds, you're on
the wrong side of the police line.

445
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,210
I've been covering the Minnesota Shrike
long before you got involved.

446
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,403
I wanna help you tell your story.
You need me now more than ever.

447
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,803
- I wanna talk to her.
- No, you don't. Go inside.

448
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,924
I'm not the only one lurking about
the Hobbs house peeking in windows.

449
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,601
You really should monitor
those police lines more carefully.

450
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,410
Have you seen a young man,
mid-20s, ginger hair, unwashed?

451
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,087
I'll tell you if I saw him
if you tell me why it's important.

452
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,770
(Sobbing softly)

453
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,811
(Hobbs) 'None of her
is gonna go to waste.'

454
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,686
I'm not gonna hurt you.

455
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,202
I just want you to listen to me.

456
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,205
I didn't kill that girl, OK?

457
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,810
I didn't kill her!

458
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,445
Wait!

459
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,931
Listen! I didn't...

460
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,251
Abigail?

461
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,611
Abigail?

462
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,928
(Lecter) She'll be all right.

463
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,403
Abigail?

464
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,449
Show me what happened.

465
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,401
- He was gonna kill me.
- Was he?

466
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,048
This isn't self-defence, Abigail.
You butchered him.

467
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,404
I didn't...

468
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,807
They will see what you did,

469
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,881
and they'll see you as an accessory
to the crimes of your father.

470
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,889
I wasn't.

471
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,567
I can help you, if you ask me to.

472
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,565
At great risk to my career
and my life.

473
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,603
You have a choice.

474
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,127
You can tell them you were defending
yourself when you gutted this man...

475
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,362
Or we can hide the body.

476
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,050
No, I don't remember anything.

477
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,004
Maybe a blur out of the corner
of my eye,

478
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,806
and then a big fat cut to black.

479
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,766
(Crawford) Well, Nicholas Boyle
attacked Abigail, you.

480
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,646
Struck Dr Lecter
in the back of the head.

481
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,809
- Well, where's Abigail?
- Lecter took her back to the hotel.

482
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,287
She scratched Nicholas Boyle
on his way out the back door.

483
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,643
The blood on her hands
matches the tissue that we pulled

484
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,569
from Marissa Schurr's mouth.

485
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,127
And then what,
he... he got away?

486
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,208
We'll catch him one way
or another.

487
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,002
Where are you going?

488
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,926
I wanna go home.

489
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,410
(Creaking)

490
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,449
Hello, Abigail.

491
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,969
- How did you know it was me?
- The hospital called.

492
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,001
You climbed over the wall.

493
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,765
Where else were you to go?
Home's no longer an option.

494
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,002
Come down from there.

495
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,762
I don't want to go to sleep.

496
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,129
You can't anticipate your dreams.

497
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,005
Can't block them, can't repress.

498
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,569
I didn't honour any part of him
so it's just murder, isn't it?

499
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,410
Most would argue self-defence.

500
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,211
Then why not tell the truth?

501
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,731
Most would argue.

502
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,571
There would still be those who would
say you were taking after your father.

503
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,971
You're glad I killed him.

504
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,002
What would be the alternative?

505
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,521
- That he kill you?
- I don't know if he was going to.

506
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,005
No, you don't.

507
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,161
You're the one who called the house.

508
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,131
You talked to my dad before...

509
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,568
What did you say to him?

510
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,970
A simple conversation,

511
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,845
ascertaining if he was home
for an interview.

512
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,002
Then why not tell the truth?

513
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,408
I think you called the house
as a serial killer.

514
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,004
Just like my dad.

515
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,251
I'm nothing like your dad.

516
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,124
