1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,284
(Lecter)
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,449
- Garrett Hobbs didn't kill Cassie Boyle.
- I know.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,648
Dad, it's for you.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,685
I believe the as-yet unidentified caller
was our copycat killer.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,247
I wanna go home.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,964
You do this a lot?

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,686
- Go places and think about killing?
- Too often.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,450
- Abigail!
- (Screams)

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,284
I didn't kill that girl.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,324
This isn't self-defence, Abigail.
You butchered him.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,523
- You're the one who called the house.
- I'll keep your secret.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,846
And I'll keep yours.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,845
Sometimes, at night I leave
the lights on in my little house.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,683
And...
walk across the flat fields.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,842
'But when I look back
from a distance,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,645
'the house is like a boat
on the sea.'

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,930
It's really the only time I feel safe.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,287
You stood in the breathing silence
of Gareth Jacob Hobbs's home,

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,323
the very spaces he moved through.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,084
Tell me, Will,
did they speak to you?

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,371
With noise and clarity.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,324
You could sense his madness,
like a bloodhound.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,126
I tried so hard to know
Gareth Jacob Hobbs.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,931
To see him.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,088
Gareth Jacob Hobbs, FBI!

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,601
(Gunshots)

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,243
Past the slides and phials,

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,647
beyond the lines
of the police reports,

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,889
between the pixels of all those...

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,126
...printed faces of sad dead girls.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,003
See?

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,881
How did you feel seeing Marissa Schurr,
impaled in his antler room?

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,245
Guilty.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,368
Because you couldn't save her?

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,969
Because I felt like I killed her.

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,368
I got so close to him.

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,849
Sometimes...

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,521
I felt like we were doing the same things
at different times of day

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,646
like I was eating or showering
or sleeping at the same time he was.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,445
Even after he was dead?

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,043
Even after he was dead.

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,767
Like... you were becoming him.

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,130
I know who I am. I'm not
Gareth Jacob Hobbs, Doctor Lecter.

44
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,441
Table has been set.

45
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,409
Family dinner.

46
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,689
I wasn't invited.

47
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,123
I take my seat
at the head of the table.

48
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,049
My seat.

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,243
My place setting,
next to Mrs Turner.

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,162
I am the guest of honour.

51
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,650
Nobody's taken a bite of their dinner.

52
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,162
If you don't eat your growing foods,
you won't get any dessert.

53
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,122
No one leaves the table!

54
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,328
All afraid to move,

55
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,807
even the little ones
behave themselves.

56
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,645
I brought my own family
to this home invasion.

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,845
Controlling the Turners
with threats of violence,

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,691
threats that turn to action.

59
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,128
(Gunshots)

60
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,931
The Turner family
is executed simultaneously.

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,570
With the exception of Mrs Turner
who dies last.

62
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,203
This is my design.

63
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,448
I shoot Mrs Turner.

64
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,081
What do you see, Will?

65
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,925
Family values.

66
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,768
Whose family values?

67
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,128
All right, Karen and Roger Turner,
childhood sweethearts,

68
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,322
owned a successful
real estate business.

69
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,522
Pillars of the community,
three children.

70
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,961
- Minus one.
- Uh... a son.

71
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,242
Jesse. Disappeared last year.

72
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,840
Last confirmed sighting
had him boarding an RV

73
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,962
at a rest stop on Route 47.

74
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,411
- Possible runaway, probable abduction.
- Or both.

75
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,050
- When misery rains, it pours.
- False faces in family portraits.

76
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,369
Layers and layers of lies,
betrayed by...

77
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,766
...a sad glint in the child's eyes.

78
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,808
- Norman Rockwell with a bullet!
- (Crawford) Any signs of forced entry?

79
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,571
No broken windows or torn screens.
All sealed up tight.

80
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,842
Yeah, they probably rang
the front door.

81
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,122
I got bullet holes
on the upper sections of the wall.

82
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,801
- And again over here.
- OK. Pull the slugs for ballistics.

83
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,922
(Katz) They aren't frangible,
shouldn't be a problem.

84
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,089
(Zeller) Elevated termination points
match for the scene with these bodies.

85
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,649
Angular cranial impact coupled with
acute exit wounds, conical spray.

86
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,047
Shooter went low to high,
probably crouching.

87
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,210
- When was Jesse abducted?
- Uh, a little over a year ago.

88
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,368
'I can hide what happened to me.

89
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,687
'All I need is a scarf to pass.'

90
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,009
Hiding what happened to you
defeats the purpose of being here.

91
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,763
Sharing will help normalise.

92
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,770
I'm not normal. Not anymore.

93
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,649
What happened to you isn't normal.

94
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,649
(Abigail) Some of these women
aren't even sharing.

95
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,762
They speak in "little girl voices",

96
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,884
telling everyone what was done to them
without saying a word about it.

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,083
Certain traumas can arrest
vocal development.

98
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,281
And victims can sometimes
broadcast victimhood involuntarily.

99
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,243
Not me.

100
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,449
That's not necessarily true.

101
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,088
Your victimhood has a high profile.

102
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,089
I'm a celebrity victim!

103
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,801
Someone here asked me
if I kept my stained clothes.

104
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,763
How did that make you feel?

105
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,962
Like I wanted to go home.

106
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,885
But I don't have a home
anymore, do I?

107
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,810
You will.
You will, I'll help you find it.

108
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,530
Abigail, I'd like you to give
the support group another chance.

109
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,042
Support groups are sucking
the life out of me.

110
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,004
Well, isolation can suck
just as much.

111
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,647
You have to find someone to relate to
in this experience.

112
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,084
(Knocking at door)

113
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,401
Hi.

114
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,210
- Do you have an appointment?
- Do you have a beer?

115
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,043
Interesting day with Abigail?

116
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,207
Yeah, with grief work,
trauma intervention.

117
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,844
It's all on course.

118
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,447
I think she might be wrestling
with a low-grade depression.

119
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,280
She?

120
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,769
Nothing wrong with a little
self-medication, right, Doctor?

121
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,563
Professional neutrality be damned.

122
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,889
It's so hard to watch
a bright young girl go so adrift.

123
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,009
Perhaps it's time Abigail
is released from clinical treatment.

124
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,966
Released where?
Back into the wild?

125
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,766
Spending each day immersed in tragedy
may be doing more harm than good.

126
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,129
She should be out in the world.

127
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,846
Finding her footing, giving her
the confidence to move forward.

128
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,009
Abigail is in no condition
to tackle her real world issues.

129
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,648
- Where's she gonna live?
- I'm not suggesting abandonment.

130
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,684
Hannibal, this is a girl who was
very attached to her parents.

131
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,009
You stepping in as a surrogate
would only be a crutch.

132
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,246
I think Abigail needs to figure
things out for herself

133
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,443
in a safe, clinical environment.

134
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,080
And that will give her
the confidence to move forward.

135
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,249
I defer to the passion
of my esteemed colleague.

136
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,410
Passion's good.
Gets blood pumping.

137
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,763
I'm glad we didn't have guns
in my house.

138
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,762
I would've shot my sisters
just to get them out of the bathroom.

139
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,726
- (Katz) I liked having a big family.
- My parents gave me a gift, a twin.

140
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,890
- Who wouldn't want two of me?
- Let me guess... only child.

141
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,925
Why do you say that?

142
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,931
Because family friction is usually
a catalyst for personality development.

143
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,965
(Katz) I was the oldest,
so all the friction rolled downhill.

144
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,971
Yes, all the attention and responsibility
is heaped on firstborn children.

145
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,323
Prepares them
for success in the future.

146
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,081
(Katz) My baby sister got away
with murder. She had them all fooled.

147
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,885
- I thought middles were the problem.
- Middle's the sweet spot.

148
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,925
Always trying to figure out
where they fit in.

149
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,088
They can be great... politicians.

150
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,564
Or lousy ones.

151
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,241
All the victims have defensive wounds
except for Mrs Turner.

152
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,330
(Graham) There's forgiveness.

153
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,603
What kind of victim forgives the killer
at the moment of death?

154
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,804
A mother.

155
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,922
- Tell me about your mother.
- Some lazy psychiatry, Doctor Lecter.

156
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,690
Low hanging fruit.

157
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,651
I suspect that fruit is
on a high branch.

158
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,082
- Very difficult to reach.
- So is my mother.

159
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,409
- Never knew her.
- An interesting place to start.

160
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,604
Tell me about your mother,
let's start there.

161
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,650
Both my parents died
when I was very young.

162
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,641
The proverbial orphan until I was adopted
by my Uncle Robertos when I was 16.

163
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,286
You have orphan in common
with Abigail Hobbs.

164
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,201
I think you'll discover you and I have
a great deal in common with Abigail.

165
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,767
She's already demonstrated
an aptitude for the psychological.

166
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,081
There's something so foreign
about family.

167
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,124
Like an ill-fitting suit.

168
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,402
I never connected to the concept.

169
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,011
You created a family for yourself.

170
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,284
I connect to a family of strays.

171
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,404
And thank you for feeding them
while I was away.

172
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,763
I was referring to Abigail.

173
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,643
Tell me about the Turner family,
were they affluent, well-to-do?

174
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,286
They lived like they had money.

175
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,802
- Did your family have money, Will?
- We were poor.

176
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,083
I followed my father
from the boatyards

177
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,046
of Biloxi and Greenville,
to lake boats on Erie.

178
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,006
Always the new boy at school,
always the stranger.

179
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,849
Always.

180
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,324
What grudge was Mrs Turner's killer
harbouring against her?

181
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,046
Motherhood.

182
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,323
Not motherhood. A perversion of it.

183
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,011
(Lecter) A modified Boudin Noir

184
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,691
from Ali Bab's
Gastronomie Practique.

185
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,286
You promised to deliver your wife
to my dinner table.

186
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,289
We're gonna have to polish up our act,

187
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,689
we can't have you diagnosing our
marital problems all in one fell swoop.

188
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,121
- What am I about to put in my mouth?
- Rabbit.

189
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,562
- He should've hopped faster.
- Yes, he should have.

190
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,410
- But fortunately for us, he did not.
- Mm-mm.

191
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,643
Our friend Will seems haunted today.

192
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,889
We don't know what nightmares lie
coiled beneath Will's pillow.

193
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,767
Children killing other children is...
not that unfamiliar a notion to Will.

194
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,121
You still suspect Abigail Hobbs
in her father's crimes.

195
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,847
Perhaps the nightmare
under Will's pillow

196
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,962
is that he was wrong about her.

197
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,924
Children transport us
to our childhoods.

198
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,283
Will may feel the tug of life
before the FBI, before you.

199
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,449
Simpler times in boatyards with dad.

200
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,127
That life is an anchor streamed
behind him in heavy weather.

201
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,410
He needs an anchor, Jack.

202
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,725
One pair of size-six sneakers
from the Turner house.

203
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,922
The tread on left indicates
uneven leg length.

204
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,202
- Is that unusual?
- Not in a 12-year-old.

205
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,041
Growth plates all out of whack,
got one foot that's bigger,

206
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,209
one leg that's longer,
puberty in full effect.

207
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,891
How did Jesse Turner turn out?
No one's seen him in over a year.

208
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,800
I extrapolated the present height
and weight from abduction stats.

209
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,922
Even with the usual growth spurts
between 11 and 12,

210
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,281
he'd be four and a half feet,
80lbs tops.

211
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,281
God's gift to trace analysts.
Greasy fingerprints all over these things.

212
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,289
No matches, but they're gorgeous.

213
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,006
Isolated seven pairs of shoe prints.

214
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,408
Filtered out the Turner's including
Jesse's, so we're down to three unsubs.

215
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,803
Sneakers are sizes seven,
three and a half, and a boy's 11.

216
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,721
- The lost boy's.
- I think I found one of them.

217
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,286
Most of the time in sexual assaults,

218
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,442
the bite mark has a livid spot
at the centre, a "suck bruise".

219
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,409
In some cases, it does not.

220
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,006
For some killers, biting may be
a fighting pattern

221
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,724
as much as a sexual behaviour...

222
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,241
OK, class dismissed. Everyone out.

223
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,806
What did I just say? Let's go!

224
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,326
You're making it difficult
to provide an education, Jack.

225
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,125
We found a match to a set of prints
we pulled from the Turner home,

226
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,971
they belong to a 13-year-old boy
from Reston, Virginia.

227
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,651
- His name is Conner Frist.
- Another kid?

228
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,683
Another missing kid.

229
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,885
Vanished ten months ago,
case was never solved.

230
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,287
How many kids in the Frist family?

231
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,641
Three,
just like the Turner family.

232
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,523
We're ready to go when you are and
you're ready to go now, so let's go.

233
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,041
You're expecting a crime scene?

234
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,810
(♪ PERRY COMO: "There Is

(Coughing)

240
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,285
Mr Frist and the children killed first,
saving Mrs Frist for last.

241
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,291
- Same as the Turners.
- (Will) Not exactly the same.

242
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,243
Something went wrong.

243
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,328
Not a single present under the tree
for Mrs Frist.

244
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,410
He took her presents,
he took her motherhood.

245
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,642
Shooting her once wasn't enough.

246
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,240
The first bullet travels
beneath her scalp

247
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,249
to its final resting place,
base of her neck.

248
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,010
(Crawford) It still didn't kill her.

249
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,327
Hydrostatic shock of shell hitting skull
would've caused brain damage.

250
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,967
- Her body went into convulsions.
- He shot her again.

251
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,128
Put her out of her misery,
different gun.

252
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,720
So someone else shot Conner's mum.

253
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,287
So who is our additional corpse
in the fireplace?

254
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,880
I'd say Conner Frist.

255
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,004
He'd been prepped to shoot his mother,
not watch her suffer.

256
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,283
Conner couldn't put his panic back
in the bottle, so he got shot too.

257
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,243
Whoever shot him...

258
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,600
...disowned him.

259
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,850
Don't be sad about Conner.

260
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,566
I guess I couldn't make him
understand.

261
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,891
The family you're born into
isn't really family,

262
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,128
those are just people
you didn't choose.

263
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,086
You have to make family, that's what
we're doing, we're making our family.

264
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,249
- What happened to your family?
- We're her family.

265
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,405
I meant... your other family.

266
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,805
The family you think is family is
just a stepping stone to real family.

267
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,601
Are you feeling OK, sweetie pie?

268
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,608
- He's fine.
- CJ.

269
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,801
You should be excited to go home.

270
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,686
Even if it is to say goodbye,
cos we're your family now, Christopher.

271
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,841
You can only have one family.

272
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,965
Ever heard of Willard Wigan?

273
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,890
He's this artist
that does micro sculptures,

274
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,527
like putting the Obamas
in the eye of a needle.

275
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,440
He's so focused that he can work
between beats of his heart.

276
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,568
I guess archers do
the same thing, right?

277
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,921
- Hmm...
- What are you looking at?

278
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,250
(Graham) Both these kids are small,
underweight for their age.

279
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,886
You think there's a connection?

280
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,924
I'm thinking possible ADHD diagnosis
for both boys.

281
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,122
Ritalin, Focalin,

282
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,961
any medication containing
Methylphenidate can affect appetite

283
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,289
and slow long-term growth in kids.

284
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,528
Another thing about Willard Wigan,

285
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,688
he had a lonely childhood.

286
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,690
He used his tiny sculptures
as an escape.

287
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,849
Who's Willard Wigan?

288
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,566
Price got a hit on the ballistics
matching programme

289
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,682
he's been running
on the two family murders.

290
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,802
The bullet that put Mrs Frist
out of her misery

291
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,606
matches three used in a murder
in Bangor, Maine a year ago.

292
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,531
Mother of a 13-year-old boy
shot to death with her own gun.

293
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,371
13-year-old
milk carton material.

294
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,203
(Crawford) CJ Lincoln disappeared
six months before his mother's murder,

295
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,129
hasn't been seen since.

296
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,971
(Graham) He has none of the
characteristics of a sadist or a sociopath.

297
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,129
Right, no shoplifting,
no malicious destruction of property.

298
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,050
No assault, no battery,
he was kind to animals, for God's sake.

299
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,130
The firearm says we are looking
at Peter Pan to our Lost Boys.

300
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,289
But it takes a sophisticated
level of manipulation

301
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,880
to convince young boys
to kill their families in cold blood.

302
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,924
Kindness to animals doesn't suggest
that particular kind of sophistication.

303
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,123
Well, he's older,
he's been out in the world.

304
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,766
'Maybe he picked up a few things.'

305
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,764
There you go.

306
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,921
Thank you so much.

307
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,451
Oh, honey!

308
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,410
Oh, geez...
Are you feeling OK, honey?

309
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,009
You have a fever?

310
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,248
- You don't feel warm.
- (Shopkeeper) Here you go, ma'am.

311
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,682
Oh, thank you.
He's never done this before.

312
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,041
- I'll pay for the napkins.
- Don't worry about it.

313
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,403
Oh, honey, oh, gee-whiz...

314
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,244
I'm so embarrassed.

315
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,729
But you shouldn't feel embarrassed,
this happens with little bladders, right?

316
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,604
Right?

317
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,967
Good evening, Will.
Please come in.

318
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,081
Has Christmas come early?
Or late?

319
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,042
- It was for Abigail.
- "Was"?

320
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,643
I thought better of it, I wasn't thinking
straight. I was upset when I bought it.

321
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,250
Maybe still am.

322
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,931
- What is it?
- A magnifying glass.

323
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,883
FBI-Wing gear.

324
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,807
Teaching her how to fish.

325
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,608
- Her father taught her how to hunt.
- That's why I thought better of it.

326
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,967
Feeling paternal, Will?

327
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,048
- Aren't you?
- Yes.

328
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,528
Our good friend Doctor Bloom
has advised against

329
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,008
taking too personal an interest
in Abigail's welfare.

330
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,930
- Tell me why are you so angry?
- I'm angry about those boys.

331
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,122
I'm angry cos I know when I find them,
I can't help them.

332
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,403
I can't give them back
what they just gave away.

333
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,204
Family.

334
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,007
Yeah.

335
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,571
We call them the "Lost Boys".

336
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,446
Abigail's lost too.

337
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,561
And perhaps it's our responsibility,

338
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,126
yours and mine,
to help her find her way.

339
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,802
I don't think I'm allowed to leave,
after I climb the fence.

340
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,763
I've made arrangements.

341
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,929
You could say,
I'm one of your guardians.

342
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,203
- Where are we going?
- Home. My home.

343
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,210
I thought you might enjoy
if I cooked for you.

344
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,530
- I'll have you back before bedtime.
- Can't I spend the night?

345
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,008
I don't like sleeping here,
I have bad dreams.

346
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,686
You have to sleep in your own bed.

347
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,848
This isn't my bed.

348
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,128
Tell me about your bad dreams.

349
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,451
I had one where Marissa
was sending me picture texts.

350
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,640
Like crime scene photos
of Nicholas Boyle.

351
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,090
Gutted.

352
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,690
How you left him.

353
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,881
Even though she's dead, I'm afraid
Marissa's gonna tell everyone I killed him

354
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,571
and they'll think
I'm just like my dad.

355
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,890
Sorry.

356
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,884
Can't really talk about this
in group.

357
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,730
You don't have that luxury, Abigail.

358
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,242
I'll just have to get used to lying.

359
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,566
You only have to lie about one thing.

360
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,322
And when you're with me,
you don't have to lie about anything.

361
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,048
In the dream, I wonder
how I could live with myself,

362
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,083
knowing what I did.

363
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,846
And when you're awake?

364
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,760
When I'm awake,
I know I can live with myself.

365
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,884
And I'll just get used to what I did.

366
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,923
- Does that make me a sociopath?
- No.

367
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,168
It makes you a survivor.

368
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,442
It's important to know
when it's time to turn the page.

369
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,046
Have you thought about
applying for schools?

370
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,686
My dad killed girls
at all the schools I applied to.

371
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,371
- Perhaps that can wait then.
- I wanna work for the FBI.

372
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,881
I would certainly feel safer
if you were in the FBI,

373
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,684
protecting my interests.

374
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,522
They wouldn't let me though, would they?
Because of what my dad did.

375
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,246
Only if they believe
that's in your nature too.

376
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,964
Nature versus nurture.

377
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,809
You're not your father's daughter.
Not anymore.

378
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,011
What if it weren't so painful
anymore, to think of him?

379
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,048
- My dad?
- Yes.

380
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,967
Have you ever tried Psilocybin?

381
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,008
Mushrooms?

382
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,441
- That's what's in the tea?
- Yes.

383
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,251
There are those psychiatrists
who believe that altered states

384
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,283
could be used
to access traumatic memories.

385
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,404
I have all the access
to traumatic memories I need.

386
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,925
Unlimited access.

387
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,442
Which is why we need to supplement
them with positive associations.

388
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,409
No more bad dreams, Abigail.

389
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,122
- You want me to do drugs?
- I want you to do this drug.

390
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,847
With my supervision.
Where it's safe.

391
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,888
Do you trust me?

392
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,090
(Crawford) Bangor, Maine.
Stamford, Connecticut.

393
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,123
And recently Reston, Virginia.

394
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,767
This places each murder approximately
500 miles from the one before it.

395
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,961
Right.

396
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,651
You're trying to establish
a geographical pattern

397
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,649
when the murders are weeks apart.

398
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,206
Other patterns too:
our shooters are minors,

399
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,846
middle children
from traditional affluent families.

400
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,849
(Crawford) They're moving south,

401
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,850
so we wanna cover the border
of North Carolina and Georgia.

402
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,568
We need to get files on every missing
boy within 200 miles of North Carolina.

403
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,641
There's a pattern... less to do
with geography than psychology.

404
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,808
(Crawford) What kind of kid does this?

405
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,571
And what kind of kid
follows a kid who does this?

406
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,286
There's no indication these kids
came from abusive families.

407
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,004
No, no, no.

408
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,248
Capture-bonding.

409
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,046
A passive psychological response
to a new master

410
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,004
has been an essential survival tool
for a million years.

411
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,010
You bond with your captor,
you survive.

412
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,881
You don't...
you're breakfast.

413
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,647
Just like we talked about.

414
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,444
Doctor Bloom said this was OK?

415
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,763
Not at all. We often have
a difference of opinion.

416
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,130
- More secrets for us.
- Well...

417
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,087
You and I will have many secrets.

418
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,721
Infusing Psilosybin into the bloodstream
before psychotherapy

419
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,640
can illicit a positive, even spiritual,
experience for patients.

420
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,765
Psychological trauma is
an affliction of the powerless.

421
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,520
I want to give you your power back.

422
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,881
I don't feel so good.

423
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,606
That feeling will pass.

424
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,369
Allow it to wash over you,
through you.

425
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,411
Let me be your guide.

426
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,930
You're making breakfast for dinner?

427
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,803
High Life eggs.

428
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,960
A chef in Spain called Muro claimed
he invented it in the 19th century.

429
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,602
Taste is not only biochemical,
it's also psychological.

430
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,329
Sausage and eggs was the last meal
I was having with my parents.

431
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,204
I know.

432
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,166
It's also the first meal
you're having with me.

433
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,129
Without the interference of a leader,

434
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,402
these kids would never
consider violent action.

435
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,404
Our missing kid's a boy.
(Clears throat)

436
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,325
A paradox in the midst
of a normal family,

437
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,205
he's an outsider
who doesn't look like one.

438
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,007
He'd have a vocation.
Something inventive or mechanical.

439
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,451
Here's one.

440
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,889
Family moved from Biloxi to Charleston
to Fayetteville in the last three years.

441
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,368
He won a junior high award for his work
on pretty sophisticated computer circuitry.

442
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,121
Why do you think these kids
are susceptible to CJ Lincoln?

443
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,961
Our boy may have a brother, but
their ages or interests keep them apart.

444
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,608
- So he's a brother without a brother.
- Brothers looking for a mother.

445
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,402
They're killing the mothers last.

446
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,085
- Yeah?
- It's not just CJ Lincoln.

447
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,806
There's an adult
with some formative sway.

448
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,164
It's a woman, a mother figure I think.
She's looking to form a family.

449
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,244
A family can have
a contagion effect on some people.

450
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,402
Influences them to adopt
similar behaviours and attitudes.

451
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,847
Whoever this woman is,
she wants these children

452
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,327
to burst with love for her.

453
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,649
But she has to erase their family
to do that.

454
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,401
So she abducts them, convinces them
no one can love them like her,

455
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,847
and then makes damn sure of it.

456
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,443
A security camera in a convenience store
in Alexandria, Virginia,

457
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,126
caught footage of one Chris O'Halloran
this morning.

458
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,846
He was with an unidentified woman.

459
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,681
- Where's this kid's parents?
- Fayetteville, North Carolina.

460
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,930
- Christopher?
- Hi, Mum.

461
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,964
Oh, my God.

462
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,809
Chris.

463
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,400
No, no, no!

464
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,401
Down! Down on the ground
right now!

465
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,244
Chris, wait.

466
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,370
Don't shoot.

467
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,401
It's OK.

468
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,122
You're home now.
Put the gun down, Christopher.

469
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,607
Shoot him, Christopher.

470
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,970
Christopher.

471
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,686
Please.

472
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,969
Can I go home now?

473
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,050
I don't think you're gonna go home
for a long time.

474
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,768
You came hereto kill your family,
that's all anybody knows.

475
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,282
It may be all that
anyone ever believes.

476
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,209
I wasn't gonna do it.

477
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,041
Well, you're gonna have
to talk to a lot of people about it.

478
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,527
Those people are gonna
try and help you understand

479
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,881
what you were really trying to do.

480
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,328
She told me...
that they weren't my family,

481
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,611
that we had to make
our own family.

482
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,009
- Do you have a family?
- I don't have any children, no.

483
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,241
Then you don't know what it's like.

484
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,768
Can I talk to my mum?

485
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,446
My real mum.

486
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,841
In a little while.

487
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,248
But first I need you to talk to me.

488
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,251
As someone who makes such
a big deal about common courtesy,

489
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,283
I'm a little taken aback...

490
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,200
slash, a lot taken aback,
that you would take my patient,

491
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,167
my patient, out of the hospital
without my permission.

492
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,720
And I'm not a professional scold,

493
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,241
but don't put me in this position
ever again.

494
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,648
I'm sorry.

495
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,445
Rude!
Hannibal, shockingly rude!

496
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,400
You have every right to be upset
with me, I overstepped my bounds.

497
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,124
- Where is she?
- She's in the dining room.

498
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,402
And Alana...

499
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,324
you were right.

500
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,445
Often am.
You have to be more specific.

501
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,325
She wasn't ready
to leave the hospital, she...

502
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,410
experienced a bit of anxiety
so I gave her a sedative.

503
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,129
A sedative?
What did you give her?

504
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,767
I only gave her half a Valium,
but she may be a little hazy.

505
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,687
- Hi, Doctor Bloom.
- Hello, Abigail.

506
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,843
You were expecting me?

507
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,409
Please.

508
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,248
Are you hungry?

509
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,408
Hannibal made breakfast for dinner.

510
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,402
I could eat.

511
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,250
What is it?

512
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,330
Abigail...

513
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,762
What do you see?

514
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,242
I see family.

515
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,800
Hello.

516
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,763
Think it's to late for us
to have kids?

517
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,243
It is for me.
