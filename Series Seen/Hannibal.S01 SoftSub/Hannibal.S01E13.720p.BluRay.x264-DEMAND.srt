1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,286
(Lecter) 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,722
Georgia Madchen was murdered
by whoever killed Dr Sutcliffe.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,649
Dad? It's for you.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,046
They know.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,767
He said he got so close to Garret
Jacob Hobbs, he was becoming him.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,326
- My name is Will Graham.
- (Crawford) You think he's mentally ill?

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,762
Whoever killed Marissa Schurr
and Cassie Boyle wanted to copy

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,848
how Garret Jacob Hobbs
killed his victims.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,327
- And now he has Hobbs' daughter.
- Who Hobbs intended to kill.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,646
Mind if I sit?

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,524
- Did Hannibal tell you?
- No, he didn't.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,325
- How many people have you killed?
- Many more than your father.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,851
Are you going to kill me?

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,202
(Laboured breathing)

15
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,602
(Dogs whimper and bark)

16
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,842
(Retching)

17
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,846
I went to Minnesota.

18
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,768
I took Abigail.

19
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,682
We went to Minnesota.

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,083
She didn't come back with me.

21
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,042
Show me.

22
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,442
I don't remember
going to bed last night.

23
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,809
But I must have.

24
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,085
Maybe I got up
to let the dogs out and then...

25
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,328
When was the last time
you saw Abigail?

26
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,761
- ...and my feet were muddy.
- Will!

27
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,531
When was the last time
you saw Abigail?

28
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,130
Yesterday.

29
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,285
At her father's cabin.

30
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,961
I had... an episode.

31
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,763
She said something was wrong with me.

32
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,331
She was afraid of me.

33
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,122
- And she ran away.
- What happened? Why was she afraid?

34
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,244
I hallucinated that I killed her.

35
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,684
But it wasn't real.

36
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,009
I know it wasn't real.

37
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,570
Will, we have to call Jack.

38
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,250
You can't run from this.
It will only be worse.

39
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,444
Get dressed.

40
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,050
What are we gonna find
in Minnesota, Will?

41
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,970
I don't know.

42
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,402
Go ahead and process him.

43
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,764
(Dog whimpers)

44
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,166
(Muffled voices)

45
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,288
(Price) Right rear pocket.

46
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,610
A leather wallet
containing $17.00 cash.

47
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,081
(Zeller) Right rear pocket.
Leather wallet, $17.00 cash.

48
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,248
(Price) Right front pocket.

49
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,080
- One folding knife.
- (Zeller) Right front pocket. Folding knife.

50
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,045
I can't do the silent treatment.

51
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,003
I can't pretend I don't know you

52
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,206
and I can't pretend we both don't know
what I'm finding under your nails.

53
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,568
You called me once because you didn't
trust yourself to know what was real.

54
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,286
- This blood is real, Will.
- I know.

55
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,131
Do you know how it got there?

56
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,365
Not with any certainty, no.

57
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,641
Certainty comes from the evidence.

58
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,004
I didn't want to find any evidence on you.
I wanted to be certain about who you are.

59
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,202
But you can't even be certain
with yourself.

60
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,924
Not any more.

61
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,409
If you weren't certain with yourself,
you shouldn't have been here.

62
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,164
This is the FBI.

63
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,001
I thought I would get better.

64
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,841
You always said you interpret
the evidence, so do it, Will.

65
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,208
Interpret the evidence.

66
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,250
According to the evidence...

67
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,610
...I killed Abigail Hobbs.

68
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,127
(Crawford) We analysed the tissue.
It matched Abigail Hobbs.

69
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,280
It was her ear,
her blood under Will's fingernails.

70
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,691
Scratches on his arms are all
defensive wounds, like she fought back.

71
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,086
Shut up.

72
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,809
- I...
- Stop talking.

73
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,084
"He won't get too close."
You said you would cover him.

74
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,044
- You could see he was breaking.
- Yes, I could.

75
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,041
And I kept pushing him,
because he was saving lives, Alana.

76
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,329
Not Abigail Hobbs' life.

77
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,128
Look me in the face and tell me
you couldn't see that he was breaking?

78
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,961
Of course I could see it.
I told you not to put him out there!

79
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,401
Every decision I made
concerning Will's mental health

80
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,723
I made under advisement
of a respected psychiatrist,

81
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,763
who you recommended.

82
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,531
Hannibal had to know,
he had to see something was wrong.

83
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,328
Not until it was too late.
Just like everybody else.

84
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,126
Hannibal said that Will was
exhibiting signs of dementia.

85
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,087
Dementia isn't a disease.
It's a symptom of disease!

86
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,329
We have to find out
what's causing it and treat it.

87
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,762
The concern is that
there may not be anything to treat.

88
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,962
Will had a brain scan.

89
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
They found nothing.

90
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,051
Well, then they don't know
what they're looking for.

91
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,088
This started with Garret Jacob Hobbs.

92
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,886
Maybe Will just did
what Hobbs couldn't.

93
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,407
He killed his daughter.

94
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,041
Abigail's blood is on all of us.

95
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,767
And so is Will's.

96
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,326
(♪ Music over audio)

97
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,645
(Door opens)

98
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,771
Hi.

99
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,606
Hi.

100
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,368
You're flushed. You been yelling?

101
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,568
- Screaming is more like it.
- I could use a good scream.

102
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,082
I can feel one perched under my chin.

103
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,807
- Let it out.
- I'm afraid that if I started...

104
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,880
...I wouldn't be able to stop.

105
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,324
I'm surprised Jack let you in here,
given my romantic overtures.

106
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,964
Jack doesn't know about
your romantic overtures.

107
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,968
Didn't know.

108
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,650
I guess you dodged a bullet with me.

109
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,684
I don't feel like I dodged a bullet.

110
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,163
I feel wounded.

111
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,766
I've been in touch
with, erm... Animal Services.

112
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,969
I'll go pick up your dogs
in a couple hours.

113
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,162
I'll take them back home with me,

114
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,249
and I'll take care of them until...

115
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,046
...whenever.

116
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,243
Whenever could be
a long time from now.

117
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,967
I'll take care of them until then.

118
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,890
Thank you.

119
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,210
We have to do some tests.

120
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,721
They'll be the standard
psychopathology tests.

121
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,402
I suppose you're gonna ask me
to draw a clock while you're at it.

122
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,803
Did Hannibal ask you to draw a clock?

123
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,321
He said it was an exercise...

124
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,440
...to ground me
in the present moment.

125
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,009
A handle to help me hold onto reality.

126
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,921
- Was the clock normal?
- Would I be here if it wasn't?

127
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,450
Draw me a clock.

128
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,607
(Sighs heavily)

129
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,770
(Graham) You see?
It's just a normal clock.

130
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,406
Telling the time isn't my problem.

131
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,366
It's the least of your problems.

132
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,683
It seems hard to find words today.

133
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,565
Ah...

134
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,288
Despite the overwhelming evidence,
I find myself

135
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,768
searching for ways
that Abigail could still be alive.

136
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,761
Grieving is an individual process
with a universal goal,

137
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,807
the truest examination of the meaning
of life and the meaning of its end.

138
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,127
I know what life means.

139
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,210
We've existed for
a hundred thousand years.

140
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,766
In that time, a hundred billion human
lives have had beginnings and ends.

141
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,407
A hundred billion lives
haven't impacted yours,

142
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,123
but clearly Abigail Hobbs' life has
and you seem surprised by that.

143
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,010
I never considered having a child.

144
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,687
But after meeting Abigail,
I understood the appeal.

145
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,925
The opportunity to guide and support,
and, in many ways, direct a life.

146
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,561
- You were having influence on her?
- I was hoping I was.

147
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,326
Young people are supposed
to be the lenses

148
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,603
through which we see ourselves
living beyond this life.

149
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,286
I think of my earliest memory

150
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,007
and project forward to what
I imagine will be my death.

151
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,880
I never think about living
beyond that span of time.

152
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,045
- Except by reputation.
- Even after this loss?

153
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,441
More so after this loss.

154
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,729
Will Graham is a loss, too.

155
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,764
You might grieve him as a loss.

156
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,281
I haven't given up on Will.

157
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,041
If they do find him guilty
of killing Abigail Hobbs...

158
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,245
When.
Let's be honest.

159
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,565
I don't recommend you participate
in any rehabilitation effort.

160
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,851
I was so confident in my ability
to help him, to solve him.

161
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,008
To save him.

162
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,128
Saving him, I lost Abigail.

163
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,801
It's hard to accept that I could
fail them both so profoundly.

164
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,281
(Crawford) OK, Jimmy,
what have you got?

165
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,088
As you know, Will is a big fly fisherman
and he designs all of his own lures.

166
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,444
Most anglers use feathers,
fur, twine, bits of shell.

167
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,444
They design each lure
to catch a specific fish.

168
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,809
This one caught my eye.
I noticed the hair colour.

169
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,082
Took me a few
to accept what I was seeing.

170
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,521
I ran a chem-set
to confirm the connection.

171
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,051
What connection?

172
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,243
Four of the lures are made from
materials including human remains.

173
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,647
(Price) And we have a DNA match
for all of them.

174
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,047
(Katz) This one is Cassie Boyle.

175
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,811
Bits of bone fragments
and pieces of lung.

176
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,687
Marissa Schurr. Antler velvet,
a fingernail, wound with her hair.

177
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,088
Dr Sutcliffe. Crushed teeth,
soft tissue from inside his mouth,

178
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,441
bound with cartilage from his jaw.

179
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,648
All victims of the copycat?

180
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,765
And this last lure was made with hair
and fibre that matches Georgia Madchen.

181
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,929
- He took trophies of all his victims.
- Trophies?

182
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,884
So now Will Graham's a serial killer
who takes trophies?

183
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,767
Somethings wrong with Will physically,
neurologically. He's not a serial killer.

184
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,611
(Crawford) You're sick, Will.

185
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,450
I wasn't consistent
with taking my antibiotics.

186
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,807
The fever came back.

187
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,127
We're gonna move you
to a secure medical ward,

188
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
get to the bottom of whatever it is
that's wrong with you

189
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,528
and make sure that you get
whatever kind of treatment you need.

190
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,404
And then what?

191
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,169
Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane?

192
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,805
Have Chilton fumbling
around in my head?

193
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,050
This job doesn't generally
lend itself to optimism, all right?

194
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,448
But I desperately want to be
optimistic about an alternative

195
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,331
to what every fibre of the evidence
is telling me you've done.

196
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,330
I can't confess to something
I don't remember.

197
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,651
The question is, how much more
is there that you don't remember?

198
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,891
We found your fishing lures.

199
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,764
Yeah, I should hope so.

200
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,645
They were on my desk
right by the front door.

201
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,642
We found human remains amongst
the materials that you made them from.

202
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,730
The human remains
of Cassie Boyle, Marissa Schurr,

203
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,606
Donald Sutcliffe, Georgia Madchen.

204
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,765
No.

205
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,644
Yes.

206
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,364
I wasn't...

207
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,087
I wasn't sick when Cassie Boyle
was murdered.

208
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,526
I wasn't sick when Marissa Schurr
was murdered.

209
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,409
That's not an argument you wanna
be making right now. Not with me.

210
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,641
Because then I'd be a psychopath.

211
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,321
My biggest fear is that we'll learn

212
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,126
that you knew what you were doing
the whole time.

213
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,562
You don't have to be afraid of that, Jack.

214
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,800
There is something
you should be afraid of, though.

215
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,285
Yeah? What's that?

216
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,323
Whoever's doing this to me...

217
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,131
- Someone's doing this to you?
- They'll be close to you.

218
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,848
It could be someone here.
Working with you.

219
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,281
So that's it? It's a set-up?

220
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,122
They know the cases.
They know forensics.

221
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,128
They know that I'm unstable.

222
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,131
Can you hear how paranoid
you sound?

223
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,608
Or it could just be you.

224
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,806
Then I'd be really screwed, wouldn't I?

225
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,569
I wanted to be the one to do this.

226
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,641
Will Graham,
you're under arrest for murder.

227
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,809
You have the right to remain silent.

228
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,804
He disarmed his guard.

229
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,400
He threw the guard and the driver
from the vehicle.

230
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,248
We found the ambulance
in an alley in Dumfries.

231
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,203
These are not the actions
of an innocent man.

232
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,971
They're the actions
of a man who's impaired.

233
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,449
I had Will draw a clock
to test for cognitive dysfunction.

234
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,962
(Lecter) That is extreme.

235
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,600
Now this is the clock
he drew for me two weeks ago.

236
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,401
It's normal.

237
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,924
What disease progresses gradually
but plateaus for lengths of time?

238
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,929
Will has periods of clarity.

239
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,122
We've seen him lucid and aware
one moment

240
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,891
and then the next moment he's not.

241
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,130
- Could be some form of encephalitis.
- Auto-immune encephalitis?

242
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,289
It's hard to diagnose.
There are no tumours. No lesions.

243
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,971
It wouldn't even show up on a brain scan
unless you were looking for it.

244
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,166
Look, just tell me if he could kill
five people and not be aware of it.

245
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,604
This doesn't feel like dementia.
This is an intelligent psychopath.

246
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,645
Look, this killer called the Hobbs' house,
he warned Abigail's father.

247
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,842
I was with Will that entire time.

248
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,042
Did he have an opportunity
to make a phone call?

249
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,447
Before we went to interview
Garret Jacob Hobbs,

250
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,809
he was alone in the office while I was
outside loading the car with the files,

251
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,402
but that was only for a few minutes.

252
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,801
Dumb luck and bad bookkeeping.

253
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,404
That's how Will said he caught Hobbs.
Now how would you say he caught him?

254
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,882
We were looking through the files

255
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,891
and it was as if Will plucked
his name out of a hat,

256
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,968
based on little more than
an incomplete address.

257
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,686
Let me play the devil here
for a moment, Doctor.

258
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,691
This clock test...
Could Will fake something like this?

259
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,121
Would he be able to do that?

260
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,160
Yes.

261
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,807
Hello, Will.
How are you feeling?

262
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,924
Self aware.

263
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,648
You frightened Alana Bloom.

264
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,411
She's confused about who I am...

265
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,249
...which I can relate to.

266
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,087
- Are you confused about who I am?
- I'm not confused. I'm sceptical.

267
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,443
Meaning I'm willing to change my mind
should the evidence change.

268
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,331
Do you believe I killed Abigail?

269
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,331
I believe it's entirely possible,

270
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,128
if not nearly indisputable,
based on how you discovered her ear.

271
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,404
If it was just Abigail,
I would've believed.

272
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,888
I would've believed that I got so far
inside Hobbs' head I couldn't get out.

273
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,890
But it wasn't just Abigail.

274
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,521
- I know who I am.
- No.

275
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,122
All sense of who you are
has been distorted by your illness.

276
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,403
You know who you are
in this moment.

277
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,730
That's not always the case, Will.

278
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,411
I didn't kill any of them.

279
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,842
And somebody is making sure
that no one believes me.

280
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,689
If we're to prove
you didn't commit these murders,

281
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,644
perhaps we should consider
how you could have.

282
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,808
And then disprove that.

283
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,207
If you are this killer,

284
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,450
that identity runs through these events
like a thread through pearls.

285
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,801
Cassie Boyle would have been
your first victim.

286
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,685
You said her crime scene
was practically gift-wrapped.

287
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,288
It told me everything I needed to know
to catch Garret Jacob Hobbs.

288
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,086
(Lecter) You had seen one of Hobbs'
victims. You knew how he killed.

289
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,771
You may have been exploring
how he killed

290
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,281
to better understand who he was.

291
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,529
I wasn't in Minnesota
when Cassie Boyle was murdered.

292
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,850
She disappeared on a Saturday.
She was found on a Monday.

293
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,128
You would've had the weekend
to do your work.

294
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,402
I know I didn't kill her.

295
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,244
How do you know?

296
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,682
What did you think
when you first met Marissa Schurr?

297
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,928
How much like Abigail she was?

298
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,968
Same height, same weight,
hair colour, same age.

299
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,562
- How could I resist?
- So much like his daughter.

300
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,288
You may have wondered why Garret
Jacob Hobbs didn't kill her himself.

301
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,200
Dr Sutcliffe wasn't killed
how Garret Jacob Hobbs killed.

302
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,441
He was murdered how you imagined
yourself murdering a woman

303
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,728
only days before.

304
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,969
How Georgia Madchen killed.

305
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,686
She dreamt she saw me killing Sutcliffe.

306
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,407
But she couldn't see my face.
And then she was murdered.

307
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,009
You catch these killers
by getting into their heads,

308
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,044
but you also allow them
into your own.

309
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,327
I'm trying to help you, Will.

310
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,248
Then take me to Minnesota.

311
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,364
I want to see where Abigail died.

312
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,249
Have you had any contact with
Hannibal Lecter in the last 24 hours?

313
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,442
He didn't make his session this morning

314
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,649
and he didn't call in,
which he would consider rude.

315
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,730
- Is something wrong?
- I'm on my way to Minnesota.

316
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,446
I believe that Will Graham has taken
Hannibal to Minnesota.

317
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,206
Will thinks he's being framed
for these murders.

318
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,290
He's slipping in and out of delusion.

319
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,846
He could kill Hannibal
and not even know he's doing it.

320
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,126
If anyone could've helped Mr Graham,
it would've been Hannibal.

321
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,164
In fact, he may still be trying.

322
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,122
(Phone ringing)

323
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,922
Hello?

324
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,203
Just a second. Dad? It's for you.

325
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,045
Caller ID said it was blocked.

326
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,843
Hello?

327
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,327
(Lecter) 'Will?'

328
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,090
Yes.

329
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,407
Will?

330
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,163
We're here.

331
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,447
Are we gonna re-enact the crime?
You be my dad. You be my mum.

332
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,570
And you be the man on the phone.

333
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,008
Are we gonna re-enact the crime?

334
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,171
If that would help you.

335
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,643
It's as if Abigail was supposed
to die in this kitchen.

336
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,888
Her throat was cut.

337
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,691
She lost great gouts of blood.

338
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,090
There's an unmistakable arterial spray.

339
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,130
- They haven't found her body.
- Just the one piece.

340
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,131
If you were in Garret Jacob Hobbs'
frame of mind when you killed her,

341
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,129
they may never find her.

342
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,925
Cos I honoured every part of her?

343
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,408
Perhaps you didn't come here
looking for a killer.

344
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,643
Perhaps you came here
to find yourself.

345
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,762
You killed a man in this very room.

346
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,041
I stared at Hobbs.

347
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,007
And the space opposite me
assumed the shape of a man

348
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,602
filled with dark and swarming flies.

349
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,244
Then I scattered them.

350
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,922
At a time when other men
fear their isolation,

351
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,647
yours has become
understandable to you.

352
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,085
You are alone
because you are unique.

353
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,922
I'm as alone as you are.

354
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,965
If you followed the urges
you kept down for so long,

355
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,244
cultivated them
as the inspirations they are...

356
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,210
...you would have become
someone other than yourself.

357
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,567
I know who I am.

358
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,963
I'm not so sure
I know who you are any more.

359
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,281
But I am certain
one of us killed Abigail.

360
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,404
Whoever that was, killed the others.

361
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,444
Are you a killer, Will?

362
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,446
You. Right now.
This man standing in front of me.

363
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,764
- Is this who you really are?
- I am who I've always been.

364
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,762
The scales have just fallen
from my eyes.

365
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,001
I can see you now.

366
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,846
What do you see?

367
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,962
You called here that morning.

368
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,880
Abigail knew.

369
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,210
And you kept her secrets until...

370
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,449
Until what?
Until she found out some of yours?

371
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,850
You said it felt good
to kill Garret Jacob Hobbs.

372
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,760
- Would it feel good to kill me now?
- Garret Jacob Hobbs was a murderer.

373
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,603
- Are you a murderer, Dr Lecter?
- What reason would I have?

374
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,682
You have no traceable motive...

375
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,241
...which is why
you were so hard to see.

376
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,651
You were just curious
what I would do.

377
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,004
Someone like me.

378
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,600
Someone who thinks how I think.

379
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,129
Wind him up and watch him go.

380
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,883
Apparently, Dr Lecter...
this is how I go.

381
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,042
Will?

382
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,321
Easy.

383
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,091
See?

384
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,050
You see?

385
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,325
((Medical instruments bleeping)

386
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,683
(Lecter) The right hemisphere
of his brain was inflamed.

387
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,928
They've placed him
in an induced sleep

388
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,329
and they are treating him
with antiviral and steroid therapies.

389
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,411
- Is he responding?
- More or less.

390
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,411
He's expected to make
a substantial recovery.

391
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,086
Would you have gone to Minnesota
with him if he didn't have a gun on you?

392
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,409
I would have wanted to.

393
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,207
I believe I've failed to satisfy
my obligation to Will,

394
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,846
more than I care to admit.

395
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,611
Well, he's not your victim, Doctor.

396
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,605
Nor is he yours.

397
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,284
You know, in my time
I've seen people broken by the world.

398
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,449
I've seen them broken in all kinds
of hideous and offhanded ways

399
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,410
but never like this.

400
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,767
Never like this.

401
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,127
No one in this room will be the same.

402
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,644
- Good evening.
- Hello, Hannibal. Please come in.

403
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,650
Tête de Veau en Sauce Verte.

404
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,728
It smells like a bonfire.

405
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,561
I smoked the veal
on a pyre of dry hay.

406
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,131
It imparts a unique smouldering
flavour to the meat and to the room.

407
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,608
This is an unexpected treat.

408
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,127
Thank you for indulging me.

409
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,322
You seemed like you needed to talk.

410
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,091
Since you refuse invitations
to my dinner table,

411
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,248
this is the only way I could cook for you.

412
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,125
What's on your mind, Hannibal?

413
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,448
I'm going to see Will tomorrow.

414
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,764
As a patient or as a friend?

415
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,049
As a farewell. Of sorts.

416
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,406
I thought Mr Graham was finally going
to be the patient who cost you your life.

417
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,963
He didn't cost me my life.
He cost Abigail hers.

418
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,809
- Your veal is getting cold.
- Controversial dish, veal.

419
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,607
Mmm.

420
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,084
Those who denounce veal often cite the
young age at which the animals are killed,

421
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,888
when they're in fact older
than many pigs going to slaughter.

422
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,121
You have to be careful, Hannibal.
They're starting to see your pattern.

423
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,646
What pattern would that be?

424
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,402
You develop relationships with patients
who are prone to violence.

425
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,044
That pattern.

426
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,447
Under scrutiny, Jack Crawford's beliefs
about you might start to unravel.

427
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,205
Tell me, Dr Du Maurier...

428
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,123
...have your beliefs about me
begun to unravel?

429
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,441
Hello, Will.

430
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,407
Hello, Dr Lecter.
