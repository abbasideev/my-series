00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,081
(Lecter)
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,850
I thought it might be
the Chesapeake Ripper,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,689
but there were
no surgical trophies taken.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,201
- I need you to prepare yourself on this.
- I'm prepared.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,810
Prepare yourself more.
It's soup in there.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,003
Jack gave you his word
he would protect your headspace,

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,884
yet he leaves you
to your mental devices.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,002
Are you trying to alienate me
from Jack Crawford?

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,602
It's difficult to lie still and fear going
to sleep when it's there to think about.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,721
Do you have a history
of sleepwalking, Mr Graham?

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,286
My wife and I need to talk.
May we use your waiting room?

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,926
- Lung cancer.
- When were you gonna tell me?

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,691
- Do I seem different?
- But you've always been a little different.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,882
It's getting harder and harder
to make myself look.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,809
I won't tell you what you ought to do.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,968
I don't know how much longer
I can be useful to you, Jack.

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,128
Really?
The last three we had, you caught.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,890
You can't arrest me for writing an article.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,890
You don't write another word about
Will Graham and I won't have to.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,088
This is your final opportunity
to comply.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,161
On your feet, Dr Gideon,
or we will restrain you.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,764
(Door buzzes)

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,251
All right, lace your fingers
behind your head!

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,846
Get a gurney!

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,401
(Machine flatlines)

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,846
Thanks to Freddie Lounds,
there's an unconfirmed story out there

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,008
that the Chesapeake Ripper's
already in custody.

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,691
Unconfirmed. Am I confirming?

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,771
- Fact-checking for Freddie Lounds?
- You're fact-checking for me.

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,928
I always feel nervous
going in these places.

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,930
- Why's that?
- Afraid they won't let me out.

32
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,442
- Don't worry, I won't leave you here.
- Yeah, not today.

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,762
Dr Bloom just called me about you,
Mr Graham...

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,646
- Or should I call you Dr Graham?
- I'm not a doctor.

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,127
You're not FBI either.
That's a temporary identification.

36
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,642
- Mr Graham teaches at the Academy.
- Ah, a teacher.

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,364
Please, gentlemen, take a seat.

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,365
Thank you.

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,926
Dr Chilton, we need to see
the crime scene

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,281
while it's still relatively undisturbed.

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,121
I assure you, for something
so disturbing, it is quite undisturbed.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,288
Why was a nurse left alone
with a prisoner

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,846
in a high-security psychiatric hospital?

44
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,851
For the two years since he was
brought here, Gideon behaved perfectly

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,282
and gave every appearance
of cooperating with attempts at therapy.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,531
As dictated by our present administrator,
security around him was slightly relaxed.

47
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,202
I cannot help feeling responsible
myself for what happened.

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,961
He sat directly across from me
and I had no idea what he was hiding.

49
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,243
- And now one of our staff is dead.
- (Crawford) I understand, Doctor.

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,522
Mr Graham's going to need
to see the crime scene

51
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,688
with as much privacy
as you can provide.

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,768
Oh, yes, that thing you do.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,249
You're quite the topic of conversation
in psychiatric circles, Mr Graham.

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,968
- Am I?
- Uh, yes.

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,050
A unique cocktail
of personality disorders and neuroses

56
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,845
that make you a highly skilled profiler.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,884
- He's not here to be analysed.
- Perhaps he should be.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,642
We are woefully short of material
on your sort of "thing", Mr Graham.

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,127
- Would you speak to some of the staff?
- (Crawford) Doctor.

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,961
No, no. Not this trip.
Maybe a special visit.

61
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,721
Thank you, Dr Chilton.
I'd like to see the crime scene now.

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,922
So Gideon was restrained?

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,769
- Handcuffed.
- Hmm.

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,441
He concealed a fork tine in the palm
of his hand and used it to pick the lock.

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,968
- Where is he now?
- In his cell.

66
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,084
You'll note the removal of organs
and the abdominal mutilations

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,646
are all consistent
with the Chesapeake Ripper.

68
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,287
So is the brutalisation of the corpses,
but the Ripper is still out there.

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,281
Jack... what I'm about to show you
suggests otherwise.

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,845
(Door buzzes)

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,846
Dr Chilton consulted on the case
when we failed to catch the Ripper

72
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,566
after his last series of murders.

73
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,962
The reason you kept failing to capture
The Chesapeake Ripper

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,447
was I already had him.

75
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,810
(Machine bleeps)

76
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,447
(Nurse Shell)
Ah!

77
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,409
Shh, shh, shh!

78
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,610
Erm...

79
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,645
Far as we know, it's been over two years
since the Chesapeake Ripper killed?

80
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,364
That's correct.

81
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,331
- When was Gideon admitted?
- Almost two years ago.

82
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,527
(Crawford) Lass, Miriam. Come in.

83
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,325
- Morning, Agent Crawford.
- Sorry to pull you out of class.

84
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,842
There's nothing wrong.
Er... no reason to be nervous.

85
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,725
I'm not nervous. Curious.

86
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,730
Your instructors tell me that
you are in the top ten per cent.

87
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,966
Top five, sir.

88
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,766
You'll have to stop correcting me
if we're gonna get along, Lass.

89
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,644
Take a seat.

90
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,242
You wrote me a letter
when you qualified for the Academy.

91
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,561
I wasn't sure you got it.
You never replied.

92
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,002
Never do. Odds are against any trainee
completing the programme.

93
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,442
But I'm glad to see you're still here.

94
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,285
In your letter, you said
you wanted to work for me

95
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,084
in the violent criminal
apprehension programme.

96
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,642
- Yes, sir.
- There might be an opportunity.

97
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,001
I'm assuming that you're familiar
with the Chesapeake Ripper.

98
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,646
- Yes.
- Ripper's very hot right now.

99
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,649
Killed his last two victims
in six days.

100
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,843
There'll be at least one more body
and then nothing for months.

101
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,407
- They say he's a true sociopath.
- What do you say?

102
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,650
I say they don't know
what else to label him.

103
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,889
He has some of the characteristics
of what they call a sociopath.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,889
No remorse or guilt at all.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,764
He won't have
any of the other marks.

106
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,450
He won't be a drifter.

107
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,571
He'll have no history of trouble
with the law. He'll be hard to catch.

108
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,011
I'm assigning you to
the Chesapeake Ripper task force.

109
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,964
You're gonna work directly under me.

110
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,890
I'm grateful for the opportunity,
Agent Crawford.

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,924
But I can't help wondering... why me?

112
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,640
You have a forensics fellowship,
six years of law enforcement,

113
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,560
a degree in psychology,
doctorate in criminology.

114
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,844
And what I don't have
are enough warm bodies.

115
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,123
So, I'm gonna need
your full attention on this.

116
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,810
(Lass) 'Yes, sir.'

117
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,724
(Chilton) The volume of Abel Gideon's
mail is becoming a nuisance.

118
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,731
Sometimes I feel like his secretary
rather than his keeper.

119
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,287
Any specific correspondences
that stood out from the others?

120
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,564
Mostly researchers or PhD candidates
requesting interviews.

121
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,004
A scattered dozen lonely hearts
seeking his hand in marriage.

122
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,920
He butchered his last wife
and her family on Thanksgiving.

123
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,930
There's no accounting for taste.
Or intelligence.

124
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,088
Murdering his wife was impulsive.

125
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,000
The Chesapeake Ripper is...
methodical, meticulous.

126
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,205
- That's why he's so hard to catch.
- Was so hard to catch.

127
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,283
- Will you be conducting a joint interview?
- Separate. Compare and contrast.

128
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,562
I know you're anxious to get on with it.

129
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,047
You have talked to Gideon before,
for some length of time.

130
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,128
I saw him mainly in court.

131
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,971
I wrote an article about him
in the Journal of Criminal Psychology.

132
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,447
He is very familiar with you.

133
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,811
- He has given you a lot of thought.
- You had some sessions with him?

134
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,402
Yes, two. A couple years ago
when he was first institutionalised.

135
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,724
I've read your notes, of course,
they were more or less helpful

136
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,561
as I conducted my own interviews
with Dr Gideon over the years.

137
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,843
- Well, I'm glad I was helpful.
- More or less.

138
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,085
I'll go first.

139
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,884
(Door buzzes)

140
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,325
Why, Dr Bloom.
How wonderful to see you again.

141
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,204
You remembered.

142
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,723
I've met a lot of psychiatrists.
It's hard to forget one so sublime.

143
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,571
Thank you for your time, Dr Gideon,
I won't waste it.

144
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,569
Shall we begin?

145
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,887
Dr Bloom, what is this to be?

146
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,924
I was caught red-handed.
I mean, literally.

147
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,647
There's no mystery
as to whodunit. I did it.

148
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,845
The mystery is whether
you are who you say you are.

149
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,291
Or not.

150
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,290
Never liked being called
the Chesapeake Ripper.

151
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,927
Maybe something
with a little more wit.

152
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,523
Is that why you didn't take credit
for the Ripper murders before now?

153
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,883
Just watching the goose chase
from the box seats.

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,244
Two years of goose-chasing.
You must be a very patient man.

155
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,840
Are you just gonna run
the psychopathic checklist?

156
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,249
I have had my personality inventoried
by the Minnesota Multiphasic.

157
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,806
Would you prefer a Rorschach test?

158
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,763
If you're gonna show me
those pictures,

159
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,566
maybe you should put a blood
pressure cuff to my genitals.

160
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,651
I find it gives a much truer
gauge of reaction.

161
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,130
What effect were you hoping to have
by killing the night nurse?

162
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,245
The effect I was hoping to have
was her death.

163
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,969
Mission accomplished.

164
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,323
Brutalisation of the body
was done posthumously.

165
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,051
The Chesapeake Ripper usually does
that sort of thing during, not after.

166
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,769
I do not have to convince you
that I am the Chesapeake Ripper.

167
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,604
Seems that's what you need to do.

168
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,846
It's certainly what somebody needs.

169
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,406
Jack. Come in.

170
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry. Um...

171
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,641
I was just, uh...

172
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,569
In the neighbourhood.

173
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,967
Yeah, something like that.

174
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,242
How's Mrs Crawford?

175
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,921
Yeah, that's why
I was in the neighbourhood.

176
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,849
She's fine.

177
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,170
Well, she tells me that she's fine,
and she tells me when she's not.

178
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,888
You expect me to tell you more?

179
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,800
Look, Bella's at a NATO conference.

180
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,651
I can't talk to her. She's working.

181
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,762
I doubt I could talk to her
if she was here.

182
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,804
- About her condition?
- Yeah. About her cancer, her dying.

183
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,288
She doesn't want to talk to me about it.

184
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,688
I am prohibited from talking about it.
Doctor/patient confidentiality.

185
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,962
You talk to me about Will Graham.

186
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,846
Will Graham is not officially my patient.
We have conversations.

187
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,850
What do you consider this?

188
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,610
Desperate coping.

189
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,686
You don't think I have a right to know
what's happening with my wife?

190
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,010
You have every right to know
what's happening, but not from me.

191
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,249
I'm not just gonna stand outside
my marriage and watch this happen.

192
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,682
If that's what she wants, too bad.
She married the wrong guy for that.

193
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,367
I'll offer one insight. She doesn't think
she married the wrong guy.

194
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,928
I can't stop thinking about
when my wife is gonna die.

195
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,245
I look at her side of the bed and I think,
"Is she gonna die there?"

196
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,407
I can't stop thinking about it,
you understand? I can't stop.

197
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,002
You're dreading the loss
of your wife.

198
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,690
Yes.

199
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,403
And I'm thinking
about other losses too.

200
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,441
What other losses are you dreading?

201
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,122
Jack, you can't save her.
She won't let you.

202
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,607
The cancer won't let you.

203
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,242
Who else couldn't you save?

204
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,450
- Where is everyone?
- It's just you and me for the time being.

205
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,365
Take a look around here.
Tell me what you see.

206
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,925
He did it all here.

207
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,125
Did it while he was alive. He struck
the throat so he couldn't call for help.

208
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,642
You think he was unconscious
when the Ripper did the ripping?

209
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,922
No, he'd want him awake.

210
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,651
Organs were removed.
Not all of them. He was choosy.

211
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,128
He took the liver, thymus,
but left the heart.

212
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,885
What's he doing with the organs?

213
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,843
Surgical trophies.

214
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,682
He's a medical doctor, isn't he?
Is that why you call him the Ripper?

215
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,121
Why do you say that?

216
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,522
Psychopaths are attracted
to surgical fields.

217
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,404
They offer power

218
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,962
and require the ability to make
objective clinical decisions without feeling.

219
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,447
White male?

220
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,443
40s? 50s?

221
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,001
I don't know that he's white.

222
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,082
He's exotic somehow...

223
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,006
...which is why
you're gonna catch him.

224
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,808
- I'm gonna catch him?
- We call you the guru.

225
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,446
You have a peculiar cleverness.

226
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,002
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- You should.

227
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,841
You'll probably spot him
before anybody else.

228
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,450
Or you will.

229
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,007
Now I want you
to take a look at this.

230
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,010
There's no detectable consistency
with the Ripper victims.

231
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,282
He doesn't hunt exclusively
within his own ethnic group.

232
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,846
He's killed all creeds, colours,
men and women.

233
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,284
She has the exact same wound pattern
as the last victim of the Ripper. Exact.

234
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,802
We never found a body
for his last known victim.

235
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,400
Then the victim before that.

236
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,441
I see the Ripper,
but I don't... feel the Ripper.

237
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,204
This is plagiarism.

238
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,121
We never made the wound patterns
for any of the Ripper's victims public.

239
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,289
Maybe he is the Ripper, I don't know,
but if he's a plagiarist,

240
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,167
the real Chesapeake Ripper is gonna
make sure everybody knows it.

241
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,964
(Phone rings)

242
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,160
Hello.

243
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,522
(Lass) 'Jack? Jack?'

244
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,371
- Who is this?
- 'Jack, it's Miriam.

245
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,286
'I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.'

246
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,961
- Miriam?
- 'I was so wrong. I was so wrong.'

247
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,684
Miriam?

248
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,201
'Please, Jack... Please.'

249
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,606
(Bleep)

250
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,288
I'm hooked into every carrier database
and telephone provider in the US.

251
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,084
- Nothing.
- Look again.

252
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,443
I did my agains.
And my again and again and agains.

253
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,809
I can't find any electronic trace of
any call made to your home at 2:46am.

254
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,049
I am telling you that the phone rang.

255
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,046
- Wake your wife up?
- I was alone.

256
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,130
Whoever made that call could've made it
from that box outside your house

257
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,402
or a junction in your neighbourhood.

258
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,689
Either way, there would be
no trace signal to track.

259
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,883
- You're sure it was Miriam Lass?
- It was Miriam.

260
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,651
You haven't heard her voice
in two years, Jack.

261
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,922
You gonna continue to question me, Z?

262
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,250
If so, maybe I should ask you to leave
while it's still safe for you to be here.

263
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,444
The Chesapeake Ripper recorded
Miriam Lass two years ago

264
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,125
as he was killing her.

265
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,801
Last night,
he called my house at 2:46am.

266
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,002
He played that recording for me.

267
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,805
Then we know the Ripper
is not Dr Gideon,

268
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,641
because we know the call wasn't made
from the Baltimore State Hospital.

269
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,608
- That we would've been able to trace.
- Are you certain it was a recording?

270
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,770
Jack, you said yourself,
there's no body.

271
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,564
Miriam Lass is dead!

272
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,288
The Ripper is making it very clear
that someone is plagiarising his work!

273
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,767
(Zeller) It was 2:46
in the morning, Jack.

274
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,770
You're in a deep sleep,
you're roused, you're disoriented.

275
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,123
You might not even know
you're still asleep.

276
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,925
I know when I'm awake.

277
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,608
(Hooves stepping)

278
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,049
(stag snorts)

279
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,443
(stag growls)

280
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,125
Will? You look like
you were dreaming.

281
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,402
I was thinking about something else.

282
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,770
Well, here's something
for you to think about.

283
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,009
We have a direct way of communicating
with the Chesapeake Ripper,

284
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,851
and we'd like to see
if we can push him.

285
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,724
Push him toward what?

286
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,081
We might be able to influence him
to become visible.

287
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,964
If we can enrage him.

288
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,970
To what purpose, Jack?
I don't see what you're asking.

289
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,880
Is there a way to push the Chesapeake
Ripper and focus his attention?

290
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,085
He's already focused on Gideon
as his adversary. Don't fool around.

291
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,522
Gideon is just a tabloid rumour right now.
We need to make him the truth.

292
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,086
You might push the Ripper
to kill again

293
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,090
just to prove he isn't in a hospital
for the criminally insane.

294
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,771
I have to push, Will.

295
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,804
Are you thinking about getting
into bed with Freddie Lounds?

296
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,244
You yourself know it's the best way
to bait the real Chesapeake Ripper.

297
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,091
Morning, Agent Crawford.
Thank you for inviting me.

298
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,884
Miss Lounds.

299
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,288
This is Dr Alana Bloom.

300
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,131
She's one of our psychiatric consultants.

301
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,642
- I believe you know Will Graham.
- Mr Graham. So good to see you.

302
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,005
Miss Lounds, you have all
the qualities of a good reporter.

303
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,249
You have intelligence,
guts, a good eye.

304
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,081
So how is it that you wind up
where you've ended up?

305
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,647
Where I wound up
being criminal justice journalism?

306
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,128
"Criminal justice journalism" being
a euphemism for tabloid reporting.

307
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,850
You ran an unconfirmed story
about the Chesapeake Ripper.

308
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,567
What I want...
is for you to confirm it.

309
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,808
An exclusive story would be a coup.

310
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,241
Mm... yes, it would.

311
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,126
And you would get the satisfaction
of seeing the Los Angeles Times,

312
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,130
the sanctified Washington Post,

313
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,245
and even the holy New York Times
run copyrighted material

314
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,331
under your by-line,
with a picture credit.

315
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,523
What's against you
and by association us

316
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,885
is that your brand of journalism is
obnoxious and therefore disliked.

317
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,401
Yes, that is an obstacle.

318
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,442
I tried to get an interview
with Dr Gideon. I was denied.

319
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,762
Evidently some trouble
with my euphemism.

320
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,647
I'm friendly with the new chief of staff,
I can get you an interview.

321
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,447
Not to snap bubble gum and crack wise,
but what's my angle?

322
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,888
Is he the Chesapeake Ripper? Or you
just want me to tell everybody he is?

323
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,131
He could be, and certain personalities
are attracted to certain professions.

324
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,767
You know what profession psychopaths
disproportionately gravitate to?

325
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,451
CEOs, lawyers, the clergy.

326
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,444
Number five on the list
is surgeons.

327
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,889
- I know the list.
- Then you know what number six is.

328
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,048
Journalists.

329
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,640
Know what number seven is,
Mr Graham?

330
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,444
Law enforcement.

331
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,809
Here we are, a bunch of psychopaths
helping each other out.

332
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,410
Dr Gideon, I'm Freddie Lounds.

333
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,722
May I call you Dr Gideon?

334
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,241
Or do you prefer
the Chesapeake Ripper?

335
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,284
'His name is Dr Abel Gideon,
and strong evidence has surfaced

336
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,562
'that he's far more than
a mild mannered surgeon

337
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,523
'who cruelly murdered his wife.

338
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,449
'Maybe, just maybe,

339
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,683
'Gideon is the most sought after
serial killer at large,

340
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,962
'a killer who's eluded the FBI
for years

341
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,129
'and has baffled
their most gifted profilers.

342
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,847
'That serial killer? None other
than the Chesapeake Ripper.

343
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,602
'This would explain why the Ripper has
been silent for more than two years.'

344
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,246
- So are you enjoying reading my mail?
- No, not particularly.

345
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,570
Looking for something instructional?
Diagrams?

346
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,446
Don't believe I can recreate
one of my own murders from memory?

347
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,410
You wouldn't be recreating them
from your memory, Doctor.

348
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,847
You're not the Chesapeake Ripper.

349
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,440
Ooh, have to agree to disagree.

350
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,602
Then why the surgical trophies?

351
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,565
Agent Crawford, there are just
some things you're not allowed to do

352
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,967
in a state-certified operating room.

353
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,287
You didn't take any trophies
when you murdered your wife

354
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,289
and her family on Thanksgiving.

355
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,722
- You put none on display. Why not?
- Crime of passion.

356
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,401
You know how stressful
the holidays can get.

357
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,044
Anyway, you didn't come here to talk
about my wife or the little nursey.

358
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,164
Oh? What am I here to talk about?

359
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,201
Your trainee.

360
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,802
Miriam... somebody.

361
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,247
You're telling me
you killed Miriam Lass.

362
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,411
Yes.
Didn't mean to kill her.

363
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,086
Now don't get mad at me.

364
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,407
I'm not mad at you.

365
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,122
I know where you are.
I know how you got here. I read your file.

366
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,846
I'm curious, why are you being
so forthcoming all of a sudden?

367
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,725
Well, what have I got to lose?

368
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,242
You know where I am
and you know how I got here.

369
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,206
- Why didn't you put her on display?
- What makes you think I didn't?

370
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,082
(Phone rings)

371
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,965
Excuse me.

372
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,251
The polite thing to do
is to ask them to call back.

373
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,689
Unless it's not an option.

374
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,129
You're home early.

375
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,808
Bella? Something wrong?

376
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,570
'Jack, it's Miriam.

377
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,002
'I don't know where I am,
I can't see anything.

378
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,169
'I was so wrong. I was so wrong.

379
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,207
'Please, Jack,
I don't wanna die like this.'

380
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,002
In my house. In my bedroom.
Where my wife sleeps.

381
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,920
I've dusted the phone.
Got a lot of usable prints.

382
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,045
Nice detail too.
I got three distinct beauties here.

383
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,210
Yours, your wife's, and presumably
The Chesapeake Ripper.

384
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,324
I can't imagine the Chesapeake
Ripper would start leaving prints

385
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,761
at his crime scenes now.

386
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,042
The Ripper put his head
on your wife's pillow.

387
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,846
- Now somebody's sleeping in my bed.
- There he is.

388
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,883
Or there she is.

389
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,525
- Was Miriam Lass a blonde?
- Yes.

390
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,690
I pulled her fingerprints from the Vicap
database, Jack, and I got a match.

391
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,246
She's dead. She wasn't here.

392
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,005
Jack. Did Miriam Lass
know where you live?

393
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,407
If she wanted to know,
she was smart enough to find out.

394
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,962
She could've told the Chesapeake
Ripper before he killed her.

395
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,448
Did you know
you were sending her after him?

396
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,285
I sent her after information.

397
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,847
Whoever made that call thinks
you were close to Miriam Lass

398
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,123
and feel responsible for her death.

399
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,127
Don't you have classes today?
Aren't you still in school?

400
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,449
Yes, sir. I thought this might be
more important

401
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,887
than "Exclusionary Rules
of Search and Seizure".

402
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,241
Is that what you thought?

403
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,443
I left a report here for you last night.
I don't know if you got it.

404
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,729
- I got it.
- Did you read it?

405
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,241
Go back to class.

406
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,526
You feeling frustrated, Lass?

407
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,041
If so,
you should start forming calluses,

408
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,688
some thick ones, cos frustration's
gonna wear you thin.

409
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,210
- You could've at least read the report.
- I read it.

410
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,561
Your assessment? Sir.

411
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,083
My assessment is that instead of being
here, you should be in a lecture hall

412
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,601
boning up on
"good faith warrant exceptions".

413
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,962
What you're proposing in your report
breaks confidentiality laws.

414
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,048
You know that.

415
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,891
You shouldn't be so dismissive
of what you're learning here.

416
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,401
If the Chesapeake Ripper is a surgeon,

417
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,131
we should check medical records
for all the known victims.

418
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,289
I knew we couldn't get a warrant
if we didn't have something substantial.

419
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,085
It's one thing for a trainee
to go poking around

420
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,806
in private medical records
without a warrant.

421
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,764
Very different if the guru did it.

422
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,281
Better for a trainee to ask for forgiveness
than an FBI agent to ask for permission?

423
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,765
In my experience.

424
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,123
Then I hope you forgive me
for skipping class today.

425
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,722
If someone were using
manipulative methods

426
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,287
to subvert your sense of control,
you may not realise it

427
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,289
until those methods
are pointed out to you.

428
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,131
Which may be
a manipulative method in itself.

429
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,524
You were a model patient.
You behaved yourself for two years.

430
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,565
Well, no opportunity to be naughty.

431
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,645
You could have been pushed.

432
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,240
Well, that would be unethical.

433
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,084
I can help you find out.
But I need your trust to do that.

434
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,162
Oh, I trust you, Dr Bloom.

435
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,010
To the Chesapeake Ripper.

436
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,283
Dr Gideon is going to provide us
with a singular opportunity

437
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,722
to analyse a pure sociopath.

438
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,083
It is so rare to find one in captivity.

439
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,611
Ah. Dinner is served.

440
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,448
Inspired by Auguste Escoffier,

441
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,286
we are having
langue d'agneau en papillotte,

442
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,042
served with a sauce of duxelles and
oyster mushrooms, picked myself.

443
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,004
I don't think I've ever had tongue before.

444
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,088
It was a particularly chatty lamb.

445
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,211
(Bloom) It smells delicious.

446
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,245
The Romans used to kill flamingos
just to eat their tongues.

447
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,842
Don't give me ideas.
Your tongue is very feisty.

448
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,000
And as this evening has already proven,
it's nice to have an old friend for dinner.

449
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,970
- I see three possibilities.
- Mm-hm.

450
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,651
Gideon is the Chesapeake Ripper.

451
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,649
Or he just thinks he is.

452
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,445
Or he knows he isn't.

453
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,211
He is, he knows he is, so do I.

454
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,642
Did you discuss the Chesapeake
Ripper's crimes with Dr Gideon

455
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,525
before he murdered the night nurse?

456
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,120
Mm-hm. When I began to suspect
what he was.

457
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,767
Fearing he might be exposed may
have, er... spurred him into action.

458
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,850
Is it possible
you inadvertently planted

459
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,282
the suggestion in Gideon's mind
that he was the Ripper?

460
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,449
You're not suggesting
coercive persuasion?

461
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,365
No, I said inadvertently.

462
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,281
Psychic driving is unethical.

463
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,847
But reasonable
in certain circumstances.

464
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,247
What circumstances?

465
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,081
It may have been useful trying to remind
Gideon he's the Chesapeake Ripper,

466
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,407
if he repressed those memories.

467
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,643
But he seems to have come
to that awareness all by himself.

468
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,966
Dr Bloom, if he has been
unethically manipulated somehow,

469
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,963
I need to know,
and I would love your insight.

470
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,051
Dr Chilton, would you care
to assist me with dessert?

471
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,331
A pleasure.

472
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,604
I love Norton grapes.
Same colour inside as outside.

473
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,003
Peel it...
and the flesh is also purple.

474
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,570
Not like other grapes where flesh is white
and colour comes from the skin.

475
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,001
A grape with nothing to hide.

476
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,084
Were I in your position,
I would have attempted psychic driving.

477
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,441
Perhaps you already have.

478
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,208
I promise...

479
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,967
I am much more forgiving
of the unorthodox than Dr Bloom.

480
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,921
Shall we?

481
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,651
(Phone rings)

482
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,451
'Jack? Jack, it's Miriam.'

483
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,047
The last call was made to Jack's cell
from a disposable phone traced here.

484
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,242
Or within 100 feet of here.

485
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,443
- What was Miriam Lass looking into?
- Medical records.

486
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,446
If the Ripper was a surgeon, she thought
he might've treated one of his victims.

487
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,444
- Have they retraced her steps?
- The ones they could find.

488
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,649
She made a jump somewhere
they couldn't explain.

489
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,765
- You make those jumps.
- The evidence has to be there.

490
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,929
Every surgeon that came into contact
with any of the Ripper victims

491
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,771
has been thoroughly vetted
or currently under observation.

492
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,283
- Including Dr Gideon?
- Dr Gideon wasn't in my bedroom.

493
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,641
The Chesapeake Ripper was.

494
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,207
The last call left something
the others didn't.

495
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,322
A phone number.

496
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,249
(Phone rings)

497
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,967
(Ringing continues)

498
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,969
What would be the benefit of making
you believe your trainee was alive?

499
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,289
Hope.

500
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,244
The Ripper wanted
to cloud my vision with hope.

501
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,807
It can sometimes be brave
to allow yourself hope.

502
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,641
Not the false kind.

503
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,643
Don't give up hope for your wife.
Not yet.

504
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,923
She's lost hope,
which means you can't.

505
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,924
- I don't have any control over that.
- Take control.

506
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,761
I'm sorry about your wife, Jack.
I truly am.

507
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,327
I believe the world is
a better place with her in it.

508
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,242
And I am sorry about your trainee.

509
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,127
Whatever the Ripper was doing,
it worked.

510
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,369
I thought she was alive.
For a moment, anyway.

511
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,442
I actually let myself believe something
that I knew was impossible.

512
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,648
Talk to me about her.

513
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,049
What was her name?

514
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,447
'My name is Miriam Lass.
I'm with the FBI.'

515
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,921
I'd show you my credentials,
but I'm just a trainee.

516
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,125
Never just a trainee.
An agent in training.

517
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,810
Please come in.

518
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,683
I was hoping to talk to you
about a former patient.

519
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,450
Not necessarily one of yours,

520
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,921
but someone you may have
come into contact with

521
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,008
when you were a practising physician.

522
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,441
I haven't practiced medicine
for some time,

523
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,046
but fortunately for you,
I have a very good memory.

524
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,571
Please.

525
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,808
His name was Jeremy Olmstead.

526
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,085
Perhaps not so good a memory after all.

527
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,249
I don't recall a patient with that name,
but it sounds familiar.

528
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,204
He was recently found murdered
in his workshop.

529
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,721
We think he may be a victim
of the Chesapeake Ripper.

530
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,129
That's why he sounds familiar.
It was all over the news.

531
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,811
He had two old scars on his thigh.

532
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,888
Pathology checked
with the local hospital.

533
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,561
He'd fallen out of a tree blind
five years ago while bow hunting,

534
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,330
stuck an arrow through his leg.

535
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,522
The doctor of record
was a resident surgeon,

536
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,688
but you were on duty
in the ER that night.

537
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,647
- I was?
- Your name was on the admissions log.

538
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,410
Let me think.

539
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,885
You'll have to forgive me,
I saw so many people in the ER,

540
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,923
but not so many hunters.

541
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,247
It's been a long time
since the accident,

542
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,410
but I thought you may remember if
anything was fishy with the arrow wound.

543
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,122
If it's the gentleman I'm thinking of,
I remember a fellow hunter bringing him in,

544
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,005
but I recall very little else.

545
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,202
I figured it was a long shot.

546
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,720
I did keep detailed journals
during those days.

547
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,084
If you like, I can get them for you.
Maybe you'll find something helpful.

548
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,328
That would be great.
If you don't mind.

549
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,809
Not at all.
If you'll wait here, I'll be right back.

550
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,603
Thank you.

551
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,131
She was a very brave young woman.
