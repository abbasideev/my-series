1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,365
(Graham) 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,682
You entered into a devil's bargain
with Jack Crawford.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,569
You know what looking
at this does.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,365
Am I your psychiatrist or are we
simply having conversations?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,010
I don't want to get
in the middle of you and Jack.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,770
I like you as a buffer.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,123
- Graham likes you.
- Cos I want to be his friend, and I am.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,969
It seems a shame
not to take advantage.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,651
- This is my friend, Tobias.
- Good evening.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,888
I hate being this neurotic.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,766
If you weren't neurotic, Franklyn,
you would be something much worse.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,850
Whatever the Ripper was doing,
it worked.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,008
(Animal whining)

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,002
(Distant whining)

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,322
(Animal shrieking)

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,327
(Shrieking)

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,845
(♪ Cello playing
"Minuet in G Major" - Petzold)

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,411
These strings are harder to bow
than the regular ones.

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,325
You have to learn how to bow
authentic strings,

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,727
to better bow
strings how they're made today.

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,650
I should learn to play the easier
strings first, then the harder ones.

22
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,843
- No, you shouldn't.
- Are they really made from cat guts?

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,564
Not always.

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,882
(♪ Continues "Minuet in G Major")

25
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,889
That's better. Good.

26
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,166
If it wasn't a coyote,
the coyotes probably got it.

27
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,011
Probably got it
even if it was a coyote.

28
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,521
You're not expecting to find it alive,
are you?

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,325
We'll be lucky to find a paw.

30
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,571
So you invited me over
to help you collect animal parts?

31
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,604
I invited you over on the off chance
we do find it alive.

32
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,964
It's hard for me to wrangle
a wounded animal by myself.

33
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,970
Did you think it was a date?

34
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,243
- Honestly, it never crossed my mind.
- Oh.

35
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,045
Why not?

36
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,926
- You just don't seem like you date.
- Oh? Too broken to date?

37
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,844
You're not broken.

38
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,646
- What's your excuse?
- For not dating?

39
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,684
- Why are you assuming I don't date?
- Do you?

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,570
No.

41
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,531
Seems like something
for somebody else.

42
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,847
I'm sure I'll become
that somebody someday,

43
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,407
but right now I think too much.

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,131
So what are you gonna do,
try to think less?

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,643
- Or just wait till it happens naturally?
- I haven't thought about it.

46
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,162
- Are you seeing anything?
- Uh, no, actually.

47
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,161
I'm not even seeing any tracks.

48
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,965
I mean, except for the ones we made.

49
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,843
Good morning. Please, come in.

50
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,971
(Franklyn) I have a lot of respect for you.

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,928
Since we can't be friends,
or... you're not comfortable with that,

52
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,805
I found myself looking
at my friends through your eyes,

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,845
imagining what
your diagnosis might be.

54
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,402
- So you become the psychoanalyst?
- I become you.

55
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,923
- Who are you psychoanalysing?
- (Sighs) My friend Tobias.

56
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,884
I googled "psychopaths",
went down the checklist,

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,527
and I was a little surprised

58
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,527
to see how many boxes
I had checked.

59
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,608
Why were you so curious
to Google?

60
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,007
He's been saying very dark things,

61
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,566
and then saying, "Just kidding!" a lot.

62
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,569
It started to seem kind of crazy.

63
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,967
Psychopaths are not crazy.

64
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,005
They're fully aware of what they do
and the consequences of those actions.

65
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,330
Would you diagnose someone
like Tobias as a psychopath?

66
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,331
Or are you supposed to diagnose
other people in front of me?

67
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,205
Would you rather just
talk about me?

68
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,243
Not at all.

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,528
Are you bored with me?

70
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,041
No. This is your hour, Franklyn.

71
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,369
We will talk about whatever
you would like to talk about.

72
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,570
I'd like to talk about Tobias.
Perhaps you can help me analyse him.

73
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,889
I'm not analysing your friend,
I'm analysing your perception of him.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,810
It may help you know yourself better.

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,322
You could be projecting onto him
what you consider to be your flaws.

76
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,887
Does that mean
that I'm a psychopath?

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,367
You're not a psychopath,

78
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,330
although you may be attracted to them.

79
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,527
(♪ Strings crescendo)

80
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,364
The victim is Douglas Wilson,

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,649
a member of the Baltimore Metropolitan
Orchestra's brass section.

82
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,728
A trombone player.

83
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,207
He was killed shortly
after his last performance.

84
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,006
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

85
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,047
His killer brought him here to...
put on a show.

86
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,971
Will, is it me, or is it becoming
easier for you to look?

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,369
I tell myself
it's purely an intellectual exercise.

88
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,569
In the narrow view of forensics,
that's exactly what it is.

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
It's not any easier, Jack.

90
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,642
I shake it off, keep on looking.

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,168
Good.

92
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,684
You shake it off. Get to work.

93
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,683
We'll come back in
when you're ready for us.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,526
I open his throat from the outside

95
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,564
to access the trachea
and expose the vocal chords.

96
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,523
I open his throat from the inside
using the neck of a cello.

97
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,321
Powder on the wound.

98
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,569
Rosin from the bow.

99
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,522
I wanted to play him.

100
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,326
I wanted to create a sound.

101
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,169
My sound.

102
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,128
This... is my design.

103
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,328
(Strings hum)

104
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,171
(Slow clapping)

105
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,209
(Lecter) I worry that I've made
Franklyn feel powerless.

106
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,324
He wants to be my friend.

107
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,604
His obsession with me
is interfering with his progress.

108
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,371
I'm considering referring him
to another doctor.

109
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,761
Referrals can be complicated.

110
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,931
I referred you to another psychiatrist.

111
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,883
You refused.

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,321
I'm more tenacious than Franklyn.

113
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,522
Why were you so tenacious?

114
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,291
I feel protective of you.

115
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,291
You support me as a colleague and
psychiatrist, and as a human being.

116
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,046
I want to be supportive of you
after what happened.

117
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,404
I'm not the only psychiatrist
who's ever been attacked by a patient.

118
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,884
I hesitated to even bring up
the subject of an obsessive patient

119
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,731
because of your traumatic experience.

120
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,251
Hannibal...

121
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,524
...I'm your psychiatrist,
you're not mine.

122
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,122
(Price) Played him like a fiddle.

123
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,720
Along with rosin powder,
we found sodium carbonate,

124
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,561
sulphur dioxide, lye
and olive oil in the wounds.

125
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,889
- What is the deal with the olive oil?
- Sure wasn't making salad.

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,731
He removed anything non-muscular
or fatty from around the vocal folds.

127
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,845
The chords themselves were treated
with a sulphur dioxide solution.

128
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,965
The sulphur dioxide had the effect
of hardening the vocal chords.

129
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,128
Made them easier to play.

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,402
Had to open you up
to get a decent sound out of you.

131
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,322
(Katz) You pick it up and can't play it,
he'll put you down and play you.

132
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,649
(Price) He took the time to whiten
the vocal chords before playing them.

133
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,082
It's not about whitening them,
it was about increasing elasticity.

134
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,081
He treated the vocal chords
the same way you treat catgut string.

135
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,123
Yes, I play the violin.

136
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,648
This takes a steady hand.

137
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,328
A confidence.
He's killed before.

138
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,681
- Like this?
- No, not like this.

139
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,687
This is a skilled musician
trying a new instrument.

140
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,569
Among the first musical
instruments were flutes

141
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,001
carved from human bone.

142
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,846
This murder was a performance.

143
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,287
Every life is a piece of music.

144
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,883
Like music, we are finite events,
unique arrangements,

145
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,207
sometimes harmonious,
sometimes dissonant.

146
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,766
Sometimes not worth hearing again.

147
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,043
- He's a poet and a psychopath.
- And a craftsman.

148
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,845
He was shrinking and tanning
the vocal chords.

149
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,930
Like turning iron wire
into musical steel string.

150
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,922
Was there olive oil?

151
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,046
Yes.

152
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,881
Whatever sound he was trying
to produce, it was an authentic one.

153
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,005
Olive oil hasn't been used in the
production of catgut for over a century.

154
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,566
It was said to increase
the life of the strings

155
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,207
and create a sweeter,
more melodic sound.

156
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,281
No, I hear what he was playing
behind my eyes when I close them.

157
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,687
What do you see behind closed eyes?

158
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,010
I see myself.

159
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,971
You said the killer was performing.
Who was he performing for?

160
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,923
I don't know.

161
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,361
A patron of the arts?
A fellow musician?

162
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,841
Or... another killer?

163
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,402
- It's a serenade.
- No, this isn't how he kills.

164
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,201
Normally, he doesn't kill
for an audience.

165
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,041
And you believe he risked
getting caught for a serenade?

166
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,688
I believe he wants to show
someone how well he plays.

167
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,967
Do you remember when I said Tobias
was saying very dark things?

168
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,650
I made note of it.

169
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,889
Well, he said that he wanted
to cut someone's throat

170
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,765
and play it like a violin.

171
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,329
They found somebody whose throat
was cut and played like a violin.

172
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,365
So you think Tobias killed
that man at the symphony?

173
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,330
I don't know. I-I...

174
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,329
- If I do, do I have to report it?
- Do you have a reason not to?

175
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,001
- What if I'm wrong?
- What if you're right?

176
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,770
I'm always wrong.

177
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,323
I don't know. Why would he say
something like that to me?

178
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,085
Why do you think?

179
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,320
Cos he knows I'd tell you.

180
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,887
(♪ Cello playing solo)

181
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,682
(Playing stops)

182
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,887
You're Franklyn's therapist,
Dr Lecter.

183
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,048
- Nice to see you again.
- Is it Tobias?

184
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,369
- Yes.
- Your strings are all gut.

185
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,808
I also carry steel and polymer strings,
if you prefer.

186
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,529
I prefer gut. Harps strung with gut
still make music after 2,000 years.

187
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,644
- I didn't hear you ring the bell.
- I didn't want you to stop playing.

188
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,731
- Was it an original composition?
- Something I've been writing.

189
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,161
- You compose?
- I discover.

190
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,806
Can't impose traditional composition

191
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,161
on an instrument
that's inherently free form.

192
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,801
- What instrument would that be?
- The Theremin.

193
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,400
It can generate any pitch
throughout its range.

194
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,368
Even those
between conventional notes.

195
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,887
And so can a violin or a trombone.

196
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,369
It seems we are both comfortable
playing between conventional notes.

197
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,729
I hear the symphony's
looking for a new trombonist.

198
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,970
- Altogether horrible what happened.
- Not altogether.

199
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,526
It's an unfortunate way
to leave the symphony, yes,

200
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,325
but I can't help thinking
the orchestra will be better for it.

201
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,205
At least the brass section.

202
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,208
- What brings you here looking for gut?
- My harpsichord needs new strings.

203
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,641
It's making an awful noise.

204
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,086
Perhaps you could help.

205
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,008
(Scratching)

206
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,447
(Scratching and animal noises)

207
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,042
(Scratching continues)

208
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,688
(Chirruping)

209
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,684
- What kind of animal was it?
- It might've been a raccoon.

210
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,369
"Might've been"?

211
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,447
By the time I'd knocked a hole
in the chimney, it climbed out the top.

212
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,251
Well, at least it got out.

213
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,882
What are you doing out?

214
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,881
I thought I'd come over,
make some noise,

215
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,162
shoo away any predators
at your door.

216
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,282
Looks like you're making
plenty of noise all by yourself.

217
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,044
You avoided being in a room alone
with me essentially since I met you.

218
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,851
You were smooth about it.

219
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,284
- Evidently not smooth enough.
- And now you're making house calls?

220
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,124
Just a drive-by on my way home.

221
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,402
Since you're not my patient.

222
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,649
No. I'm not.

223
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,565
I'm confused.

224
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,843
You have to stop thinking so much.

225
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,009
I can stop the thinking
if we're not...

226
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,085
- But if we're...
- Intimate.

227
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,570
The way that I am in relationships...

228
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,287
Not that this is a relationship,
it's just a kiss.

229
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,842
A great kiss. But I...

230
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,882
The way that I am isn't compatible
with the way that...

231
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,082
The way I am.

232
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,968
I wouldn't be good for you.
You wouldn't be good for me.

233
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,162
And I wouldn't be able
to stop analysing,

234
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,683
because I have this professional
curiosity about you and...

235
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,726
I am not your patient.

236
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,081
If I were my patient,
my advice to me...

237
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,841
...would be don't do this.

238
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,406
I have to follow my own advice.

239
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,240
I'm gonna go ahead and go now.

240
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,444
Goodnight, Will.

241
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,730
More wine?

242
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,842
(♪ Cello sonata playing)

243
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,406
A late harvest Vidal from Linden.

244
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,723
Oh, Virginia.
I thought it was French.

245
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,842
The Virginia wine revolution
is upon us.

246
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,124
I apologise for being so blunt, Tobias,
but I have to ask.

247
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,927
Did you kill that trombonist?

248
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,722
- You really have to ask?
- No. Just changing the subject.

249
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,684
Franklyn gave you my message.

250
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,049
The murder is being investigated
by the FBI.

251
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,323
- They're going to find you.
- Let them.

252
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,887
- You want to get caught?
- I want them to try.

253
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,846
They may investigate me
because I own a string shop.

254
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,282
They'll send men to investigate,
and I'll kill them.

255
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,044
Then I'll find Franklyn and kill him.
Then I would disappear.

256
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,602
- Don't kill Franklyn.
- I've been looking forward to it.

257
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,245
Actually...

258
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,410
- ...I was going to kill you.
- Of course you were.

259
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,246
I'm lean. Lean animals yield
the toughest gut.

260
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,251
What stopped you
from wanting to kill me?

261
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,085
Or have you stopped?

262
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,568
I stopped after I followed you
one night out of town.

263
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,047
To a lonely road.

264
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,242
To a bus yard.

265
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,562
You're reckless, Tobias.

266
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,720
I'm not going to tell anyone
what I saw you do and do well.

267
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,521
So my recklessness
doesn't concern you.

268
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,728
It concerns me because you won't be
drawing attention just to yourself.

269
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,569
I could use a friend.
Someone who can understand me.

270
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,364
Who thinks like I do

271
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,967
and can see the world
and the people in it the way I do.

272
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,731
I know exactly how you feel.

273
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,207
But I don't want to be your friend.

274
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,686
Then why did you invite me
here for dinner?

275
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,924
It wasn't just to restring
your harpsichord.

276
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,884
I was going to kill you.

277
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,641
I didn't poison you, Tobias.
I wouldn't do that to the food.

278
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,207
(Doorbell chimes)

279
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,448
Expecting someone?

280
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,325
No.

281
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,848
I kissed Alana Bloom.

282
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,122
Well, come in.

283
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,731
- You have a guest?
- A colleague.

284
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,650
- You just missed him.
- He didn't finish his dinner.

285
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,843
An urgent call of some sort.
He had to leave suddenly.

286
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,760
This benefits you,
because I have dessert for two.

287
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,003
Tell me,
what was Alana's reaction?

288
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,164
She said she wouldn't be good for me
and I wouldn't be good for her.

289
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,884
I don't disagree.

290
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,890
She would feel an obligation
to her field of study to observe you.

291
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,083
- And you would resent her for it.
- I know.

292
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,091
I'm wondering then why
you kissed her and felt compelled

293
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,328
to drive an hour in the snow
to tell me about it.

294
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,161
I wanted to kiss her since I met her.
She's very kissable.

295
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,805
You waited a long time, which suggests
you were kissing her for a reason,

296
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,843
in addition to wanting to.

297
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,086
I heard an animal trapped
in my chimney. Erm...

298
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,881
I broke through the wall
to get it out.

299
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,207
I didn't find anything inside.

300
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,844
Alana showed up,
she looked at me...

301
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,085
Maybe her face changed,
I don't know.

302
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,288
But, um, she knew...

303
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,688
What did she know, Will?

304
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,004
There was no animal
in the chimney.

305
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,088
It was only in my head.

306
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,040
I sleepwalk. I get headaches.

307
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,322
I am hearing things.

308
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,524
I feel unstable.

309
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,650
That's why you kissed her.
A clutch for balance.

310
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,206
You said yourself
what you do is not good for you.

311
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,209
Unfortunately, I am good for it.

312
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,767
Are you still hearing this killer's
serenade behind your eyes?

313
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,848
Well, it's our song.

314
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,043
I hesitate telling you this,

315
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,687
as it borders on a violation
of doctor-patient confidentiality.

316
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,566
A patient told me today
he suspects a friend of his

317
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,127
may be involved with the murder
at the symphony.

318
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,842
Right, erm...

319
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,087
Erm... what did he say
about his friend?

320
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,728
He owns a music store in Baltimore,
specialising in string instruments.

321
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,127
Perhaps you should interview him.

322
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,731
Yeah.

323
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,290
For the first time in a long while,
I see a possibility of friendship.

324
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,050
- Is there someone new in your life?
- I met a man much like myself.

325
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,845
Same hobbies, same worldviews,

326
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,203
but I'm not interested in being
his friend. I'm curious about him.

327
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,766
And that got me curious
about friendship.

328
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,081
Whose friendship
are you considering?

329
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,090
Oddly enough,
a colleague and a patient,

330
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,806
not unlike how I'm a colleague
and a patient of yours.

331
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,729
We've discussed him before.

332
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,322
- Will Graham.
- He's nothing like me.

333
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,727
We see the world in different ways,

334
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,320
yet he can assume my point of view.

335
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,210
By profiling the criminally insane.

336
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,130
As good a demonstration as any.

337
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,242
I find it reassuring.

338
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,011
It's nice when someone sees us,
Hannibal.

339
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,526
Or has the ability to see us.

340
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,249
It requires trust.

341
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,047
Trust is difficult for you.

342
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,208
You've helped me
to better understand

343
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,403
what I want in a friendship
and what I don't.

344
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,726
- Someone worthy of your friendship.
- Yes.

345
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,367
You spend a lot of time
building walls, Hannibal.

346
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,969
It's natural to want to see if someone
is clever enough to climb over them.

347
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,407
- JSB's Suite No 1.
- OK.

348
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,891
Special agent Will Graham
with the FBI.

349
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,368
- Are you the owner?
- Yes. Tobias Budge.

350
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,761
I'm just showing one of my students out.
Can I have a moment?

351
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,370
Sure.

352
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,682
Adagio. For Saturday.

353
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,921
What can I help you with?

354
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,362
We're investigating the death
of Douglas Wilson. He was...

355
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,966
- Trombonist.
- That's right. Did you know him?

356
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,369
I was aware of him.
Baltimore is a small town.

357
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,206
The cultural arts community
is an even smaller one.

358
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,721
Well, that's why we're here, Mr Budge.

359
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,811
I hear someone cut his throat
and tried to play it with a bow.

360
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,968
Why do you say "try"?

361
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,928
The strings have to be treated.

362
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,963
You can't just open somebody up

363
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,404
and draw a bow across their innards
and expect to produce a sound.

364
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,211
The vocal chords were
chemically treated,

365
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,846
similar to how catgut string is treated.

366
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,327
We kept those details
out of the press.

367
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,411
You're looking for someone who knows
how to manufacture gut strings?

368
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,562
Anybody leap to mind?

369
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,890
Mine are imported from Italy.
Best catgut is.

370
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,367
The string section of the Baltimore
Metropolitan Orchestra

371
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,965
refuses to play anything else.

372
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,722
- More authentic?
- A richer, darker sound.

373
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,320
Allows music to say
what words can't.

374
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,609
(Tyres screeching; crash)

375
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,848
(Shrieking)

376
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,129
Something wrong?

377
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,521
Didn't you hear that?

378
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,881
I didn't hear anything.

379
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,761
Excuse me a minute.

380
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,680
(Animal moaning)

381
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,326
(Animal shrieking)

382
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,202
(Animal shrieking)

383
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,962
Sorry about that...

384
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,645
Officers?

385
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,890
Officers?

386
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,684
I need ERT at Chordophone Strings,
downtown Baltimore. Officer down.

387
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,849
(Scratching)

388
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,728
(Scratching continues)

389
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,405
(High-pitched whine)

390
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,246
(Muffled gunshots)

391
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,121
Nine.

392
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,130
Nine times.

393
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,722
I can count on two hands
the number of times

394
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,127
I've been dumped by a psychiatrist.

395
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,562
I'm sorry, Franklyn, but I think
you should see another doctor.

396
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,603
- You're giving me a referral?
- Yes, I am.

397
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,530
- You were a referral!
- I am also a part of the problem.

398
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,290
You focus too much on your therapist,
and not enough on your therapy.

399
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,529
You lost respect for me because
I wouldn't report Tobias, didn't you?

400
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,768
(Tobias) Report Tobias for what?

401
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,565
Tobias?

402
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,762
I came to say goodbye, Franklyn.

403
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,206
What do you mean, goodbye?

404
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,130
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, is that your blood?

405
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,402
I just killed two men.

406
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,927
The police came to question me
about the murder.

407
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,008
OK... you have
to give yourself up right now.

408
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,646
This plane is going down.

409
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,967
Let it have a controlled descent.

410
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,003
We can get you back up
in the air again.

411
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,327
There's rehabilitation for everyone.

412
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,807
Franklyn, I want you to leave now.

413
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,730
Stay right where you are, Franklyn.

414
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,681
You've done a horrible thing.

415
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,531
And... I know...

416
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,204
that you wish to God
that you didn't, but you did.

417
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,767
And there's nothing you can do
to change that.

418
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,851
Only thing you can change
is your future.

419
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,325
Right?

420
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,887
Now, you're probably scared.

421
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,327
You probably feel like you're all alone.

422
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,051
- I'm not alone.
- That's right. You're not alone.

423
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,687
Nothing has happened in
our relationship that you and I can't...

424
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,162
I was looking forward to that.

425
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,251
I saved you the trouble.

426
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,971
Ah!

427
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,769
(Bone cracks)

428
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,082
(Tobias screams)

429
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,124
(Gagging)

430
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,844
(♪ JS BACH:
"Goldberg Variations - Aria")

431
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,322
I was worried you were dead.

432
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,402
Tobias Budge killed
two Baltimore police officers,

433
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,121
nearly killed an FBI special agent,
and after all of that,

434
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,767
his first stop is here,
at your office.

435
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,008
He came to kill my patient.

436
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,525
Your patient. Is that who
Budge was serenading?

437
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,884
I don't know.

438
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,891
Franklyn knew more
than he was telling me.

439
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,641
He told Mr Budge that
he didn't have to kill anymore.

440
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,561
And then he broke Franklyn's neck,
and then he attacked me.

441
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,411
You killed him?

442
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,050
Yes.

443
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,848
Could Franklyn have been involved
in whatever Budge was doing?

444
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,571
I thought this was a simple matter
of poor choice of friends.

445
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,411
This doesn't feel simple to me.

446
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,121
I feel like I've dragged you
into my world.

447
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,322
No, I got here on my own.

448
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,206
But I appreciate the company.

449
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,964
I'm going to start seeing patients again.

450
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,565
It's strange, thinking about
going back to daily practice.

451
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,889
Well, it's good you stepped away.

452
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,446
Even if it was only for a few days.

453
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,646
Patients will sit where Franklyn died.

454
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,201
I will sit where I almost died,
and I will offer therapy.

455
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,164
It's easy to understand why
you retired after you were attacked.

456
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,929
Will you ever feel comfortable
returning to psychiatric work?

457
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,162
This is psychiatric work.

458
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,642
One patient isn't a practice.

459
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,647
I can't help feeling responsible
for what happened to Franklyn.

460
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,243
Every person has an intrinsic
responsibility for their own life, Hannibal.

461
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,807
No one else can take on
that responsibility.

462
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,400
Not even you.

463
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,086
Did you take responsibility when
you were attacked by your patient?

464
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,845
Yes.

465
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,727
But I don't take responsibility
for his death.

466
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,762
Nor should you.
