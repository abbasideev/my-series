1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,045
(Crawford) 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,207
You think this was a copycat?

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,687
(Graham)
I almost feel like he's been mocking her.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,246
Your name is Georgia Madchen.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,885
You're not alone.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,367
- Somebody told him we were coming.
- The man on the phone?

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,931
(Graham) Did you recognise his voice?

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,202
How much would I get
if you wrote a book about me?

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,608
Nicholas Boyle was gutted with
a hunting knife. You knew how to do that.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,562
You think I did this?

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,889
You and I are just gonna have to have
a difference of opinion about who Will is.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,081
I'm worried about you, Will.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,680
What if you lose time and hurt yourself?
Or someone else?

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,722
(Gunshot)

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,291
(Mouths) Hi.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,651
You look better.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,084
Do I look alive?

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,250
You look pretty.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,848
Must be all the oxygen.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,291
(Graham chuckles)

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,208
They say what's wrong with you?

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,163
No. Just the fever.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,961
They're trying to find out what else.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,367
They won't find anything.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,007
They'll keep looking,
keep taking tests,

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,806
keep giving false diagnoses,
bad meds,

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,807
but they won't find out what's wrong.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,203
They'll just know that you're wrong.

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,527
- I hope you have good insurance.
- I do, too.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,007
They're going to give me
shock treatment.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,809
Electroconvulsive therapy
is what it's called.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,401
Shock treatment sounds nicer.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,769
People who have what you have
can recover with shock treatment.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,806
You know how many times I've been told
that I could recover with treatment?

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
They said I might remember what I did.

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,047
But I don't wanna remember.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,766
You know what you did, Georgia.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
But I don't remember it.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,842
It feels more like a horrible dream
where I killed my friend.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,324
You dream about killing anybody else?

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,006
I dream you killed that doctor.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,650
But I couldn't see your face.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,325
Smells delicious.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,841
Silkie chicken in a broth.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,801
A black-boned bird prized in China

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,730
for its medicinal values
since the 7th century.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,122
Wolfberries, ginseng, ginger,
red dates and star anise.

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,603
You made me chicken soup.

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,805
Yes.

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,171
The nurses tell me
you've been wandering, Will.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,805
I was awake...

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,286
...and wandering with purpose.

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,129
And good intentions.

54
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,801
Visiting that unfortunate young woman
suffering from delusions.

55
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,729
She's my support group.

56
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,002
And I hope you're hers.

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,885
Nothing more isolating
than mental illness.

58
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,411
The hallucinations,

59
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,451
the... loss of time, sleepwalking.

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,202
Could that have all just
been the fever?

61
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,648
Fevers can be symptoms of dementia.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,002
Dementia can be a symptom of many
things happening in your body or mind

63
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,043
that can no longer be ignored, Will.

64
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,645
Does Jack know?

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,082
That this could be more than a fever?
No. I haven't told him.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,371
Shouldn't you?

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,568
Not until we know for certain.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,122
What we must do now is continue
to support and monitor your recovery.

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,602
This young woman you were visiting,
how's her recovery?

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,329
I don't think she wants to recover.

71
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,447
Afraid to remember what she did.

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,529
Can't say I blame her.

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,322
(Machine beeping)

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,762
(Banging)

75
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,367
The hospital speculates that it was
a short circuit that ignited the fire.

76
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,569
Unit looks well maintained.
No exposed wiring.

77
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,368
Horrible way to die.

78
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,171
There was a kid in Italy
who was in one of these things.

79
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,250
A spark of static electricity
from his pyjamas set it off.

80
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,570
Two cubic yards of oxygen
suddenly became two cubic yards of fire.

81
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,728
Is it possible she set the fire herself?

82
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,209
She wasn't wearing her grounding bracelet.
Prevents the build-up of static electricity.

83
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,369
- She took it off.
- Suicide by immolation?

84
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,008
She was facing
two murder charges.

85
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,681
She wasn't suicidal, Jack.
She was... sick.

86
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,201
I was here. I spoke to her.

87
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,643
Why did you speak to her?

88
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,202
Because I know how she felt.

89
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,251
She's a murder suspect.
She tried to kill you.

90
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,284
Your trying to be her friend
impacts the case against her.

91
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,086
Well, the case against her doesn't
really matter any more, does it, Jack?

92
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,524
(Crawford sighs)

93
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,810
We could use the articles I wrote
at the time of each of the murders

94
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,161
as book chapter headings.

95
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,727
The chapters themselves
would be you telling your story,

96
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,968
where you were
and what you were thinking,

97
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,606
when one by one
eight girls, just like you,

98
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,405
all over Minnesota
were disappearing.

99
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,851
What are we gonna call it?

100
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,326
Well, I thought about
"The Last Victim",

101
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,889
but there is already a book about
serial killers called "The Last Victim".

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,923
Was it a bestseller?

103
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,371
Absolutely.

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,524
Especially after the guy
who wrote it killed himself.

105
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,044
Just as well.

106
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,084
I wasn't really my dad's
last victim anyway, was I?

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,331
Who was?

108
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,051
Marissa.

109
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,970
Marissa Schurr was killed by the copycat.
So was Cassie Boyle.

110
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,321
I still blame my dad.

111
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,602
Blame him for Nick Boyle's death?

112
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,085
I blame Nick Boyle
for Nick Boyle's death.

113
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,931
He killed Marissa.
He got what was coming to him.

114
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,169
- Nick Boyle did not kill your friend.
- Then who did?

115
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,805
Better question is, who killed Nick?

116
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,889
Nick Boyle was just a dumb kid
who was really messed up

117
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,287
because his sister was murdered.

118
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,090
He wasn't a killer.

119
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,728
I've interviewed enough killers
to know one when I see one.

120
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,804
What gives them away?

121
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,527
A very specific brand of hostility.

122
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,442
I see it every time I look at Will Graham.

123
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,008
He did kill my dad.

124
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,886
As far as I'm concerned,
he killed Nick Boyle.

125
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,569
He and Jack Crawford told
everyone Nick was the copycat

126
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,411
and then someone murdered him for it.

127
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,883
You really don't think he did it.

128
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,366
Whoever killed Nicholas Boyle
killed an innocent man.

129
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,044
See?

130
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,211
See?

131
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,803
- What are you doing here?
- Checked myself out of the hospital.

132
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,082
- Well, check yourself back in.
- Fever broke.

133
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,565
I don't care.

134
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,569
Georgia Madchen didn't commit suicide

135
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,921
and whatever happened to her
wasn't an accident.

136
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,567
I'll have Z come down here and
if you got a temperature higher than 99...

137
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,160
She was murdered, Jack.

138
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,808
- By who?
- By whoever killed Dr Sutcliffe.

139
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,285
(scoffs)

140
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,244
His blood was all over Georgia Madchen.
Her DNA was all over him.

141
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,842
She told me
there was somebody else there.

142
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,405
She couldn't see his face.

143
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,767
There was somebody else there,
it was Dr Sutcliffe.

144
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,362
She couldn't see his face
because she cut in half!

145
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,251
Will, I understand.
You're looking for an explanation.

146
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,283
An explanation that makes all of this OK.

147
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,926
No! No, no.
That is not what I want.

148
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,601
Listen, something went wrong
and we will never know what that is,

149
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,849
but for all the doctors she saw,
for all of the help she received,

150
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,769
she was fighting that wrong alone.

151
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,928
There was nothing you could do
about that.

152
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,010
All her adult life
this woman was misunderstood.

153
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,284
And what I can do is make sure
that her death isn't misunderstood.

154
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,009
She didn't kill herself.

155
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,727
And this wasn't an accident.

156
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,082
(Muffled voices)

157
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,721
We dismantled the oxygen chamber,
see if anyone tampered with the wiring,

158
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,842
or even like a short circuit but nothing.

159
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,691
- So what sparked the fire?
- Inconclusive, but...

160
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,009
Not conclusively inconclusive.
Found this.

161
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,128
Thought it might have been part
of the bed or monitoring equipment,

162
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,720
but mass spectrometer
said it was celluloid plastic.

163
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,845
- They don't use plastic in those things.
- It generates static electricity.

164
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,248
Her hair was melted right in there.
Preserved like it was in amber.

165
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,649
Could it have been a plastic comb?

166
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,810
Static charge from a plastic comb
in a highly oxygenated environment

167
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,684
would be a powerful accelerant.

168
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,531
(Zeller) Anything combustible in there
would combust.

169
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,123
- You're holding the murder weapon.
- Or whatever she used to kill herself.

170
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,366
- Will!
- Whoa, whoa!

171
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,171
Whoever killed Sutcliffe
wanted to kill him

172
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,411
how Georgia Madchen killed her victim,
but not exactly how. Correct?

173
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,609
Georgia Madchen carved up
her victim's face.

174
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,530
Sutcliffe was nearly decapitated
at the jaw. I mean...

175
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,449
So she went further the second time.

176
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,126
- Serial killers often do that.
- She was copied.

177
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,643
Like whoever killed Marissa Schurr
and Cassie Boyle wanted to copy

178
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,684
how Garret Jacob Hobbs
killed his victims.

179
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,323
- But not exactly how.
- Wait a minute...

180
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,606
Are you saying that Dr Sutcliffe was
killed by Garret Jacob Hobbs' copycat?

181
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,883
So was Georgia Madchen.

182
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,528
Because he thinks she saw his face.

183
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,291
(Crawford) You said Nicholas Boyle
was the copycat.

184
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,768
His blood was on one of the victims.
Nicholas Boyle is dead.

185
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,410
Well, then he isn't the copycat.

186
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,166
Could this be more than a fever?

187
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,204
Will is connecting murders
that previously had no connections.

188
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,687
Beyond his involvement
in the investigations?

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,165
That's right.

190
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,921
So you're wondering if the lines
are blurring or if he's on to something.

191
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,769
I'm wondering all sorts of things.

192
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,926
What's Will's relationship
with Abigail Hobbs?

193
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,130
(Clears throat)

194
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,450
You think he's protecting her?

195
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,921
He has been
ever since he shot her father.

196
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,849
I just don't know from what.

197
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,566
I can't imagine he would hide
anything criminal from you.

198
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,241
I've only ever known Will
as a man striving to be his best self.

199
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,883
You haven't known him that long.

200
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,450
We both know him well enough
to know he hasn't been himself.

201
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,923
He needs our support.
Whether or not mental illness is involved.

202
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,364
Mental illness.

203
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,885
(scoffs)

204
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,365
Is it really mental illness

205
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,763
or is it just that his mind works
so differently from most people's

206
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,723
that we don't know what else to call it?

207
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,730
There are days when even Will
doesn't understand his own thinking.

208
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,683
(Knocking at door)

209
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,806
Dr Du Maurier. I'm Special Agent
Jack Crawford with the FBI.

210
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,961
I'd like to talk with you
about a patient of yours.

211
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,648
Do you have a court order?

212
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,411
Well, I'd rather not get one
if I don't have to.

213
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,130
(♪ Switches music off)

214
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,005
- So it's not an official enquiry.
- Not yet.

215
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,929
I'd hate to damage
anyone's reputation unnecessarily.

216
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,520
Whose reputation would that be?

217
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,646
I suspect that Dr Hannibal Lecter
may be withholding pertinent information

218
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,728
involving a murder investigation.

219
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,730
No, thank you.

220
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,522
So he hasn't confided in the FBI.

221
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,523
You are hoping he's confided
in his psychiatrist and I'll tell you.

222
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,085
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,406
It's not that I think Dr Lecter
is dangerous. I don't.

224
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,564
I'm concerned about a relationship he has
with one of his patients. Will Graham.

225
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,443
Without consent or a court order,
I'd be in breach of confidentiality.

226
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,730
That's correct.

227
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,564
So if we can't discuss Dr Lecter,
perhaps we can discuss you.

228
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,685
You were attacked by a patient
not too long ago.

229
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,168
I read the report.

230
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,045
I know that there was a statement
given by Dr Lecter.

231
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,686
The patient who attacked me
was a former patient of Dr Lecter.

232
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,646
And he was referred to you by Dr Lecter?

233
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,331
- Yes.
- And this patient almost killed you.

234
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,648
He swallowed his tongue
while he was attacking me.

235
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,161
That's the only thing
that saved my life.

236
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,565
Well, thank God for small favours.

237
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,206
Yes, thank God.

238
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,126
You should know there was another
attack recently in Dr Lecter's office.

239
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,529
It involved another patient.
Two dead, including the patient.

240
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,163
That's not bad psychology,
Agent Crawford.

241
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,970
Putting me in a position to have
to defend or not to defend Dr Lecter.

242
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,448
He's had some pretty strange
relationships with some of his patients.

243
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,446
Complicated patients are conducive
to complicated relationships.

244
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,769
All right.

245
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,283
How far do you think Dr Lecter would
go in his therapy to treat a patient?

246
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,051
Specifically, Will Graham.

247
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,850
Hannibal refers to Will Graham
more as a friend than as a patient.

248
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,011
How far do you think
he would go to treat a friend?

249
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,245
Well, he doesn't have many of them,
so I imagine he'd be loyal.

250
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,841
I know that he's concerned
about Will Graham

251
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,442
and... I know that he wants to help him.

252
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,366
Well, I consider Will a friend
and I'd like to help him, too.

253
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,447
It seems to me that
Will Graham would do well

254
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,002
to have more friends like Dr Lecter.

255
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,720
Will Graham theorised
that the copycat killer

256
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,525
and Garret Jacob Hobbs
were somehow connected.

257
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,685
That he had insight
into Hobbs' personal life,

258
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,521
that they may have met, known each
other, perhaps even killed together.

259
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,689
See, I would call that less of a theory,
more of a hypothesis.

260
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,407
- Theories require evidence.
- Let's play jeopardy, shall we?

261
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,521
These people were killed by the copycat
who's connected to Garret Jacob Hobbs.

262
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,971
You tell me how.

263
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,244
You mean beyond the application
of supposition and unexplained leaps?

264
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,725
Yes. That's right.

265
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,606
I've been yearning for a return to
the fundamentals of investigation. Right?

266
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,682
- Where is Beverly?
- Jury duty.

267
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,643
She's deposed in court.

268
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,048
Get her out of court.
Then here's what we're gonna do.

269
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,802
I wanna look at train station,
airport, toll road, hotel details.

270
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,809
I wanna track Garret Jacob Hobbs

271
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,651
using license plate capture
from security footage.

272
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,084
I also want to know every phone call
he made and where he made them from.

273
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,363
I'll see if I can get R&I to loan us
clerks to help us cross-match.

274
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,649
Good. I also wanna know every place
that he went that wasn't home.

275
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,525
I wanna know how long he was there,
who he was there with.

276
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,405
I wanna know the travel time
to the nearest missing girl

277
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,528
in the Minnesota Shrike case,
you got it?

278
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,722
Yeah. OK.

279
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,047
You told me that killing someone
was the ugliest thing in the world.

280
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,204
One of them.

281
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,729
I finally get it.

282
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,847
I thought there was
something wrong with me,

283
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,089
because I didn't feel ugly
when I killed Nick Boyle.

284
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,964
I felt good.

285
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,087
That's why it was so easy
to lie about it.

286
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,367
Like you didn't do anything wrong.

287
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,889
Feel like you'd done something wrong
when you killed my dad?

288
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,684
I felt terrified.

289
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,205
And then... I felt powerful.

290
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,648
It felt good.

291
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,369
To get to end it, to stop it all.

292
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,529
I thought I got away from him.

293
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,565
No. I don't think either of us have
gotten away from your father.

294
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,405
I Wish I'd killed him.

295
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,324
For killing my mum.

296
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,401
For killing all those girls.
For making me...

297
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,726
- Making you what, Abigail?
- Part of it.

298
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,328
Part of any of it.

299
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,366
This wasn't supposed to be my life.

300
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,240
It feels like my dad's still out there.

301
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,203
In a way, he is.

302
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,447
You mean the copycat.

303
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,808
I think I can catch him.

304
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,442
But I'm gonna need your help.

305
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,526
An agent from the FBI
came to see me.

306
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,923
He asked me questions about
your relationship with Will Graham.

307
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,129
Jack Crawford was here?

308
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,331
Mm.

309
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,291
He had enough doubt in whatever it is
you told him about your patient

310
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,006
to feel the need to verify.

311
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,329
He believes Abigail Hobbs
was involved in her father's crimes

312
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,125
and he suspects Will is protecting her.

313
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,562
And, evidently, he suspects
you are protecting Will.

314
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,805
Are you?

315
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,241
Are you asking as my psychiatrist?

316
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,284
I'm stepping out of my role
as your psychiatrist

317
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,324
and I'm speaking to you now
as your colleague.

318
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,290
Whatever you're doing
with Will Graham, stop.

319
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,168
Will needs my help.

320
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,768
You've crossed professional lines.

321
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,850
(Scoffs) By making a friend?

322
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,041
You cannot function
as an agent of friendship

323
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,528
for a man who is disconnected
from the concept

324
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,769
as a man who is disconnected
from the concept.

325
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,008
I'm protecting Will from influence.

326
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,841
He has flaws in his intuitive beliefs
about what makes him who he is.

327
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,803
I'm trying to help him understand.

328
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,163
You may not be able to.

329
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,651
I'm not comfortable telling Will that
my very best attempts to help him may fail

330
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,082
and that my loyalty to him and
his treatment could be compromised.

331
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,248
Then tell him something else.

332
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,961
Agent Crawford also asked me
about my attack.

333
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,605
I see.

334
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,563
What did you tell him?

335
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,889
Half-truths.

336
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,682
That a violent patient swallowed
his tongue while he was attacking me.

337
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,081
I didn't tell him how or why
or who was responsible.

338
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,410
You protect your patient from
Jack Crawford, but I can't protect mine?

339
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,891
Not any more.

340
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,806
Even the very best psychiatrists
have an inherent limitation

341
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,161
to their professional abilities.

342
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,602
You may find that difficult to accept.

343
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,290
You're right. It is.

344
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,371
You have to maintain boundaries,
Hannibal.

345
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,611
When the pressures of my personal
and professional relationships with Will

346
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,449
grow too great,

347
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,011
I assure you...

348
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,162
...I'll find a way to relieve them.

349
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,409
I'm much better now.

350
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,929
I feel clearer.

351
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,762
It had to be the fever.

352
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,601
I am finally thinking clearly
about the copycat.

353
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,963
The murders you're attributing
to the copycat have suspects

354
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,003
whose DNA was found on the victims.

355
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,451
So what?

356
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,882
- You're choosing to ignore that?
- Both of those suspects are dead.

357
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,925
I'm choosing to factor that into
my psychological profile of a killer.

358
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,168
Georgia Madchen followed me
to Sutcliffe's office,

359
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,647
she witnessed his murder,
she saw the copycat.

360
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,650
- Why not kill her then and there?
- Maybe didn't have the time.

361
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,287
She was an unreliable witness,
so that bought him time.

362
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,930
So he framed her for the murder.

363
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,961
He wasn't planning on framing her.

364
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,721
- He was planning on framing me.
- You believe this is personal?

365
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,846
If it wasn't before... it is now.

366
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,288
This could be someone at the bureau,
someone in the police department,

367
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,609
someone who knows the crimes
and has access to the investigations.

368
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,764
Someone like you?

369
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,121
(Sighs)

370
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,083
There will be evidence.

371
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,363
I found a pattern and now I'm gonna
reconstruct his thinking.

372
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,209
- How do you intend to do that?
- By taking Abigail back to Minnesota.

373
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,649
Start where the copycat started,
when he called Garret Jacob Hobbs.

374
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,923
Will, this is venturing into the paranoid.

375
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,771
I can't allow you to pull Abigail
into your delusion.

376
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,928
This isn't a delusion.

377
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,327
I'm not hallucinating.
I haven't lost time.

378
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,330
I am awake and this is real.

379
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,002
(Sighs)

380
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,804
We found train tickets
purchased by Garret Jacob Hobbs.

381
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,251
- Tickets?
- Two.

382
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,091
For the same train line
that one of his victims was using.

383
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,565
Elise Nichols?

384
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,808
Found more instances
of Hobbs crossing with victims.

385
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,766
Dinner receipts for two and two
hotel rooms near the same campuses.

386
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,248
- We know he wasn't travelling alone.
- Travelling with his daughter?

387
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,601
They were registered
for the same orientation programme

388
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,247
at St Cloud State on the Mississippi
where the Nichols girl was at school.

389
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,727
Abigail Hobbs attended orientations
at every school

390
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,968
where a girl was abducted
by the Minnesota Shrike

391
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,320
within days of the abduction.

392
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,171
She was with him
when he was choosing these girls.

393
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,089
She was the bait.

394
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,924
She was helping him choose the girls.

395
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,806
The connection between the copycat killer
and Garret Jacob Hobbs might be family.

396
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,764
She kills Cassie Boyle
to impress dad?

397
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,848
She kills Marissa Schurr in memoriam?

398
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,531
Then she kills Nicholas Boyle
to cover her tracks?

399
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,450
Then why kill Dr Sutcliffe?
Or the Madchen girl?

400
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,001
Because she's got a taste for it now.

401
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,050
Or she wants to impress someone new.

402
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,367
Hello, Agent Crawford.

403
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,443
Freddie Lounds.

404
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,321
You look like you came hereto arrest
somebody. Abigail Hobbs or Will Graham?

405
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,569
- Will Graham was here?
- Oh, then it was Abigail Hobbs.

406
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,011
Where is she?

407
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,283
One of the other girls said
Special Agent Graham snuck her out.

408
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,051
I don't know why he would
feel the need to be sneaky.

409
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,767
He is registered as one
of her guardians. The irony.

410
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,120
Give us a minute here.

411
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,320
- How's the book coming?
- There's plot holes.

412
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,363
Tell me how you're filling them in.

413
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,291
- Did Abigail Hobbs kill Nick Boyle?
- Why do you say that?

414
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,688
Abigail is one of those very smart girls
who hasn't quite figured out

415
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,643
that very smart girls grow up

416
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,005
and know all the moves they're making
when they're trying to hide something.

417
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,600
What is Will Graham trying to hide?

418
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,205
Sorry to barge in on you, Doctor.
Couldn't wait.

419
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,411
What the hell is going on between
Will Graham and Abigail Hobbs?

420
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,047
Will has been victim of many unusual
and irrational thoughts.

421
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,846
- Has he acted on these thoughts?
- Not that I'm aware of.

422
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,008
Or he's aware of, for that matter.

423
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,681
But he has experienced
periods of lost time.

424
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,600
Yes, I've seen him confused at
crime scenes. I've seen him disoriented.

425
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,843
He may have been confused
because he was waking up.

426
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,440
Might not have known
where he was or how he got there.

427
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,251
- Waking up?
- From a dissociated personality state.

428
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,403
He would appear perfectly normal
and not remember a thing.

429
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,044
But a fractured part of him would.

430
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,609
- How long have you been aware of this?
- He's recently started to discuss this.

431
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,041
Unless "recently" means
just before I walked into your office,

432
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,969
you failed to mention any of this to me!

433
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,560
Because I was trying to determine
if it was trauma and stress

434
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,570
from the work he's doing for you
or mental illness.

435
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,605
I thought it wise to be sure before making
any claim about Will Graham's sanity.

436
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,011
He's taken Abigail Hobbs. You have
any idea where they might be going?

437
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,891
No.

438
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,048
We have evidence she was involved
in some of her father's crimes.

439
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,049
We just don't know how involved.

440
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,688
Is it possible Will knew what Abigail was
doing? Is that why he's protecting her?

441
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,809
There's something you should hear.

442
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,764
(Lecter) 'How did you feel seeing Marissa
Schurr impaled in his antler room?'

443
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,405
(Graham) 'Guilty.'

444
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,688
(Lecter)
'Because you couldn't save her?'

445
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,041
(Graham)
'Because I felt like I killed her.'

446
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,650
(Switches off recording)

447
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,969
Where was Will the night
that Marissa Schurr was killed?

448
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,605
He was supposed to be
in his hotel room.

449
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,167
I knocked on his door. He didn't answer.

450
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,921
We know he was in Dr Sutcliffe's office
the night that he was killed.

451
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,930
And Will was the last person to visit
Georgia Madchen before she died.

452
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,723
This dissociative personality state
you say he goes into.

453
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,245
Whose personality is it?

454
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,531
He said he got so close
to Garret Jacob Hobbs

455
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,085
and what he had done...

456
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,682
...that he felt he was becoming him.

457
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,087
And now he has Hobbs' daughter.

458
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,002
Who Hobbs intended to kill.

459
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,125
(Sighs)

460
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,684
I'm so sorry, Jack.

461
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,931
(Door closes)

462
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,850
You look pasty. Maybe you shouldn't have
checked yourself out of the hospital.

463
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,291
I feel fine.

464
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,927
It would've been
my mum's birthday next week.

465
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,290
We were gonna climb
Eagle Mountain to celebrate.

466
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,928
Highest point in Minnesota,
but... it's not really that high.

467
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,885
Less than three hours to summit.

468
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,809
You can see Lake Superior from there.

469
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,527
I could take you if... if you wanna go.

470
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,082
I think it would just make me sad.

471
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,927
Some places are stained now.

472
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,530
Some people, too.

473
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,770
I know I am.

474
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,810
(Sighs heavily)

475
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,322
(Crows cawing)

476
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,087
The copycat knew your father
well enough to know about this place.

477
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,041
You felt like you knew my father?

478
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,928
I wanted to understand him.

479
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,442
I felt like I had to understand him.

480
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,324
Do you ever hunt?

481
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,370
I fish.

482
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,887
Well, it's the same thing, isn't it?

483
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,050
One you stalk... the other you lure.

484
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,681
Were you more fisherman or hunter?

485
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,882
- My dad taught me how to hunt.
- No, that's not what I'm asking.

486
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,851
All those girls your dad killed.

487
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,163
Did you fish...

488
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,082
...or did you hunt, Abigail?

489
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,329
I was the lure.

490
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,131
Did Hannibal tell you?

491
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,121
No, he didn't.

492
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,608
He said you'd protect me.
That you'd keep it a secret.

493
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,722
(Gas-ping)

494
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,200
There's something wrong with you.

495
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,322
I think you're still sick.

496
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,884
Jack Crawford was right about you.

497
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,923
Yeah, he knew!

498
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,642
You killed Nick Boyle and you helped
your father kill all of those girls.

499
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,004
- No, I didn't help my dad kill anybody.
- No, you lured them. You killed them.

500
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,208
How many other people
have you killed?

501
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,449
Do you think I'm the copycat?
You think I killed Marissa?

502
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,127
If you didn't kill her, Abigail,
then somebody you know did.

503
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,402
Ever think that somebody
could be you?

504
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,288
You were there. You saw Marissa.

505
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,847
You knew about this place
and there is something wrong with you.

506
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,962
(Groans)

507
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,161
(Attendant)
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.

508
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,965
We're preparing the cabin
for the next passengers.

509
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,243
I'm sorry. Where... where are we?

510
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,044
Dulles International, Virginia.

511
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,004
Was there a young woman
travelling with me?

512
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,647
The other passengers are disembarked.
It's just you, sir.

513
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,925
Abigail.

514
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,210
- What are you doing here?
- I was so worried about you.

515
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,128
Will told me
he was taking you to Minnesota,

516
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,288
and I strongly advised against it.

517
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,730
Where is Will?

518
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,440
I left him at the cabin.

519
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,762
I didn't feel safe with him,
so I left him.

520
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,363
He knows everything.

521
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,407
So does Jack Crawford.

522
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,641
If I run, they'll catch me,
won't they?

523
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,844
You can't protect me any more.

524
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,531
They'll arrest you
when they find you, yes.

525
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,051
And Will.

526
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,169
Did he kill Marissa?

527
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,648
They will believe he did.

528
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,401
They will believe he killed others, too.

529
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,329
Will always said whoever
called the house that morning

530
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,568
was the serial killer.

531
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,442
Why did you really call?

532
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,324
I wanted to warn your father that
Will Graham was coming for him.

533
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,245
Why?

534
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,563
I was curious what would happen.

535
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,649
I was curious what would happen
when I killed Marissa.

536
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,729
I was curious what you would do.

537
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,811
You wanted me to kill Nick Boyle.

538
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,210
I was hoping.

539
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,846
I wanted to see how much
like your father you were.

540
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,971
Oh, my God.

541
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,562
Nicholas Boyle is more important
for you gutting him.

542
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,728
He changed you, Abigail.

543
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,650
That's more important
than the life he clamoured after.

544
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,323
How many people have you killed?

545
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,128
Many more than your father.

546
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,684
Are you going to kill me?

547
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,888
I'm so sorry, Abigail.

548
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,051
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you
in this life.
