1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,286
(Lecter) 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,689
You're quite the topic of conversation
in psychiatric circles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,610
The reason you failed to capture
the Chesapeake Ripper is I had him.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,926
I did it.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,451
(Crawford) Miriam Lass is dead.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,888
The Chesapeake Ripper is making it
clear someone is plagiarising his work.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,322
Is it possible you inadvertently planted
the suggestion in Gideon's mind

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,805
that he was the Ripper?

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,082
Psychic driving is unethical.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,770
(Bloom) I have feelings for you.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,644
- I can't just have an affair.
- (Graham) Why?

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,807
I think you're unstable.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,161
You're the subject of a lot
of speculation at the bureau.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,204
Jack pushed you right up to the edge
and now you're pushing yourself over.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,608
(Crawford) What happened in there?
I saw the look on your face.

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,088
You must overcome these delusions
that are disguising your reality.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,646
It's anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,082
Now that we have confirmed what it is,
it'll be easier to hide from him.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,841
Someone who already doubts
their own identity

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,531
can be more susceptible to manipulation.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,449
Dr Gideon is a psychopath.

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,286
Psychopaths are narcissists.
They rarely doubt who they are.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,006
I tried to appeal to his narcissism.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,281
By convincing him
he was the Chesapeake Ripper.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,929
If only I had been more curious
about the common mind.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,407
I have no interest
in understanding sheep.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,009
Only eating them.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,804
Kudal.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,730
A South Indian curry.

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,604
Made from sheep, of course.

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,167
Bathed in a coconut-coriander
chilli sauce.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,530
It feels like a last supper.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,521
You're not the only psychiatrist accused
by a patient of making them kill.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,648
Poke around a psychopath's mind...
bound to get poked back.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,008
- What would you do in my position?
- Deny everything.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,601
I thought psychic driving
would've been more effective

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,529
in breaking down his personality.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,928
Psychic driving fails because
its methods are too obvious.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,849
You were trying too hard,
Frederick.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,169
If force is used, the subject will
only surrender temporarily.

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,931
Once a patient is exposed
to the method of manipulation,

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,247
it becomes much less effective.

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,125
When Dr Gideon began
to suspect he was being pushed...

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,685
He pushed back.

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,728
The subject mustn't be aware
of any influence.

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,162
(Breathing heavily)

47
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,642
(Gas-ping)

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,042
(Gas-ping)

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,162
(Dog whimpers)

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,088
So you get to dress up and I don't?

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,443
This might affect how well my testimony
goes over with the judge.

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,648
Testimony speaks for itself.

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,606
Frederick, don't look so worried.
I forgive you your trespasses.

54
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,883
- What trespasses are those?
- You made me kill the nurse.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,130
I take responsibility for killing my wife
and her family. The nurse is your fault.

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,130
I cannot accept responsibility
for your actions, Abel.

57
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,925
<i>Au contraire</i>
It's why I'm suing you.

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,291
You made me think
I was somebody else

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,450
and now... who knows what I'm thinking?

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,002
Dr Gideon, you told me
you were the Chesapeake Ripper.

61
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,567
Dr Chilton, you told me
I was the Chesapeake Ripper,

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,241
and that's what
I'm going to tell everyone.

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,765
See you in court.

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,844
You married?

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,930
You married?

66
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,170
You're married.

67
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,770
How long you married?

68
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,090
That long?

69
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,326
Regarding divorce,
not that you're getting one,

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,847
just I can see
the clock in your eyes.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,931
Word of advice.

72
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,922
It's easier just to kill 'em.

73
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,203
Kill 'em. Kill everyone at the table.
Less paperwork.

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,880
Worked for me. I'm doing OK.

75
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,368
Your wife is probably fantastic.

76
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,371
My wife? Horrible.

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,161
Maybe I'm not supposed to be in
a relationship. There's people like that.

78
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,963
How do you keep those whites
so clean?

79
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,731
That's... Always amazes me.

80
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,722
(Indistinct police radio)

81
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,282
(Sighs)

82
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,611
All I need is one hand free.

83
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,762
So does Abel Gideon still believe
he's the Chesapeake Ripper?

84
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,845
Abel Gideon is having a difference
of opinion about who he is.

85
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,528
The man who escaped
from that van

86
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,440
was not in the same state of mind
when he did this.

87
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,609
He took a uniform,
police radio,

88
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,883
two 9mm handguns, pepper spray,
Taser and handcuffs.

89
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,763
It's what he didn't take.

90
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,884
(Katz) He hung the organs from
the branches with vein from the victims.

91
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,891
- He even tied little bows with some.
- Yeah, it's pretty impressive.

92
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,686
The Chesapeake Ripper would
not have left the organs behind.

93
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,441
Well, if Gideon isn't
the Chesapeake Ripper,

94
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,807
he's certainly trying to get his attention.

95
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,730
Local PD picked up a foot trail
leading out of the woods.

96
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,127
Boot soles were consistent with
the ones we found at the crime scene.

97
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,766
- How fresh are the tracks?
- Two, three hours old.

98
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,929
- Which direction they headed?
- Back to Baltimore.

99
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,769
(Door opens)

100
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,360
I suppose this is my fault, too.

101
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,882
You did dodge a bullet.

102
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,050
Gideon's escape foregoes a trial
and a very public humiliation for you.

103
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,686
And now you are hosting a private one.

104
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,009
Next you'll be accusing me
of arranging his escape.

105
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,884
No one's making that accusation.

106
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,890
If we're tossing around the blame,
Dr Bloom, you're due your fair share.

107
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,402
You planted the idea that
I was unethically manipulating Gideon.

108
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,289
Well, according to Gideon,
you were.

109
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,004
After you told him I was.

110
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,566
You thought I was manipulating him?

111
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,409
He was manipulating you.

112
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,925
You were pushing him.

113
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,691
He gave me informed consent
to treat him.

114
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,045
Said that he was grateful for my help
in understanding who he is.

115
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,242
What did you help him understand?

116
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,088
He was not insane
when he killed his wife.

117
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,964
Killing her drove him insane.

118
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,606
I did not convince him
that he was a serial killer.

119
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,890
I just reminded him of the fact.

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,401
Gideon is not the Chesapeake Ripper,

121
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,723
although he might have thought
he was under your care, Doctor.

122
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,764
Whether he is or he isn't
doesn't really matter right now.

123
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,805
If he thinks he is or if he's confused
on that issue, he will kill again.

124
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,287
I hope he does not,
I mean, for your sake.

125
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,610
Cannot imagine how you would sleep
with that on your shoulders.

126
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,691
(Echoes) Cannot imagine how you would
sleep with that on your shoulders.

127
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,361
How did you sleep
when Gideon killed your nurse?

128
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,807
What does Gideon want?

129
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,562
The last thing Abel Gideon said to me
is that he intends to tell everyone

130
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,364
that he is the Chesapeake Ripper.

131
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,083
Our fugitive is Abel Gideon.
Transplant surgeon.

132
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,410
Convicted in the first degree
in the murders of his wife and her family.

133
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,246
Institutionalised at the Baltimore
State Hospital for the Criminally insane

134
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,081
where he killed a nurse and claimed
to be the Chesapeake Ripper.

135
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,647
Dr Gideon escaped this morning
after killing three people.

136
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,410
He is armed and dangerous.

137
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,927
(Muffled) He is believed to be at large.

138
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,850
...In the murders
of his wife and her family.

139
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,444
Institutionalised
at the Baltimore State Hospital

140
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,762
for the Criminally Insane.

141
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,080
'He is armed. He is dangerous.
He escaped this morning.

142
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,762
'You are armed
and you are extremely dangerous.

143
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,680
'Institutionalised at the Baltimore State
Hospital for the Criminally insane.'

144
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,770
What kind of crazy are you?

145
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,611
You kill! You will kill again.

146
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,967
(Erratic breathing)

147
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,449
(Indistinct chatting)

148
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,049
(Lecter) What did you see?

149
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,083
A thicket of antlers.

150
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,971
(Sighs)

151
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,890
All I heard was my heart.

152
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,050
Dim, but, but... fast.

153
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,405
Like... footsteps fleeing into silence.

154
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,131
I don't know how to gauge
who I am any more.

155
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,610
I don't feel like myself.

156
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,124
I feel like I have been gradually
becoming different for a while.

157
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,364
I just feel like somebody else.

158
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,848
What do you feel like?

159
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,529
I feel crazy.

160
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,961
(Lecter) And that is
what you fear most?

161
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,806
I fear not knowing who I am.

162
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,249
It's what Abel Gideon's afraid of,
isn't it?

163
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,603
He's like a blind man.

164
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,727
Somebody got inside his head and...

165
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,401
...moved all the furniture around.

166
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,089
I imagine Abel Gideon would want
to find the Chesapeake Ripper

167
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,362
to gauge who he is.

168
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,522
And who he isn't.

169
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,765
Will...

170
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,968
...you have me as your gauge.

171
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,763
(Katz) Gideon didn't leave a manifesto.

172
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,724
We confiscated all correspondence
from outside admirers.

173
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,604
- We're going through everything.
- Good.

174
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,963
Any secret communiques or coded
messages written in bodily fluids,

175
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,765
or anything else, we'll find them.

176
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,249
You won't find anything. Whatever's
going on with Gideon, it's in his head.

177
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,123
There's not much left in these heads.

178
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,450
All organ removal was done post-mortem,
including the transorbital lobotomies.

179
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,170
It wasn't technically a lobotomy.

180
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,931
He didn't remove any of the brain.
He just scrambled them.

181
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,520
(Zeller) Went in through the top
of the eye socket.

182
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,244
(Katz) It wasn't a lobotomy...

183
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,966
Why remove all of the other organs
from the bodies

184
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,003
and leave them intact,

185
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,963
and just scramble the brains?

186
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,128
- It's what they did to him.
- It's what who did to him?

187
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,244
Dr Chilton, every psychiatrist
and PhD candidate,

188
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,081
who attempted any kind of therapy,
pushed and prodded, gave him tests,

189
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,929
told him who he was,
who he wasn't.

190
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,884
All right, I want a list
of every therapist, every doctor,

191
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,923
any kind of psychiatric professional,

192
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,202
that worked with or talked to Dr Gideon.

193
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,690
Alana Bloom will be on that list.

194
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,889
Are you my protective custody?

195
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,650
You heard.

196
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,368
I heard I get an armed escort
until Gideon's apprehended.

197
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,969
You'll have a real FBI agent,
not a teacher with a temporary badge.

198
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,729
Too bad.

199
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,367
Would've been fun to cosy up with
your dogs in front of a space heater.

200
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,562
You don't need protective custody
to cosy up with my dogs.

201
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,244
Or me, for that matter.

202
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,049
I just need a little more...
stability on my part.

203
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,009
You're really warm.

204
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,008
Yeah, I tend to run hot.

205
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,445
You know they say stress
raises body temperature.

206
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,042
Maybe you should take an aspirin.

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,048
Way ahead of you.

208
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,808
They're gonna kill Gideon,
aren't they?

209
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,765
Whatever happens to him
has nothing to do with you.

210
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,724
Gideon can't be completely
responsible for his actions

211
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,161
if he was subjected
to an outside influence.

212
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,329
What, like Chilton telling him
he's the Chesapeake Ripper?

213
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,767
Like me... telling him he's not
in a state of mind to know who he is.

214
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,369
Well, he's gonna want somebody
to tell him who he is,

215
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,205
and I think he'll be looking
for the Ripper to do that.

216
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,047
What do you think will happen
if Gideon finds the Chesapeake Ripper?

217
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,049
The Chesapeake Ripper will kill him.

218
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,089
He took credit for his work.

219
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,840
The Ripper would consider that... rude.

220
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,682
(Mobile ringing)

221
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,085
Freddie Lounds.

222
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,170
'My name is Paul Carruthers.
I'm a psychiatrist.

223
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,760
'I read your article on Abel Gideon.'

224
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,201
And I yours, Dr Carruthers.

225
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,561
'So you're aware of my work?'

226
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,004
I found your paper on narcissistic
personality disorder insightful,

227
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,329
especially as it pertains
to your opinions of Abel Gideon.

228
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,444
'Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you.'

229
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,329
You calling about his escape?

230
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,204
'Well, yes.

231
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,121
'I'd like to collaborate on an article for
the "Journal of Abnormal Psychology".'

232
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,402
You want a writing partner?

233
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,289
'Could we meet?'

234
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,211
Hello?

235
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,004
Dr Carruthers?

236
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,766
(Gideon) Ms Lounds, come on in.

237
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,768
You wrote in your "Tattler" archive
that the Chesapeake Ripper

238
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,601
once removed a man's tongue
and used it as a bookmark for his Bible.

239
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,291
They call this the Colombian Neck Tie.

240
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,250
'What do you think?

241
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,525
Hey?

242
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,011
Dr Paul Carruthers wrote an article for
the "Journal of Criminal Psychology"

243
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,567
in which he described Dr Gideon
as being a pathological narcissist

244
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,603
who suffers from psychotic episodes.

245
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,803
Let's hope he got some satisfaction
from being proved right.

246
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,527
I think this is about more than getting
the Chesapeake Ripper's attention.

247
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,291
Gideon's mind was dissected
by psychiatrists

248
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,530
and, as a surgeon,
he is applying his own skill set.

249
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,208
He gave you something better to do
with your tongue than wag it.

250
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,283
No, that's not how he died.
Drained him till his heart stopped.

251
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,722
Got a little on his collar.
Other than that, didn't spill a drop.

252
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,287
That's because it's all in here.
4.5 litres all packed in ice.

253
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,564
"Please deliver to the Red Cross."

254
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,524
- That's considerate.
- He's peacocking for the Ripper.

255
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,962
This is like flowers and chocolate
before a first date.

256
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,644
How is this news already?

257
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,250
Somebody from the Baltimore PD

258
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,567
must've taken a picture
and sold it to "Tattlecrime".

259
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,082
The photo was taken
before the blood was put on ice.

260
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,569
- Dr Gideon was still here.
- He has Freddie Lounds.

261
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,329
You might be working out
the emergency exits

262
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,761
or at least considering them.

263
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,928
Let me just tell you there are three.

264
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,848
They're all terribly locked down.

265
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,330
Now this relationship
between you and me,

266
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,124
this can do us both some good.

267
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,561
I could write a big story on you.

268
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,921
Anything you wanna say.

269
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,609
I did enjoy the article you wrote
about the poor nurse I killed,

270
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,769
but it didn't really seem
like genuine Freddie Lounds.

271
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,645
- Jack Crawford told me to write it.
- Of course he did.

272
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,810
- To flush out the Chesapeake Ripper.
- And flushed out he was.

273
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,086
That's why he waved
Jack Crawford's dead trainee's arm

274
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,569
around his head right here
like a flag in this very room.

275
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,444
Aren't you the Chesapeake Ripper?

276
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,086
Ms Lounds, I might be
slightly fuzzy in this area,

277
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,123
but there's no need to patronise me.

278
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,285
I'm sorry.

279
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,369
It's like remembering
something from your childhood...

280
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,647
...and you're not sure if it's your memory
or a friend's memory...

281
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,130
...and then you realise sadly
it's just some photo in an old book.

282
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,883
You're waiting for the Chesapeake Ripper
to come back here.

283
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,287
Let's hope he gets the invitation.

284
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,370
There's one thing
we know about your writing,

285
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,251
he is an avid fan.

286
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,045
(Bloom) Dr Carson Nahn. He's the
psychiatric attending at Western General.

287
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,283
He interviewed Dr Gideon
for the same psychopathy survey

288
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,129
I participated in two years ago.

289
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,685
(Zeller) Total frenectomy.

290
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,566
Webbing under the tongue, the connective
tissue into the throat is cut free

291
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,082
and pulled through
for the... desired effect.

292
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,446
Still no word from Dr Chilton?

293
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,366
He hasn't answered his phone since
yesterday. Didn't show up to work today.

294
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,284
Gideon wants to lure the Ripper.

295
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,246
He's going to offer up the man
who disrespected both their identities.

296
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,204
Every detail of Dr Carruthers' murder,

297
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,164
as described meticulously
in Freddie Lounds' article,

298
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,366
has been faithfully reproduced
except... for one.

299
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,091
What's different about Carson?
Why amputate his arm?

300
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,965
(Crawford)
Freddie write anything about this?

301
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,003
(Zeller) Not that I'm know of, no.

302
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,284
Abel Gideon didn't kill this man.
The Chesapeake Ripper did.

303
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,964
You said the Chesapeake Ripper
would wanna kill Gideon

304
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,764
for taking credit for his work.

305
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,202
But Gideon isn't alone any more,

306
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,120
and the Ripper isn't going
to risk exposure,

307
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,288
so, no, he's, he's...

308
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,566
He's telling us where to catch him.

309
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,563
- Actually, he's telling you.
- Me?

310
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,046
Where's the last place
you saw a severed arm, Jack?

311
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,569
With experience, I have found
surgeries are best performed

312
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,607
under local anaesthetic
or epidural with the patient awake.

313
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,122
Reminds me there's a real person here
entrusting me with their life,

314
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,084
rather than a lump of meat
that I'm about to reorganise.

315
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,441
And in this instance,
I would like to see the look on your face.

316
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,331
Please...
You're not the Chesapeake Ripper.

317
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,920
You got inside my mind, Frederick.

318
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,010
It's only fair I get inside your belly.

319
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,127
This is of course Freddie Lounds,
who you know.

320
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,766
She will be assisting me today,
or assisting you,

321
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,566
by manually pumping the ventilator,
should you stop breathing.

322
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,250
Oh, my God.

323
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,441
(Chilton gasps)

324
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,647
The real Chesapeake Ripper is
a collector of surgical trophies

325
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,001
and I'm gonna leave him a little gift.

326
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,441
In fact, I'm gonna leave him
a gift basket.

327
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,522
(Chilton groans)

328
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,850
You know, it is truly amazing
how many organs the body can offer up

329
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,645
before it really begins to suffer.

330
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,080
All right, stay awake now!
Come on, Frederick.

331
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,242
I'm gonna ask you to hold
a few things.

332
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,445
Hmm... What next?

333
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,086
(Crawford) I want you to wait outside.

334
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,685
That's probably best.

335
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,890
You look like hell, Will.

336
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,002
I feel like hell.

337
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,845
Actually, no. I feel... fluid.

338
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,927
Like I'm spilling.

339
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,089
Must've come down with something.
I hope it's not contagious.

340
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,730
Look, this work that we do,

341
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,401
it will compromise
your immune system, if you allow it.

342
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,281
You gotta keep things in perspective,
gotta keep yourself in perspective.

343
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,164
My self is a little hazy at the moment.

344
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,250
You've gotta start
taking better care of yourself.

345
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,131
Build my resistance.

346
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,924
You just can't take it all in.

347
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,363
You've got to let go
of as much of it as you can.

348
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,045
You just gotta let go.

349
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,849
It's hard to shake off something
that's already under your skin.

350
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,729
Mark.

351
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,722
(stag snorts)

352
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,885
Go!

353
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,291
(Officer) Clear. Clear.

354
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,010
No sign of Gideon.

355
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,849
Gideon's gone. He's still alive.

356
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,566
I need medical in here now!

357
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,525
(Sighs)

358
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,763
I was expecting
the Chesapeake Ripper.

359
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,451
Or are you he?

360
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,962
Turn around. Don't look at me.

361
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,686
You are looking a little peaky,
Mr Graham,

362
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,529
if you don't mind my saying.

363
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,883
I may be crazy, but you look ill.

364
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,129
Drive.

365
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,410
Who is your doctor?

366
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,122
I'm having a hard time thinking.

367
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,567
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I-I-I don't know what's real.

368
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,089
It's 7:27pm.

369
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,283
You're in Baltimore, Maryland,
and your name is Will Graham.

370
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,725
No, I don't care who I am!
Just tell me... if he's real.

371
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,842
(Panting)

372
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,767
Who do you see, Will?

373
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,129
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

374
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,924
Who do you see?

375
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,004
- I don't see anyone.
- No? He's right there.

376
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,009
- There's no one there.
- You're lying.

377
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,124
We're alone. You came here alone.
Do you remember coming here?

378
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,641
- Please don't lie to me!
- Garret Jacob Hobbs is dead.

379
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,649
You killed him. You watched him die.

380
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,250
What's happening to me?

381
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,603
Will...
Will, Will, you're having an episode.

382
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,370
I want you to hand me the gun.

383
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,129
Will, I want you
to hand me your... Will?

384
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,765
Will?

385
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,045
He's had a mild seizure.

386
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,842
That doesn't seem to bother you.

387
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,685
I said it was mild.

388
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,762
Are you the man who claimed
to be the Chesapeake Ripper?

389
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,889
Why do you say "claimed"?

390
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,571
Because you're not.
You know you're not.

391
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,650
And you don't know much more
about who you are beyond that.

392
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,603
Are you the Ripper?

393
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,245
A terrible thing...

394
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,201
...to have your identity
taken from you.

395
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,766
Well, I'm taking it back
one piece at a time.

396
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,969
You should see the pieces
I got out of my psychiatrist.

397
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,124
Alana Bloom was
one of your psychiatrists, too.

398
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,605
Is that right?

399
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,402
Yes, Dr Bloom.

400
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,928
I can tell you where to find her.

401
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,001
(Lecter) Will, can you hear me?

402
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,450
Repeat after me.

403
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,049
My name is Will Graham.

404
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,889
My name is Will Graham.

405
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,451
Raise both of your arms.

406
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,683
More... More.

407
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,765
Good.

408
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,923
Although you may not feel like it,
I need you to smile.

409
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,085
Good.

410
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,085
It wasn't a stroke.

411
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,323
You may have had a seizure.
Tell me the last thing you remember.

412
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,120
I...

413
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,844
(Panting heavily)

414
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,169
I was with Garret Jacob Hobbs.

415
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,248
You have a fever.

416
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,931
You were hallucinating.
You thought he was alive.

417
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,644
Here, in the room with you.

418
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,603
I saw him.

419
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,848
He's a delusion disguising reality.

420
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,922
Don't let that let you slip away.

421
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,170
You killed Garret Jacob Hobbs once.
You can find a way to kill him again.

422
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,971
Where are you going?

423
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,970
Abel Gideon is still at large.
He mutilated Dr Chilton.

424
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,887
They found him clinging to life.

425
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,162
I'm worried about Alana.

426
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,409
- Alana...
- No, no, no. Will.

427
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,651
You're in no state to go anywhere
but the hospital.

428
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,730
I'll call Jack,
tell him where you are.

429
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,245
(Door shuts)

430
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,602
(Indistinct chatting)

431
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,162
(Gas-ping)

432
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,924
I don't know
if I will ever be myself again.

433
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,042
I don't know
if I've got any self left over.

434
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,170
I spent so long thinking I was him,

435
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,002
it's got really hard to remember
who I was when I wasn't him.

436
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,570
Who are you now?

437
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,288
Now I'm you.

438
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,442
We're both here looking at her.

439
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,805
Just those kind of people
that shouldn't be in a relationship.

440
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,887
You and I are already committed.

441
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,087
It's hard to be with another person
when you can't get out of your own head.

442
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,404
I want to get out.

443
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,961
Yeah, well, we all want things
that we can't have.

444
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,889
But if I kill her,

445
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,401
like he would kill her,

446
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,767
maybe I could understand him better.

447
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,930
I wonder if then you would finally
understand what you've become.

448
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,291
(Gunshot)

449
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,451
They will be sewing up Dr Chilton
until the morning,

450
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,648
that is if he makes it through the night.

451
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,001
(Lecter) At least Will remains
in one piece.

452
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,651
For now.

453
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,091
Mm.

454
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,889
His temperature is 105.

455
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,321
White blood cell count
is twice normal

456
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,728
and they still can't identify
the source of his infection.

457
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,608
They will.

458
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,609
You seem confident.

459
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,449
I am.

460
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,441
Even with a temperature
of 105 degrees,

461
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,400
Will was able to bring Gideon down.
I told you, he'll be fine.

462
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,889
Jack... I would recommend you suspend
his license to carry firearms.

463
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,411
You and I are just gonna have to have
a difference of opinion about who Will is.

464
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,006
I know who Will is.

465
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,605
Will knows who he is.

466
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,290
Yes.

467
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,767
But our experiences shape us, Jack.

468
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,323
How is this experience
going to shape Will?

469
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,282
Will Graham is troubled.

470
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,761
(Du Maurier) And that troubles you?

471
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,646
Beyond a professional concern
for a patient?

472
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,331
I see his madness
and I want to contain it.

473
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,851
Like an oil spill.

474
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,330
Oil is valuable.

475
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,810
What value does Will Graham's
madness have for you?

476
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,970
You're suggesting I'm more fascinated
with the madness than the man?

477
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,367
- Are you?
- No.

478
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,121
He realised early on that he saw things
differently than other people.

479
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,129
Felt things differently.

480
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,850
So did you.

481
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,929
I see myself in Will.

482
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,682
Do you see yourself in his madness?

483
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,804
Madness can be a medicine
for the modern world.

484
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,366
You take it in moderation,
it's beneficial.

485
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,922
You overdose and it can have
unfortunate side effects.

486
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,611
Well, side effects can be temporary.

487
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,530
They can be a boost
to our psychological immune systems

488
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,610
to help fight the existential crises
of normal life.

489
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,688
Will Graham does not present you
with problems from normal life.

490
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,089
No, he doesn't.

491
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,288
What does he present you with?

492
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,168
The opportunity for friendship.

493
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,531
He is still your patient, Hannibal.

494
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,206
Where Will Graham is concerned,
if you feel the impulse to step forward,

495
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,722
you must force yourself
to take a step back.

496
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,684
And just watch him lose his mind?

497
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,041
Sometimes all we can do is watch.
