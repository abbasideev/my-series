1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,331
(Crawford) 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,331
The reason you kept failing to capture the
Chesapeake Ripper is I already had him.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,728
I see the Ripper,
but I don't feel the Ripper.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,083
Franklyn, the lion is not in the room.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,406
He's eating them.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,770
The real Chesapeake Ripper is gonna
make sure everybody knows it.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,202
I don't think we've ever been alone
in a room together, have we?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,721
My name is Miriam Lass.
I'm actually just a trainee.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,842
A very brave young woman.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,650
'It's Miriam.
I don't want to die like this!'

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,320
The Chesapeake Ripper kills
in sounders of three.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,967
He did his first victims
in nine days.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,881
Annapolis, Essex, Baltimore.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,923
He didn't kill again for 18 months.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,805
Then there was another sounder
of three in as many days,

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,400
all of them in Baltimore.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,011
I use the term "sounders" because
it refers to a small group of pigs.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,763
That's how he sees his victims,
not as people, not as prey.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,764
Pigs.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,889
Eleven months after the sixth victim,
there was a seventh.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,210
Two days later, the eighth is killed
in his workshop.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,120
Every tool on the pegboard where
they hung was used against him,

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,881
and, as with previous murders,
organs were removed.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,209
The removal of organs
and abdominal mutilations means

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,767
someone with anatomical
or surgical know-how.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,681
There... is a distinctive brutality.

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,641
An FBI trainee named
Miriam Lass

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,331
was investigating
private medical records

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,728
of all the known victims
when she disappeared.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,524
She's believed to be
the Ripper's ninth,

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,008
but no trace of her was found
until recently,

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,081
two years later,
when her severed arm was discovered.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,968
Only because he wanted it to be.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,565
True to his established pattern,

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,288
the Chesapeake Ripper has
remained consistently theatrical.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,451
(♪ Female singing opera)

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,970
It's been too long since you've
properly cooked for us, Hannibal.

38
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,208
Come over
and I will cook for you.

39
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,607
I said "properly",
means dinner and the show.

40
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,768
Have you seen him cook?
It's an entire performance.

41
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,010
He used to throw
such exquisite dinner parties.

42
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,203
You heard me. "Used to".

43
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,642
And I will again,
once inspiration strikes.

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,651
I cannot force a feast,
a feast must present itself.

45
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,809
- It's a dinner party not a unicorn.
- But the feast is life.

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,287
You put the life in your belly
and you live.

47
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,209
(She chuckles)

48
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,802
I believe this young man is trying
to get your attention.

49
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,810
- Hello.
- Hi. It's so good to see you.

50
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,571
- This is my friend Tobias.
- Good evening.

51
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,886
How do you two know each other?

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,847
There should remain some mystery
to my life outside the opera.

53
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,531
- I'm one of his patients.
- Oh.

54
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,169
- Did you enjoy the performance?
- I did. I loved it. Every minute.

55
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,169
His eyes kept wandering.

56
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,523
More interested in you
than what was happening on stage.

57
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,202
Oh, don't say too much. You must leave
something for us to discuss next week.

58
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,163
Franklyn, good to see you.

59
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,248
- You too.
- Tobias.

60
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,411
- Who's hungry?
- (She giggles)

61
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,409
(Phone rings)

62
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,002
(Ringing continues)

63
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,331
(Continues ringing)

64
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,407
(Phone rings)

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,331
Hello?

66
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,567
The victim was found
in a hotel room bathtub.

67
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,843
There were abdominal mutilations
and organ removal on the scene.

68
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,645
Sounds more like an urban legend
than the Chesapeake Ripper, no?

69
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,764
I've had the room sealed.
You'll get it fresh.

70
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,850
Fresh? Fresh as a daisy?

71
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,930
Fresh enough for you to tell me
whether or not it's the Ripper.

72
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,170
- Then you can go back to class.
- You don't want me in a classroom.

73
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,567
You want me to wrap my head
so tight around the Ripper

74
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,762
I won't go back to class
until he's caught.

75
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,805
- Your bad luck that you're the best, pal.
- Expecting more bodies after this one?

76
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,164
- If it's the Ripper, yes, I am.
- Don't let the Ripper stir you up.

77
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,371
The reason he left you Miriam Lass's arm
is so he could poke you with it.

78
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,966
Why not the rest of her?

79
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,970
His other victims...

80
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,369
he wanted to humiliate in death,
like a public dissection.

81
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,841
She was different.

82
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,561
He was probably impressed
that she was able to find him.

83
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,604
He may be starting another cycle, Will.

84
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,645
The Ripper contacted you directly.

85
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,525
If he was killing again,
he wouldn't be subtle about it,

86
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,041
he would just pick up the phone.

87
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,362
- Any more phone calls, Jack?
- No.

88
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,205
If this is the Ripper, there'll be
at least two more bodies

89
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,846
and then nothing for months,
maybe a year.

90
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,204
We'll have a window of opportunity
to catch him and that window will close.

91
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,644
The last time the window closed,
I lost the Ripper and I lost Miriam Lass.

92
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,762
I don't intend to do that again.

93
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,729
Has anyone touched the body?

94
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,604
For once, local police behaved
themselves.

95
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,848
It's fairly evident the man's dead
just by looking at him.

96
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,804
I touched the body.
A lot going on with that body.

97
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,526
Surgery was performed
and then un-performed.

98
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,645
Surgery was un-performed
with bare hands, sutures clawed open.

99
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,082
Er... I also... did
a little bit of touching.

100
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,843
Pieces of him were torn off from the bed
to the bathroom like breadcrumbs.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,561
Surgery wasn't performed here.
There would be a lot more blood.

102
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,569
If he's moving his victims,

103
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,365
he could be performing the mutilations
in the same transport.

104
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,409
(Price) Find the car, find the killer.

105
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,360
- He tore open his own sutures.
- It wasn't to get to his kidney.

106
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,330
The Ripper already took it with him.
Or her.

107
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,726
I'd say him.

108
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,525
- What did he take out of the chest?
- Going for the heart.

109
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,565
Probably interrupted. It's intact.
Traumatised, but it's intact.

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,650
Everybody out.

111
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,369
Signs of a struggle indicate

112
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,889
he's suffering from a severe,
violent emergence from deep sedation.

113
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,970
Oh!

114
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,722
His heart seizes up.

115
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,409
(Gasps)

116
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,329
I open his chest wall.

117
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,729
I spread the ribs.

118
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,848
I take his heart in my hand.

119
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,410
Internal cardiac massage.

120
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,730
(Gasps)

121
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,531
Jack?

122
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,607
This wasn't brutal.

123
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,520
The killer wasn't killing,
he was trying to save his life.

124
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,407
The Ripper ever do that?

125
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,004
- It's the Chesapeake Ripper.
- (Graham) It's not the Ripper.

126
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,409
- There are too many similarities.
- There aren't enough.

127
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,528
Knife wounds are cuts, not stabs.

128
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,404
Anatomical knowledge,
dissection skills, mutilation,

129
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,086
organs removed,
victim clothed, on display.

130
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,727
We got 22 signature components
all attributable to the same killer.

131
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,730
Twenty two possible
signature components.

132
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,922
It's the Ripper.

133
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,969
- Are you sure?
- More or less.

134
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,084
Tell me why you're sure.

135
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,524
The Ripper left a victim in a church pew
using his tongue as a page marker

136
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,961
in the Bible he was holding.

137
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,769
This isn't that,
this is a medical student,

138
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,645
or a trainee or someone trying
to make an extra buck

139
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,842
in a back-alley surgery,
and it went bad.

140
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,327
Actively bad.

141
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,369
We'll catch the Ripper. Eventually.

142
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,682
Yeah, well, I want to catch him now.

143
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,721
When I do, you won't get a chance
to shoot him, cos I'm gonna do that.

144
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,207
You can't just jack up the law
and get underneath it.

145
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,765
Can't I?

146
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,525
Tell me how you see the Ripper, Will.

147
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,841
I see him

148
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,285
as one of those pitiful things

149
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,768
sometimes born in hospitals.

150
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,089
They feed it, keep it warm,

151
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,522
but they don't put it on the machines.

152
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,888
They let it die.

153
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,206
But he doesn't die.

154
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,403
He looks normal.

155
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,041
And nobody can tell what he is.

156
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,569
Good morning.
Please come in.

157
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,846
Would you like to discuss
our chance encounter?

158
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,530
(Chuckles)

159
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,722
It wasn't altogether by chance.

160
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,208
I kind of... kinda thought
you'd be there...

161
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,924
which isn't why I was there.

162
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,646
I-I... I was there because
I like that sort of thing.

163
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,321
It just occurred to me that...
that you might like it too.

164
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,090
In fact, I do.

165
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,091
- I tried to get your attention.
- I was aware of that.

166
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,123
I knew that you were aware,

167
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,244
even though you were pretending
that you weren't.

168
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,569
It would be unethical
to approach a patient

169
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,763
or acknowledge in any way
our relationship outside this room

170
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,167
until that patient gives consent.

171
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,087
But I really don't know
who you are outside this room.

172
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,568
- I'm your psychiatrist.
- I want you to be my friend.

173
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,286
Of course you do.
I have intimate knowledge of you.

174
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,609
And we like the same things.
I think that we would make good friends.

175
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,690
It makes me sad
that I have to pay to see you.

176
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,330
(Sighs heavily)

177
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,850
I am a source of stability and clarity,
Franklyn. I'm not your friend.

178
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,167
I'm a great friend.

179
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,003
I was listening to, uh,
Michael Jackson last night,

180
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,930
and I burst into tears, and...

181
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,441
My eyes are burning right now
just thinking about it.

182
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,561
You know what I think is
the saddest thing

183
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,562
about him dying is that
I will never get to meet him,

184
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,921
and I feel like if I was his friend

185
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,964
that I... I would have
been able to...

186
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,845
help save him from himself.

187
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,442
In this Michael Jackson fantasy,
how is your friendship returned?

188
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,443
I just get to touch greatness.

189
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,728
Hello. Come on in.

190
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,528
This always goes better
if I'm perfectly honest with you.

191
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,246
What would be the point otherwise?

192
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,722
Well, one of us has to be honest.

193
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,569
I'm honest.

194
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,283
- Not perfectly.
- As honest as anyone.

195
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,043
Not really.

196
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,687
I have conversations
with a version of you

197
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,164
and hope that the actual you
gets what he needs.

198
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,527
A version of me?

199
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,565
Naturally, I respect
its meticulous construction,

200
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,327
but you are wearing
a very well-tailored "person suit".

201
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,729
Do you refer to me as "Person suit"
with your psychiatrist friends?

202
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,368
I don't discuss patients
with my psychiatrist friends,

203
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,364
especially since I only have
one patient

204
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,127
who chooses to ignore
my retirement.

205
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,084
A patient who wears a person suit.

206
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,250
Maybe it's less of a person suit
and more of a human veil.

207
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,004
That must be lonely.

208
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,723
I have friends.
And the opportunities for friends.

209
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,842
You and I are friendly.

210
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,243
You are my patient
and my colleague, not my friend.

211
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,848
At the end of your hour,
I will pour you a glass of wine.

212
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,648
Nevertheless, you will be drinking it
on the other side of the veil.

213
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,009
Why do you bother?

214
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,044
I see enough of you
to see the truth of you.

215
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,290
And I like you.

216
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,330
Red or white?

217
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,248
I think something pink, don't you?

218
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,162
Good evening, Will.
Please come in.

219
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,602
Oh, you've been drinking.

220
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,769
I had a glass of wine
with my last appointment, yes.

221
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,171
Drinking with a patient.
She was drinking with a patient.

222
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,409
I have an unconventional
psychiatrist.

223
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,961
Well, we have that in common.

224
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,524
Am I your psychiatrist, or are we
simply having conversations?

225
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,411
"Yes" I think is the answer to that.

226
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,927
Then having a glass of wine
before seeing a patient,

227
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,850
I assure you, is very conventional.

228
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,725
Especially for evening appointments.

229
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,606
Huh. How long have you been
seeing a psychiatrist?

230
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,564
Since I chose to be a psychiatrist.

231
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,531
Thank you.

232
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,722
I read the Freddy Lounds article.
Chesapeake Ripper has struck again.

233
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,764
No, no, no.
No, it's not the same guy.

234
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,087
Maybe it's never been the same guy.

235
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,046
Oh, what, now he has a friend?
(Chuckles)

236
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,767
Any variations in the murders that might
suggest more than one Ripper?

237
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,645
Some variations.

238
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,882
The victims were all brutalised.

239
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,526
What was the brutalisation hiding?

240
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,969
The careful surgical removal
and preservation of vital organs.

241
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,009
Valuable organs.

242
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,729
Organ harvesters?

243
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,162
Jack's looking for a serial killer
he can't seem to catch.

244
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,647
It's a brilliant diversion.

245
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,848
That's an interesting theory.

246
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,769
I will keep it in mind
if another body drops.

247
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,087
Please do.

248
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,010
(Man) Any other infections?

249
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,202
(Lecter) You seem convinced
I'm diseased.

250
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,563
I was asking a broader question.
A disease is an infection.

251
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,809
- An infection isn't always a disease.
- That is true.

252
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,571
You should tell me now,
because I'm going to find out,

253
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,729
and it will affect your insurance
if you lie.

254
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,768
May I ask for your business card,
please, for my records?

255
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,848
(Metallic knocking)

256
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,051
Aargh!

257
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,210
Do you need a hand?

258
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,201
I think I must've hit a rock or something.
It gouged my gas tank.

259
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,330
Have we met before?

260
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,401
(Zeller) Found him in a school bus,
sitting across the aisle from himself.

261
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,848
Not only did the Ripper
take his kidney...

262
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,367
...but he also took his heart,
which is what he tried to do in the hotel

263
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,161
but was interrupted before
he could paint his picture.

264
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,163
The Ripper wasn't painting a picture
in the hotel. Someone else was.

265
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,965
You still think he was ripping out
a heart to save a life?

266
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,286
Yes, I do.

267
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,167
The Ripper painted this picture,
for sure, in big, broad strokes.

268
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,051
Could both victims' organs
have been harvested for transplant?

269
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,642
Subtle variation on waking up
in a tub of ice missing a kidney?

270
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,569
I love a good urban legend.

271
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,651
You could put the organs on a ventilator
long enough to coordinate the donation.

272
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,207
At the hotel, the victim's abdominal
aorta and inferior vena cava...

273
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,927
that's like the kidney's in-and-out
for blood... were entirely removed.

274
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,726
They're like USB cables. You keep
them intact for an easy reconnect.

275
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,650
Were Mr Caldwell's heart and kidney
disconnected for easy reconnect?

276
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,807
Yeah.

277
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,720
Other Ripper victims...
Organs and USB cables missing?

278
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,764
It's inconclusive due to the degree
of mutilation,

279
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,360
but yes, that is how the Ripper rips.

280
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,329
Two different killers, same agenda?

281
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,602
Is the organ harvester
disguising his work

282
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,405
as the crimes of a serial killer,

283
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,928
or is the serial killer disguising his
crimes as the work of an organ harvester?

284
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,726
The Chesapeake Ripper
wants to perform.

285
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,765
Every brutal choice has elegance...

286
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,329
...grace.

287
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,007
His mutilations hide
the true nature of his crimes.

288
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,409
I've been unspeakably rude,
I haven't offered you a drink.

289
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,609
I appreciate beer more than wine.

290
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,166
It's not what you appreciate,
it's that you appreciate.

291
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,729
A compromise?
Beer brewed in a wine barrel.

292
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,081
Two years. I bottled it myself.

293
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,043
I'm impressed.

294
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,371
A Cabernet Sauvignon wine barrel.

295
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,444
- I love your palate.
- I love your beer.

296
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,569
I taste oak.
What else do I taste in there?

297
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,887
I will only answer that yes or no.

298
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,968
Are you serving this
at your dinner party?

299
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,130
- No. This is your reserve.
- My own private reserve?

300
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,890
Why, thank you.

301
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,002
I'm curious about something.

302
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,530
Are you purposefully avoiding
the subject of Will Graham?

303
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,926
Absolutely.

304
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,008
Not on my account, I hope.

305
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,930
I'm happy to get your perspective.

306
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,522
No, it's on Jack Crawford's account.

307
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,202
I don't want any information about Will
that I shouldn't have as his friend.

308
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,369
Did Jack ask you to profile the Ripper?

309
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,764
Not since I consulted on the case
with Miriam before she disappeared.

310
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,087
- Crawford's trainee?
- Yeah.

311
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,331
Very sad.

312
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,368
You had me examining
PhD candidates that week.

313
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,764
And I'm grateful you were examining
PhD students and not the Ripper.

314
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,010
You realise those candidates thought
we were having an affair.

315
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,085
- Why didn't we?
- You were already having an affair.

316
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,365
- Will does that too, you know.
- What? Have affairs?

317
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,808
Flirtatiously change the subject.
You have that pathology in common.

318
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,526
Or we just have you in common.

319
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,530
I recall even before I met Will,
you never spoke about him.

320
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,929
Probably because I just want
everybody to leave him alone.

321
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,049
It's not even about Will.

322
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,528
Jack's obsessed with the Ripper
and he's grooming Will to catch him.

323
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,242
And I sincerely hope he does.

324
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,447
(♪ Opera music playing)

325
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,882
(Price) They're all missing
different organs.

326
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,527
Before, we were looking
at waiting lists for a heart or a kidney.

327
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,771
Now we're looking at hearts,
kidneys, livers, stomachs,

328
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,928
pancreases, lungs.

329
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,566
This guy,
he's missing a spleen.

330
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,287
A spleen! Who the hell gets
a spleen transplant?

331
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,725
Intestines were the only organ
missing from this body?

332
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,845
Yes, so we're either looking
for someone with short bowels or...

333
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,849
Ripper's making sausage.

334
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,804
He's selling these organs to someone.

335
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,207
We don't even know if he's
transplanting them within the US.

336
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,563
- He could be exporting them to China.
- The Chinese have a cultural taboo

337
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,887
that restricts voluntary donation.

338
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,207
You gotta die with all your parts
or you dishonour mummy and daddy.

339
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,971
(Zeller) You can still kill a guy
for parts, that doesn't break that taboo.

340
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,128
I was agreeing with you.

341
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,927
- Well, I was.
- Your tone was a little...

342
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,886
OK... How many killers?

343
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,650
Two.

344
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,649
You confident one of them
is the Chesapeake Ripper?

345
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,286
At least one of them, yep.

346
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,320
Good morning. Please come in.

347
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,522
I discovered that
we are cheese folk.

348
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,130
I saw you shopping for cheese.

349
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,371
I didn't say hello, because you were
so uncomfortable the last time I did.

350
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,605
- This city is very small.
- Yes. Jose's.

351
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,361
Jose's has the best selection
of artisanal cheeses

352
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,568
in Baltimore, city or county.

353
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,205
(Chuckles)

354
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,644
Cheese is my passion.
You ever heard of tyromancy?

355
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,768
- Divination by cheese.
- It was my gateway to cheeses.

356
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,850
It was like a magic 8-ball
that you can eat.

357
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,007
Tobias, he, erm...

358
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,202
he doesn't eat dairy.

359
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,402
(Sighs heavily)

360
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,888
Do you desire Tobias sexually?

361
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,210
No. God, no. Uh... no.

362
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,846
Not to be defensive.
I just, erm...

363
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,408
Don't get me wrong.
I was in a "fraternity".

364
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,722
I tried things, you know?

365
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,969
Erm... It's just not my brand.

366
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,731
You care deeply about Tobias?

367
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,368
Despite differences,
he's your best friend, but you're not his.

368
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,330
Well, it's sad
when you say it like that.

369
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,401
You often worry about being alone?

370
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,562
I worry about hurting.

371
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,888
Being alone comes with a...

372
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,287
a dull ache.

373
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,004
Doesn't it?

374
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,206
It can.

375
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,766
(♪ Opera music playing)

376
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,522
It's better that it's just the two of us.

377
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,961
(Lecter) 'Will?'

378
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,805
- Dad.
- Yes?

379
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,844
There's someone else here.

380
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,004
(Lecter) Will?

381
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,126
Will?

382
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,966
I have a 24-hour cancellation policy.

383
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,243
- What time is it?
- Nearly nine o'clock.

384
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,322
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- No apology necessary.

385
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,081
I must've fallen asleep.

386
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,924
Was I sleepwalking?

387
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,681
Your eyes were open,
but you were not present.

388
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,729
Jeez.

389
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,929
I felt as if I was asleep.
I need to stop sleeping altogether.

390
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,004
Best way to avoid bad dreams.

391
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,291
Well, I can see
why you have bad dreams.

392
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,321
What do you see, Doctor?

393
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,726
Sum up the Ripper
in so many words?

394
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,650
- Choose them wisely.
- Oh, I always do.

395
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,889
Words are living things,
they have personality,

396
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,721
point of view, agenda.

397
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,922
They're pack hunters.

398
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,603
Displaying one's enemy after death
has its appeal in many cultures.

399
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,850
These aren't the Ripper's enemies,
these are pests he's swatted.

400
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,082
Their reward for their cruelty.

401
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,841
Oh, he doesn't have a problem
with cruelty.

402
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,611
Their reward is
for undignified behaviour.

403
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,644
These dissections are
to disgrace them.

404
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,927
It's a public shaming.

405
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,205
Takes their organs away because,
in his mind, they don't deserve them.

406
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,402
In some way.

407
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,565
What's this?

408
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,048
It's Jack Crawford's trainee.
She's not like the other victims.

409
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,881
The Ripper had no reason
to humiliate Miriam Lass.

410
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,129
Seems to me
he was humiliating someone.

411
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,527
Yeah, he was humiliating Jack.

412
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,683
- Did it work?
- I'd say it worked really well.

413
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,005
I've been looking for the kill truck,
a van or SUV.

414
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,169
But it was a whole lot easier than that.

415
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,210
- What am I looking at here?
- One of the hotel security cameras.

416
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,322
- Kill truck?
- It's a private ambulance.

417
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,727
The city works with dozens
of private ambulance companies.

418
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,968
Including this one.
But not as a first responder.

419
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,721
A first responder driving away
from the emergency?

420
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,050
Have a seat.

421
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,840
Ambulance would be a smart place
to perform surgery.

422
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,726
If the cops show up,
blend in and drive away.

423
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,402
Where's Will Graham?

424
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,562
Will. There you are.

425
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,889
And Dr Lecter.
What a surprise. We have a lead.

426
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,765
Would you care to, uh,
help us catch the Ripper?

427
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,524
How could I refuse?

428
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,968
That ambulance isn't in rotation,
hasn't even been out of the shed.

429
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,809
Surveillance footage says
it has been.

430
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,400
Nobody's signed her out.
My road sheet's got her down for repairs.

431
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,403
And who signed her in for repairs?

432
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,801
Devon Silvestri,
one of our part-time drivers.

433
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,446
- Does he want to be a doctor?
- He's taking the MCATs.

434
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,851
What?

435
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,731
- It was there this morning.
- It was there this morning. Well...

436
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,561
- Is Mr Silvestri working today?
- He's not on the schedule.

437
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,209
- Is there GPS on that ambulance?
- Mm-hm.

438
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,924
Encrypted messaging,
or remote tracking?

439
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,566
We can't afford that kind of hardware.
We use consumer grade.

440
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,762
- Digital trunk systems.
- Yeah.

441
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,564
- Jack.
- Yeah.

442
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,207
If the ambulance radio is on,
I can use a DF sweep to find it.

443
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,084
Good.

444
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,521
This is very educational.

445
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,727
- Show me your hands.
- I can't.

446
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,124
Show me your hands.

447
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,651
He'll die.

448
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,761
Dr Lecter!

449
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,764
I need you to assess
the situation here, Doctor.

450
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,130
He was removing his kidney. Poorly.

451
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,722
- I can stop the bleeding.
- Do it.

452
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,082
- Have you got it?
- I've got it.

453
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,931
Mr Silvestri, put your hands
behind your head.

454
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,840
Exit the vehicle slowly. Do it.

455
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,527
On the ground. On your knees.

456
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,130
I have a butcher
who carries sow's blood.

457
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,568
Centrifugate, separate the matter
from the water,

458
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,921
creates a transparent liquid.

459
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,042
Serve with tomatoes
in suspension

460
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,208
and everybody will love
the sweet taste.

461
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,845
Sure you can't stay?

462
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,566
Uh, I don't think
I would be good company.

463
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,604
I disagree.

464
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,326
But before you go,

465
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,046
what became
of Mr Silvestri's donor?

466
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,130
You saved his life.

467
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,843
Been a long time since I used
a scalpel on anything but a pencil.

468
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,009
- Why'd you stop being a surgeon?
- I killed someone.

469
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,886
Or more accurately, I couldn't save
someone, but it felt like killing them.

470
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,765
You were an emergency room surgeon,
it has to happen from time to time.

471
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,770
It happened one time too many.

472
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,169
I transferred my passion for anatomy
into the culinary arts.

473
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,362
I fix minds instead of bodies,

474
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,525
and no one's died
as a result of my therapy.

475
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,722
I have to go.

476
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,969
I have a date
with the Chesapeake Ripper.

477
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,082
Or is that rippers?

478
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,124
Devon Silvestri was harvesting organs,
but not with the Ripper.

479
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,802
- There's no connection between them.
- Jack must be devastated.

480
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,048
I imagine he is.

481
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,331
- Enjoy the wine.
- Thank you.

482
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,641
(Applause)

483
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,285
Before we begin,
you must all be warned,

484
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,763
nothing here... is vegetarian.

485
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,530
(Laughter)

486
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,404
Bon appetit.
