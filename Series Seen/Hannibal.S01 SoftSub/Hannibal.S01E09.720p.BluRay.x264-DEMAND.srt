1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,328
(Lecter) 'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,046
So is it me or is it becoming
easier for you to look?

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,686
I can make myself look,
but the thinking is shutting down.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,361
(Bloom) The way that I am isn't
compatible with the way that...

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,726
(Graham) The way I am.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,365
Do you know where you are,
Mr Graham?

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,850
My sister was impaled on a severed
stag head. Cut down the middle.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,201
I can help you.
We can hide the body.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,210
Abigail Hobbs may be the only person
who knows the truth.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,402
(Bloom) You can't ask her
right now, Jack.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,528
I wanna go home.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,250
(Graham sighs)

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,923
World's sickest jigsaw puzzle.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
Yeah, but where are the corners?

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,971
What?

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,130
My mum always said
start a jigsaw with the corners.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,971
Uh... the heads are the corners,
I guess.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,927
We got too many corners.
Seven graves. Way too many heads.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,643
The headpiece appears
to be the only recent victim.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,969
The others are years,
even decades old.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,564
And we know that seven of the bodies
were buried out here.

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,287
Whoever dug them up knew
exactly where they were buried.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,880
I guess it wasn't enough for him
to kill them once.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,162
He had to come back
and defile his victims.

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,887
These graves weren't desecrated,
Jack, they were exposed.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,760
OK, everybody, let's go!
Let's clear the scene!

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,889
(Graham sighs)

28
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,770
(Inhales)

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,967
I planned this moment,

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,368
this monument, with precision.

31
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,442
Collected all my raw materials
in advance.

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,690
(Grunts)

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,929
I position the bodies carefully,

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,408
according each its rightful place.

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,805
Peace in the pieces disassembled.

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,971
(Groans)

37
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,970
My latest victim... I save for last.

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
I want him to watch me work.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,210
I want him to know my design.

40
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,565
(Victim groans)

41
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,689
This is my resume.

42
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,723
This is my body of work.

43
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,402
This is my legacy.

44
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,368
Will, I wasn't expecting you.

45
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,211
I don't know how I got here.

46
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,641
Your car is outside,
so we know you drove.

47
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,206
Well, I was on a beach
in Grafton, West Virginia.

48
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,245
I blinked and then I was waking up in
your waiting room, except I wasn't asleep!

49
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,762
Grafton is three-and-a-half hours
from here. You lost time.

50
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,769
There is something wrong with me.

51
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,609
You're disassociating, Will.

52
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,566
It's a desperate survival mechanism for
a psyche that endures repeated abuse.

53
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,444
- I'm not abused!
- You have an empathy disorder.

54
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,921
- What you feel is overwhelming you.
- I know, I know.

55
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,044
Yet you choose to ignore it.
That's the abuse I'm referring to.

56
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,321
Do you want me to quit?

57
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,569
Jack Crawford gave you a chance
to quit and you didn't take it. Why?

58
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,011
Um...

59
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,005
I save lives.

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,851
- And that feels good?
- Generally speaking, yeah.

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,721
- What about your life?
- Huh?

62
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,130
I'm your friend, Will.
I don't care about the lives you save.

63
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,323
I care about your life
and your life is separating from reality.

64
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,685
(Breathes heavily)

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,689
I've been sleepwalking.

66
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,851
I'm experiencing hallucinations.

67
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,931
- Maybe I should get a brain scan.
- Will!

68
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,450
Stop looking in the wrong corner
for an answer to this.

69
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,290
You were at the crime scene when
you disassociated. Tell me about it.

70
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,168
It was a totem pole of bodies.

71
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,205
In some cultures,
crimes and guilt are made manifest,

72
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,846
so that everyone can see them
and see their shame.

73
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,965
No, this isn't shame, this is celebration.
He's marking his achievements.

74
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,807
And faced with this killer's
achievements,

75
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,241
your mind needed to escape
and you lost time.

76
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,291
Yes.

77
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,084
I'm worried about you, Will.

78
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,929
You empathise so completely

79
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,044
with the killers Jack Crawford
has your mind wrapped around

80
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,810
that you lose yourself to them.

81
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,764
What if you lose time and hurt yourself?

82
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,370
Or someone else?

83
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,680
I don't want you to wake up
and see a totem of your own making.

84
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,201
Every day, I wake up and...

85
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,688
...I hear my dad's voice.

86
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,680
Like he was kneeling next to my bed.

87
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,848
He whispers what he told me.

88
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,962
(Whispering)

89
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,401
He told me he killed girls.

90
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,880
Again and again.

91
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,641
So he wouldn't have to kill me.

92
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,009
I wish he was still alive,
so I could ask him...

93
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,245
...what did I make him feel?

94
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,763
What was so wrong with me
that he wanted to kill?

95
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,123
He should have.
He should have killed you.

96
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,249
- So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,328
So he wouldn't have killed me.

98
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,250
- So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

99
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,931
(Voices talk over each other)

100
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,810
So he wouldn't have killed me.

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,850
(Panting)

102
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,724
He should have killed you...

103
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,362
...so that you wouldn't have killed me.

104
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,522
(Gas-ping)

105
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,525
Hey-

106
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,766
- I'm sorry about yesterday.
- Sorry about what?

107
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,563
I... I wasn't feeling like myself.

108
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,967
Well, not feeling like yourself,
that's kind of what you do, isn't it?

109
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,051
- I suppose so.
- Yeah. OK.

110
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,610
So, I seemed fine to you?

111
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,647
- Is there something you wanna tell me?
- Uh, no, no.

112
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,609
Well, clearly there's something
that you don't wanna tell me.

113
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,083
I... I guess I just got
a little lost yesterday, is all.

114
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,811
And where are you today?

115
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,441
It got to me.

116
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,602
All those bodies got to me,

117
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,521
and... I thought it was a little
more obvious than... than it was.

118
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,725
(Sighs heavily)

119
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,931
If there's a problem,
you need to tell me.

120
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,602
Is there a problem, Will?

121
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,570
Everything's fine.

122
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,882
All right.

123
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,046
They sold my parents' house.

124
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,642
Murder houses don't fetch big money
in today's real-estate market.

125
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,808
(Lounds) Not that you'll get any of it.

126
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,126
The families of your father's victims
filed wrongful death suits.

127
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,371
Wrongful death?

128
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,683
That means that they get
everything, Abigail. Every penny.

129
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,124
What you have here is all you have.

130
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,049
Let them take all his money.

131
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,684
I don't want any of it.

132
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,282
You can make your own money.

133
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,371
How much would I get...
if you wrote a book about me?

134
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,291
About my dad?

135
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,565
Plenty.

136
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,203
Do you still wanna tell my story?

137
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,526
I think you need to tell your own story,
but I am the one to help you tell it.

138
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,130
No one knows more about
what your father did than I do.

139
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,930
Not even Will Graham?

140
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,089
Will Graham is part of the story
you tell, Abigail,

141
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,929
not the person to help you tell it.

142
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,604
He avoids me
because I make him feel like my father.

143
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,769
Well, feeling like your father
makes him feel like a killer.

144
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,527
People think I helped my dad
kill those girls.

145
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,050
Well, you can change what people think.

146
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,606
We can change that together.

147
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,802
Everyone will know the truth.

148
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,371
OK.

149
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,564
Let's tell my story.

150
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,371
(Sighs)

151
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,810
How many bodies?

152
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,649
(Price) We got 17 in total.

153
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,401
Meet our freshest one.

154
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,244
Joel Summers.

155
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,887
40 years old. Runs a cell phone store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

156
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,681
Or did. Been missing for three days.

157
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,370
Single stab wound to the heart.

158
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,320
Other injuries were post-mortem.
Broken bones, dislocated hips, shoulders.

159
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,442
He was special to him somehow.

160
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,764
He held a place of honour.

161
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,963
Seven bodies from unmarked graves
found at the crime scene.

162
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,129
Earth from the body parts
matches the grave sites.

163
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,767
Blunt-force trauma, stabbings,
strangulations. Wrongful deaths.

164
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,723
There are at least eight other bodies

165
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,446
that are grave robbings
from across West Virginia.

166
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,570
No crimes attributed to any of them.
Accidental deaths.

167
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,845
They're all murders.

168
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,531
Anthony Lamb, 28.
Fatal car wreck, 1986.

169
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,929
Francesca Bourdain, 42.
Suicide, pills, 1994.

170
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,170
Adrian Packham, 60.
Massive coronary, 2001.

171
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,930
Peter McGee, 25.

172
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,123
Carbon-monoxide poisoning
in his home, 2006.

173
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,768
And seven as-yet-unidentified bodies
buried on a beach.

174
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,969
Every death is different.

175
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,448
Made to look... like something else.

176
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,331
No sadism. No torture.

177
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,365
The method of these murders
was less important to the killer

178
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,443
than the simple fact...

179
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,728
...that these people die.

180
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,371
Joel Summers, killed with
a single stab to the heart.

181
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,325
Presented with great ostentation

182
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,808
atop a display
of all the previous victims.

183
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,767
This killer's design was
to remain unnoticed, a ghost.

184
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,044
That is what excited him.

185
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,770
Until now.

186
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,365
Why is he coming out into the light?

187
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,321
Will... I don't wanna interrupt
if you're rehearsing or...

188
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,925
Uh... no, no, no. It's OK, it's OK.

189
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,284
Very moody in here.

190
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,082
Uh... well, that's me all over.

191
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,565
(Chuckles)

192
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,091
Come on in.

193
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,200
I promise I won't try to kiss you again.

194
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,720
Unless you've stopped
taking your own advice.

195
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,171
A doctor who treats herself
has a fool for a patient.

196
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,804
I regretted leaving your house
the other night.

197
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,171
Regretted?

198
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,405
Implying that you're no longer regretting,

199
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,450
or are you still in a state of regret?

200
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,926
I'm crisscrossing the state line.

201
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,804
What side of the line are you on now?

202
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,009
I've got one foot
firmly planted on both sides.

203
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,287
Are you telling me that
to confuse me?

204
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,129
No, I'm telling you that
to be honest about how I feel.

205
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,043
I don't wanna mislead you,
but I don't wanna lie to you either.

206
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,684
I won't lie if you don't.

207
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,407
I have feelings for you, Will.

208
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,211
But I can't just have an affair with you.

209
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,923
It would be... reckless.

210
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,003
Why? Why?

211
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,011
And it is not because you have
a professional curiosity about me.

212
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,451
No.

213
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,722
It's because I think you're unstable.

214
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,205
Hm.

215
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,207
And until that changes,
I can only be your friend.

216
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,210
Thank you for not lying.

217
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,688
Do you feel unstable?

218
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,005
Mm.

219
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,769
I'm trying to be understated

220
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,770
when I say that this is a bad idea.

221
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,564
Freddie Lounds is dangerous.

222
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,968
She said she wanted me
to write about you guys in the book.

223
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,686
You would be forfeiting
your privacy and ours.

224
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,244
This... this...
Well, all of this will change.

225
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,570
Whatever you're feeling now,
that won't last.

226
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,170
Things change.

227
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,006
Things are changing for me, too.

228
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,845
I've been doing some accounting of
what's important in my life and what isn't.

229
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,641
You are important, Abigail.

230
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,602
Just because you killed my dad
doesn't mean you get to be him.

231
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,930
Abigail, you've been through
a traumatic event,

232
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,520
and no one more traumatised
than you, Abigail,

233
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,324
but we went through it together.

234
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,522
What you write,
you write about all of us.

235
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,608
I don't need your permission.

236
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,850
And you don't need our approval,
but I hope it would mean something.

237
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,928
I know what people think I did.

238
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,411
They're wrong.

239
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,971
Why can't I tell everybody
that they're wrong?

240
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,209
You have nothing to apologise for.

241
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,810
Yet.

242
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,925
But if you open this door, Abigail,

243
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,088
you won't control what comes through.

244
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,525
Are you ready for that?

245
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,169
The display was built in Grafton
for a reason.

246
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,330
Totem poles commemorate special
events. They tell the story of a life.

247
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,209
If Joel Summers is his finale,

248
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,608
then this lowest body on the pole
will be our killer's beginning.

249
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,325
His first.

250
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,841
Fletcher Marshall, murdered in 1973.

251
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,362
Beaten to death right in Grafton.
His grave was robbed five days ago.

252
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,161
- No one convicted of killing him?
- Not yet.

253
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,201
So our guy got away with it
40 years ago.

254
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,561
So he kept on going.

255
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,965
There will be a connection between
Joel Summers and Fletcher Marshall.

256
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,811
Will... I need you in my office.

257
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,042
Nicholas Boyle turned up
in Minnesota dead.

258
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,361
His body was found in the woods.
He was frozen.

259
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,206
They thawed him out fairly quickly,
but they can't tell if he died a week ago,

260
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,243
six weeks ago
or the night he disappeared.

261
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,725
(Bloom) How did he die?

262
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,005
Knife wound. He was gutted.
I've had the body flown down here.

263
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,567
I want Abigail Hobbs
to identify it for us.

264
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,524
- You already have a positive ID.
- Not from Abigail Hobbs.

265
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,120
You can't put her in a room
with Nick Boyle's body.

266
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,687
- She already has nightmares about him.
- I'm curious about why.

267
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,171
You can't think
she has something to do with this.

268
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,248
Abigail Hobbs is
the common denominator

269
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,045
between her father,
Marissa Schurr and Nicholas Boyle.

270
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,525
They all go back to Abigail.

271
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,008
My instincts tell me that Abigail
has answers that we have not heard.

272
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,645
What are the questions, Jack?

273
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,285
Let's start with where she goes

274
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,085
when she climbs the walls
of the psychiatric facility.

275
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,407
Maybe she's meeting Nicholas Boyle.

276
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,404
None of us know what was
really going on between them.

277
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,724
I wanna go on record as saying that
this is a very bad idea. Hannibal?

278
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,208
Jack has the look of a man with
no interest in any opinion but his own.

279
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,649
I want you to observe on this, Alana.

280
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,331
If you're putting Abigail in a room
with the body, I wanna be there.

281
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,805
I'm sorry, Will.

282
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,968
I am not very confident
with your ability

283
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,447
to be objective
about Abigail Hobbs right now.

284
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,931
Alana.

285
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,767
He could do Abigail irreparable damage
exposing her to this.

286
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,922
Perhaps she's stronger than we think.

287
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,243
Miss Hobbs,
I want you to look at this man.

288
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,368
Is this the same person
that attacked you,

289
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,568
Dr Bloom and Dr Lecter at your home?

290
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,724
That's him.

291
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,004
Good.

292
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,930
I just have a few other questions
I'd like you to answer.

293
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,843
Have you seen this man
since the night he attacked you?

294
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,291
Could you cover him up?

295
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,131
I just need you
to answer the question first, please.

296
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,284
No.

297
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,167
I haven't seen him
since he... attacked me.

298
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,923
This man, Nicholas Boyle,
was gutted with a hunting knife.

299
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,722
You knew how to do that.
Your father taught you.

300
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,366
- Jack, I won't be party to this.
- Then you can leave.

301
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,691
You're here by invitation,
by courtesy, Dr Bloom.

302
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,450
Please don't interrupt me again.

303
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,250
You think I did this?

304
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,130
Where do you go when you escape
from the hospital, Abigail?

305
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,688
Sometimes... into the city.
Sometimes into the woods.

306
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,289
Sometimes just out.

307
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,090
I go get away from... this.

308
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,203
To be alone where I can...

309
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,802
...think... breathe.

310
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,684
Did you ever meet
with Nicholas Boyle

311
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,246
on one of your little getaways
from the hospital?

312
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,930
Did you know each other
before the night he attacked you?

313
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,410
- Did he know your father?
- No!

314
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,161
And you know nothing about his death?

315
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,404
I know he tried to kill me.

316
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,004
And when he was trying to kill me,

317
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,886
all I could think was that
I was gonna die in that house after all.

318
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,690
But I didn't.

319
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,331
I survived.

320
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,162
Dr Bloom and... Dr Lecter saved my life.

321
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,089
They saved me from him.

322
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,284
And you haven't seen him since?

323
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,724
Only in my nightmares.

324
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,885
(Bloom) Are we done?

325
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,683
I'll be just a moment, Abigail.

326
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,687
- You believe her?
- I think Abigail Hobbs is damaged.

327
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,725
There is something, she's using every
ounce of that strength to keep buried,

328
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,604
but it's not the murder
of Nicholas Boyle, Jack!

329
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,846
What makes you so sure?

330
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,409
Because any reservations I have
about Abigail don't extend to Hannibal!

331
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,361
He has no reason
to lie about any of this.

332
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,402
It can be a comfort to see
the broken, bloated corpse of a monster

333
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,243
and know it can never come back.

334
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,161
Nick Boyle wasn't a monster.

335
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,131
Were you?

336
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,602
I sometimes feel like one.

337
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,566
Is that why you uncovered his body?

338
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,087
Would this be a chapter
in your book, Abigail?

339
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,171
No. Neither would killing Nick
or you helping me hide the body.

340
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,683
There's always an addendum.

341
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,122
The FBI already asked their questions.
I answered them. I passed.

342
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,970
- With Jack Crawford's attention.
- You're right. I opened the door.

343
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,085
I can't control what comes through it,
but this time I could control when.

344
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm not afraid of them finding Nicholas
Boyle any more. He's been found.

345
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,328
You betrayed my trust.

346
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,205
You jeopardised my life,
as well as your own.

347
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,448
I deserve more than that.

348
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,568
I need to trust you, Abigail.

349
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,364
What if I can't?

350
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,444
Joel Summers, the headpiece of our totem
pole, was adopted after his parents died.

351
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,931
Guess who dad was?

352
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,806
Fletcher Marshall.
Joel Summers is Joel Marshall.

353
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,845
We did a DNA comparison between
Fletcher Marshall and Joel Summers.

354
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,849
No match.

355
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,089
So Marshall's son wasn't his son?

356
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,407
The mum, Eleanor,
was killed in a car accident

357
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,528
four years after Fletcher was killed.

358
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,641
Genuine car accident?

359
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,445
If she was murdered,
she would've been on the totem pole.

360
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,126
Well, unless he loved her too much
to disgrace her that way.

361
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,004
Was anyone ever convicted
for Marshall's murder?

362
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,045
There was a man named Laurence Wells
who was questioned twice in 1973.

363
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,128
Never charged. Still lives in Grafton.

364
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,328
Fletcher Marshall was a crime of passion.

365
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,444
It had something that
none of the other murders had.

366
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,411
Motive.

367
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,684
(Wells) It's open. Come in.

368
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,765
I'm unarmed.

369
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,243
(Crawford) So you were expecting us.

370
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,767
I had faith you'd find me.

371
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,328
- And why is that, Mr Wells?
- Because I let you.

372
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,088
That last one was...

373
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,011
Let's just say it's a good thing
it was the last one.

374
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,082
I don't have the fight in me any more.

375
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,965
Are you confessing
to the murder of Joel Summers?

376
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,367
(Chuckles)

377
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,124
And Fletcher Marshall.

378
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,003
And 15 others.

379
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,409
I assume you've counted 'em up by now.

380
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,086
So you killed Joel Summers
just so you'd be caught?

381
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,088
Not just.

382
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,728
I killed Joel Summers
because he was never meant to be.

383
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,121
What reason did you have
to kill the others?

384
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,641
I had every reason to kill the others.

385
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,569
They just had no reason to die.

386
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,651
They never saw me coming
unless I wanted them to see me coming.

387
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,128
I could wave at a lady and smile,

388
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,084
chew the fat with her in church,

389
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,248
knowing I killed her husband.

390
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,647
There is something beautiful
about that ball of silence at a funeral.

391
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,047
All those people around you,

392
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,561
knowing that you made it happen.

393
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,201
Now there's something beautiful
about knowing

394
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,721
that you'll spend
the rest of your life in prison.

395
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,601
Do I look wealthy to you?

396
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,129
Prison is gonna be a luxury

397
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,289
next to the kind of retirement home
I can afford.

398
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,083
And I certainly won't be forgotten there.

399
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,330
I'm securing my...

400
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,121
I'm securing my legacy.

401
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,561
(Graham) That's one way to be
remembered.

402
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,083
No children to tell your story.
Did Joel Summers remember his father?

403
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,170
Not any more.

404
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,322
Did you have an affair with Eleanor
Marshall before you murdered her?

405
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,887
From your silence,
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

406
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,765
He was your son. Joel Summers.

407
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,166
What?

408
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,090
You thought the woman you loved
was having Fletcher Marshall's baby

409
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,249
when she should've been having yours,
but you got it the wrong way around.

410
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,169
Eleanor chose to raise him

411
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,170
as Fletcher Marshall's child
rather than yours,

412
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,968
so maybe... she saw
what's in your heart.

413
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,721
You didn't secure your legacy, Mr Wells.
You murdered it.

414
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,405
In fact, your one act as a father
was to destroy your son.

415
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,009
Killing somebody,

416
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,043
it feels that bad?

417
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,169
I'm worried about nightmares.

418
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,647
(Lecter)
We'll help you with the nightmares.

419

(♪ BACH: "Sarabande")

423
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,404
(Door opens)

424
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,725
Hello, Will.

425
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,601
Abigail Hobbs killed Nick Boyle.

426
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,765
Yes, I know.

427
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,041
Tell me why you know.

428
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,726
I helped her dispose of the body.

429
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,523
Evidently... not well enough.

430
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,210
Have you told Jack Crawford?

431
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,401
- No.
- Why not?

432
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,607
Because I was hoping it wasn't true.

433
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,729
Well... now you know the truth.

434
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,051
Do I?

435
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,562
Everything you know about that night
is true, except the end.

436
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,851
Nicholas Boyle attacked us.

437
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,884
Abigail's only crime was
to defend herself and I lied about it.

438
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,083
- Why?
- (Scoffs) You know why.

439
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,889
Because Jack Crawford would hang her
for what her father's done

440
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,321
and the world would burn Abigail
in his place.

441
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,161
That would be the story. That would be
what Freddie Lounds writes.

442
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,891
Abigail is no more a killer than you are
for shooting her father

443
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,365
or I am for the death of Tobias Budge.

444
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,366
- It isn't our place to decide.
- If not ours, then whose?

445
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,251
Who knows Abigail better
than you and I?

446
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,761
Or the burden she bears?

447
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,962
We are her fathers now.

448
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,924
We have to serve her better
than Garret Jacob Hobbs.

451
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,050
If you go to Jack,
then you murder Abigail's future.

452
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,529
Do I need to call my lawyer, Will?

453
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,084
We can tell no one.

454
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,082
What we are doing here
is the right thing.

455
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,968
In time, this will be the only story
any of us cares to tell.

456
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,082
(♪ Classical piano music playing)

457
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,041
I feel terrible, Ms Lounds.

458
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,891
It never entered my head
you might be a vegetarian.

459
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,125
A lapse on my behalf.

460
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,329
Research always delivers benefits.

461
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,284
If it contradicts a good story,
hell, publish it anyway.

462
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,446
Are you still angry I called you insane?
The libel laws are clear, Mr Graham.

463
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,682
Insinuation is such a grey area.

464
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,280
Insane isn't really
black or white, is it?

465
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,602
We're all pathological in our own ways.

466
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,327
You choose the version of the truth
that suits you best

467
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,204
and pursue it pathologically.

468
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,563
Everybody decides
their own versions of the truth.

469
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,889
I'm here because I want
to tell Abigail's version of the truth.

470
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,251
See that you do.

471
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,922
- I don't have anything to hide.
- Hm, everyone has something to hide.

472
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,967
But I won't tell anything
you don't want me to.

473
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,287
(Lecter) You must understand
our concerns.

474
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,125
We care about Abigail.
Our only thought is to protect her.

475
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,763
She's already exposed.

476
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,407
Her silence until now
has been taken as guilt.

477
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,166
This book is about her innocence.

478
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,760
I want Abigail to have a future.

479
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,723
That's what we all want.

480
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,003
Well, we all want what's best for Abigail.

481
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,843
This is possibly the finest salad
I've ever eaten in my life.

482
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,806
Shame to ruin it with all that meat.

483
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,284
Will knows, doesn't he?

484
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,560
He knows you killed
Nicholas Boyle, yes.

486
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,930
What am I gonna do?

487
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,683
He will keep our secret.

488
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,409
You don't know that.

489
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,884
He will keep it because otherwise
the one good thing in his life is tainted.

490
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,446
And he will lie
to Jack Crawford about you.

491
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,402
Just as he has lied to himself.

492
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,205
You're free, Abigail.

493
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,049
No one will know what you did.

494
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,250
And no one will know the truth
you're trying to avoid.

495
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,683
The one you cannot admit...

496
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,964
...even to yourself.

497
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,730
(Sobs) I helped him.

498
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,842
- I can't hear you.
- I helped him.

499
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,047
I knew what my father was.
I knew what he did. I... I knew.

500
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,929
I was the one who...

501
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,570
...met the girls.

502
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,084
Talked to them.

503
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,601
Laughed and joked.

504
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,691
Found out where they lived,

505
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,526
where they were going,
when they'd be alone.

506
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,248
Girls that looked just like me.

507
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,163
They could've been my friends.

508
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,201
I-I couldn't say no to him. I knew...

509
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,248
I knew it was them or me.

510
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,409

(Lecter sighs)

512
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,568
I wondered when you would tell me.

513
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,010
I'm a monster.

514
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,043
No.

515
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,561
I know what monsters are.

516
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,444
You're a victim.

517
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,203
And Will and I...

518
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,768
...we're going to protect you.

519
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,410

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,325
