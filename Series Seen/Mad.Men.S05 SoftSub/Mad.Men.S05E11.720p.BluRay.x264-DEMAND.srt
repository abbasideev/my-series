1
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:47,004
Jaguar, the mistress
who'll do things your wife won't.

2
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,133
What did l say before?

3
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,884
The client doesn't want to
hear the word "mistress."

4
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,886
Salesmen can use it, but the campaign can't.

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,099
Jaguar, you'll love it when you're in it.

6
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,935
Are we just spitting up lines now?

7
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,689
You know what? Let's take a break.

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,611
Where are you going?

9
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,448
What was unclear about the fact
that he's taking a break and we're not?

10
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,584
l need you to sign off on Secor Laxative.

11
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,588
l told you you were in charge of all
ongoing business till Jaguar's done.

12
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,465
-Just handle it.
-Done.

13
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,301
-How's the prospect doing?
-ls it lunchtime?

14
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,094
Jesus, is it?

15
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,805
Mr. Sterling bought lobster from The Palm.

16
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,682
Doesn't that sound good?

17
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,517
Hey.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,945
So, l don't know
what the Jaguar executives will say.

19
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,490
But l got dealerships in Montclair,

20
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,576
Englewood, Morristown,
Paramus and Rutherford.

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,369
And l carry three other foreign cars.

22
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,539
So, frankly, creative
has to be pretty spectacular

23
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,125
or Jaguar is just another word on the sign.

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,669
Well, then we have nothing to worry about.

25
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,881
The dealership on the ground floor
of the corporate offices on Madison

26
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,092
has done very well
just having that XK-E in the entrance.

27
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,844
You have to be excited about this car.

28
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,597
Oh, it's a red-hot number.
l'm excited about that.

29
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,974
But l'm a hard man to please.

30
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,102
l always feel like someone
should go the extra mile.

31
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,647
We're open to anything your heart desires.

32
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,402
Well, the other day
when we were all touring your offices,

33
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,863
our guide was a dynamite redhead.

34
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,158
-Joan Harris.
-Built like a B-52.

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,452
Yeah, we know who you're talking about.

36
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,163
Well, l sure would like the opportunity
to get to know her better.

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,791
Well, a lot of guys would.
But, you know, she's...

38
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,543
She's a very interesting girl.

39
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,130
She's one of these free spirits?
You know, open to ideas?

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,176
So you like redheads? l think l know some.

41
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,554
l like that redhead.

42
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,848
And l think she and l

43
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,226
would both welcome the opportunity
to spend a night together.

44
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,272
Well, you could ask her out.
lt wouldn't be a conflict.

45
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,108
No, l'm kind of shy.

46
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,695
All l'm saying is, if it happens,
it would make me happy.

47
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,906
lf it doesn't, well,
no guarantees in life, right?

48
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,288
-Get another round. l'll get it.
-Absolutely not.

49
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,084
-Was that what l think it was?
-Yes, it was.

50
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,461
Why didn't you just let me
tell him she was married?

51
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,090
Because so is he.
And he already knows that.

52
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,926
Well, we wanted to be in the car business.

53
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,810
-You waited up.
-No.

54
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,645
l mean, yes.

55
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,024
l'm going in to read tomorrow
for a really good part.

56
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,817
An audition? Why didn't you call?

57
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,279
Honestly, because l had to go
to 1 0th Avenue to get the script

58
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,864
and then l went and talked to Fanny,

59
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,949
you know, who teaches
my auditioning class.

60
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,118
You're very good at auditions.

61
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,996
Not as good as the girls who get parts.

62
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,042
You know what? Let's talk about your day.

63
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,836
Well, l was gonna watch Carson
and cry myself to sleep.

64
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,381
lt'll come to you. lt always does.

65
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,342
Unless it comes to you.

66
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,761
Do you really want help
or you want to yell at me?

67
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,262
l don't know yet.

68
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,556
What's the strategy?

69
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,645
A Jaguar is beautiful, but unreliable.

70
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,230
lt comes with a tool kit
the size of a typewriter.

71
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,107
You basically have to
own another car to go places.

72
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,527
So we're saying it's your gorgeous mistress.

73
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,949
So a wife is like a Buick in the garage.

74
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,992
We're trying to make a weakness
into a strength.

75
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,203
-We're selling to men.
-No, l got it.

76
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,165
Doesn't being a mistress
make the car immoral?

77
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,000
The word "mistress" won't be in the ad.

78
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,380
l don't know, but it sounds great.

79
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,803
l need to learn some of this.

80
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,305
There goes the act.

81
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,683
One shot, and there goes the tambourine.

82
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,519
You're here early.

83
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,854
What can l do for you?

84
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,982
Nothing.

85
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,151
Nothing, it's just,
l got some bad news last night

86
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,737
and l was hoping you'd help me deliver it.

87
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,489
What happened?

88
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,367
Well, we were having dinner
with Herb Rennet.

89
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,161
l think you met him
the other day, from Jaguar.

90
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,039
-Handsome guy.
-l don't remember any of them.

91
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,166
Well, l don't know what to do.

92
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,627
He basically pledged
he wasn't going to back us.

93
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,421
Why not?

94
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,716
Turns out he wanted something
we're not prepared to give.

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,384
Something very unorthodox.

96
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,052
-Good morning.
-Yes?

97
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,389
l'm here. l'm going to get danish.

98
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,975
What does he want?

99
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,772
l feel like l shouldn't even bring this up.

100
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,316
ln fact, l don't know how to bring this up.

101
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,028
But we're going to lose Jaguar unless

102
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,824
an arrangement is made, and it involves you

103
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,702
and, well, Herb.

104
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,164
How did that come up?

105
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,834
He said he was crazy about you
and then he just asked.

106
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:22,131
And then l thought we were past it,
but right before we put him in a cab,

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,134
he said it again and it was quite conditional.

108
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,969
A night with you or no vote.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,097
Well, l'm sorry to hear that.

110
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,810
Anyway, if you can think of some way
to break the news to the company

111
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,022
that we're out of this, l'd really appreciate it.

112
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,107
You're unbelievable.

113
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,359
l'm married.

114
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,278
How would you feel
if someone asked Trudy?

115
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,448
l didn't bring this up. He did.

116
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,454
lf you're not interested in the idea at all,
l appreciate...

117
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,790
lt's just...

118
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,710
lt seems to me that there's something
that could be worth the sacrifice.

119
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,338
We're talking about a night in your life.

120
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,132
We've all had nights in our lives
where we've made mistakes for free.

121
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,593
You're talking about prostitution.

122
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,888
l'm talking about business
at a very high level.

123
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,265
Do you consider Cleopatra a prostitute?

124
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,810
Where do you get this stuff?

125
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,645
She was a queen.

126
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,940
What would it take to make you a queen?

127
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,193
l don't think you could afford it.

128
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,539
This was an act of desperation.

129
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,083
l hope l haven't insulted you.

130
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,085
That's all that matters to me.

131
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,546
l understand.

132
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,301
Scarlett, we're ready.

133
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,472
Now, we can't get Ginsberg out for the call,
so we want you to pretend you're his junior.

134
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,517
-Partner?
-Supervisor.

135
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,688
l have Mr. Rick Swanson
from Chevalier Blanc cologne on speaker.

136
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,984
Hi, Rick. lt's Kenny.

137
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,279
l'm here on a speaker
with Harry Crane and Peggy Olson,

138
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,281
Mr. Ginsberg's supervisor,

139
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,783
and we want to know
why you want to pull the ad.

140
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,660
-Hello, everyone.
-Hi, Rick.

141
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,078
Hello.

142
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,163
We're very happy with the work,

143
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,582
but sales have leveled off
since the holidays.

144
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,127
lt's Harry. And, you know,
Valentine's Day is coming up.

145
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,087
A girl can't get a guy flowers.

146
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,048
Why would a woman buy a man
anything for Valentine's Day?

147
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,344
Rick, it's Peggy.

148
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,221
l think you're right.

149
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:38,559
The target of "A hard day's night" was men,
but we can easily change that.

150
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,352
How do you do that?

151
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:46,984
Hello?

152
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,987
What if it's our leatherjacket hero

153
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,157
running down the street
being chased by screaming girls

154
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:58,120
and instead ofjumping into a bar,
he comes upon Lady Godiva on a horse

155
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,373
as naked as we are allowed to make her?

156
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,963
And he stops short, but she leans down
and picks him up and puts him on the horse

157
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,632
and rides away with him.

158
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,135
What's the tagline?

159
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,764
lt's something about how, you know,

160
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,268
the right woman loves Chevalier Blanc.

161
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,940
So it's exactly the same
except for the ending?

162
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,484
And maybe Paris instead of London.

163
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,695
Ooh-la-la. A French song.

164
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,745
Close the door, please.

165
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,711
Herb Rennet has demanded
to spend a night with Joan.

166
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,463
And l don't mean dinner and dancing.

167
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,344
He just came right out and said that?

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Who is he?

169
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,389
He's the head of the Dealers Association.

170
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,974
And l hope you told him to take a long walk.

171
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,017
There's three votes. We only need two.

172
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,019
l thought about that.

173
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,981
But all he has to do is say
he can't sell cars with our campaign

174
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,858
and neither marketing
nor the factory will fight him.

175
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,237
-So?
-So l brought up the subject with Joan.

176
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,823
-You what?
-Now, relax.

177
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,409
She seemed more amused than shocked.

178
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,995
And it's my opinion,
if we brought her the right amount...

179
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,497
So you thought you'd have us in here
for coffee and talk about this?

180
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,666
What's the problem if she's amenable?

181
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,001
She said she'd do it?

182
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,253
She said we couldn't afford it.

183
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,760
She has a husband in Vietnam
and a baby at home.

184
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,762
And the work will be good enough
to win on its own.

185
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,557
-Plus, it's not a guarantee.
-No, it's not.

186
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,518
lt's a guarantee we won't get it if we don't.

187
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,729
You have some nerve to even ask her.

188
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,938
That's right.

189
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,273
And you should be thanking me

190
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,233
because we've come too far
and are too close

191
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,819
to turning this place into what it should be.

192
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,196
Now we're going to walk away?

193
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,614
Over what?

194
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,702
He's one guy and we can win it without him.
End of discussion.

195
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,417
Speaking of one guy,
how does everyone else feel?

196
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,420
l'd love to approach her with, say,

197
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,715
a 1 0 % finder's fee
on the first year's commission.

198
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,093
That's $50,000. A flattering amount
which begs no negotiation.

199
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,597
l'm not going to stand in the way,
but l am not paying for it.

200
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,309
Not even with our Christmas bonuses?

201
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,229
Maybe Jaguar wasn't meant to be?

202
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,900
l say we take our bonuses and move on.

203
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:37,404
This is a car. You cannot
put a dollar figure on its significance.

204
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,573
Extend our credit line.

205
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,700
Say it's for Jaguar.

206
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:54,588
Well, why don't l look into it
to see what we can afford

207
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,842
so you may approach her in the morning
with something definitive?

208
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,098
So, we're 75% of this company.

209
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,934
There's no need to create a conspiracy
by having a vote, is there?

210
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,604
Don't fool yourself.
This is some very dirty business.

211
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,067
Let her know she can still say no.

212
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,796
You know what?
We're not doing this mistress thing.

213
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,840
lt's vulgar.
We're going back to racing heritage.

214
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,384
-Why?
-People think writers horse around

215
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,760
because they're coming up with ideas.

216
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,429
But, actually, it's because
they're horsing around.

217
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,722
Now knock off the grab-ass
and give me some lines.

218
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,434
And don't try to reuse these.
They do not apply.

219
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,317
Hey, skipper. You got five seconds?

220
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,320
Five seconds is not
enough time to sit down.

221
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,574
Good news.
Chevalier Blanc wants to do a pool-out.

222
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,535
-Great.
-Peggy was incredible.

223
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,704
She came up with this
Lady Godiva bit on the spot.

224
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,124
But in the end, we're doing
the same ad as before, but in Paris.

225
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,959
The guy has a beret.

226
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,255
Bid it out. Ginsberg should be free by then.
Be nice to get him out of here.

227
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,799
Ginsberg? l thought of this.

228
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,303
-lt's his account.
-So l guess l'm not in charge of everything.

229
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,306
Jesus, Peggy, you know what?

230
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,558
You want to go to Paris? Here.

231
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,518
Go to Paris.

232
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,166
l'm not crying.

233
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,418
l didn't think that.

234
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,214
What, we're all suddenly interested
in each other's lives?

235
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,467
l know for a fact
that Jaguar's not going to happen.

236
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,718
And he probably does, too.

237
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,596
-l don't care.
-l'll get you to Paris.

238
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,224
And if l don't, we'll both get out of here.

239
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,143
You and your stupid pact.

240
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,355
Save the fiction for your stories.

241
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,284
What can l do for you?

242
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,119
May l?

243
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,006
Signing Jaguar would be disastrous
for the financial health of this company.

244
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,426
You have to stop being afraid.

245
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,596
lt would be a defining moment
for our business.

246
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,642
We don't want it that badly.

247
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,605
-All right, get out.
-lt bears discussion.

248
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,692
l don't know what you're talking about.
Now get out.

249
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,403
Well, l'm sorry that there was a discussion.

250
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,324
But when a company
is planning on spending $50,000,

251
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,159
there needs to be a discussion.

252
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,328
You were all in there talking about it?

253
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,956
Why does it matter
if you have no intention of action?

254
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,084
l don't want them to know l was asked.

255
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,922
Roger Sterling participated
in this discussion?

256
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,799
Yes.

257
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,884
He's a partner.

258
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,097
lf you're against it,
why did you tell me that number?

259
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,307
Sounds like a joke.

260
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,394
Because that may be enough money
to turn your head,

261
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,023
and l wanted a chance to discourage you.

262
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,986
lt is a lot of money, Lane.
lt's four times what l make in a year.

263
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,822
l suppose you wouldn't even be tempted.

264
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,782
Well,

265
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,243
if l were,

266
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,123
l would try to avoid the mistake
that l've made my entire life.

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,251
Every time someone's asked me
what l wanted,

268
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,337
l've never told them the truth.

269
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,881
And what would you want?

270
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,300
Three years ago,

271
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,928
when l was essential
to the future of this firm,

272
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,516
l settled for much less than l needed.

273
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,020
The cash would only cripple the company

274
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,274
and would do very little
to change your future.

275
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,611
But a partnership

276
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,490
yielding a 5% stake in the company itself

277
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,037
could take care of a woman
and a child for a lifetime.

278
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,335
Here l thought you were trying to stop this
because you have feelings for me.

279
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,091
That's why l'm looking out for your interests
over the company's.

280
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,693
"Good night, nobody.

281
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,611
"Good night, mush.

282
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:17,411
"And good night to the old lady
whispering 'hush."'

283
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,836
Hey.

284
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,306
How's it going?

285
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,475
You want to help us out?
Throw some taglines at the wall?

286
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,813
How about,
"Jaguar, it's your problem, not mine."

287
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,151
May l speak with you?

288
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,532
So that's Megan.

289
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,826
Be careful what you say. We're best friends.

290
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,206
So, you're wearing your audition dress.

291
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,125
What are you hoping l can do for you?

292
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,461
You noticed.

293
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,804
l've only bad associations
with letting you leave the house in that.

294
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,309
There's probably 20 girls.
And Julia's coming with me.

295
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,853
Plus, he's a fairy.

296
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,863
So whatever this is, it's not for me.

297
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,953
l want to walk in there with confidence.

298
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,183
l could be in a bikini
and you could paint my body with spots.

299
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,893
Jaguar, try to tame it.

300
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,146
-Don't try and tame it.
-Here, kitty, kitty.

301
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,692
So, she just comes and goes
as she pleases, huh?

302
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,320
Ginsberg. What?

303
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,030
Yeah, l got it.

304
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,129
You can unplug that if you want.

305
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,882
Aren't l interrupting
your routine without me?

306
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,133
Don't be cranky.

307
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,137
l was in a great mood when l left work.

308
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,182
Now l'm just exhausted.

309
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,059
So let's go to bed.

310
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:51,064
lf and when we get Jaguar,
l'm going to need an apartment in the city.

311
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,816
Absolutely not.

312
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,735
lt's an epic poem for me to get home.

313
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,405
And you're dressed for bed at dinner.

314
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,284
Peter, let's stop playing games.

315
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,077
What are you talking about?

316
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,789
l'm tired of competing.
Your love affair with Manhattan is over.

317
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,127
Well, how can you stand living
out here in this cemetery?

318
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,671
There's nothing to do.
There's no good night noises anywhere.

319
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,924
Because l want to raise my child
in the fresh air.

320
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,301
And we should have another on the way.

321
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,553
l mean, it was a miracle the first time
and we're not even trying.

322
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,514
l'm using all my energy
putting my foot down.

323
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,069
lt's 8:00. Where were you?

324
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,614
What's that smell?

325
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,200
The refrigerator is on the fritz.
l had to take everything out.

326
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,744
Did you call someone?

327
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,996
His wife won't let him come here anymore.

328
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,873
l don't want to talk about that.

329
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,376
We can afford to have someone else
fix the refrigerator, for God's sake.

330
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,464
Why won't anyone believe me?
Apolo and l are just friends.

331
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,551
You know what? Just hire someone.

332
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,846
Get a colored girl in here.
They're used to being bossed around.

333
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,974
Do whatever you want.

334
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,644
And what are you doing?

335
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,855
Drying up inside? Because of what? Greg?

336
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,690
l hate him.

337
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,526
l don't want you talking that way
around Kevin.

338
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,863
He's a baby. He doesn't know
that we all wish his father was dead.

339
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,617
Please, stop.

340
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,037
Have you been drinking?

341
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,872
Yes.

342
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,249
Sit down.

343
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,097
Little Murders called.
Four of us got callbacks.

344
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,682
l'm supposed to go meet
the playwright tomorrow.

345
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,976
That's fantastic.

346
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,896
-That's a big deal.
-l know.

347
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,691
You have to promise
you'll come visit every weekend.

348
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,693
You're going to Broadway, not jail.

349
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,364
No, rehearsal starts in Boston in 1 0 days.
Oh, forget it. l'm getting ahead of myself.

350
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,116
Boston?

351
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,869
Yeah, l think there's
eight weeks of rehearsals plus previews.

352
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,791
So you're just gonna leave
for three months?

353
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,335
-lf they want me.
-Well, forget it.

354
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,506
What do you think this is?

355
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:27,470
You think l'm gonna be a singing waitress.
Maybe put on a show in the laundry room?

356
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,180
l have to go to work.

357
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,434
You never thought about it because
you didn't expect me to make it.

358
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,688
This is the way it works. Now you know.

359
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,401
Just keep doing whatever the hell you want.

360
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,366
Please, come in.

361
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,499
You didn't have to make
an appointment, you know.

362
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,751
Yes, l did.

363
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,629
Tell them l want a partnership,

364
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,214
not silent,

365
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,383
comprising 5% of the business.

366
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,721
-Well...
-There's no negotiation.

367
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,309
Okay.

368
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,479
l want documents by the end of the day.

369
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,481
l don't know if that's possible.

370
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,816
Well, l'm not guaranteeing results.

371
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,903
l don't think he'll have trouble performing.
He's quite ardent.

372
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,197
l meant winning the business.

373
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,657
Yes, of course.

374
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,744
So, l have instructions,
but l don't know how this works

375
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,537
in a practical sense.

376
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,082
The presentation's tomorrow, isn't it?

377
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,795
So l just call him and have him call you?

378
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,130
Probably not.

379
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,841
Well, how do l...

380
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,470
Figure something out.
Do l have to do all of it?

381
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,609
Which one is he?

382
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,736
He's not bad.

383
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,364
He's doing this.

384
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,538
Come in.

385
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,540
l know l'm not a manager,

386
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,000
but it's very hard to get things done
with you in another room.

387
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,336
Well, l obviously have the opposite feeling.

388
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,172
Permission to speak freely?

389
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,799
What?

390
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,760
l know you forbid us
from thinking about the mistress,

391
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,596
but l kept imagining the asshole
who's gonna want this car.

392
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,099
Now he's probably already
got a lot of beautiful things.

393
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,351
Or maybe he thinks the car
will help him get them.

394
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,270
So l can go on?

395
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,984
And one way or another,
what he has isn't enough.

396
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,821
So no matter what,
the first idea has got to be

397
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,032
finally, like, you're getting what you wanted.

398
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,078
The copy is still describing
the car as another woman.

399
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,455
But a woman you can't have,

400
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,625
because they have all
the qualities of a Jaguar.

401
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,714
Good-looking, expensive, fast,
and, frankly, not practical.

402
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,592
l've always been fine with all that.

403
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,051
But what's the line?

404
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:19,267
"Jaguar. At last, something beautiful
you can truly own."

405
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,405
So he threw the money in your face?

406
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,533
l don't even want to talk about it.

407
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,247
l've never had more responsibility.
l'm on everything but Jaguar.

408
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,167
l worked on Plymouth at N. W. Ayer.

409
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,252
Car guys are a bunch of creeps.

410
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,421
They're all a bunch of creeps.

411
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,924
Could l get some more coffee?

412
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,844
l can never tell, ballerina,

413
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,096
if you're ambitious
or you just like to complain.

414
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,807
Why can't it be both?

415
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,394
Well, if this was about work
and not feelings,

416
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,562
you'd make a move.

417
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,773
You're right.

418
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,692
l could take a couple of meetings

419
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,861
and get an offer
and throw that in Don's face.

420
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,031
Or you can do what everybody else does.

421
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,784
Have a bunch of meetings,
pick a place and leave.

422
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,911
Don't think l haven't thought about it.

423
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,749
Well, you'd get to find out
if you could shine elsewhere.

424
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,126
And l know you can.

425
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:31,506
And you'd let him know that
you're not some secretary from Brooklyn

426
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,383
who's dying to help out.

427
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,806
l don't know if l can do that.

428
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,309
Sure, you could.
You could hire a headhunter

429
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,272
or you could buy a friend a piece of pie.

430
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,527
Of course, if you do move,

431
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,697
you can't complain
if l gave Draper a call on my own behalf.

432
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,573
What if Don finds out you helped me?

433
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,826
Don's a big boy.

434
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,830
lf he was having this conversation with you
and he wasn't the subject of it,

435
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,832
he'd tell you to leave in a second.

436
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,212
Thanks.

437
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,927
l've seen the campaign
and it's something l couldn't have imagined,

438
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,637
yet exactly what l expected.

439
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,306
Thank you.

440
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,266
And l want you to present
in the fullest confidence.

441
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,518
l think it's a winner.

442
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:31,190
Well, all l wanted to say was
we've removed all other impediments.

443
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,901
But you do know,
no matter what else goes on,

444
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,321
it's the creative that's going to win this.

445
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,158
Close the door.

446
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,202
lt was four to zero.

447
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,455
You abstained in absentia.

448
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,292
The conversation doesn't end
just because you leave the room.

449
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,752
What did you promise her?

450
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,338
A 5% stake as a voting partner.

451
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,090
Dawn, could you buzz Mrs. Harris?

452
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:57,884
She's not here.

453
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,679
Actually, Dawn, could you get my things?

454
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,641
Yes, you should be well rested.

455
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,103
l don't want it like this.

456
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,731
lt was her idea.

457
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,655
Hello.

458
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,867
Hello. l'm Don Draper.
l work with Joan. ls she in?

459
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,827
Yes, of course. Please come in.

460
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:31,876
What?

461
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,595
She'll be right with you.

462
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,765
-l should take your coat.
-l won't be long.

463
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,480
Well, l will leave you two alone.

464
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,153
l'm really sorry to bother you
if this is a bad time.

465
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,740
Well, l was just stepping into the shower,
but how can l help you?

466
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,244
l wanted to tell you that it's not worth it.

467
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,705
And if we don't get Jaguar, so what?

468
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,084
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

469
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,801
l was told everyone was on board.

470
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,139
l said no and they voted
when l left the room.

471
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,644
You're a good one, aren't you?

472
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,855
So you understand what l'm saying?

473
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,733
Yes, l do.

474
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,320
l'm all right.

475
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,448
And thank you.

476
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,535
So you have a nice night,
and l'm gonna go prepare.

477
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,132
-Say good night to your friend.
-Good luck tomorrow.

478
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,863
You must get tired of hearing
what a beautiful thing this car is.

479
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,283
But l've met a lot
of beautiful women in my life.

480
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,370
And despite their protestations,
they never tire of hearing it.

481
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:38,461
But when deep beauty is encountered,
it arouses deep emotions

482
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,215
because it creates a desire,

483
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,344
because it is, by nature, unattainable.

484
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,554
You look radiant, Joan.

485
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,057
May l call you Joan? l'm Herb, by the way.

486
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,559
Well, l should hope so.

487
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,313
We're taught to think
that function is all that matters.

488
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,734
But we have a natural longing
for this other thing.

489
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,239
l got you a little something.

490
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,916
l thought a woman with your complexion
would look good in emerald.

491
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,126
When l was driving the E-Type,

492
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,587
l passed a 1 0-year-old boy
in the back window of a station wagon

493
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,381
and l watched his eyes follow.

494
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:27,718
He'd just seen something he would want
for the rest of his life.

495
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:33,599
l feel like a sultan ofAraby
and my tent is graced with Helen of Troy.

496
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,311
Those are two different stories.

497
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:41,774
He'd just seen that unattainable object
speed by just out of reach.

498
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,902
Because they do that, don't they?

499
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,113
Beautiful things.

500
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,618
You know, l don't know how much longer
l can restrain myself.

501
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,954
Let me see them.

502
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:21,647
Then l thought about a man of some means
reading Playboy or Esquire.

503
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:27,111
And flipping past the flesh
to the shiny painted curves of this car.

504
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,865
There was no effort to stop his eye.

505
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,827
The difference is he can have a Jaguar.

506
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:41,167
Well, thank you for a wonderful time.

507
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,712
You're a hell of a gal.

508
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,174
Oh, this car,

509
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,302
this thing, gentlemen,

510
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,472
what price would we pay?

511
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,932
What behavior would we forgive?

512
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,437
lf they weren't pretty,
if they weren't temperamental,

513
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:05,274
if they weren't beyond our reach
and a little out of our control,

514
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,193
would we love them like we do?

515
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,030
"Jaguar.

516
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:16,285
"At last, something beautiful
you can truly own."

517
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,051
What?

518
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,553
Mr. Draper is here to see you.

519
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,555
Why'd you tell him l was here?

520
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,350
He's your boss. You should see him.

521
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,701
Well, l will leave you two alone.

522
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,416
l'm really sorry to bother you
if this is a bad time.

523
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,919
Well, l was just stepping into the shower,
but how can l help you?

524
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,922
l wanted to tell you that it's not worth it.

525
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,050
And if we don't get Jaguar, so what?

526
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,262
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

527
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,895
How'd it go?

528
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,774
-We'll see.
-lt was one of his good ones.

529
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,946
-Come have a drink?
-Maybe later.

530
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,214
-Where are you from?
-New York.

531
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,428
Turn around, please.

532
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,640
Could you step forward, sweetheart,
and turn around, please?

533
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,240
You know, l would have
taken you anywhere.

534
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,618
Well, no one comes in here.
The food's too bad.

535
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,953
We're not actually gonna eat here, are we?

536
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,538
l'm not hungry.

537
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,415
Freddy Rumsen says you are.

538
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,169
And so does Tom Vogel.
You know we have Clearasil.

539
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,880
ln fact, he sung your praises

540
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,591
while he was yelling at me
that the work wasn't as good anymore.

541
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,844
That was my first account.

542
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,181
Everybody else is gonna want to know
if you're married

543
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,350
or planning on having a baby.

544
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,228
And then they're gonna want to know
how much you want to be paid.

545
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,438
But all l want to know is,

546
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,483
you must have heard
some pretty terrible things about me

547
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,026
from Don Draper's mouth.

548
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,737
But why would you want
to play for the other team?

549
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,365
lt's not a game.

550
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,617
lt's my career.

551
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,036
Look, l need a writer.

552
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,455
They don't have to be like me, but...

553
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,833
Do you know anything
about Ralph Waldo Emerson?

554
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,711
From school.

555
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,465
He said that you have to be
a transparent eyeball.

556
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,593
What he meant was,
you have to take in the world

557
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,719
and pass it through you.

558
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,139
l am tired of people who treat this like math.

559
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,018
l looked at your book and l saw somebody

560
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,230
who was writing like
every product was for them.

561
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:35,985
No clichés, no homilies, no formula.

562
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,196
Well, l had a lot of help.

563
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,490
Everybody does.

564
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,285
So l lied to you.

565
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,204
What do you want to get paid?

566
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,173
Freddy tell you to do this?

567
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,478
You already know you want to go.

568
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,273
You know how much you'll do it for.

569
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,984
And you didn't make me wait.

570
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,279
l'm going do you the same favor.

571
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,584
lf this is your last meeting.

572
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,132
l think l need a chocolate shake.

573
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,971
First day of work ends with
you and me at La Caravelle.

574
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,811
-You're here.
-l'm here.

575
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,816
How'd it go?

576
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,745
How did yours go?

577
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,206
We're waiting to hear.

578
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,500
l bet you were great.

579
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,877
l bet you were, too.

580
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,091
-The difference is l want you to get it.
-Stop it.

581
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,468
Well, you get to disappear for work
whenever you want.

582
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,681
And if l have to choose
between you and that,

583
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,058
l'll choose you.

584
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,521
But l'll hate you for it.

585
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,399
You know l don't want you to fail.

586
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,858
Good.

587
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,361
Because l'm not going to.

588
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,286
Don't run away like that.

589
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,301
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

590
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,304
Miss Olson wants to see you.

591
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,890
Peggy, come on in.

592
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,396
-D'Arcy's out.
-Says who?

593
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,941
Arthur's girl told me on the QT.
She said he was in his office crying.

594
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,694
Jaguar is calling
the president of every agency.

595
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,363
-Dancerjust got a big "No, thanks."
-D'Arcy is out, too.

596
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,205
Get the partners in my office
and wait for further instructions.

597
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,962
Roger Sterling's office.

598
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,757
l want all the partners here.

599
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,341
You can't leave him on hold.

600
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,676
Where's Pete?

601
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,929
Just answer it.

602
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,395
Hello? Hugh, how are you this morning?

603
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,274
l'm glad to hear that. We like him, too.

604
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:07,071
-Well, that is terrific news.
-Bravo.

605
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,031
-This is spectacular.
-Great.

606
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,159
We'll be over this afternoon
to kiss the bride.

607
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,287
He said it wasn't even close.

608
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,713
-Well, congratulations to everyone.
-We got to get champagne.

609
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,673
l promise you they're opening it right now.

610
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,635
Before everybody's too drunk,
l need a list of names.

611
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,721
l promised them we'd staff up immediately
and we're going over there today.

612
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:36,016
Can't we wait to see what
the scope of the campaign will be?

613
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:41,188
ls this about the bonuses again?
There are no bonuses this year.

614
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,107
Now, next year...

615
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,280
Joan, shall we address the men?

616
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,803
Congratulations.

617
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,847
You wanted to talk to me?

618
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,974
You're not busy?

619
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,352
l'm not in the mood.

620
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,313
You really have no idea
when things are good, do you?

621
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,080
l swear, l don't really need to talk right now.

622
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,832
Drink with me.

623
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,256
l have to talk about
something kind of serious.

624
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,886
l can't put a girl on Jaguar.

625
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,139
These car guys...

626
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,391
l just can't.

627
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,935
-But, you know...
-lt's not that.

628
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,354
ls this about Joan being made partner?

629
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,231
What?

630
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,150
The circumstances...

631
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,486
She's been with us 1 3 years.

632
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,042
l want you to know that

633
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,587
the day you saw something in me

634
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,090
my whole life changed.

635
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,179
And since then, it's been my privilege

636
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:43,185
to not only be at your side,
but to be treated like a protégée

637
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,522
and for you to be my mentor
and my champion.

638
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,654
But?

639
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,322
But

640
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,867
l think l've reached a point

641
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,620
where it's time for me
to have a new experience.

642
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,705
Really?

643
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,958
l'm giving my notice.

644
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,794
l've accepted another offer.

645
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,132
-Are you done?
-l'm giving the customary two weeks.

646
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,802
My last day will be the third.

647
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,846
-And don't think...
-Hold on.

648
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,478
lt's been crazy around here
and l know l've been taking you for granted.

649
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,438
And, frankly, l'm impressed.

650
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,485
You finally picked the right moment
to ask for a raise.

651
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,530
lt's time for me to move on.

652
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,490
Come on.

653
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:40,951
l'm serious.

654
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:47,916
You're serious?

655
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,168
lt wasn't easy.

656
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,337
l'm sure it wasn't.

657
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,341
Well, good for you. Where are you going?

658
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,177
Cutler Gleason and Chaough.

659
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,392
Perfect.

660
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,229
Okay.

661
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,650
Well, let's pretend l'm not responsible

662
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:17,487
for every single good thing
that's ever happened to you,

663
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,449
and you tell me the number or make one up

664
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,492
and l'll beat it.

665
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,036
There's no number.

666
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,954
There's no number?

667
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,081
How long do you want to play this out?

668
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,625
l'm sorry,

669
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,588
but you know this is what you would do.

670
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,053
You don't need to wait until the third.

671
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,014
l've got a room full of freelancers out there.

672
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,724
l'll get by.

673
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,645
l understand.

674
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,300
Don't be a stranger.
