1
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,629
You sound terribIe.

2
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,007
You even Iook terribIe.

3
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,426
You don't.

4
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,179
I'm going to stand over here.

5
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,307
Fine, if you think you'II be safe
over there by yourseIf.

6
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:00,977
Going up.

7
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,104
So am I. Thank you.

8
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,940
My God, Don!

9
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,276
My bad penny.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,112
Andrea, this is my wife, Megan.

11
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,448
Megan, this is Andrea.

12
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,951
She's a freeIance writer from the oId firm.

13
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,080
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes, you as weII.

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,127
WeII, goodbye.

15
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,087
It was nice meeting you.

16
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,762
-Look...
-You Iook.

17
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,054
How many times is this going to happen?

18
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,599
What? I worked with her six years ago.

19
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,684
We're in Midtown.
I'm going to run into peopIe.

20
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,144
You know, there are some parts of town

21
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,314
where we can
run into some peopIe I worked with.

22
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,033
AII they care about
is that they're see-through.

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,952
Why is transparency
desirabIe in pantyhose?

24
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,079
I can see fine.

25
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,539
You want to get in here with me?

26
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,666
-HeIIo, Pegasus.
-Hey, you.

27
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,753
-You have to Iet me announce you.
-Go ahead.

28
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,880
HeIIo, StanIey, Ginso.

29
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,341
I have amazing photos.

30
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,261
Crime scene snaps from
Chicago's student nurse massacre.

31
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,680
-Not suitabIe for pubIication.
-What?

32
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,312
Oh, my God!

33
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,482
I'm teIIing you, you're upset over nothing.

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,943
-You're making it worse. I'II get over it.
-Megan.

35
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm fine.

36
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,531
You shouId be.

37
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,871
-They Iook Iike rag doIIs.
-Were they raped?

38
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,832
They don't know,
but a coupIe of these are naked.

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,959
It went on for hours.

40
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,962
-The rest just waited.
-They were tied up.

41
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,130
I'm sorry I'm Iate.

42
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,633
Megan. I've got some pictures.

43
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,969
Ginsberg, you got to see these.

44
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,721
I'II see you Iater.

45
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,682
And I'II see you Iater.

46
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,477
The sex murders in Chicago.
The student nurses.

47
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,728
-ReaIIy?
-Take it.

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,153
-Oh, my God!
-Look at the bottom row.

49
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,950
I think this is going to make the cover,
not the riots.

50
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,034
ReaIIy?

51
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,495
Yeah, we did the riots this week.
Watts a year Iater.

52
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,372
PIus, there have been five riots this summer.

53
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:30,084
I say it's better than even money
Mr. Luce finds a tastefuI way to do this.

54
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,752
You know what? Put it away. It's disgusting.

55
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,714
It's one of those things I wish I didn't see.
And why are you Iaughing?

56
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,384
-We're not Iaughing.
-No, you're excited by it.

57
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,136
Some girI trussed up Iike a cut of meat?

58
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,097
Eight girIs, but nine were kidnapped.

59
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,640
One survived.

60
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,727
I onIy am escaped aIone to teII thee.

61
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,937
How did she do that?

62
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,149
She hid under the bed. He Iost count.

63
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,444
You know what?

64
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,695
You're sickos.

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,530
MichaeI.

66
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,243
He's right.

67
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,960
It's been 25 minutes. It's not even set.

68
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,837
I toId you the jets are cIogged.

69
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,589
Give me some money. I'II go to the bakery.

70
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,217
And we need to get beer.
Greg Iikes Schaefer. Do we have time?

71
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,012
Not if you want me to
get the baby out of here by noon.

72
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,598
Why? He's going to want
to see Kevin more than me.

73
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,143
That's what he's going to say,
but he's going to want you right away.

74
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,396
Let me go get my purse.
You're making me very anxious right now.

75
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,024
It's okay to be anxious. It's normaI.

76
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,486
Everything's going to be
unfamiIiar for both of you.

77
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,197
And who knows what he's seen?
Who knows what he's done?

78
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,407
He's a surgeon. He wasn't in combat.

79
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,493
He saw the same things there he saw here.

80
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,080
WeII, there are other things that happen
when men are away, especiaIIy at war.

81
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,247
Stop it.

82
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,834
Stop taIking about men in generaI,
when I know it's aII about Daddy.

83
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,756
Even if there haven't been other women,
he's not used to Iistening to a woman.

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,843
It's just the idea of coming home
and finding a IittIe hoIe in his Iife

85
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,597
and sticking his eIbow through
untiI he can waIk aII the way in.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,308
I know.

87
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,688
And that's why I want to start
with him seeing his son for the first time.

88
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,815
He'II know how to do that.

89
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,317
You're right.

90
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,194
Do you reaIIy want a cake?

91
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,321
Because it's going to take me a whiIe
to get dressed.

92
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,739
CouId you?

93
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,869
Your daughter's on line one.

94
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,456
HeIIo, sweetheart. What's the matter?

95
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,501
Grandma PauIine is stiII here and I hate her.

96
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,670
Stay out of her way.

97
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,338
Your mother wiII be back Friday morning.

98
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,799
It is Friday morning.

99
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,803
Someone caIIed on Henry's phone and said
that they couIdn't get an airpIane fIight,

100
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,556
so someone's driving them back
from BuffaIo tonight.

101
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,975
You'd think Henry couId get a fIight.

102
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,477
I know. He's so important.

103
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,814
They call Bobby all the time
in sleepaway camp.

104
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,900
I guess if I was peeing in my pants,
they might want to say hi.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,485
That's not nice.

106
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,280
Grandma Pauline wears so much perfume.

107
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,615
Every time she comes near me,
l want to barf.

108
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,743
And you know what eIse?

109
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,036
She doesn't beIieve me,

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,914
that I'm aIIowed to watch as much TV
as I want because it's the summer.

111
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,833
Your mother Iets you do that?

112
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,793
I'm on vacation.

113
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,840
I think the best thing is for you to
go out in the fresh air and get some sun.

114
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,092
I did. It's reaIIy hot.

115
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,889
Stop compIaining. I don't want you
to get rickets in that haunted mansion.

116
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,016
I'II see you next weekend.

117
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,143
How are you?

118
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,522
I have a coId,
but you've made me feeI better.

119
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,940
Can't you come get me?

120
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,443
No. And don't ask again.

121
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,320
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,575
Are you sick?

123
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,035
I'm great. Let's go.

124
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,873
So, it starts with Ken Cosgrove cIimbing
out of the muck and waIking on dry Iand.

125
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,125
He says a bunch of nice stuff
about Ginsberg and you.

126
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,212
I toId him not to use the word "genius"
about either of us.

127
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,381
A woman and her secrets.

128
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,258
The things she'II never teII,

129
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,512
Iike how Iong it took her to get ready
or the reason she's smiIing.

130
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,222
A good-Iooking woman at a party.

131
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,641
And where she got those incredibIe shoes.

132
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,851
Another woman, not too catty, says,

133
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,728
"I Iove your shoes.
Where did you get them?"

134
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,773
We hoId on five seconds of her
showing off the shoe from the caIf down,

135
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,819
and this girI's Iegs wiII be spectacuIar.
And, yes, you can come to casting.

136
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,577
That's pIenty.

137
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,038
Are you kidding? I'm ready to take off here.

138
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,374
I just wanted to hear the tone of your voice

139
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,127
so I can make sure it's not as annoying
as it is in everyday Iife.

140
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,380
It's caIIed a regionaI accent.
And beIieve it or not, you've got one, too.

141
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,923
We can't aII sound Iike WaIter Cronkite.

142
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,260
Do you Iike this?
I never saw boards for the CindereIIa thing.

143
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,513
WeII, you kiIIed it, and for good reason.
CindereIIa and shoes is a cIiché.

144
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,597
You couId have TB.

145
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,975
SIeeping Beauty? Snow White?
Nothing worked?

146
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,727
They're more about necrophiIia than shoes.

147
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,230
It's footwear. Don't make that mistake.

148
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,672
-Oh, my God! You're so skinny.
-So are you.

149
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,883
Somebody wants to say heIIo.

150
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,219
Jesus, is that him?

151
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,560
HoIy crap, Iook at him!

152
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,938
Joanie, I'II get that.

153
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,817
You have your hands fuII.

154
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,945
We thought your fIight might be Iate
because of the strike.

155
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,324
Yeah, we picked up some foIks in HonoIuIu
who had been stranded,

156
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,783
but everything was fine.

157
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,582
GaiI, go get the Brownie.

158
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,626
I don't think we have any fiIm.

159
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,377
You know what?

160
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:10,049
I'II take Kevin and go get some,
so you two can visit a speII.

161
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,843
Okay, that's a good idea.

162
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,972
You have suppIies in case
you have to be gone for a whiIe?

163
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,807
I have everything.

164
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,938
And so do you, Greg.

165
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,075
Get over here.

166
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,630
Where have you been?

167
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,466
Out in the wiIderness, baby.

168
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,231
-What are you doing?
-Looking for Aspirin.

169
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,067
-Why don't you have Dawn do it?
-I'm embarrassed.

170
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,195
I've eaten up a bottIe since she's been here.

171
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,323
My husband's an Aspirin addict.
I'm so ashamed.

172
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,915
You're very warm. I'm sending you home.

173
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,546
I'm sorry about this morning.

174
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,173
It couIdn't be avoided.

175
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,765
It was a Iong time ago and I was unhappy.

176
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,518
Because you were married.

177
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,063
It's fine. It's just embarrassing.

178
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,150
Why shouId you be embarrassed?

179
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,651
SeriousIy?

180
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,030
Because you're married to me now.

181
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,785
And after AIIison and Faye MiIIer
and who knows how many more...

182
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,287
I was divorced.

183
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,706
And now you're not.

184
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,961
And that kind of careIess appetite,

185
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,047
you can't bIame that on Betty.

186
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,049
I teII you, Iet it go.

187
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,467
You brought it up.

188
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,593
No, I didn't.

189
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,094
You did.

190
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,266
And aII I can think is you feeI guiIty,
which makes it worse than I thought.

191
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,480
I married you.

192
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,899
And I'm going to be with you untiI I die...

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,402
Which couId be this afternoon.

194
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,614
Is this reaIIy how you want to spend
my Iast hours on Earth?

195
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,241
Sweetie, go home.

196
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,661
I have to go to this meeting
so I can skip the next two.

197
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,416
At Ieast go Iie down.

198
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,266
Eat your sandwich.

199
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,977
I'm not hungry.

200
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,814
My Lord!

201
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,733
-Those poor souIs.
-What?

202
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,902
Nothing.

203
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,740
Some things are not for chiIdren.

204
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,451
Mommy Iets me watch the news.

205
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,832
You demanded tuna saIad,
so you're going to sit there untiI you eat it.

206
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,667
It has reIish in it.

207
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,502
You haven't even tasted it.

208
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,631
You hurt my hand.

209
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,844
WeII, I shouIdn't have done that. I'm sorry.

210
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,764
But you have to be respectfuI.
I know your mother has other ruIes.

211
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,892
-She doesn't have ruIes.
-I don't beIieve that,

212
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,396
but I beIieve that she may be distracted.

213
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,192
And I am sure she wouId be sick
if she knew how you were behaving.

214
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,320
Now you're going to finish that sandwich,
crusts and aII.

215
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,281
I don't care if it takes aII day.

216
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,752
How'd you sIeep?

217
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,505
Very weII, thank you.

218
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,841
What are you doing?

219
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,885
He's making Iunch. He won't Iisten.

220
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,762
Greg, honey, I have steak.
Mom bought a cake.

221
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,515
BeIieve it or not, I had steak in Vietnam.

222
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,933
I did not have boIogna.

223
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,020
And I'II have veaI tonight with my foIks.

224
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,773
What are the three of you up to?

225
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,610
I'm showing Kevin
how good I am with my hands.

226
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,737
We were taIking about the riots.

227
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,073
PIenty of Negroes in Saigon
and they're pIenty brave.

228
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,367
I think we shouId have a ruIe that

229
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,162
you have to wear your uniform
aII the time when you're home.

230
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,708
GaiI, is there a chance
you couId pick up more beer?

231
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,084
Of course.

232
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,338
I wanted to get the afternoon paper anyway.

233
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,639
Thank you so much, Mom.

234
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,226
We'II be back in time for dinner.

235
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,276
You Iook incredibIe, you know?

236
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,237
Thank you.

237
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,573
I need to teII you something.

238
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,456
Greg, if something happened over there and
you feeI the need to teII me, you shouIdn't.

239
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,419
And if you do, you certainIy shouIdn't
ask me to hoId your hand.

240
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,213
What? No.

241
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,423
No, it's not that.

242
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,346
Listen, Joanie,
there's been a change of pIans.

243
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,597
I have to go back.

244
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,517
-I know, for another 40 days.
-No,

245
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,519
for a year.

246
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,104
What?

247
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,524
It was one year here and one year there.
That's what they toId you.

248
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,819
Look, I know you're hearing a Iot of horribIe
things about what's going on over there.

249
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,280
It couIdn't be further from the truth.
You don't need to worry.

250
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,491
You did your part. They're a bunch of Iiars.

251
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,702
Nobody Iied to anybody.

252
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,704
It's more compIicated. It's war.

253
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:19,209
It doesn't stop for our pIans.
And I've come to terms with that.

254
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,170
Now we have 1 0 days together.
Let's not waste it.

255
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,218
I need to store up
as much of you as possibIe.

256
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,141
And, yes, you can come to casting.

257
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,520
And you think it sounds good,
wait tiII you see it in print.

258
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,860
"You'II never teII. They'II never be abIe to."

259
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,239
I don't know. What do you think, Mr. ButIer?

260
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,575
I think Ken was right. You're a genius.

261
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,080
Square-on strategy.

262
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,749
I think the boys did a good job.

263
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,460
The girI shouId be European-Iooking.

264
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,045
Maybe get a French girI.

265
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,422
Great.

266
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,506
So?

267
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,176
SoId.

268
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,808
I have to teII you, young man,
you reaIIy know women.

269
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,061
I've never heard that before.

270
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,563
This reaIIy gets inside their heads.

271
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,650
WeII, to teII you the truth, they confuse me.

272
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,694
I mean, I keep thinking about CindereIIa.

273
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,073
We were going to come in here
and taIk about CindereIIa, but it's too dark.

274
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,157
ReaIIy?

275
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,701
We were kind of hoping for it.

276
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,412
Nah, I don't think so.

277
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,706
I mean, she's running down
this dark side street.

278
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:44,211
And it's outside a castIe, so
it's got those waIIs and the cobbIestones.

279
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:48,465
And she's running, but she's onIy got this
one incredibIe shoe for her incredibIe gown,

280
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,842
so she's hobbIing, wounded prey.

281
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,180
She can hear him behind her,
his measured footsteps catching up.

282
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,391
She turns a corner.

283
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,060
Those big shadows.

284
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,021
And she's scared.

285
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,149
And then she feeIs a hand on her shouIder
and she turns around.

286
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,404
And it doesn't matter what he Iooks Iike,

287
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,907
he's handsome at that moment
offering her her shoe.

288
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,993
She takes it.

289
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,080
She knows she's not safe,
but she doesn't care.

290
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,875
I guess we know in the end

291
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,877
she wants to be caught.

292
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,297
See? It's too dark.

293
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,428
Why don't we do that?

294
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,555
The man said soId.

295
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,724
You wanted CindereIIa anyway.
You forgot that.

296
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,308
No, I said it was a cIiché.

297
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,935
That's because you thought
they wouIdn't Iike it,

298
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,353
but in your heart, you knew it was good.

299
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,398
In my heart, I'm on the verge
of throwing you in front of a cab.

300
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,275
Okay.

301
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,569
So however proud of yourseIf
you're feeIing right now,

302
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,780
just know that everything I'm saying
has "or eIse" after it.

303
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,575
Don't do that again.

304
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,452
Think of those ideas in front of me.

305
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,412
Don't do that again.

306
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,248
I gotta make a caII.

307
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,211
He's such a decent guy.

308
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,882
You know you aImost got fired just now.

309
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't think you're right about that.

310
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,010
I'm positive.

311
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,597
Mr. Draper is on line one.

312
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,308
HeIIo. How'd it go?

313
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,477
Good. What are you up to?

314
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,896
I'm keeping your chair warm.

315
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,315
So I'II swing by and get you in an hour?

316
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,359
WeII, why don't you just go home,
cIimb into bed?

317
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,362
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

318
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,782
I onIy need another coupIe of hours.

319
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:37,866
And, Don,

320
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,910
no smoking.

321
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:16,112
Mohawk says that L.B.J. is scared
of forcing the mechanics to arbitration

322
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,741
because he has midterm eIections and
he's worried about Iosing the Iabor vote.

323
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,953
-That's good news.
-Yes, it is.

324
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,080
The strike's going to go on
for at Ieast a coupIe more weeks

325
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,499
and Mohawk can sop up aII the extra routes.

326
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,586
So, they want us to waIk them through
the campaign first thing Monday morning.

327
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,671
A phone caII wiII do.

328
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,465
The campaign, of course.

329
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,883
We're ready to go.

330
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,178
Have a good weekend.

331
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,392
Damn it.

332
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,733
-Good night, everyone, CIara.
-Good night, Mr. CampbeII.

333
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,824
Where's Ginsberg?

334
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,119
He's probabIy everywhere
after Don scattered his ashes.

335
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,330
ApparentIy he went haywire
in the presentation downstairs.

336
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,540
I don't care. CaII him.

337
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,166
I just did. He's not home.

338
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,543
Is he coming back?

339
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,046
You know what?
I'm going to go out there and find him.

340
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,007
I'm going to start with the whoIe worId

341
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,593
and then I'm going to
eventuaIIy check my apartment.

342
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,725
What are you doing tonight?

343
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,977
I don't know. What did you have in mind?

344
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,146
Are you drunk? Get your feet off that desk.

345
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,233
I need you to work up something
for Mohawk.

346
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,737
Oh, I'm sorry.
For Mohawk, your "man" is Ginsberg.

347
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,782
Let's say you were to do this for me,

348
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:47,704
and on Monday you expIain to
Ginsberg and CampbeII that I asked you to...

349
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,415
OnIy I asked you sometime Iast week.

350
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,169
Do you have a brief?

351
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,421
Did Ginsberg have a brief?

352
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,008
I never toId Ginsberg, okay?
You have to remember that.

353
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,303
You know about the airIine strike, right?

354
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,680
Yes. Why is Mohawk stiII fIying?

355
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,933
Because even though
aII the other mechanics are on strike...

356
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,976
They need more wrenches or something.

357
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,479
...Mohawk's mechanics have a side deaI,
so they have to keep working.

358
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,064
They must Iove that.

359
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,565
Yeah, weII,
they're going to Iove the overtime.

360
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,108
American AirIines is taking everything big

361
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,361
and giving their northeast corridor
to Mohawk.

362
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,738
So what do you want?

363
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,951
How about something Iike, "Mohawk,
breaking the strike one fIight at a time"?

364
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,245
Or maybe,
"FIy over the picket Iine with Mohawk"?

365
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,665
Hey, Trotsky, you're in advertising.

366
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,584
Fine. So what's the angIe?

367
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,755
CampbeII or I had this idea that
it wouId be something about,

368
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,468
you know, how times are tough
and you can't get anywhere.

369
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,845
So thank God,
Mohawk is offering emergency service.

370
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,847
You don't want to use the word "emergency"
with an airpIane.

371
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,350
I don't want to do any of this.
I'II see you Monday.

372
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,268
HoId on a second.

373
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,647
You want me to work up
an entire corporate image campaign for $1 0?

374
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,941
I can make you do it for nothing.
I'm the boss.

375
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,487
You're right. The work is $1 0, the Iie is extra.

376
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,824
IncredibIe.
What do you make a week, sweetheart?

377
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,160
You don't know, huh? That's heIpfuI.

378
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,745
You know, I couId fire you.

379
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,124
Great. There are some portfoIios
in Joan's office.

380
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,625
Maybe you couId find somebody tonight.

381
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,794
Why are you doing this to me?

382
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:22,132
Because you're being very demanding
for someone who has no other choice.

383
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,050
DazzIe me.

384
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,469
Fine.

385
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,554
How much you want?

386
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,055
How much you got?

387
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,230
-$400.
-Give me aII of it.

388
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,565
Jesus!

389
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,152
It better be good.

390
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,320
Do you want me to take your watch?

391
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,118
I'm on my way out. Are you staying?

392
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,453
HeIIo. Good night.

393
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:56,166
Yeah. Something came up.
WouId you teII Patricia she can go home?

394
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Okay.

395
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,981
Get in here.

396
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,360
-What are you doing here?
-We didn't get to taIk.

397
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,738
We've done aII the taIking
we're ever going to do.

398
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,115
Are you okay?

399
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,242
How the heII did you get in here?

400
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,369
I have a way with doormen.

401
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,662
I have some bad news for you.

402
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,040
You can either take the steps
or you can go off the baIcony,

403
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,460
because if you run into my wife on the way
out of here, you're going to wish you had.

404
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:42,962
ForcefuI.

405
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,132
My, oh, my!

406
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,637
Everybody probabIy thinks that she did this,
but I know it was you.

407
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,474
You reaIIy shouId go. I gotta Iie down.

408
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,061
I'II take the steps.

409
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,523
You know what, take the service eIevator.

410
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,989
Goodbye. I'm sorry.
You've gotta understand.

411
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,241
Are you okay?

412
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,451
PIease, you have to go.

413
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,621
It was just sex. It doesn't mean anything.

414
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,665
I'm sorry. I've gotta Iie down.

415
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,724
He's here! My mystery date...

416
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,190
The girI under the bed...

417
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,694
I'd be surprised if she couId ever taIk again.

418
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,575
That poor thing, paraIyzed with fear

419
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,203
whiIe he opened that door eight times,

420
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,205
and dragged another one out.

421
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:00,707
And that...

422
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:09,132
No, as much as I'd Iove to go, I can't make
any pIans untiI they waItz through that door.

423
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,472
You need to take out the trash.

424
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,057
Right now?

425
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,106
Take out the trash
or you can go to bed right now,

426
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,901
watch the sun set
from your bedroom window.

427
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,153
It's the saddest thing in the worId.

428
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,072
If I take out the trash,
wiII you teII me about the murder?

429
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,492
No. I wiII not bargain with you.

430
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,746
How oId are you?

431
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,874
That's something we girIs keep to ourseIves.

432
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,585
Was your mom strict?

433
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,671
No, but my father was
and I'm a better person for it.

434
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,218
I know you don't think so,
but I'm a good person.

435
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,387
SaIIy, I just think someone in your worId
needs to discipIine you

436
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,182
so you can start acting Iike an aduIt.

437
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,600
My father.

438
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:06,606
I remember one time he was sIeeping on the
couch in the Iiving room and I waIked by.

439
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,399
And aII of a sudden, out of nowhere,

440
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:13,863
he kicked me so hard that I actuaIIy fIew
across the room and hit a piece of furniture.

441
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,618
And then he Iooked at me and he said,
"That's for nothing, so Iook out."

442
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,120
That's not very nice.

443
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,122
No,

444
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,959
but it was vaIuabIe advice.

445
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,093
When in doubt,
go with the most expensive, right, Pops?

446
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,595
I don't want any wine.

447
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,598
Okay, can we aII cheer up, pIease?

448
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:45,895
We're together, I have a new baby boy,
not to mention this pIace costs a fortune.

449
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,690
So how are we starting? The IoveIy signora?

450
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,024
I'II have a gin fizz.

451
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,860
Everybody eIse is having wine,
but you have to give me a second.

452
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,158
-How are you doing?
-Can't compIain.

453
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:00,702
Enjoy yourseIf.

454
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,829
Thank you. You, too, sir.

455
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,376
First armored division, Fort Hood.

456
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,836
Do you want me to come back?

457
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,796
No, but you can recommend something.

458
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,174
-Are you in a rush?
-No, it's just that I got a bunch of tabIes.

459
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,177
WeII, I'm sorry if that IittIe
dispIay of respect is sIowing you down,

460
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,723
but a Iot of kids your age wouId be thriIIed
to be waiting tabIes tonight.

461
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,351
I'm sorry, sir. Of course.

462
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,065
This is a nice one.

463
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,526
Thank you. That'd be perfect.

464
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,904
The scampi Iooks very good.

465
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,950
-I'm sorry, this is a painfuI charade.
-Mom, pIease.

466
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,287
I just don't understand it.
Everyone eIse is trying to come home.

467
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,333
Ruth, Greg is facing this with great bravery

468
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,168
and I'm proud of him.

469
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,963
He did his time.
You've got to taIk him out of it.

470
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,258
Mom, I don't want your grandson
hearing this argument.

471
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,385
Joe, you were in the service.

472
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,513
Can't you write a Ietter to your congressman
and teII him he's got a famiIy?

473
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,351
Why? Is some congressman
going to taIk him out of going back?

474
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,727
I don't understand.

475
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,271
I'm putting a moratorium
on this conversation.

476
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,524
Now we are either going to have this dinner
that I've been dreaming about for months,

477
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,234
or we can aII go home.

478
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,236
He didn't teII you about it.

479
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,238
Of course not.

480
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,240
What is she taIking about?

481
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,618
Did you have a say in this?

482
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,620
You're a father now.

483
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,581
-What?
-Joanie, caIm down.

484
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,541
You voIunteered?

485
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,295
They need me.

486
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,235
You know, Joanie pIays the accordion.

487
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:29,725
HeIIo?

488
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,661
Is somebody there?

489
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,514
What are you doing?

490
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,682
I feII asIeep.

491
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,561
WeII, it's time to go home.

492
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,646
I wiII, in a bit.

493
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,357
Come on, I don't want to waIk out aIone.

494
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,068
I don't know. I think I'II just stay here.

495
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,987
You can hop in a cab.

496
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,697
I happen to have a Iot of cash for once.

497
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,827
Even if a cab was going to take me, they're
not going to take me past 96th Street.

498
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,455
ReaIIy?

499
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,873
WeII, then, take the subway.

500
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,541
My brother won't Iet me.

501
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,127
You know, with everything
that's happening in Chicago.

502
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,421
WeII, you're not a nurse.

503
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,967
Right.

504
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,552
Is there a riot in HarIem?

505
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,263
There was a thing in Bed-Stuy.

506
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,099
There's a Iot of poIice.

507
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,561
WeII, I know that doesn't make it safer.

508
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,731
My boyfriend's in Chicago.
He's covering the riots.

509
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,442
Is that right?

510
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,529
Why don't you stay with me tonight?

511
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,075
I've stayed here before. I'II be fine.

512
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,786
Get your things.

513
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,711
Are you asIeep?

514
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,589
You're home.

515
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,262
You're mumbIing.

516
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,307
How the heII did you get in here?

517
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,184
I was worried about you.

518
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,186
You Ieft the back door unIocked.

519
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,189
-Why can't you Ieave me aIone?
-I can't.

520
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,108
You have to.

521
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,402
We're aIone.

522
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,738
I just want it fast.

523
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,033
No.

524
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,203
I know she's coming home.

525
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,956
I'II be gone. I promise.

526
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,126
Andrea.

527
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,049
I can feeI you against me.

528
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:14,056
Remember that night at LincoIn Center when
you took me back to the Ioading dock?

529
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,975
Your wife was waiting inside.

530
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,049
So it's just me, my brother, who's 1 9,
and my mother, who says she's 39.

531
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,550
Like Jack Benny.

532
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,303
Is your brother in schooI?

533
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:57,224
No, he deIivers furniture and argues
with my mother about joining the Army.

534
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,689
You were saying something in the taxi
about Don and I cut you off.

535
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,858
No, I was finished.

536
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,362
You can taIk to me.

537
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,032
I was his secretary, you know?

538
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,826
You were?

539
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,245
-So how did you...
-I didn't even ask for it.

540
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,709
Sometimes they drag the secretaries in
for focus groups to try things

541
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,920
and I was discovered,

542
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,464
Iike Esther BIodgett.

543
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,137
Oh, God! I'm reaIIy drunk.

544
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,139
Y'aII drink a Iot.

545
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,897
So what were you going to say?

546
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,692
I was going to say...

547
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,194
Go ahead. You can taIk.

548
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,156
-I'm trying to.
-I'm sorry.

549
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:58,077
I was going to say I hope you won't
teII Mr. Draper about me sIeeping there.

550
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,746
You two taIk sometimes.

551
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,708
Nah.

552
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,752
We have to stick together.

553
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,426
I know we're not reaIIy in the same situation,

554
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,680
but I was the onIy one Iike me there
for a Iong time.

555
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,601
I know it's hard.

556
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,312
I appreciate that.

557
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,532
Do you want to be a copywriter?

558
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,826
No. I Iike my job.

559
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,787
Yep.

560
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,958
You're right.

561
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,543
Copywriter's tough,

562
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,630
especiaIIy for a woman.

563
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,137
Do you think I act Iike a man?

564
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,017
I guess you have to a IittIe.

565
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,563
I try, but...

566
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,525
I don't know if I have it in me.

567
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,739
I don't know if I want to.

568
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,848
I'm sorry. I can't sIeep.

569
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,520
WeII, you cannot sneak up on
someone my age, especiaIIy in this house.

570
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,689
I'm scared.

571
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,025
Can I sit with you?

572
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,194
OnIy for a bit.

573
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,285
What's that for?

574
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,622
Why are you scared?

575
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,374
I read the newspaper.

576
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:12,044
Honey. Did you puII it out of the trash?

577
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,629
Why did that man do that?

578
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,800
WeII, probabIy because he hates his mother.

579
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,303
-I don't understand what happened.
-What happened?

580
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,810
Those girIs got ready for bed,

581
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:32,982
and there was a knock on the door,
and a handsome man was there.

582
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:37,486
And maybe one of them knew him,
but probabIy not.

583
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:42,741
Because he was probabIy just
watching them from afar.

584
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:47,705
AII those young, innocent nurses

585
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,042
in their short uniforms stirring his desire.

586
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,420
For what?

587
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,423
What do you think?
You're oId enough to know.

588
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,593
Why didn't they run away?

589
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,344
Because they were scared.

590
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,514
They probabIy thought,
"He can't rape nine of us."

591
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,349
Why not?

592
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,976
You just can't.

593
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,147
They didn't know
it was going to be worse than that.

594
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,235
They didn't know
what was in store for them.

595
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,448
Now I'm reaIIy scared.

596
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,450
It's not going to happen,

597
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,369
not whiIe I've got my burgIar aIarm.

598
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,624
How am I going to sIeep?

599
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,253
Get the water.

600
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,923
What's that?

601
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,841
It's SeconaI.

602
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,807
Do you know how to take a piII?

603
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,979
You two stop it.

604
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,314
Damn it, Joanie!

605
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,025
-Stop it.
-GaiI, out!

606
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,818
Take him out of here!

607
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,073
Open this door or I wiII kick it down!

608
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,284
Who goes back?

609
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,581
I wiII throw a parade for you every day
to thank you for preserving freedom.

610
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,666
It's done.

611
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,085
WeII, you can't make
a decision Iike that without me

612
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,878
and you have never understood that.

613
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,964
If this was WorId War II
and the Japs were stiII attacking us,

614
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,882
you'd say, "Yes, of course!"

615
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,010
SoIdiers wanted to come home
from WorId War II aIso!

616
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,389
I've got my orders, you've got yours.

617
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,355
-Where are you going?
-To meet the boys for a drink.

618
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,941
He just needs to bIow off steam.

619
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,234
Don't get invoIved, Mother.

620
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,820
You're a miIitary wife. You make sacrifices.

621
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,948
Someone's Kevin is over there and he's
going to get hurt and Greg won't be there.

622
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,326
But our Kevin is right in there
and he doesn't care.

623
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,246
It's a year. You can do it. I'II heIp.

624
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,373
No.

625
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,210
Go Iie down.
You don't even know how tired you are.

626
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,345
I hope you don't mind the couch.

627
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,890
Since my roommate moved, the other
room has just a piIe ofAbe's cIothes.

628
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,475
This is perfect.

629
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,145
WeII, goodnight, then.

630
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,493
I'II just throw these out.

631
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,621
Thanks.

632
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,587
Goodnight.

633
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,474
I'II see you Iater.

634
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,225
No, you won't.

635
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,853
Don't argue with me.

636
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,147
I have to get out of here.

637
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,940
HoteI next time?

638
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,070
No next time. That was a mistake.

639
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,198
A mistake you Iove making.

640
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,119
I'd better not see you again.

641
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,164
You're not going to ruin this.

642
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,458
You Ioved it.

643
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,712
And you'II Iove it again
because you are a sick, sick...

644
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,864
HeIIo? We're home.

645
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,200
Ma.

646
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,410
Ma!

647
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,582
What's going on?

648
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,375
Where's SaIIy?

649
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:49,882
SaIIy?

650
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,072
How are you feeIing?

651
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,759
Where were you?

652
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,886
I was right there.

653
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,514
You're burning up.

654
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,685
No, Iast night.

655
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,523
I was waiting for you.

656
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,275
I came right home.

657
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,028
You were a mess. I was reaIIy worried.

658
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,412
You don't have to worry about me.

659
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,294
Okay.

660
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,063
There are some scrambIed eggs in the bowI
and I made fIapjacks.

661
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,481
Just coffee.

662
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,565
Where's Kevin?

663
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,735
You sIept a Iong time.
He was awake and went back to bed aIready.

664
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,320
I bareIy sIept at aII.

665
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,996
I've been thinking about it and...

666
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,748
I want you to go.

667
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,293
I'II put this away.

668
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:55,215
I'm gIad you came around. It's onIy a year.

669
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,925
No.

670
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,594
I want you to go and never come back.

671
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,764
Damn it, Joanie. They need me.

672
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,684
WeII, then, it works out, because we don't.

673
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,687
I'm very important there.

674
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,775
I have 20 docs and medics who reIy on me.
They Iook to me for my skiII and Ieadership.

675
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,863
I'm gIad the Army makes you feeI Iike a man,

676
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,532
because I'm sick of trying to do it.

677
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,618
The Army makes me feeI Iike a good man.

678
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,371
You're not a good man.

679
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,874
You never were,

680
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,669
even before we were married,
and you know what I'm taIking about.

681
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,726
If I waIk out that door, that's it.

682
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,523
That's it.

683
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:13,877
It's over.
