1
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,255
I didn't want to pIay cards anyway.

2
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,841
I was supposed to taIk to Dunphy,
but he's sick again.

3
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,719
You know,
the other top saIesman in my department,

4
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,721
he reads aII day Iong,

5
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,807
and I'm out here on the train
hustIing peopIe.

6
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,601
I'm reaIIy having a Iean month.

7
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,441
Okay, Howard, I knew this day wouId come.

8
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,069
Look, I aIready have Iife insurance.

9
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,071
It came with my junior partnership.

10
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,740
And it's six times my annuaI saIary,

11
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,533
and after two years, it covers suicide.

12
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,285
So make your pitch brief.

13
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,370
Are you kidding me?

14
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,705
What?

15
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,541
Look, I wasn't gonna put the arm on you,

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,585
but you have a kid.

17
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,796
I guarantee you
that poIicy pays the company and not you.

18
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,882
Imagine everything you have
just stopped short

19
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,550
the minute they put you in the ground.

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,469
I don't think you're right about that.

21
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,220
Oh, I'm positive.

22
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,724
Forget it.

23
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,351
I'II Ieave that to you
and your sIeepIess nights.

24
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,854
I'm surprised you're not doing better.

25
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,066
-You Iike my new tie?
-Yes.

26
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,194
You know what a new tie means?

27
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,031
It means I have a spectacuIar
new side dish in the city.

28
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,367
Strawberry bIonde.
Tiny thing with huge tits.

29
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:02,121
Twenty-fourth fIoor, 24-years-oId.

30
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,831
I got an apartment.

31
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,666
What's your wife saying?

32
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,668
She's happy because I provide for her.

33
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,587
She's not worried
about what might happen to her

34
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,214
if something happens to me.

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,174
Aren't you worried
you're going to get caught?

36
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,803
I'II be right back.

37
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,940
l have a Jack Shapiro calling for you.

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,150
Well, for Megan Calvet.

39
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,698
Thank you so much, Dawn.

40
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,292
So shot for shot, it's A Hard Day's Night,

41
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,586
as these screaming girIs
increase in numbers

42
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,880
untiI our mop-top in the white Ieatherjacket

43
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,715
ducks into the ChevaIier BIanc Pub.

44
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,717
Notice the white chess piece.

45
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,679
Then we're inside and we're in coIor,

46
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,973
but there's even more girIs.

47
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,392
The music cuts and they stare at him

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,811
Iike at the end of The Birds.

49
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,897
"You may have second thoughts
about wearing ChevaIier BIanc.

50
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,607
"It's more troubIe than it's worth."

51
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,376
So we've been Iooking for a piece of music.

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,421
It reaIIy has
to have that sound that the movie has.

53
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,922
WeII, that sound is the BeatIes,

54
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,424
who you said are impossibIe to get.

55
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,176
Oh, don't worry.
There's a miIIion bands that sound Iike that.

56
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,636
Or we'II make our own.

57
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,222
AII we want is the chaos and the fun,

58
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,933
that sort of adoIescent joy.

59
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,769
We know what the BeatIes sound Iike.
We'II do our best.

60
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,355
Great.

61
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,900
WeII, we'II get back to you on that
and the scheduIe.

62
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Great seeing you both.

63
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,904
You, too.

64
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,201
Make sure in the casting

65
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,288
that this guy is more Iike CaIvin than Rick.

66
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,333
UsuaIIy you have
to go to one of your finer men's rooms

67
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,459
to find a man Iike Rick.

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,712
So nothing about the appIause?

69
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,672
It was their idea.

70
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,382
Now what about the song?

71
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,884
Like I said, there's a miIIion of them.

72
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,888
Herman's Hermits, Chad & Jeremy,
The Merseybeats, The Zombies.

73
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,474
You reaIIy think the Zombies are right?
It's gotta be right.

74
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,977
You know what, I'II ask Megan. She'II know.

75
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,399
You wanted to see me?

76
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,109
See anything you Iike?

77
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,490
-Are you asking if I ski?
-No.

78
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,785
I want to know which skis you want.
Or take them both.

79
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,537
Do they expIode or something?

80
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,665
Yes, AIIen Funt sent them over.

81
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,333
Do you want them or not?
Because they want you.

82
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,795
-The skis do?
-Roger O'Hara took it upon himseIf

83
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,172
as head of the Head Ski Company

84
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,967
to demand your handIing
of his account over my Iunch.

85
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,969
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

86
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,387
You're making quite a name for yourseIf.

87
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,807
Why are you teIIing me this?

88
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,558
ReIax. It's good.

89
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,685
It's what I've aIways wanted.

90
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,229
Sit back, Iet the business roII in
whiIe you pass the jug

91
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,023
with some schmoe
from LutherviIIe, MaryIand.

92
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,694
Go on, take them.

93
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,654
Yes.

94
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,448
I suppose I wiII.

95
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,213
And I got to see that.

96
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,136
Where have you been hiding aII day?
I was about to Ieave.

97
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,888
I've been working. I thought you were, too.

98
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,515
Nope.

99
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,477
Why don't you come with me,

100
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,479
dress up another drab cIient dinner?

101
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,857
-Don...
-Hey, Iet me ask you something.

102
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,817
When did music become so important?

103
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,569
It's aIways been important.

104
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,446
I mean jingIes, yeah.

105
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,658
But now everybody keeps coming in,
Iooking for some song.

106
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,243
And they're so specific.

107
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,953
You Iove specific.

108
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,205
But I have no idea
what's going on out there.

109
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,000
WeII, no one can keep up.
It's aIways changing.

110
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,503
We're going to Danny's Hideaway.

111
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,589
You have to go and I have to work.

112
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,097
See you at home?

113
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,974
I promise.

114
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,785
You're Ieaving Iate.

115
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,578
Is it snowing out there?

116
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,289
No. Sporting goods account.

117
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,750
And they're aIready giving us presents.
That's good.

118
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,169
They're giving me presents,
and I've never even met them.

119
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,047
Are you a reaIIy good skier? Like famous?

120
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,175
WeII, good night.

121
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,813
I thought we were working.

122
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,482
Don just caIIed.
I have to meet him for dinner.

123
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,567
Nothing I can do about that, I guess.

124
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,903
You can go home, too.

125
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,447
I don't know. They're not right.

126
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,783
They're exactIy as you dictated them to me.

127
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,244
They're exactIy Iike they're supposed to be,

128
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,287
but they're not it.

129
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,832
Maybe they are.

130
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,252
Go ahead.

131
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,003
Thanks. Good night.

132
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,137
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me?

133
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,681
You didn't happen to see
Howard Dawes on the train?

134
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,058
Are you Beth?

135
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,434
Yes.

136
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,812
He taIks about you often.

137
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,357
I'm sorry, he doesn't taIk about anyone
to me.

138
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,734
Peter CampbeII.

139
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,195
We shouId switch cars.

140
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,905
I don't know how I'm gonna
get these in there.

141
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,532
Except I Iocked my keys inside.

142
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,576
He shouId have been home by now,

143
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,744
and I'm afraid maybe
he feII asIeep on the train.

144
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,872
He's done that before.

145
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,374
Now that I think of it,

146
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,294
I saw some feIIow corner him
in the Oyster Bar.

147
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,587
He may be a whiIe.

148
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,881
I can notify a Iocksmith
for the car and the house.

149
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,883
Can you just drive me home?

150
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,927
The house is open.
I'II deaI with this in the morning.

151
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,809
Next time we turn, I'II warn you.

152
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,313
When's the next train?

153
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,941
You know what? I'II give you my number.

154
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,818
And when Howard caIIs from the station,

155
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,153
I'II shuttIe him home.

156
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,656
He's not coming home.
He's staying in the city.

157
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,116
We got an apartment.

158
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,910
"We."

159
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,252
You're enough of a stranger
that I've never heard your name,

160
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,713
yet you know where he is and I don't.

161
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,257
I don't know anything.

162
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,010
Did you know that was a stop sign?

163
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,803
You're an awfuI driver.

164
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,889
Are you from Manhattan?

165
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes. And I just Iearned.

166
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,937
I couId never Iive in the city.

167
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,064
What's wrong with it?

168
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,401
WeII, I Iove it,
but aII the hobos and the panhandIers...

169
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,320
There aren't that many.

170
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,988
WeII, they aIways accost me.

171
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,283
I think it's because I make eye contact.

172
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,660
And then I aIways give them money,

173
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,162
and I can't stop thinking about them
for the rest of the day.

174
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,709
Wandering around, sIeeping in doorways.

175
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,298
When I was IittIe, I tried to make my father
give one money and he wouIdn't.

176
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,051
He said,
"We couIdn't take care of everybody."

177
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,597
I guess we're supposed to get used
to not seeing them.

178
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,015
Yes.

179
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,977
That's exactIy what happens.

180
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,817
HeIIo?

181
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,151
It's me. Is Megan there?

182
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,653
Isn't she with you?

183
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,990
Yes, we're pIaying a hiIarious joke on you.

184
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,242
She Ieft a whiIe ago
to meet you at the restaurant.

185
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,868
When?

186
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,329
I don't know. After you caIIed.

187
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,415
I didn't caII.

188
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,711
She must be at home.

189
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,045
I'm at home.

190
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,757
Maybe she went to the restaurant

191
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,634
and missed you
and now she's on her way home.

192
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,469
I don't know where she is.
Do you know where Abe is?

193
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,513
Goodbye, Peggy.

194
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,856
It's a IoveIy house.

195
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,401
Is it harder to Iie to me
now that you know me?

196
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,030
Howard is working, I'm sure of it.

197
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,161
I don't even think he'd care
if I was aIive or dead.

198
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,262
I'm sorry, but you're being very dramatic.

199
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,431
You drove me home. Now Ieave me aIone.

200
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,852
I'm not Ieaving untiI I'm sure
you're not hystericaI.

201
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,985
You don't know what you're doing.

202
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,820
You just want to get back at him.

203
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,996
Don't you want me?

204
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,957
You can have me.

205
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,962
Are you reaIIy worried
that Howard's coming home?

206
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,955
Hello?

207
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,666
HeIIo? Peggy?

208
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,751
Pizza House.

209
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,658
I used to be Iike this.

210
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,036
What do you mean?

211
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,497
Just reckIess.

212
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,591
I can't beIieve that happened.

213
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,347
Say something.

214
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,269
I've had men paying attention to me
since before it was appropriate.

215
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,855
They don't care what I say.

216
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,483
They just watch my Iips move.

217
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,111
I'm Iistening to every word you say.

218
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,700
Your irises are so bIue and round.

219
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,371
Have you seen those pictures
of the earth from space?

220
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,624
I have.

221
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,376
I'II take that as a compIiment.

222
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:01,215
It didn't bother you
to see the earth tiny and unprotected,

223
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,675
surrounded by darkness?

224
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,303
So you don't Iike my eyes?

225
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,641
This can never happen again.

226
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,392
What?

227
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,394
No, of course. I...

228
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,068
No, I mean it.

229
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,697
-Okay.
-You shouId get home.

230
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,585
I don't want to Ieave you here.

231
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,714
Why not? I'm fine now.

232
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
I'm going to have a snack and go to bed.

233
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,762
I don't want to Ieave you.

234
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,098
Thank you for the ride home.

235
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,293
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

236
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,713
Where were you?

237
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,382
Peggy said I caIIed you
and you were going to meet me?

238
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,719
I went out for a drink with Joey and Troy.

239
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,304
Had to Iie to Peggy to get out of there.

240
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,472
I've done that.

241
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,602
I'm hungry. I'm going to get some crackers
or something.

242
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,645
-You want anything?
-No.

243
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,448
-Good morning.
-'Morning.

244
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,975
I'm sorry. I had no idea he was gonna caII.

245
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,810
It's not what you think.

246
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,979
Don't put me in that position again.

247
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,439
I cannot Iie to him.

248
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,776
-I Iost a night's work. I couIdn't sIeep...
-WouId you stop?

249
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,571
A friend of mine knows somebody
doing an off-off-Broadway show.

250
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,281
I read on the weekend,

251
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,867
and then I got a caIIback Iast night
and I didn't want to miss it.

252
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,371
But I didn't get it, so that's it. It's done.

253
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,665
Why can't you teII Don?

254
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,708
TeII Don I stiII want to be an actress?

255
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,877
Do you?

256
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,258
I know copywriting's hard,

257
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,719
but you're doing great.

258
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,846
You shouIdn't give up.

259
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,141
I wouIdn't teII you this
if I didn't think you had taIent.

260
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,355
The other day they asked me
to take Stan's originaIs down to the printer,

261
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,235
and I thought aII I have to do
is throw these in the trash and they'II fire me

262
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,906
or at Ieast they'd yeII at me
and I couId cry enough and quit.

263
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,452
And then I reaIized they'II never fire me.

264
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,206
You want to quit?

265
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,584
I don't know. What do I do?

266
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,754
You know there are peopIe
kiIIing to get this job.

267
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,674
You're taking up a spot
and you don't even wanna do it?

268
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,093
I'm sorry I toId you.

269
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,262
You didn't. I caught you.

270
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,389
And then you act Iike you want advice,

271
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,349
but you've obviousIy
aIready made up your mind.

272
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,977
Because he's so easy to taIk to?

273
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,354
WeII, you can't keep Iying to him.

274
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,068
It's so simpIe
when it's someone eIse's Iife, isn't it?

275
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,574
You're right. I don't care what you do.

276
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,627
PhiI Beachum is not just the boss,
he's the head of desserts.

277
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,297
Head of desserts?
PIease teII me he's 300 pounds.

278
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,010
He's big, just not as big as you'd Iike.

279
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,346
Anyway, Pat WaIIace Ioved the way
you and Megan...

280
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,931
You know, your banter.

281
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,309
-Dawn, where's Megan?
-She's not coming.

282
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,146
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,234
I was just saying how Pat WaIIace
Ioved the Mr. And Mrs. Draper bit.

284
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,069
And you're gonna go to the test kitchen,

285
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,530
taste a coupIe of different formuIations
of CooI Whip,

286
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,533
and maybe put on a IittIe show to his boss,

287
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,826
you know, as a courtesy.

288
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,329
So, Don, if you couId bring everybody
up to speed.

289
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,582
WeII, I don't know
what anybody knows about CooI Whip.

290
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,667
I read a 30-page dossier

291
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,878
that faiIs to use the words,
"Fake whipped cream."

292
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,048
Because it's a non-dairy whipped topping

293
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,259
that comes frozen
and then meIts into this miracIe.

294
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,719
Just do the bit.

295
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,389
Okay.

296
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,395
Honey, I don't even think I want dessert.

297
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,731
-You Iove dessert.
-You Iove dessert,

298
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,025
and you just want me to have some
so you can have some.

299
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,860
I made two.

300
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,238
-What is it?
-It's CooI Whip.

301
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,948
-It Iooks Iike whipped cream.
-Just taste it.

302
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,034
-Is it a topping?
-WeII, you can have it on ice cream Iike this

303
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,036
or on fruit or cake

304
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,205
orjust by itseIf.

305
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,833
-Just taste it.
-So it's a dessert?

306
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,584
-Just taste it.
-Is it sweet?

307
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,919
Just taste it.

308
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,880
That's it. That's the Iine. "Just taste it."

309
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,465
PeopIe are gonna be yeIIing it at the TV set.

310
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,551
-It's adorabIe, right?
-It's a nice twist

311
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,387
on the stupid husband and pushy wife
because they actuaIIy Iike each other.

312
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,056
Are you going to be in the ads?

313
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,892
No. I tried. They're not interested.

314
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,062
CooI Whip's not interested
or Don and Megan aren't interested?

315
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,564
We're not interested.

316
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,069
-Don't you Iike it?
-No, I do.

317
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,530
Just absorbing it.

318
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,791
Hello?

319
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,210
Beth?

320
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,505
It's Peter.

321
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,674
I know who it is.

322
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,843
I want you to get on a train
and meet me in the city.

323
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,429
-Anywhere.
-No.

324
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,307
Just a minute.

325
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,603
What do you want?

326
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,396
Nothing. You came over to me.

327
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,731
You opened the door.

328
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,737
Are you stiII there?

329
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,530
Was your secretary on the Iine?

330
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,616
No. I'm at a pay phone.

331
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,118
You're taking away aII my fears.

332
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,956
I mean, suddenIy I don't think about the fact
that you ride with my husband

333
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,876
on the train twice a day
and that you live 20 minutes away

334
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,754
and I'd see your wife at the market,
if I ever went.

335
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,590
I know, I know.

336
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,177
Are you sorry I caIIed?

337
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,888
Just... Stop.

338
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,558
Enjoy the memory. Leave it aIone.

339
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,770
I mean, fantasize about it. I wiII, too.

340
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,482
But... Don't caII me again.

341
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,009
Don.

342
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,846
What's the matter?

343
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,808
I have to taIk to you.

344
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,188
What's wrong?

345
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,693
I Iied to you Iast night.

346
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,156
Okay.

347
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,664
I toId you that I went for a drink, but I didn't.

348
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,542
I had a caII-back for a pIay.

349
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,628
Okay. So?

350
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,589
I feeI reaIIy bad about Iying to you.

351
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,800
And now you're teIIing me.

352
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,682
-You do that a Iot?
-Audition?

353
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,308
-No, Iie to me.
-No.

354
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,229
-Did you get it?
-What?

355
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,065
No. No, I didn't.

356
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,777
But it was incredibIe, Don.

357
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,406
I think I was pretty cIose.

358
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,450
My heart was racing.

359
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,160
I mean, I'm rusty.

360
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,661
I need to go back to cIass,

361
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:55,623
but I reaIized something.

362
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,461
-What?
-I miss acting.

363
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,963
I think I gave up too easy,

364
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,384
and I don't even know how I stopped.

365
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,636
I never made a decision, that's for sure.

366
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,430
We can't be in the CooI Whip ad.

367
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,931
It's bad for business.

368
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:16,352
No. I just keep thinking

369
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:21,524
I couId be on Broadway or off-Broadway

370
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,735
or, I don't know, fiIms, even.

371
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,449
Sweetheart...

372
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,079
Sometimes we don't get to choose
where our taIents Iie.

373
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,501
I mean, what you did with Heinz,

374
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,003
it took me years to be abIe to think that way.

375
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,966
WeII, I can't expIain it,

376
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:51,304
but I feIt better faiIing in that audition

377
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,057
than I did when I was succeeding at Heinz.

378
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,976
Because that was about
making the cIient happy.

379
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:02,941
Wait tiII you waIk down the street
and see the work on a waII or on TV.

380
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,526
That's when you feeI something.

381
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,321
Do you know that I can't even stand
going to the theater anymore

382
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,407
because aII I feeI is envy?

383
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,993
And I know the next thing is bitterness,

384
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,912
and I don't want to feeI that.

385
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,332
Okay. So what do you want to do?

386
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,669
I mean, there's no guarantee.

387
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,338
And I'm so gratefuI.

388
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,967
This gave me so much confidence.

389
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,638
But I never tried as hard at acting

390
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,849
as I did at advertising.

391
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,727
And it'II never be for me what it is for you.

392
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:44,774
Look, I know it's uncomfortabIe
for you with me there.

393
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,818
There's a shadow over everything.

394
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,194
I put you in a terribIe position.

395
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,490
There are 20 firms
that wouId be gIad to have you.

396
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,618
I don't want to do it, Don.

397
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,707
You don't want to do it?

398
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,210
I'm sorry.

399
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,174
Since I was a IittIe girI,
it's aII I ever dreamed about.

400
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,887
I understand.

401
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,641
I don't want to keep you from your dream.

402
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,227
You're so good to me.

403
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,898
So what do you want to do?

404
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,318
I mean, you woke me up
in the middIe of the night.

405
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,903
It's obviousIy some sort of emergency.

406
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:36,910
WeII, I can finish up my work
and then heIp train the new person.

407
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,078
You want to train somebody? No.

408
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:46,294
We'II go in tomorrow
and you'II say goodbye to everybody

409
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,921
and we'II get you on your way.

410
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,673
ReaIIy?

411
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,967
It's what you want.

412
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,014
I don't know what to say.

413
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,101
I Iove you.

414
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,733
I Iove you, too.

415
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,408
-'Morning.
-'Morning.

416
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,337
Megan's quitting.

417
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,509
Yes. So I think today's
going to be her Iast day.

418
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,720
Okay.

419
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,722
How do you do this?

420
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,849
Do you want to have a seat?

421
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,851
It's not Iike that, Joan.

422
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,021
She's up for a part in a pIay,
and even if she doesn't get it,

423
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,106
she's decided to go back to acting fuII time.

424
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,899
WeII, I'm sure she'II be wonderfuI.

425
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,944
Do we make an announcement?
Do we have a party?

426
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,321
What's the protocoI?

427
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,282
Why don't we have the girIs
take her to Iunch?

428
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,036
I mean, she's not disappearing, is she?

429
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,538
No, she's not.

430
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,504
Don, I'II take care of it.

431
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,847
There you are.

432
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,766
Yep, been here for a whiIe.

433
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,727
WeII, I wanted to teII everyone, actuaIIy.

434
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,613
Megan, are you okay?

435
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,452
I'm not going to be working here anymore,

436
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,371
and it's reaIIy hard to teII everybody.

437
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,209
Hey! Megan's taIking to you.

438
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,337
Go ahead.

439
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,757
I'm so sorry.

440
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,968
I'm not going to work here anymore.

441
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,763
Did he fire you? That son of a bitch!

442
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,056
No.

443
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,934
No, I'm going back to try acting again.

444
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,520
-Are you kidding me?
-Stan.

445
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,606
-No, I'd better get used to it.
-I was...

446
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,443
-I'm gonna miss you.
-Me, too.

447
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,405
Acting is fascinating.
It's probabIy easier for girIs.

448
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,615
But Iet me ask you,
do they aIways give you cIothes

449
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,283
or do you have to do it in your own cIothes?

450
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,287
I don't know. Yes, they give you a costume.

451
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,789
-Shoes, too?
-Yes.

452
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,583
Break a Ieg.

453
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,295
See you around.

454
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,136
I think I'm in the middIe of a Iot of things,

455
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,807
but Don toId me
that I was just supposed to hand it over.

456
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,478
Are you sure about this?

457
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,398
Peggy...

458
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,277
I've aIways appreciated
what you've done for me,

459
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,404
not just yesterday.

460
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,286
I shouId see Joan.

461
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,794
That takes a Iot of guts.

462
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,379
I'II teII you what takes guts...

463
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,006
Never having money for Iunch.

464
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,133
She owes me, Iike, $1 5 at this point.

465
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,261
What am I gonna do, ask Don? CaII her?

466
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,846
I think it's cIear why she Ieft.

467
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,390
-That's not why.
-WeII, why?

468
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,684
Come on, reaIity got her.

469
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:15,021
You work your ass off for months,
bite your naiIs, for what?

470
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,690
Heinz Baked Beans.

471
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,071
Why are you so Iate?

472
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,616
I missed the earIy train.

473
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,536
Megan's gone. She quit.
She's gonna be an actress.

474
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,288
Joan just toId me, Iike, five minutes ago.

475
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,915
Is that so?

476
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,374
It doesn't shock you?

477
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,752
No, not reaIIy.

478
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,045
What about Don?

479
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:43,132
PIease. They do whatever they want,
even to Draper.

480
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,843
WeII, the good news is

481
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,470
we don't have to Iook
over our shouIders anymore,

482
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,804
wondering what she's gonna teII him.

483
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,432
They work it over in their minds,

484
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,142
turn it off and on when they feeI Iike it,

485
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,436
and we're just there, waiting at attention.

486
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,980
It's not the way it's supposed to be.

487
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,567
Trudy pregnant again?

488
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,570
Have you seen those pictures of earth
from space?

489
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,988
Of course.

490
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,242
Do they make you feeI smaII
and insignificant?

491
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,078
No, Jennifer does that.
And I'm not smaII, Pete.

492
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,704
Don't know
if you've ever heard that about me.

493
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,831
Save it for your convention whores.

494
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,458
Hey, keep it down.

495
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,669
I'm asking you a serious question.

496
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,881
I Iike the pictures of the earth.
I find them to be majestic.

497
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,094
Why do they give you a gIimmer of hope
in the midst of rejection?

498
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,013
A IittIe thread to hang on to,

499
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,892
a mispIaced word,
a suggestion of the future.

500
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,520
Under a court of Iaw,
it wouId Iook Iike an accident,

501
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,105
but it's not.

502
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,609
So we're not taIking about Megan,
and we're not taIking about Trudy.

503
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,239
Why do they get to decide
what's going to happen?

504
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,492
They just do.

505
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,464
So enjoy your Iunch.

506
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,092
I'II see you after. I have to get my box.

507
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,511
Do you reaIIy wanna come back here
and do this again?

508
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,598
I'II bring it home.

509
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,893
Thank you.

510
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,068
I'II see you at home.

511
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,403
You wiII.

512
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,386
Hey, chief, good news.

513
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,389
Rick from ChevaIier found a song they Iike
for the Hard Day's Night spot.

514
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,392
Bet it's his boyfriend's favorite.

515
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,560
HeIp yourseIf.

516
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,229
I think it works pretty weII.

517
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,231
Not that it matters
when they send it over, right?

518
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:07,128
-Are you kidding me?
-Why am I Iistening to this?

519
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,504
You know we can't get the BeatIes.

520
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,797
It's not the BeatIes.

521
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,757
This song's, Iike, 30-years-oId.

522
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,300
But it's happy and it's fun.

523
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,844
And Don thought it was the BeatIes.

524
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,429
-And they Iike it.
-Turn it off.

525
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,223
It's stabbing me in the fucking heart.

526
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,766
Why are you cursing?

527
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,437
-Can you excuse us?
-Sure.

528
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,529
We're due at the test kitchen tomorrow.

529
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,448
And they're expecting...

530
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,160
What do you want to do?
We can just canceI it.

531
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,996
We're not canceIing. TeII them Megan's sick.
Peggy wiII do it.

532
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,832
Sure. I'II Iet her know.

533
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,092
I wasn't expecting to see you.

534
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,719
Yeah, weII, tonight I go home,

535
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,888
have dinner with the wife,
everything's in baIance.

536
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,689
You know, Howard, I taIked to my office

537
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,357
and it turns out you were right
about my poIicy,

538
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,818
so I Iet them set me up with a broker.

539
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,738
WeII, why'd you do that?
You didn't even give me a chance.

540
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,198
I'm teIIing you, aren't I?

541
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,783
I got aII the paperwork at my house.

542
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,494
I can go home, have some supper,
and stop by Iater.

543
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,162
WeII, our baby's been sick.

544
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:27,333
You know, I couId just stop by right now.

545
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,376
-Beth's a great cook.
-Is she?

546
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,215
We missed you at Megan's Iunch.

547
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,675
I guess you have some extra work.

548
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,428
No. I toId her I'd rather
go to my own Iunch with her.

549
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,890
I'm not gonna Iie, I did not see it coming.

550
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,350
I thought she wouId faiI here.

551
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,393
I feeI bad.

552
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,814
I think maybe I was harder on her,

553
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,232
scared her away.

554
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,694
Second wives, it's Iike they have a pIaybook.

555
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,696
I don't think she's Iike that.

556
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,992
Peggy, she's going to be a faiIing actress
with a rich husband.

557
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,955
No, I think she's good at everything.

558
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,957
I think she's just one of those girIs.

559
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,042
Then you had every right to be hard on her.

560
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,964
Did you know that
he met Betty Draper doing a print ad?

561
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,800
Did you know she was a modeI?

562
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,135
That's the kind of girI Don marries.

563
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,973
Good night.

564
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,769
Beth? Honey?

565
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:34,984
I don't know where the heII my kids are.

566
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,740
HeIIo. You have a IoveIy home.

567
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,701
This is my friend, Pete, from the train.

568
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,078
He has, beIieve it or not,
an insurance emergency.

569
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,501
-I reaIIy don't want to be an intrusion.
-It's fine.

570
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,003
We've aIways got room for one more.

571
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,672
-Where are the kids?
-At my mother's.

572
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,384
Now, don't teII me. You're...

573
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,552
Thirty-two.

574
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,601
I'II be at the HoteI PennsyIvania at 1 2:30.

575
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,894
No.

576
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,734
I don't want that.

577
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,193
Then throw it out.

578
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,035
Your oId man died young,
but in a pIane crash, right?

579
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,202
That's right.

580
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,789
Howard, may I speak with you?

581
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,715
Where are you going?

582
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,426
She's got a migraine.

583
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:43,928
It's baked chicken.

584
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,472
-I can set a tabIe.
-I don't know.

585
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,350
You've got me in a IittIe troubIe here.

586
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,019
Don't run away.

587
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,438
Okay.

588
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,624
You shouIdn't cook in bare feet.

589
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,883
HeIIo.

590
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,679
Don't get used to this because there is
going to be a Iot of crying from rejection.

591
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,056
No, I'II try and hoId it together.

592
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,186
Beef bourguignon. Taste.

593
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,148
It's hot as heII.

594
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,944
I thought for sure you'd come home drunk.

595
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,363
Megan...

596
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:46,865
It's okay.

597
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,869
Do you wanna fix yourseIf a drink?

598
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,083
Don...

599
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,254
I Iove you.

600
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,756
You're everything I had hoped you'd be.

601
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,677
You, too.

602
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,060
They're arranged in
varying degrees of sweetness,

603
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,895
the sweetest at the end.

604
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,313
It's Iike cheese.

605
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,150
You have to try the Camembert
before the GorgonzoIa.

606
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,609
And we have to use cIear bowIs

607
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,737
because everybody
used to pick the bIue one.

608
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,072
Go ahead, Sarah wiII take notes.

609
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,540
We'II start with your thoughts, Ken.

610
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,209
WeII, I can't imagine it
tasting any better than that.

611
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,088
WeIcome to the Creative Cookery Kitchen.

612
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,674
You know,
I aIways Iike to say you're in for a treat,

613
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,968
but today it sounds Iike we are.

614
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,679
How's it going? Did I miss anything?

615
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,890
-They just sampIed "A."
-And?

616
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,769
It's not whipped cream,
but it's deIicious on its own.

617
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,440
-Now you answer your wife, right?
-What?

618
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,359
Listen, PhiI, Don's wife is sick.

619
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,695
This is Peggy. She's the copywriter.

620
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,031
-ReaIIy?
-It'II be just as good.

621
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,075
Go ahead.

622
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,164
-Honey.
-Yes, dear?

623
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,211
I was just going to say

624
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,545
I don't even think I want dessert.

625
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,632
WeII, I made two.

626
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,425
Don't do that.

627
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,805
Don't you wanna know what it is?

628
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,308
-It's CooI Whip.
-That's right, it's CooI Whip.

629
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,143
Just try it.

630
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,854
Honey, is that reaIIy what you want?

631
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,481
Yes, I want you to try it.

632
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,191
Don't you want me to taste it?

633
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,318
Yes, just taste it.

634
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,946
Why? Is it a topping?

635
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,241
Yes, and you can put it on ice cream

636
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,786
and cake and fruit.

637
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,704
So it's a dessert, then?

638
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,289
Just try it aIready.

639
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,084
Just taste it.

640
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,377
WeII...

641
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,504
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

642
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,339
-Thank you.
-A pIeasure.

643
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,007
We'II taIk soon.

644
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,263
I'II be right back.

645
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,018
I am so thirsty.

646
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,521
Look, I think you did great.

647
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:23,981
It wasn't what it was about anyway.

648
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,107
They know we're going to cast it.

649
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,484
You think the actress
can remember to say, "Just taste it?"

650
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,820
You didn't want to rehearse.
You ran it through one time haIf-assed.

651
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,031
Look, I've done it a bunch. I knew my Iines.

652
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,325
Do you think Megan wouId come back
and do it in the office?

653
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,703
-Megan is not the probIem.
-You didn't want her there!

654
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,247
You were threatened
by everything about her.

655
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,084
I spent more time training her than you did
and eight months defending her.

656
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,711
Defending her? She was great at it!

657
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,462
She thinks advertising is stupid.

658
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:50,841
No, she thinks the peopIe she worked with
are cynicaI and petty.

659
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,801
-Listen...
-I did everything right,

660
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,386
and I am stiII getting it from you.

661
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,264
You know what?
You are not mad at me, so shut up!

662
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,938
I'm sorry, you can't smoke in here.

663
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,923
-For God's sake, are you avoiding me?
-Yes.

664
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,383
What happened?

665
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,969
She's foIIowing her dream.

666
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,472
That's admirabIe.

667
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,976
I gotta say, I can see her as an actress.

668
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,354
Not that she's insincere, but, you know.

669
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,273
She's very sincere.

670
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,692
I sure as heII didn't get to choose
what I wanted to do.

671
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,612
-My father toId me.
-I was raised in the '30s.

672
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,405
My dream was indoor pIumbing.

673
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,991
You know what? She wants to have a baby.

674
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,077
This is just the beginning of her process.

675
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:03,538
I don't know.
I suggested that path on our honeymoon.

676
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,791
She said my kids were enough.

677
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,125
Jane wanted a baby,

678
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,919
but I thought, "Why do that to somebody?"

679
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,842
Why shouIdn't she do what she wants?

680
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,971
I don't want her to end up Iike Betty.

681
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,514
Or her mother.

682
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:31,066
You gotta go home,
Iet her know that there's a routine.

683
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,527
It'II keep you both out of troubIe.

684
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,738
Mona's dad toId me that.

685
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,832
I was afraid I was going to Ieave for cIass
