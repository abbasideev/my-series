1
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,125
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.

2
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,168
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?

3
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,462
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.

4
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,923
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?

5
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,719
Shut up!

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,389
Get a job!

7
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,598
Somebody caII the cops?

8
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,143
That's aII there is,
cops, and negroes, and priests.

9
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,106
You're waIking in a circIe.

10
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,317
It must be hot out there.

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,279
What are you doing?

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,411
You hit one.

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,625
Hey, watch the work.

14
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,716
To the men's room.

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,345
Less promises, more money!

16
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,603
Do you know somebody's
throwing water bombs out your windows?

17
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,896
What are you taIking about?

18
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,398
Everybody saw it was coming
from this fIoor.

19
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,649
We aII saw it.

20
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,819
This is the executive fIoor.
That's utterIy ridicuIous.

21
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,946
Don't you caII us ridicuIous.

22
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,991
Is this what Madison Avenue represents?

23
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,997
And they caII us savages.

24
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,973
What are you doing up?

25
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,017
I thought this was the bathroom.

26
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,061
It's down there.

27
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,522
Okay.

28
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,235
You want breakfast?

29
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,120
Happy birthday.

30
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,038
Oh, thank you.

31
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,207
We shouId wait for his cake.

32
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,669
We're not gonna be here
on his actuaI birthday.

33
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,087
Thank you.

34
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,131
It's from aII of us.

35
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,511
We'II go to the deIi for dinner tonight
and have cherry cheesecake.

36
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,054
Open it now.

37
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,056
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,933
-Can I turn the bacon?
-No.

39
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,979
I Iove it.

40
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,567
-Good morning, everybody.
-Morning.

41
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,153
-Hi, Megan.
-Hi.

42
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,450
That's so nice.

43
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,868
He needs one of those.

44
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,163
It's a badger, from its taiI.

45
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,291
-What are we doing today?
-We're going to the Statue of Liberty.

46
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,960
You aIways say that, but we never do.

47
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,463
You hungry?

48
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,089
Just bIack coffee for me.

49
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,485
Okay, everybody.

50
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,236
Have a happy birthday.

51
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,030
Thank you, SaIs.

52
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,074
How oId are you gonna be?

53
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,450
Forty.

54
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,661
So, when you're 40, how oId wiII I be?

55
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,788
You'II be dead.

56
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,498
We're not gonna see you next weekend,

57
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,708
but we'II see you the weekend after.

58
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,044
-That's the 1 1th.
-If you say so.

59
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,379
You'II be 70.

60
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,797
That's right.

61
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,758
You're not gonna come in?

62
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,679
No, but give Morticia and Lurch my Iove.

63
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,224
FIick the porch Iight
when you get there, aII right?

64
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,935
-AII right.
-Good night, animaIs.

65
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,853
Say good night, honey.

66
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,356
Good night, Daddy.

67
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,817
Get your brother's hand.

68
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,028
Bye.

69
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,729
You're Iosing your head there.

70
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,148
Dandruff.

71
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,942
It's spit-up.

72
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,819
I saw your wife dropping you off.

73
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,779
Such a sweet scene.

74
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,449
Yes.

75
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,992
She has quite a smiIe.

76
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,244
She's getting back to herseIf.

77
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,455
How oId is the kid?

78
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,415
I thought it wouId be a IittIe faster.

79
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,834
Does she cry aII the time?

80
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,336
No.

81
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,921
She just...

82
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,218
There was a time when she wouIdn't
Ieave the house in a robe.

83
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,473
Listen, there's a point

84
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,934
when you go from going home
on the 5:25 to the 7:05.

85
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,606
If you finaIIy Iearn how to drive,
you can push it to 9:30.

86
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,067
You're getting the wrong impression.

87
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,443
Or not come home at aII.

88
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,990
Beth and I got into it so bad the other night,

89
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,868
I just jumped in the car and drove.

90
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,496
Made it aII the way
to some moteI in Rocky HiII.

91
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,831
Put my fist through a waII.

92
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,459
Howard, don't get emotionaI again.

93
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,961
Maybe she's right.

94
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,214
Maybe I am a IittIe seIfish.

95
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,382
I said I needed time with my thoughts.

96
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,676
She asked me what I do at work aII day.

97
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,514
They don't understand.

98
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,489
Greenwich. Next stop,
Greenwich, Port Chester, Rye...

99
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,325
Who am I kidding?
It's nothing a IittIe peace wouIdn't fix.

100
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,077
There you go.

101
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,254
Morning.

102
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,966
Of course. I'II Iet him know.

103
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,342
-Was that for me?
-No.

104
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,760
-Who was it?
-ReaIIy?

105
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,804
Fine. What's Don up to today?

106
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,597
I see a Iot of napping and piIIow taIk.

107
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,391
That's your scheduIe.

108
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,853
You aII had the status meeting
20 minutes ago.

109
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,605
Can't you sit over there once in a whiIe?

110
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,357
What if I have someone
important coming in?

111
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,360
When you have somebody come in,
I wiII sit over there.

112
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,822
Here, why don't you buy yourseIf

113
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,241
a fancy hat or a mask or something?

114
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,826
No, thank you.

115
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,619
AII I'm asking for is a few hours a day

116
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,872
where the worId might mistake you
for my secretary.

117
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,040
Joan said you were supposed to share.

118
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,333
And his phone rings more.

119
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,128
Joan's not here.
And you just took $50 from me.

120
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,382
Let your conscience be your guide.

121
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,227
That feeIs good.

122
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,315
That feeIs so much better.

123
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,358
Yeah.

124
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,780
I was right. Somebody was very wet.

125
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,283
When you were that size,
I used to change you every hour

126
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,535
whether you needed it or not.

127
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,788
I don't know how many times
I have to say this.

128
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,665
Those go in the cabinet in the haIIway.

129
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,167
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,711
I thought it'd be easier
if they were near your bathroom.

131
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,880
I didn't mean it that way.

132
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,423
I haven't sIept.

133
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,010
And I just feeI cooped up in here.

134
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,097
I think it's bad for Kevin to be out there
untiI I'm done cIeaning the oven, the fumes.

135
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,767
I don't know why you had to do that
on a hot summer day.

136
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,686
Anyway, I think we're about
to run out of formuIa.

137
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,230
I'II get your purse.

138
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
HeIIo.

139
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,862
HeIIo, you. We're gonna take a nap.
WouId you Iike that?

140
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,406
You want to Iay in the bed with Mommy?

141
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,663
A ten?

142
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,831
You buying his formuIa or yours?

143
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,626
I'II take him for a waIk.

144
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,461
Oh, God, wouId you?

145
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:55,302
You're gonna go with Grandma GaiI.
That's where you're gonna go.

146
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,482
CIose the door.

147
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,790
How was everybody's weekend?

148
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,418
Great. We aII went waterskiing together.

149
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,670
-Made a human pyramid.
-I was here.

150
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,257
SpIendid. So, I trust you're adequateIy
prepared for the Heinz presentation.

151
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,760
Yes, boss. We have aImost everything.

152
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,305
Just short Mrs. Draper's work.
She's writing the coupons.

153
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,889
Has Don signed off?

154
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,517
He's Iate, and so is she, coincidentIy.

155
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,478
CIara.

156
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,692
CIara!

157
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,738
She shouId have just roIIed over and said,
"Don, what do you think of this?"

158
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,947
I bet she says that every morning.

159
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,660
Come on, it's 1 1 :00.

160
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,043
-No sunbathing?
-No.

161
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,006
Look, we had a three-day weekend
and you didn't do anything?

162
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,633
That's not my caIendar.

163
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,303
CIara.

164
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,514
How was your weekend?

165
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,933
-CIara, is Mr. Draper in yet?
-No.

166
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,310
You're Iate for the status meeting.

167
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,063
You shouId probabIy go prepare
instead of moIesting my secretary.

168
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,525
WeII, sweetheart, the torture's over.
Let the fun begin.

169
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,654
My office is 30 yards away.

170
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,074
So when I hit that buzzer,
I'm trying to save myseIf

171
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,742
a trip through the miracIe of teIephonics.

172
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,038
Mr. and Mrs. Draper are here.

173
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,333
-Good morning.
-So sorry, we oversIept.

174
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,585
That's not true. I did.

175
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,295
How was MemoriaI Day?

176
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,506
It was nice. We had my kids.

177
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,135
You had the status meeting at 1 0:00.

178
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,680
-Morning.
-Good morning.

179
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,435
Did you read about Y&R's paper bag drop?

180
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,312
I did.

181
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,689
-I don't see the humor.
-It's funny.

182
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,109
I mean, if nothing eIse,
it serves them right for steaIing Pond's.

183
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,361
And what does one thing
have to do with the other?

184
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,696
They stoIe the Pond's account,
and now they're a Iaughingstock.

185
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,823
Makes me feeI better.

186
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,410
GentIemen, shaII we mosey on over
to the conference room?

187
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,577
We did have a meeting at 1 0:00.

188
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,955
Morning, Lane, cIipboard.

189
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,500
We shouId run a want ad
saying something Iike,

190
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,627
"SterIing Cooper,
an equaI opportunity empIoyer."

191
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,003
"Our windows don't open."

192
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,047
As tempting as it sounds,

193
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,924
I don't know if we need to be
spending money

194
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,467
to further their embarrassment.

195
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,178
Look, if there's no Iine item
for humiIiating the competition,

196
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,805
Don wiII write it and I'II pay for it.

197
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,557
But you're not aIIowed to read it.

198
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,726
Forget the want ads.
The advertising coIumn.

199
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,478
I want them to see it.

200
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,647
So, Heinz is coming in. Don?

201
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,651
Yes. CaroIine, can you get Megan
and the Heinz boards, pIease?

202
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,194
-Do you want the team?
-No.

203
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
-What eIse?
-Status is status quo on my end.

204
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,074
I'm supposed to have drinks
with Bruce Lewis from OIdsmobiIe.

205
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,909
He wants to know
if there's a way around Nader.

206
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,245
There isn't. Anything eIse?

207
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,539
Lane?

208
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,916
I have a Iunch at the 4As,

209
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,211
so I shouId be back in time,
but not necessariIy conscious.

210
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,967
And according to the memo,
Kenny finaIIy has signatures

211
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,470
from ChevaIier, GaIone, and ButIer Shoes.

212
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,097
Footwear. AII good news.

213
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,057
I suppose that brings
this meeting to a cIose.

214
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,601
Don, may I speak with you privateIy?

215
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,896
I shouId take a Iook at these right away.

216
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,566
Mr. CampbeII.

217
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,445
I have a caII of nature.

218
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,072
Do not begin this meeting without me.

219
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,367
When is he free next?

220
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,831
You obviousIy haven't seen my coupons yet.

221
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,126
-Let's get out of here.
-No.

222
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,878
Then Iock the door.

223
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,922
As soon as I'm in here
Ionger than five minutes,

224
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,798
peopIe wiII start to...

225
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,759
What? Who?

226
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,137
I have to get these to Peggy.

227
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,181
You have a presentation, you know.

228
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,273
I couId make you go home right now,
you know. I have that power.

229
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,653
Mr. Campbell is here to see you.

230
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,321
I just saw him.

231
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,447
I have to get back to work.

232
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,740
Open your bIouse.

233
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,159
You're a dirty oId man.

234
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,046
-Anything eIse?
-No, ma'am.

235
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

236
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,011
I asked for your first avaiIabIe meeting,

237
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,931
and it turns out
you have nothing to do today.

238
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,684
If you couId have any cIient in the worId,
who wouId you want?

239
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,811
-American AirIines.
-Why?

240
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,729
-Because they stood us up.
-Right.

241
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,233
So, I started thinking,
who has those feeIings about us?

242
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,278
Mohawk AirIines.

243
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,612
You were very cIose.

244
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,699
The company's in a Iot of troubIe.

245
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,785
It's very nice that things have not gone weII
since we cut them Ioose.

246
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,537
They want to come back?

247
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,664
After the way we treated them...

248
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,375
So, that American AirIines thing
isn't happening?

249
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,044
-I, for one, am very excited.
-Oh, me, too.

250
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,755
I just don't understand
the secrecy or the urgency.

251
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm meeting with them today,
and I think you shouId drop by.

252
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,761
Hank Lammott hit me pretty hard
on his way out the door.

253
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,971
I may not heIp.

254
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,890
Don, you're the big draw.

255
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,809
They're not going to ask for someone eIse.

256
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,271
Look, get through this,
get them back for more,

257
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,523
and I'II make time in my busy scheduIe.

258
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,151
Got it. I'II Iet you know when I need you to...

259
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,445
It's a good idea.

260
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,990
Can I get some coffee?

261
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,870
Oh, Megan, you're here.

262
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,838
I took a risk on one of them.
"Two for 22 cents."

263
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,382
Nice.

264
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,928
Of course, we're reaIIy Iocked into
the five-cents off, but good thinking.

265
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,058
Stan, can you do something to these?

266
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,520
Like what?

267
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,147
I don't know.

268
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,149
Do that thing with the border
around the edge,

269
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,609
so it kind of Iooks Iike IegaI tender,

270
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,403
with the can of beans
where Washington goes.

271
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,947
You want me to put a IittIe wig on him?

272
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,532
PIay with it.

273
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,034
Drop dead.

274
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,454
Keep asking me to be
more and more specific

275
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,748
untiI you're drawing it yourseIf.

276
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,500
-Do you want me to move?
-Oh, no, no.

277
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,336
-I'm just Iooking for gum.
-Oh, I have some.

278
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,221
So, I have to ask your opinion
about something.

279
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,473
You did a great job,

280
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,892
but I can't reaIIy go overboard on coupons.

281
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,103
I did that kind of baIoney for two years.

282
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,564
You shouId take comfort in the fact
that it's very important to the cIient.

283
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,982
Too important.

284
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,360
No, it's something eIse.

285
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,363
Tomorrow's Don's birthday.

286
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,116
Oh, shit. It's June 1 st?

287
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,327
I forgot.

288
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,912
Got to get him something.

289
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,081
I stiII haven't gotten you a wedding present.

290
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,417
Sorry. You know how busy I've been.

291
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,293
No, it's just...

292
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,299
I'm throwing a party for him on Saturday.

293
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,218
It's a surprise.

294
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,262
Oh, okay.

295
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,972
For Don?

296
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,890
Yes.

297
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,018
Men hate surprises.

298
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,270
Didn't you have Lucy in Canada?

299
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,566
Look, nobody Iikes it in theory,
but peopIe are aIways gIad.

300
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,110
And you've never seen me throw a party.

301
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,447
Everyone's going to go home from this
and they're gonna have sex.

302
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,575
Okay.

303
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,201
Sounds Iike fun for us at Ieast.

304
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,998
I mean, if I'm invited. I don't want to assume.

305
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,626
You're invited. I'm not sure who eIse is.

306
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,378
I went through his RoIodex.

307
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,716
I crossed out aII the cIients
and everyone he's fired.

308
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,135
That doesn't Ieave a Iot of peopIe.

309
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,139
Freddy Rumsen doesn't come to parties.

310
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,100
You have to invite Harry.

311
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,979
I know, but he reaIIy doesn't Iike him.

312
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,481
ReaIIy?

313
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,649
I didn't say anything.

314
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,112
-Frank KeIIer, his accountant?
-He Iikes him.

315
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,657
There are six phone numbers
for Herman PhiIIips.

316
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,660
-Is he important?
-That's Duck.

317
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,499
What birthday is it?

318
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,525
How'd he do?

319
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,985
He was fussy the whoIe time.

320
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,822
But the eIevator aIways knocks him out.

321
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,241
It must be the vibration.

322
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,744
Who wouId have thought
you'd be so good at this?

323
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,372
You'II be good at it, too, sweetheart.

324
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,166
What am I going to do when you go home?

325
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,294
Are you reaIIy going back to that office?

326
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,880
-You worked.
-I had to.

327
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,465
Your husband's a doctor.

328
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,716
It doesn't matter.

329
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,635
I promised, and they need me.

330
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,804
I'm not saying you're not important to them,

331
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,265
but they aIso know that priorities change.

332
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,809
-They shouId, anyway.
-Why are you doing this?

333
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,978
You don't know
how sick you're going to feeI inside

334
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,354
or what you're going to miss.

335
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,648
What he's doing now, that's nothing.

336
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,651
-Just wait.
-I know, I know.

337
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,902
I just...

338
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,614
I don't want to break my promise.

339
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,033
And Greg wiII be stationed
at Fort Dix for a second year.

340
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,577
I can commute from New Jersey.

341
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,287
And then?

342
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,790
And then, when he's done,

343
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,000
we'II see.

344
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,544
Joan, he's not going to aIIow you to work.

345
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,921
AIIow me?

346
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,426
Whither thou goest, I wiII go.

347
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,554
And how did that work out for you?

348
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,739
Pete CampbeII. Late as usuaI.

349
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,450
He obviousIy didn't come in
on a Mohawk pIane.

350
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,035
Hank. Jack.

351
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,287
You're not Iate. Roger toId us to come earIy.

352
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,291
Have a seat. You're onIy one behind,
but they're nucIear.

353
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,961
Roger, they're Iooking for you
back in the office.

354
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,755
It'II keep.

355
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,632
We were just Iaughing about Y&R.

356
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,092
It couIdn't have happened
to a better bunch of bigots.

357
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,556
Roger, it's an emergency.

358
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,308
ReaIIy?

359
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,727
Oh, come on. We just got started.

360
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,776
AII right, aII right. Sorry, feIIas.

361
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,611
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

362
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,324
You don't want me to fIy copiIot
or be your wingman?

363
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,410
Check your vaIises?
HoId your airsickness bag?

364
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,205
Do you want me to throw one
into the bag you're in?

365
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,209
You enjoy yourseIf, then.
Garçon, assume that these are gone.

366
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,337
I shouId warn you about these two.
They're a thirsty Iot.

367
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,255
AIways a pIeasure.

368
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,758
When you're done with him, just foId him up
and sIide him under the door.

369
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,263
I Iove that guy.

370
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,939
And so we take advantage
of this new microphotography

371
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,733
and high-speed camera to show...

372
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,321
A bean baIIet.

373
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,871
Spinning in air
with their deIicious perfection,

374
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,376
the beans pirouette in sIow motion,
they somersauIt in sIow motion.

375
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,963
Some of them spin cIockwise,
some counter-cIockwise

376
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,966
so they'II appear to be
moving towards each other.

377
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,051
UntiI...

378
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,930
They drop into a fuII can,
first seen from the top.

379
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,769
There's a spIash of mouth-watering sauce
as each one Iands.

380
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,025
Then we cut to the front, the iconic IabeI.

381
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,281
"The art of supper."

382
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,914
Have you done this before,
this speciaI photography?

383
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,084
It's been done before,
but you'II be the first on TV.

384
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,379
How do they get the beans to do that?
They can't just get Iucky.

385
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,924
This camera can show
a buIIet spinning in midair.

386
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,635
Where's the bite and smiIe?

387
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,472
Ken, you said there'd be
a bite and smiIe on the phone.

388
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,640
I think I said there was going
to be a bean baIIet, Raymond,

389
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,809
but I'm sure we can add that.

390
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,645
And what do they take away from it?

391
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,274
It puts beans on their mind.

392
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:26,321
It's an unforgettabIe image.
And beIieve it or not, it makes them exciting.

393
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,325
And it'II show you have a sense of humor

394
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,996
because, reaIIy, they're being portrayed
as far more important than they are.

395
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,874
You ever see beans up cIose?

396
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,336
They're sIimy.
They Iook Iike a bunch of bIoody organs.

397
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,464
And it's not just for feIIas Iike me
that saw things in Korea.

398
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,470
Kidney beans are caIIed kidney beans
because they're shaped that way.

399
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,556
But you couId caII aII beans that.

400
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,392
They Iook better in a group, in a bowI.

401
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,186
HeII, what's wrong with a spoon?

402
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,689
Don.

403
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,358
-WeII, heIIo, Don.
-HeIIo, Raymond.

404
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,236
Good to see you.
Are you as excited about this as we are?

405
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,737
I don't know.

406
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:11,282
You said to be boId.
Nothing on TV is going to Iook Iike this.

407
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:15,411
And just imagine seeing one of
these dancing beans on the subway waII.

408
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,580
PeopIe wiII hear the music in their heads.

409
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,292
Look, it's very artistic.

410
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,294
And I want to be boId,

411
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,838
but this isn't what I had in mind

412
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,757
when I was taIking about
a new generation of consumers.

413
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,510
The ketchup kids,
are they even going to notice this?

414
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,054
I mean, that waItz aIone
reminds me of oId peopIe.

415
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,723
Maybe I wasn't cIear.

416
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,059
This is temporary music. We can change it.

417
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,687
It's got no message.

418
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,650
I can see your point.

419
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,319
Beans...

420
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,865
Is the war, the Depression, bomb sheIters.

421
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,075
We have to erase that.

422
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,245
They have to be cooI.
Don, you know what I'm taIking about.

423
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,456
I want the kids in coIIege.

424
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,043
It's convenient. They have the hot pIate.
They're sitting in.

425
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,964
Okay. We'II work on that.

426
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,096
Maybe it's someone with a picket sign
saying, "We want beans."

427
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,558
You know what, Raymond?
This is ourjob from here on out.

428
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,643
We'II make you happy.

429
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,563
I'm reaIIy sorry about that.

430
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,275
PIease, this is a process.

431
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,903
Let me waIk you out.

432
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,624
What eIse you got?

433
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,460
That was the best thing so far.

434
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,754
UnIess you Iike this beans protest.

435
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,673
PIease, you can't be surprised that,
that man doesn't have a taste for baIIet.

436
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,258
It's a joke on baIIet.

437
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:55,345
And you can't be surprised
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

438
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,473
I'm not, but I guess
I thought you'd come in here

439
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,351
and teII them how good it was.

440
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,312
Do I reaIIy want to waste an hour and a haIf
shoving it down his throat,

441
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,731
onIy to have him puII the pIug
at the Iast minute?

442
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,858
This is business
that came in over the transom.

443
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,443
We didn't pitch it.

444
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,528
He has every right to make us work for it.

445
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,949
I wish I wouId have known that.
I wouId have saved this for round two.

446
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,284
We'II get him next time.

447
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,589
CaroIine.

448
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,924
Is he in?

449
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,468
He's gone for the day.

450
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,813
Damn it. CIara.

451
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,107
CIara!

452
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,818
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

453
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,571
-You want me to get some tissue?
-No.

454
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,908
I want you to teII me
why Roger SterIing was at my meeting.

455
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,743
-I don't know.
-I know.

456
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,621
Because he hovers over your desk
Iike a damn U-2.

457
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,083
-What?
-You think he's Iooking at your breasts?

458
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,210
He's Iooking at my caIendar.

459
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,630
-Did she hit you?
-Thank you, CIara.

460
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,341
You've done enough damage for today.

461
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,928
You need to Iower your voice. Have a drink.

462
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,596
No, no more drinks.

463
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,391
Heinz Iooked miserabIe.

464
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,352
They're making us work for it.
Don didn't seem worried.

465
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,603
Did you crash with Mohawk?

466
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,938
No, it was perfect.

467
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,026
Except for my deep nausea
and impending headache.

468
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,486
Oh, and Roger made an appearance.

469
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,448
WeII, that shows it's a good Iead.

470
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,199
It's my Iead.

471
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,493
Wasn't Roger in the service
with Henry Lammott?

472
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,745
Did you do any rowing?

473
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,707
-You rowed?
-I was a coxswain.

474
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,376
The boat moves because
everyone puIIs in the same direction.

475
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,130
I'm not supposed to worry about Roger.
I'm supposed to worry about other agencies.

476
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,466
You shouIdn't be worried at aII.
Business is stabIe.

477
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,511
StabIe is that step backwards
between successfuI and faiIing.

478
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,097
Fine, Pete.

479
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,807
Just don't be impatient.

480
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,684
You know how this works from here on out.

481
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,353
We start with a bunch of piddIy shit,

482
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,646
your Topaz, your White Knight CoIogne,

483
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,358
we add your mid-sized stuff,
maybe Mohawk.

484
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,360
We stiII got Vicks, that's big.

485
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,321
Next, we worm our way
into a few niche companies,

486
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,031
get something sexy
in a good neighborhood,

487
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,532
a pharmaceuticaI.

488
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,451
Maybe if God is gracious, a car.

489
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,996
And then, we go pubIic.

490
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,498
Open an office in Buenos Aires,

491
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,917
and EIvis pIays at Tammy's sweet 1 6.

492
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,254
Kenny Cosgrove writes
another great American noveI.

493
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,423
You know it didn't hurt
to have Roger warm them up.

494
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,467
There's no one better
at turning a meeting into a bender.

495
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,262
And they Iove his pickIed guts.

496
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,891
Am I going to see you
at Chez Draper on Saturday?

497
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,352
I wish I couId get overtime for it.

498
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,740
You ready?

499
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,283
We're aImost done, actuaIIy.

500
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,410
Do you need her?

501
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,329
No, it's okay. It'II be here in the morning.

502
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,539
Great.

503
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,332
Big weekend pIans?

504
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,545
It's Tuesday. I don't know.

505
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,632
I was taIking about me.
My cousin's coming in.

506
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,593
Stan, assume that you're working.

507
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,473
Good night.

508
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,727
You're amazing.

509
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,895
It couId have been worse.

510
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,274
-I aImost said, "I'm sorry I can't make it."
-You're not going?

511
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,652
No, my cousin's on shore Ieave.
He's onIy got two days.

512
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,903
A IittIe notice wouId have been nice.

513
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,489
I wouId have Ioved to have seen
the Iook on Don's face.

514
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,866
You aImost just saw it.

515
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,786
Like we have nothing eIse to do.

516
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,122
Did you beIieve him in there?

517
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,833
The guy didn't Iike it.
What was he supposed to say?

518
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,085
What he usuaIIy says.

519
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,172
"Hey, buddy, you got such great ideas,
open your own agency."

520
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,341
The cIients are right aII of a sudden?
I don't recognize that man.

521
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,178
He's kind and patient.

522
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,512
And it gaIIs you.

523
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,682
No, it concerns me.

524
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,603
Where are you going?

525
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,690
I've got tickets to the bean baIIet
and the curtain's about to go up.

526
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,943
Never gets oId.

527
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,214
You're home Iate.

528
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,261
I thought I was going
to have to waIk home from the station,

529
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,307
but IuckiIy there was
a cab driver Ieaving a bar.

530
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,726
How was your day?

531
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,354
I didn't want to disturb you.

532
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,150
This becomes a home
the minute you waIk through that door.

533
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,029
There's no fruit to my Iabor, Tweety.

534
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,532
WeII, I suppose none of this counts.

535
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,825
An acre of Iand, a wife, a chiId.

536
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,245
That has nothing to do with work.

537
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,624
I'm ungratefuI.

538
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,462
Dissatisfaction is a symptom of ambition.

540
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,674
It's the coaI that fueIs the fire.
You know that.

541
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,971
Do you reaIIy want a dog?

542
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,599
Maybe just a beagIe to scare off gophers.

543
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,019
We'II see.

544
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,439
Oh, IuckiIy my parents
can baby-sit Saturday.

545
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,651
Now, teII me the truth.
Did Megan reaIIy just invite you today?

546
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,362
She did. I don't know about everyone eIse.

547
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,740
WeII, she's very impuIsive. We know that.

548
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,118
I have to go to bed.
Tammy wiII be up in a hour.

549
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,036
Go ahead.

550
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,896
Attention, party guests.

551
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,317
HeIIo.

552
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,904
We're T-minus five minutes or so.

553
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:32,783
So, if we can bring things down
to a sotto voce,

554
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,118
that wouId heIp.

555
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,662
I'm gonna turn off the Iights.

556
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,122
No!

557
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,876
WeII, fine. Just keep it down.

558
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,046
My God, is he queer.

559
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,548
He reminds me of Lane's brother.

560
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,519
FinaIIy.

561
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,730
We're gonna go inside in a second.

562
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,274
You're the one that dragged me
out of the restaurant.

563
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,069
Come on.

564
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,786
You have to knock.
You have to knock to get in.

565
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,995
What if it's started aIready?

566
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,123
It doesn't matter if it's started,
you stiII have to knock.

567
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,628
No.

568
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,463
We were just in the neighborhood.

569
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,050
And my mother aIways said
never show up empty-handed.

570
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,845
Oh, damn it.

571
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,014
No.

572
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,735
Surprise!

573
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,863
Sorry, I bIew it in the haII.

574
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,118
But I am very surprised.

575
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,255
Don.

576
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,968
I have to say that I am honored and touched

577
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,929
to be incIuded in this group of intimates.

578
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,015
And I predicted this, did I not?

579
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,392
This.

580
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,440
Who is this?

581
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,150
Oh, that's my wife.

582
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,276
Hi.

583
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,570
-Nice to meet you.
-Charmed.

584
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,574
The domino theory is not a joke.

585
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,076
The Vietnamese are fighting a civiI war.

586
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,287
There is no monoIithic communism.

587
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,706
-It's an excuse.
-ReaIIy?

588
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,042
Come on, Bert. It's for profit.

589
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,461
Bombs are the perfect product.

590
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,838
They cost a fortune
and you onIy use them once.

591
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,633
So, I suppose this young man here
is coming home in a bag for nothing.

592
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,886
If he's Iucky.
You ever read Johnny Got His Gun?

593
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,931
No eyes, no ears, no nose,
tapping out his Iast wishes in Morse Code

594
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,058
with his deformed head.

595
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,479
I thought there were going to be girIs here.

596
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,907
For pureIy seIfish reasons,
I want to thank you for excIuding Joan.

597
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,576
I wouId have had to buy earpIugs
for the ride home.

598
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,620
It wasn't up to me. Can't you teII?

599
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,502
HeII of a party. Jennifer couIdn't make it.

600
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,339
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-No, she couIdn't get a date.

601
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,345
Anyway, I know she said no gifts,
but I got you this.

602
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,805
Open it.

603
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,017
You don't have to if you don't want to.

604
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,811
It's a siIver-handIed waIking stick.

605
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,979
Oh, Iook, he got you a cane.

606
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,024
Don Ameche has one.
It's a Steinway waIking stick.

607
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,069
You couId stick it up your ass
and have a concert.

608
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,029
Thank you very much.

609
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,031
Oh, my God, reaIIy?

610
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,912
A negro homosexuaI, a Canadian sexpot,
and unaccompanied redhead.

611
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,790
I think this may be my key demographic.

612
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,588
Don't. Just Ieave it aIone.

613
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,340
I know.

614
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,093
You're wondering
what they're Iaughing about.

615
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,387
It's not you.

616
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,568
WeII, I, for one, think
you're very brave, Megan.

617
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,986
My mother aIways said

618
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,155
a woman shouId surprise
her husband every day.

619
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,992
That's why they had no Iock on the WC.

620
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,368
It's true.

621
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:50,583
Look at you deIivering drinks.
We shouId get you a pair of roIIer skates.

622
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,167
Roger, I didn't know you were invited.

623
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,795
Or did you just hear I was coming
and show up?

624
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,757
Is he going baId?

625
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,017
It just goes on and on.

626
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,352
It's beautifuI, but it's very Ioud.

627
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,563
Listen, you can hear the traffic
even over this party.

628
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,398
I know.

629
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:18,777
Who cares? I just want to take my pants off
and sIide my ass on the carpet.

630
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,196
How's the summer treating you?

631
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,198
WeII, it's been good because it's been bad.

632
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,783
What do you do exactIy?

633
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,535
He's a journaIist.

634
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,662
Underground papers mostIy.

635
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,914
You may not have seen it.

636
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,291
And what exactIy has been bad?

637
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,794
WeII, I don't know.
Four riots in three cities in two months.

638
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,507
It is terribIe. And Lord knows
the poIice aren't much heIp.

639
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,929
I was raised sex, poIitics,
and reIigion aren't party taIk.

640
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,639
WeII, what does that Ieave?

641
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,308
I don't know. AIcohoI and work?

642
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,519
HeIIo again.

643
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,897
Trudes, which one is Jane SterIing again?

644
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,942
The gIamour puss with the tan.

645
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,320
Marry earIy and often.

646
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,076
We're thinking about smoking some tea
with Megan's friends out there.

647
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,079
-WiII you keep an eye out for Don?
-As Iong as you're just thinking about it.

648
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,582
You shouId join us.
Kenny gets brave and recites poems.

649
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,084
And she thinks they're good.

650
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,258
Oh, absoIuteIy.

651
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,010
Megan was the best waitress they ever had.

652
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,429
No, but I did get the best tips.

653
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,265
-How did you manage that?
-She Iaid on that accent.

654
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,934
You know, she's a reaIIy good actress.

655
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,812
Not good enough, obviousIy.

656
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,023
-JuIia, come here for a second.
-HeIIo there.

657
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,025
HeIIo.

658
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,444
-GIad you couId come.
-Great party.

659
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,696
You got a great spread here.

660
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,868
I just wanted to make sure we said hi.

661
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,330
I can't stay that Iong.
I have to go back and redo the Heinz pitch.

662
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,376
But I guess you know that.

663
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,922
Come on, Don.

664
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,053
What are you doing?

665
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,972
Was that bad?

666
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,058
HeII, Iook who you're taIking to.
How do I know?

667
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,480
Okay, everyone. My friends.

668
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,693
First of aII, I wanted to
thank you aII for coming.

669
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,069
And second of aII,

670
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,613
I think I've had just enough to drink

671
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,408
that I'm ready to give my own present
to the birthday boy.

672
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,953
Thank you. Thank you aII for coming.

673
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,580
I think we shouId caII it a night.

674
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,916
AbsoIuteIy not, Don.

675
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,044
You stay there.

676
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,379
Did you buy him a pony?

677
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,161
Happy birthday, baby.

678
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,961
Why don't you sing Iike that?

679
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,463
Why don't you Iook Iike him?

680
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,224
Je m'appelle Roger.

681
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:01,768
If I may raise a gIass.

682
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,729
Happy birthday, Don!

683
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,899
As I was saying.

684
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,150
To Megan,

685
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,904
for Ietting us see the Don Draper smiIe
usuaIIy reserved for cIients.

686
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,114
Hear, hear!

687
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,658
And to Don,

688
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,076
you Iucky so and so.

689
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,164
As a wise man once said,

690
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,167
the onIy thing worse
than not getting what you want

691
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,252
is someone eIse getting it.

692
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,302
Okay, now, no one has
caIIed and compIained,

693
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,763
so there's no reason
everyone shouIdn't dance.

694
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,954
I shouId probabIy cIean up.

695
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,414
Leave it for the girI.

696
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,667
She doesn't come tiII Monday.

697
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,962
CaII her and have her come tomorrow.

698
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,380
And Monday.

699
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,215
ProbIem soIved.

700
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,759
Did you have fun?

701
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,137
Move over.

702
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,640
No, I just want to sIeep.

703
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,933
Oh, come on.

704
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,143
I know you had a good time. I can see it.

705
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:29,022
I don't want to taIk.
I just want to go to sIeep.

706
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,233
Hey.

707
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,994
Don't waste money on things Iike that.

708
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,621
It was my money,

709
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,415
and you don't get to decide what I do with it.

710
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,711
WeII, couId you pIease not use it
to embarrass me again?

711
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,548
What?

712
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,466
I know why you're upset.

713
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,926
You're 40.

714
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,595
I've been 40 for haIf a year.

715
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,265
When is that gonna stop?
OnIy you know that.

716
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,017
This is your birthday now.

717
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,769
Fine,

718
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,022
I don't Iike my birthday.

719
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:14,818
I toId you, I never had it
when I was growing up and

720
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,945
I've never wanted it since.

721
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,239
You never had a birthday?

722
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,283
Didn't Betty ever throw you a party?

723
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,951
No, because I forbid it.

724
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,579
Why?

725
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,081
I don't need to be the center of attention.

726
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,751
You Iove attention.

727
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,712
You twitched every time
I taIked to another person.

728
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,216
More peopIe feeI the way I do
than the way you do.

729
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,219
Where's your research?

730
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,058
Fine, I'm 40.

731
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,393
It's too Iate.

732
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,024
Nobody Ioves Dick Whitman.

733
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,693
I Iove you.

734
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,321
That's why I threw you a party.

735
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,330
I'm going to sIeep.

736
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,457
You can do what you want.

737
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,405
Excuse me. Someone's Ieft...

738
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,658
There's a waIIet here
from some previous passenger.

739
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,327
I'II turn it in to dispatch.
They got a Iost and found.

740
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,542
There's cIose to $1 00.

741
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,836
Yeah, it happens aII the time.

742
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:47,220
I'd feeI better if I saw to its return.

743
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,809
You're putting me in a jam here.
The guy's gonna caII Iooking for it.

744
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,317
That's me.

745
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,531
You know what?
You do what you got to do, mister.

746
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,367
That's for you.

747
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,797
High tides and heavy surf

748
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,883
battered the coast of North Carolina today.

749
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,553
Force 20 winds and
heavy rain forced evacuation

750
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:31,765
along the coast as far inland as three miles.

751
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,052
That was quite a soiree.

752
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,263
Did Masters and Johnson come in yet?

753
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,181
They haven't passed by.

754
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,352
I shouId come and sit down
so I can see them sIink in, in shame.

755
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,605
You seem to be in fine spirits.

756
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,608
WeII, I didn't get into
too much troubIe on Saturday.

757
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,903
PIus, Mohawk caIIed me
at home this morning.

758
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,118
l hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce,
but l have your wife.

759
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,954
-Which Iine?
-Three.

760
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,206
-lt's blinking.
-They're aII bIinking.

761
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,791
Three.

762
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,003
-If you don't mind.
-I've caIIed a partners' meeting.

763
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,258
HeIIo, dearest.

764
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,802
Look, I know you were upset when you Ieft,

765
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,804
and perhaps I'm overreacting.

766
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,764
Becca, dear,

767
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,642
this is why I don't Iike you opening the maiI.

768
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,604
I onIy want to ensure
that NigeI is enroIIed in the faII.

769
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:04,482
NigeI's enroIIment isn't an issue
whether we pay now or not.

770
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,360
Then why wouId they attach
such a threatening Ietter to a biII?

771
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,031
WouIdn't you rather have your money
in June than September if you were them?

772
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,701
WeII, I worry about them
saving his spot for him,

773
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,328
especiaIIy with his marks.

774
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,875
I assure you that St. PauI's is aware
that we pIan on having him return

775
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,753
and simpIy wishes to earn
whatever interest they can

776
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:27,339
on the fuII amount
for the next three months.

777
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,843
Couldn't you spare that interest
in exchange for my peace of mind?

778
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:39,851
Lane, darling?

779
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:43,271
What? I'm sorry. I didn't get that Iast bit.

780
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,731
Nothing.

781
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,609
Don't forget to get the name
of Megan's reaI estate agent.

782
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,027
Yes, dear.

783
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,154
And her decorator.

784
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,830
ApoIo, you're so good with him.

785
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,584
I wasn't expecting you back so soon.

786
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,380
First in Iine at the post office.
It wasn't that bad.

787
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,756
HeIIo, Miss Joan.

788
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,716
Sink is draining.

789
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,219
Turns out it was a Iemon peeI.

790
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,682
I'm sure you know we're appreciative,
but Mother and I have so much to do.

791
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,517
I am busy, busy, too.

792
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,268
You don't have to rush off.

793
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,312
He doesn't have to rush off, does he?

794
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,941
When you need ApoIo, you caII ApoIo.

795
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,068
Miss Joan.

796
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,574
I want him to hear. That was just rude.

797
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,494
It is one thing to have him work here,

798
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,372
it is another thing
to give him cake and my baby.

799
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,167
His fingers have been in every toiIet
from here to the Bowery.

800
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,254
He brought the cookies.

801
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,132
If you want to go on a date with him,
just ask.

802
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,426
He's married with four chiIdren.

803
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,262
I'm just making sure
this apartment gets his attention.

804
00:50:57,346 --> 00:51:00,682
This apartment has never had any troubIe
getting his attention.

805
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,393
Yes, Joanie. Everyone's staring at you.

806
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,729
You know you're not exactIy
at your fighting weight.

807
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,063
Try me.

808
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,733
You asked me to come out here.

809
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,235
You can go home any time you want.

810
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,529
You shouId think before you say that.

811
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,823
I got my money's worth.

812
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,952
WeII, I wasn't going to show you this.

813
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,296
That doesn't make any sense.

814
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,342
Look, I'm sure it's not the way
anyone wants you to find out.

815
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,011
No, it's not in the want ads.

816
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,430
And, honestIy, they don't have
the money for more peopIe.

817
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,807
It's not more peopIe. It's you.

818
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,352
You Iove stirring the shit.

819
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,356
I am teIIing you something
you don't want to hear,

820
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,318
and you are making this very painfuI for me.

821
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,904
Megan Draperjust invited me to her party.

822
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,616
At the very Iast minute.
Don't teII me that girI's not conniving.

823
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,868
You think she wants you
around her husband?

824
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,664
I'm going to Iie down.

825
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,335
Sometimes Iife makes decisions for you.

826
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,558
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

827
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,901
I know your birthday was Iast week,

828
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,612
and I was toId you don't ceIebrate it
and not to bring it up.

829
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,823
Now I feeI Iike I got caught
with my pants down,

830
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,200
so I got you a IittIe something.

831
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,035
It's a pIant.

832
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,704
I just wanted to say happy birthday.

833
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,081
Kiss-ass.

834
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,000
Thank you.

835
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:05,473
I can get you some coffee,
but there's a partners' meeting.

836
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,101
-Nobody's there.
-It's in Mr. CampbeII's office.

837
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,479
-You want to smiIe?
-Is it your obituary?

838
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:15,358
No, it's the IittIe saIt
we rubbed in Y&R's wound.

839
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,154
It's beautifuI, no?

840
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,740
-That's Mr. CampbeII.
-ShaII we?

841
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,414
What?

842
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,750
We don't make fun of
each other's wives here. Understood?

843
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,588
Come on, I wasn't making fun of her.
I was making fun of you.

844
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,089
-You're happy.
-I am.

845
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,174
WeII, I want you to be happy.

846
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,010
Somebody shouId be.

847
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,847
You know, two weeks ago,

848
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,057
Jane asked me, "Which one's MussoIini?"

849
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,437
No, it's good. She's a great girI.

850
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,940
They're aII great girIs.
At Ieast untiI they want something.

851
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,319
Let's go.

852
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,571
They're just Ieaving now.

853
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,156
What, did they stop for a drink?

854
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,702
WeII, why don't you get off your rear,
find them, and teII them I'm about...

855
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,287
They're here.

856
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,542
GentIemen, if you couId sIide over a bit.

857
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,544
-A marveIous fete.
-Oh, yes.

858
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:19,172
I have instructions from Trudy
to thank both of you.

859
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,927
-Why are we meeting in here?
-Why are we here?

860
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,554
PIease, don't smoke in here.
I spent the morning choking on the train.

861
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,981
So, Mohawk is coming in.
I've brought them in.

862
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:39,067
-What do you know about that?
-That's great news.

863
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,402
-When?
-I don't know.

864
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,780
AII I was thinking is that
I bring Henry and Jack in here

865
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:47,200
to this very gathering of individuaIs,
but I have one question.

866
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,494
Where are they going to sit?

867
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,373
I mean, what kind of impression
does this space give you?

868
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,500
Do you gaze upon
the cement coIumn and think,

869
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,920
"Yes, I beIieve success for me
and my company dweIIs here."

870
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,589
Why don't you take them
to the conference room?

871
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,508
Because it's not that meeting.

872
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,301
Fine, we'II have it in my office.

873
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,679
This does not invoIve you, Roger.

874
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:11,599
Nor does Vicks, PIaytex,
Life cereaI, Samsonite,

875
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,977
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.

876
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,020
Need I go on?

877
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,231
What are you suggesting?

878
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,526
He's suggesting
that you give him your office.

879
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,487
-No, he's not.
-Yes, I am.

880
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,072
WeII, forget it.

881
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,907
Where am I supposed to conduct business?

882
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,367
In the crapper, for aII I care.

883
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:33,496
I'm a fuII partner and you're a junior,
so sorry, CharIie, but them's the breaks.

884
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,292
GentIemen, I'm sure we can find
an equitabIe soIution to this.

885
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,378
-There's no need for a row.
-You're right.

886
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,130
I say we put it to a vote.

887
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,048
I say we step outside.

888
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,391
I didn't think so.

889
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,814
Good work on Mohawk.

890
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,774
Thank you, but I'm dead serious about this.

891
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,236
I have too much responsibiIity
and too much business

892
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,739
to appIy my skiIIs in this environment.

893
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,908
You aII know it.

894
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,202
We'II buy more space.

895
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,456
-If we're handing out offices...
-AbsoIuteIy not.

896
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:19,292
I can't extend our credit Iine any further.

897
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,419
It'II work itseIf out.

898
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,756
CongratuIations.

899
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,844
When are they coming in?

900
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,930
I'm stiII not sure they shouId,
considering the situation.

901
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,859
Great party, Don.

902
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,778
AbsoIuteIy.

903
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,363
I couIdn't sIeep.

904
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,366
Those tits and that mouth.

905
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,619
She's such a sex kitten.

906
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,371
That whoIe dance. How did he just sit there?

907
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,833
You can't stand up
once you get in that condition.

908
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,295
I wouId have. I wouId have just stood up
and grabbed her IittIe French behind

909
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,547
and pushed her
through those cheap post-war waIIs.

910
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,257
-Hi, Megan.
-Very funny.

911
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,259
God, what I wouId do to her.

912
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,303
Like what, for exampIe?

913
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,429
I'II teII you what.

914
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,848
I wouId Iove to see those heeIs
on my shouIder.

915
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,018
"Je voudrais mas Harry."

916
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,561
Good morning.

917
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,605
Great party.

918
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,149
ThriIIed to be incIuded.
Jennifer was very jeaIous.

919
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,321
I think I'm gonna die.

920
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:32,907
You couId have warned me.

921
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,200
I did.

922
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,086
l have the owner of the wallet
returning your call.

923
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,130
Thank you.

924
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,758
-HeIIo.
-Hello, Mr. Pryce.

925
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,177
l'm calling for Alex Polito.

926
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:57,181
-And who is this?
-This is his girl, Delores.

927
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,770
WeII, when he comes into the office,

928
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:04,856
I think I shouId speak with him personaIIy.

929
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,441
l'm not his secretary. l'm his girl.

930
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:10,027
l'm like his wife, but l can't call myself that.

931
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,908
You don't sound happy about that.

932
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,786
-Excuse me?
-I'm married myseIf.

933
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,663
Good for you. What's her name?

934
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:25,001
Rebecca. Rebecca Pryce. WeII, obviousIy.

935
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,837
-That's a pretty name.
-I suppose so.

936
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:30,381
She enjoys it.

937
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:35,344
Do you think she's home right now,
lying in bed, talking to a stranger?

938
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,056
I shouId hope not.

939
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,851
So, you have Alex's wallet?

940
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,187
Yes, I do.

941
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,899
-And where are you?
-I'm at my offices in Midtown.

942
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,818
Are you in big business?

943
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:52,236
Excuse me?

944
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,072
Are you in a big office building?

945
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,618
Yes.

946
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:04,916
That's why I don't have the Iuxury
of Iying around at 1 1 :00 in my underthings.

947
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,919
l didn't tell you that part.

948
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,589
You didn't say I was incorrect, either.

949
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,966
Where the hell are you from?

950
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,885
You sound like Cary Grant.

951
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,346
I toId you, Midtown.

952
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:21,432
Why don't I...

953
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:26,771
Listen, I reaIIy shouId return this,
you know, the waIIet.

954
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,774
I couId sIip it in the post or...

955
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,985
Of course, you know,
that has its disadvantages.

956
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,946
There's a bit of cash here.

957
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,114
Or I couId hand-deIiver it.

958
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,618
Is this a current address?

959
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,250
l don't know.

960
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,127
l don't know if that would be proper.

961
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:53,756
No, of course.

962
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,927
Why don't you meet me
at my pIace of business?

963
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,639
I'II give you the address
or have my secretary heIp you.

964
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,643
Yeah. Why don't we do that?

965
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,561
And l'll come by when l can.

966
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:11,649
WeII, I'II be here the rest of my Iife.

967
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,903
Just a minute.

968
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,783
I Iook forward to it.

969
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,118
Why not?

970
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,078
ToodIe-oo.

971
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,579
That's cute.

972
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,503
ScarIett, wouId you give this woman
directions to our office?

973
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,338
She's on Iine three.

974
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,280
Mr. Crane, Mr. Sterling
has requested you in his office.

975
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,033
Is there a meeting?

976
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:07,163
He just came over here, said
he needed to see you, and walked away.

977
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,915
-Why didn't he come in?
-l don't know.

978
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,834
He knows you're in there.

979
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,338
Okay. Okay.
Did you see him taIking to Megan or Don?

980
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:16,756
l've been working.

981
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,883
-What did you do?
-Nothing!

982
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,607
You wanted to see me?

983
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,401
I did. Come in, have a seat.

984
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,446
No, that's okay.

985
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,406
I think you shouId have a seat.

986
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,117
Okay.

987
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,331
Now,

988
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:54,293
I think you know that we Iike to
think of this pIace as a famiIy.

989
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:57,254
And there are certain ways a famiIy behaves.

990
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,132
What did she say?
You have to hear my side of it.

991
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,426
Your side of what?

992
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,303
What... Nothing.

993
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,097
You're aIways up to something,
aren't you, Crane?

994
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,726
It was an honest mistake
and I consider myseIf reprimanded.

995
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:11,977
Great.

996
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,772
I was thinking Pete couId take your office.

997
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,399
ReaIIy?

998
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:19,360
Look, I wiII apoIogize face to face,

999
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,654
as horribIe as that wiII be,
but I think you're...

1000
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,948
There's no reason to Iet me go.

1001
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,618
You're not getting fired.

1002
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,287
And what the heII did you do?

1003
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,541
I made fun of Zou Bisou.

1004
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,459
So did I.

1005
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,295
Is that a crime? No.

1006
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,674
I tried to get Jane to taIk to me
in that accent. Nothing doing.

1007
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,884
She doesn't speak French.
She doesn't Iike me.

1008
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,346
I went home after and
Jennifer didn't know what was coming.

1009
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,014
-I was Iike...
-I don't want to hear that.

1010
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,017
No, of course you don't. Why wouId you?

1011
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:56,105
Look, I think you can understand
that Pete needs a bigger office.

1012
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,108
And just between you, me,
and the window washer,

1013
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,318
it's been decided that you shouId trade.

1014
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:04,989
-Who decided that?
-I did.

1015
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:09,160
I can't do that.
And I don't know that I have to do it.

1016
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:11,370
Do I?

1017
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,584
Harry.

1018
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,962
I'm asking you as a friend.

1019
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,091
And I appreciate that, Roger, I reaIIy do,
but I need my office.

1020
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,677
Look, first of aII,
Pete's office isn't that different.

1021
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,429
-I disagree.
-Fine.

1022
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:32,141
Name the most important person
you couId bring into this office.

1023
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,186
WiIIiam PaIey.

1024
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,855
Okay, so you shouIdn't do that.

1025
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:42,109
Trust me, network and studio executives
want to think you're out there jet-setting,

1026
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:46,155
rubbing shouIders with teIevision stars
and chorus girIs.

1027
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,782
You shouId be taIking to cIients ringside

1028
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:52,745
or at a three-star restaurant,
not coming into your miserabIe IittIe office.

1029
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,039
But I do. I come in here aImost every day.

1030
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,958
And Pete's office is a shithoIe
with a support beam.

1031
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:02,004
What if I were to make it worth your whiIe?

1032
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,714
I'm aIready head of my department.

1033
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,300
What wouId be an appropriate bonus?

1034
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,511
There's no bonuses. We have no money.

1035
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,429
How much wouId it take?

1036
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,681
WeII, first of aII,
it's more than you couId have on you.

1037
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,058
ReaIIy?

1038
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,104
That's $1 ,1 00.

1039
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,315
Why do you carry so much cash?

1040
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,567
It's more than 1 ,000, Harry.

1041
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:31,242
That is a month's saIary after taxes.

1042
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,456
There's no window in there.

1043
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,834
You couId buy yourseIf a very beautifuI
picture of something to Iook at.

1044
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,384
WeII, okay. But you're gonna owe me.

1045
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,554
No, I'm not. I just gave you a Iot of money.

1046
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:54,348
This is a transaction. And if you don't Iike it,

1047
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,268
we can have the conversation
you thought we were having.

1048
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,272
-So this is every month?
-Get the heII out of my office.

1049
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,510
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1050
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,220
I'm Joan.

1051
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:35,598
I'm Meredith. Can I heIp you?

1052
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,558
Joan Harris.

1053
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,519
I work here.

1054
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:42,688
Worked here. I've been on Ieave.

1055
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:48,402
Joan. My goodness.

1056
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,155
It's hard to beIieve you just had a baby.

1057
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,824
You don't know where I started.

1058
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,242
Do you want me to announce you?

1059
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:56,869
No, I'II Iet myseIf in.

1060
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,412
Are you sure?

1061
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,414
No one mentioned a new girI.

1062
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:05,461
I guess they needed someone up here
because ScarIett is now covering Mr. Pryce

1063
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,630
so that she can do the books with CIara.

1064
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,426
WeII, now I can understand
why I wasn't toId.

1065
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,137
Oh, my God. My mouth.

1066
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:17,598
CouId you just heIp me with the door?

1067
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,810
He's adorabIe.

1068
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,106
PIease don't be mad at me
for teIIing you that.

1069
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,776
I'm very happy being nobody here.

1070
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,946
I know a girI who had yourjob
who ended up with everything.

1071
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,285
Where wouId you Iike to visit first?

1072
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,120
I suppose my office.

1073
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,623
Yes, yes, absoIuteIy. Joan.

1074
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,918
My goodness, you Iook radiant.

1075
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:48,921
-Can I see him?
-I don't see why not.

1076
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,965
-Where's ScarIett?
-Go fetch CaroIine.

1077
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,093
Joanie.

1078
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:57,596
Look at you out and about.

1079
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,473
Yes, we're gonna stop by The Copa Iater.

1080
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,767
One of us badIy needs a drink.

1081
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,312
Lane made it very cIear
we're not hiring anybody.

1082
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:08,023
I don't care how buxom his mother is.

1083
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:09,775
Don.

1084
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:13,028
-Look at that.
-He's okay.

1085
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,952
HeIIo, Megan.

1086
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:23,414
HeIIo, Joan.

1087
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,586
I'm sure I'm not ruining
any surprises at this point,

1088
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,964
but how was your party?
I'm sorry I missed it.

1089
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:34,717
He's adorabIe.

1090
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,593
Are we weIcoming you back?

1091
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,012
-That was my impression.
-Today?

1092
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,432
-Do you want to hoId him?
-What?

1093
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,565
He's a IittIe cabbage.

1094
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,154
It's just a matter of time, Don.

1095
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:58,031
I shouId be getting back to work.

1096
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,829
I'm gonna quit whiIe I'm ahead.

1097
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,748
Joanie, I'II say what I said
when you Ieft here,

1098
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,708
this is not a good excuse.

1099
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,418
Nice to see you.

1100
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,671
-When are you coming back?
-I was pIanning on three weeks.

1101
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,591
My mother's Ieaving any day,
so I was gonna hire a girI.

1102
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:18,218
It's gonna be terribIe to Ieave him.

1103
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:19,928
Joan.

1104
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,308
I was wondering if you were going to visit.

1105
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,936
My hands are dirty.

1106
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:30,481
Oh, my God. He Iooks just Iike you.

1107
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:33,567
I shouId get back to work.
I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.

1108
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,818
Good.

1109
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,865
So, how are you?

1110
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,241
WeII, weII, weII.

1111
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,619
There's my baby.

1112
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,330
Now move that brat out of the way
so I can see her.

1113
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:47,873
HeIIo, Roger.

1114
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,542
LittIe dud Iike my present?

1115
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:54,171
I'm sure you're aware
that a bicycIe's not usefuI yet, UncIe Roger.

1116
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,048
Oh, no? He's a Ioafer?

1117
01:08:57,008 --> 01:09:00,427
He's been keeping me awake.
He needs constant attention.

1118
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,763
Is that right? Let me see that.

1119
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:11,355
Has anyone even seen this baby
with you waIking next to him?

1120
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,817
Scarlett. Scarlett, may l see you?

1121
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,193
I got it.

1122
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,115
Mr. Pryce, Mrs. Harris is here to see you.

1123
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,786
-Send her in.
-I've got him.

1124
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,705
CaroIine, I need you to
make dinner reservations right away.

1125
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,459
I'II be right back.

1126
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,801
This reaIIy is an unexpected pIeasure.

1127
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,553
Just stopping by.

1128
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,931
Anything I shouId know about?

1129
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,560
Yes, actuaIIy. Pressing business.

1130
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,689
WouId you mind?

1131
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,441
No, not at aII.

1132
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,866
What are we supposed to do with him?

1133
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,702
Better than the steps of a church, I guess.

1134
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,498
Have either of you seen CIara?

1135
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:12,708
No.

1136
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,127
What's that?

1137
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,337
It's Joan's IittIe boy.

1138
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,510
That's darIing.

1139
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,345
WouId you pIease take him
and give him back to Joan?

1140
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,265
Do I suddenIy appear to be wearing a skirt?

1141
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,601
SpectacuIar party.

1142
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,771
Just take him.
You shouId say heIIo to Joan anyways.

1143
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:43,113
CIara?

1144
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,866
She Iooks very good.

1145
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,577
She does. She Iooked good at nine months.

1146
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,496
I don't know about that.

1147
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,625
I'm surprised you didn't teII her.

1148
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,502
-TeII her what?
-That she Iooked terribIe.

1149
01:10:57,712 --> 01:11:00,422
You seem to say whatever's on your mind.

1150
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,466
Is something wrong?

1151
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,052
No.

1152
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,931
I got the Vicks coupons done.

1153
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:12,184
I know you thought you were
the onIy one working this weekend.

1154
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,978
No, I didn't.

1155
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:17,564
ReaIIy? That's what you said to Don.

1156
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,570
I know. I had too much to drink and...

1157
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:26,031
And you couIdn't resist
saying something obnoxious?

1158
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:31,328
WeII, just so we're cIear,
I put in a Iot of work on Heinz. So did you.

1159
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,331
You can't even apoIogize. None of you can.

1160
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:39,086
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

1161
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,422
What is wrong with you peopIe?

1162
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:46,093
You're aII so cynicaI. You don't smiIe.
You smirk.

1163
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,761
Is he mad at me?

1164
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,429
I don't care.

1165
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:52,015
Who wouIdn't want a surprise party?

1166
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,145
I don't feeI weII.

1167
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,108
Megan...

1168
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:03,902
No, reaIIy, I don't feeI weII.

1169
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:09,324
Am I aIIowed to go home?

1170
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,910
Of course.

1171
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,748
I'm so sorry. You were right.

1172
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,750
I apoIogize.

1173
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,295
It's fine.

1174
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,517
Heinz won't sign off on the work.

1175
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,644
So they won't be back in for 30 days,

1176
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:40,439
which means we won't get paid
for another 90.

1177
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,775
And we're about to shoot Christmas ads
for Sugarberry and Vicks.

1178
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,986
But they won't run untiI Christmas,

1179
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,530
so we won't get paid untiI Easter.

1180
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:51,825
WeII, that expIains why
you're asking me for aII this free advice.

1181
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,494
I'm just trying to get things in order.

1182
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,371
So that you can eIiminate my job?

1183
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:58,331
What? AbsoIuteIy not.

1184
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,251
-Then why did you run an ad?
-What ad?

1185
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:04,379
-In this morning's Times.
-Oh, that.

1186
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,590
That wasn't an ad.

1187
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,633
WeII, what the heII was it, then?

1188
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:12,095
It was some private barb directed at Y&R.

1189
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:19,644
Mrs. Harris, the books have
practicaIIy been heId together

1190
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,688
with spit in your absence.

1191
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,359
What about ScarIett and CIara
spIitting my work?

1192
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:27,569
SpIitting?

1193
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:31,531
The two of them together couIdn't operate
a parking meter. They're imbeciIes.

1194
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,870
WeII, that was a dumb thing to do.

1195
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:40,207
Oh, there, there.

1196
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:44,544
I'm sorry.

1197
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,757
I've been Iike this since the baby.

1198
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,926
And it's not him.

1199
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,553
I just

1200
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:58,809
keep thinking about what's going on here,
and I missed it too much.

1201
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:00,852
It's too embarrassing.

1202
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,646
Nothing's happened.

1203
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,233
Something aIways happens.
Things are different.

1204
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,736
Somebody teIIs a joke and
you don't know what they're taIking about.

1205
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:13,240
There have been no jokes, not without you.

1206
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,908
Not even at my expense?

1207
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,327
I'm terribIy adrift without you.

1208
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,665
It's just a matter of time
before they find out I'm a sham.

1209
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,336
Nobody came to visit me.

1210
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:31,675
They sent fIowers with some stupid card
written by the fIorist.

1211
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,554
There wouId have been a cake,
but you weren't here to arrange it.

1212
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:40,892
It's just...

1213
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,106
And I don't expect you to understand this,

1214
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:50,569
but my husband's been gone so Iong.

1215
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,029
And I know he's coming home soon.

1216
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:58,577
And even with my baby there
and my mother,

1217
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:01,746
I feeI aIone.

1218
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:06,334
It's home, but it's not everything.

1219
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,212
I do understand.

1220
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:17,095
Now, I won't have everyone thinking
I've made you cry.

1221
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,686
WeII, at Ieast teII me about the party.

1222
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,439
Mrs. Draper put on a bit of a burIesque.

1223
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,649
-No.
-Oh, yes.

1224
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,611
She danced and sang in front of aII of us.

1225
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,739
She was quite the coquette.

1226
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:43,955
I can't do it justice.

1227
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:46,499
And Don?

1228
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:50,086
I saw his souI Ieave his body.

1229
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:54,925
I can't even imagine how handsome
that man must be bIushing.

1230
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:57,928
Yes.

1231
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,481
I don't know how I ended up with him, but...

1232
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:11,942
Thank you so much.

1233
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,448
Mr. Pryce, I wiII be speaking with you.

1234
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,951
Let me take a Iook at him at Ieast.

1235
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,334
Handsome IittIe bIagger.

1236
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,678
Have you seen CIara?

1237
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,681
CongratuIations. We're gonna be
right next to each other finaIIy.

1238
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:45,016
What's going on?

1239
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,726
CIara, couId you excuse us?

1240
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,728
WeII, she obviousIy aIready knows.

1241
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,021
PIease.

1242
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,901
Roger, you know, convinced me.

1243
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:57,529
We aII thought it was best for the firm
that you have a bigger office,

1244
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,614
so I was asked to switch.

1245
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,908
I'II be right back.

1246
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,958
I appreciate your sacrifice,
but a bigger office was not the point.

1247
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,127
WeII, fine, then. I'II switch back.

1248
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,920
Roger didn't say I couIdn't switch back.

1249
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:16,256
I don't care what Roger says.
I am the head of accounts.

1250
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,592
I am bringing in aII the business.
I deserve the bigger office.

1251
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,720
It's a great office, Pete.

1252
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,389
It's very important.

1253
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,766
It's got the windows.
God, I'm gonna miss them.

1254
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:29,269
And you did this
because Roger toId you to?

1255
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,313
And aIso because I respect you so much.

1256
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,939
What do you want me to say?

1257
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:35,525
Look, I just need a pIace to hide
untiI Megan Ieaves.

1258
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,029
Oh, God, unIess she toId Don.

1259
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,614
She's not gonna teII Don, is she?

1260
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,618
I don't know what you're taIking about.

1261
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,207
Come in.

1262
01:17:58,549 --> 01:17:59,883
What's up?

1263
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,472
At your party, which was IoveIy,

1264
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,390
I said something
which I shouIdn't have said,

1265
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:12,020
and I want to apoIogize
if you had a bad time because of it.

1266
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,938
I had a wonderfuI time.

1267
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,232
WeII, good.

1268
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:20,487
The onIy reason I'm bringing it up
is Megan seemed kind of upset.

1269
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,450
I'm very sorry.

1270
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,660
I shouId not be aIIowed to drink
at work functions.

1271
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,454
Or at aII, honestIy.

1272
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,206
-What did she say?
-Nothing.

1273
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,833
But she went home. She wasn't feeIing weII.

1274
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,796
I'm mortified if I had something to do with it.

1275
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,381
When did she Ieave?

1276
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,965
I think she wants to be aIone.

1277
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,093
You don't know her at aII.

1278
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,637
CaroIine.

1279
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,931
I'm done for the day.

1280
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:56,272
Mr. Pryce.

1281
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,113
Yes, ScarIett?

1282
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:06,783
There's a gentleman here,
the owner of the wallet, Mr. Polito.

1283
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,119
He's in reception. Shall l bring him back?

1284
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,621
No, absoIuteIy not.

1285
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,873
Well, do you want to see him?

1286
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,960
Yes, I'II be out in a moment.

1287
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:18,920
Of course, Mr. Pryce.

1288
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,713
Thank you, DeIores.

1289
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,591
-Excuse me?
-I said... Just a minute.

1290
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:42,986
HeIIo.

1291
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:45,822
Are you Mr. PoIito?

1292
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,825
I am. AIthough there's no way
for you to know that.

1293
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,161
You got my waIIet.

1294
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:52,996
I contacted you.

1295
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,582
Thank you.

1296
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,500
WeII, I'm gIad this worked out.

1297
01:19:57,585 --> 01:19:58,877
HoId on.

1298
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,837
Just hoId on a second.

1299
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:08,928
Everything's there.

1300
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,229
So it is.

1301
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,943
WeII, you can't bIame me.

1302
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,779
My horse came in and then I Iost my waIIet.

1303
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,490
Then it came in again.

1304
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,203
No, that's not necessary.

1305
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:36,581
-You've got to take a reward.
-I couIdn't possibIy.

1306
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,377
My girI said you were reaI poIite.

1307
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:46,216
ObviousIy from the accent,
you're not from around here.

1308
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,551
No, I'm not.

1309
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:55,183
This is the way we do things.

1310
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,188
Thanks again. I mean it.

1311
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:02,565
You're a reaI gentIeman.

1312
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:23,670
Megan? Where are you?

1313
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,092
You're home.

1314
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:31,219
So are you. What happened?

1315
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,096
Nothing.

1316
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:35,640
You just Ieft without me?

1317
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,809
-I was upset.
-That's cIear.

1318
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,769
About what?

1319
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:42,438
Because my apartment is fiIthy.

1320
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,857
Where's the girI?

1321
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:46,693
I sent her home.

1322
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,829
What are you doing?

1323
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:00,748
I'm cIeaning up. I don't want to get sweaty.

1324
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,168
-Like that?
-Don't you Iook at me.

1325
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,754
I'm taIking to you.

1326
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:09,924
I'm cIeaning up.

1327
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,593
ReaIIy?

1328
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,971
Stop Iooking at me.
You aren't aIIowed to Iook at me.

1329
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,764
Then put some cIothes on.

1330
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,934
I said stop it. You don't deserve it.

1331
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:21,519
Come on.

1332
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:25,315
You don't Iike presents.
You don't Iike nice things.

1333
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,826
Besides, you're too oId.

1334
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,745
I don't need an oId person.

1335
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:40,955
You probabIy couIdn't do it anyway.

1336
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,206
Don't!

1337
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,876
-Get up.
-No.

1338
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,753
I don't want peopIe to think
you're getting this.

1339
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,005
You want it so badIy.

1340
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,549
I don't want it. I don't want you.

1341
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:55,762
You don't get to have this. Go sit over there.

1342
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,847
AII you get to do is watch.

1343
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,377
Where's Harry?

1344
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,170
Who cares?

1345
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:32,298
I'm sorry. Do you need to see Mr. CampbeII?

1346
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:33,466
No.

1347
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,929
Is Roger SterIing stiII here?

1348
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,055
Yes.

1349
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:41,766
I want you to Iet him do whatever he wants.

1350
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,726
And I want you to penciI in
an appointment tomorrow

1351
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:47,230
at the coffee shop in the ferry buiIding
in Staten IsIand.

1352
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:48,606
6:00 a.m.

1353
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:51,693
With Coca-CoIa.

1354
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,070
Okay.

1355
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,074
That'II be aII.

1356
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,685
I don't think those peopIe Iike me.

1357
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,646
That's not true.

1358
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:33,151
WeII, I'm not sure I Iike them.

1359
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:42,535
The reason I didn't want
you to have that party is

1360
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:45,163
I didn't want them in our home.

1361
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:50,126
You've onIy been in the creative end
of this business for three months.

1362
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,713
And being a secretary,
you don't know what goes on.

1363
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:57,967
There isn't one probIem that Peggy
or anybody in that office has

1364
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,553
that wasn't there before you.

1365
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,685
You think you're a spIinter?

1366
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:09,187
You're not.

1367
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,107
The whoIe foot's been infected for years.

1368
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,114
I Iove going to work with you because

1369
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,910
you Iove work and you Iove me.

1370
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:28,748
But I wonder if maybe it's not a good idea.

1371
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,670
I don't reaIIy care about work.

1372
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,006
I want you at work

1373
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,841
because I want you.

1374
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:52,605
I think we have to repIace the rug.

1375
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,945
Just because you see white carpet
in a magazine doesn't mean it's practicaI.

1376
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:00,112
It's beautifuI.

1377
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:03,533
WeII, I've taken a Iot of pictures
of white carpets.

1378
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:07,119
You have to have four or five on hand.

1379
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,832
I thought you wanted it.

1380
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:15,253
I just wanted you to have what you want.

1381
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:55,751
What are you doing?

1382
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:58,087
I've got to go to Staten IsIand.

1383
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,256
-What time is it?
-Shut up.

1384
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,596
An aboveground pooI?

1385
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,140
No, no, in the ground. With deck chairs.

1386
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:12,602
That costs a fortune.
You gonna dig it yourseIf?

1387
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,770
We'II see what happens at Christmas.

1388
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:16,856
I never count on a bonus.

1389
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,609
I'm not taIking to you.

1390
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,612
I hope to be dead by Christmas.

1391
01:27:31,038 --> 01:27:33,080
Do you have any money for the grocer?

1392
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:34,832
You toId me not to write any checks.

1393
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,417
No, of course.

1394
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,149
He's finaIIy gone to sIeep.

1395
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,815
We cannot caII security. They are appIicants.

1396
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,193
What's going on out there?

1397
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:48,239
They're aII here responding
to your hiIarious advertisement.

1398
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,870
Is it just me, or is the Iobby fuII of negroes?

1399
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,539
They saw the Y&R ad.

1400
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,375
The humor was Iost on them.

1401
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:02,128
-Not on me.
-It was a chiIdish prank.

1402
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,463
Because you're above that, right?

1403
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:05,840
What are we gonna do?

1404
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,800
WouId you Ieave us be, dear?

1405
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,012
TeII them the position's been fiIIed.

1406
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:14,306
There's the possibiIity
that we couId be the subject of a protest.

1407
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,434
Then we interview them. Forever.
They'II go away.

1408
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:18,644
That is not a soIution.

1409
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:20,396
And who's to say
there's not a reporter out there?

1410
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,814
I don't know why we can't just hire one.

1411
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:24,275
Because we're not hiring anyone.

1412
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,735
Just fire that receptionist.

1413
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,611
We can't have one out there.

1414
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:36,412
-What is that?
-It's from Young & Rubicam.

1415
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:40,624
It's a resume.

1416
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:43,210
"1 960 to '65,

1417
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,463
"toted dat barge, Iifted dat baIe."

1418
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,842
Did those peopIe out there

1419
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,428
see that artifact come in here?

1420
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,347
Yes. I'm positive.

1421
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,277
Good morning.

1422
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,404
I'd Iike to thank you aII for coming.

1423
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:14,033
