- Happy holidays, Mrs. Johnson.

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,830
Or are you more of
a "Merry Christmas" gal?

12
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,040
I need to make sure

13
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,334
you're getting
the right blend of tequila.

14
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,004
My name is Dr. Randall Kirby.

15
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,964
I'm here because your doctor

16
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,343
with the warm and fuzzy bedside
manner couldn't make it.

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,350
Your husband, Tom, tells me
that you're a fighter, so...

18
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,852
if it's okay with you,
I'm just gonna let her rip.

19
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,403
You came in for a cervical
surgery with Dr. Duntsch

20
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,863
a few days ago to remove a disc.

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,241
Do you remember that?

22
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,867
Do you remember going home,

23
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,911
telling your husband
that you couldn't swallow,

24
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,705
and then you got a fever?

25
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,209
Well, you called Dr. Duntsch,

26
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,212
who told you
that everything was normal

27
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,340
and that your fever
was from the flu.

28
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,176
Then he stopped
taking your calls.

29
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,348
Your fever wasn't from the flu.

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,644
It was from an infection
moving towards your heart.

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,980
Now, we've had that
PICC line pumping antibiotics

32
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,400
into your superior vena cava
since you got here.

33
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,652
You've turned a corner,
but now we need to deal

34
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,864
with the other issues
from Dr. Duntsch's surgery.

35
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,992
That crazy straw
coming out of your nose

36
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,577
is draining stomach acid

37
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,330
from a hole Duntsch cut
in your esophagus.

38
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,500
That's why you couldn't swallow.

39
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,463
As for the surgery Duntsch
was supposed to perform,

40
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,506
he failed to remove the disc.

41
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,843
He left it lodged in your spine.

42
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,056
The hardware he was supposed
to attach

43
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,434
scattered in there like a bag
of leftover screws

44
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,644
from an IKEA bookshelf.

45
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,281
He sliced through a nerve
to your vocal cord.

46
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,037
We can't fix that.

47
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,045
This never should have happened.

48
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:47,268
I apologize to you
and to your family.

49
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,484
I promise I will make sure this
never happens to anyone else.

50
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,657
Um, om wanted me to discuss
a family matter with you.

51
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,928
Your children are in town
for the holidays,

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,787
and you don't want
them to visit.

53
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,207
He's hoping that you would
change your mind about that.

54
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,472
I'll fend them off
if you provide the stick.

55
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,103
I'm so sorry.

56
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,954
Hey, thanks for coming.

57
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,750
It's, uh, nice to show a united
front with these jackasses.

58
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,128
Ah...

59
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,964
- Dr. Kirby.
- Dr. Lockett.

60
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,550
He's the CEO here.
This is Dr. Robert Henderson.

61
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,261
He's my crime-fighting
partner in crime.

62
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,347
- Yeah, uh...

63
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,350
would you follow me, please?

64
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,694
Duntsch never operates
here again.

65
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,422
- Well, I guess we can call it
a night, then.

66
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,281
No harm, no foul.

67
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,825
- How did you come to hire him?

68
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,620
- We needed a neurosurgeon
on staff

69
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,331
and performed all due diligence.

70
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,850
- You just missed
that teeny-tiny detail

71
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,668
about the two dead bodies
at Dallas Medical

72
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,103
and Baylor-Plano,
but who's counting?

73
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,004
- We inquired with
the Texas Medical Board.

74
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,006
We checked the National
Practitioners Data Bank...

75
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,049
- Continue.

76
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,426
- To see if he was ever
suspended.

77
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,261
He wasn't, no complaints.

78
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,890
- So neither Baylor-Plano nor
Dallas Medical reported him?

79
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,266
- No.

80
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,203
Look, had we known,
we never would have hired him,

81
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,728
plain and simple.

82
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,606
He even came with
a clean letter from Baylor.

83
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,737
- "All investigations
with respect to any areas

84
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,031
"of concern regarding
Christopher D. Duntsch, M.D.

85
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,991
"have been closed.

86
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,035
"As of this date,

87
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,846
"or administrative restrictions
or suspensions

88
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872
"of Dr. Duntsch's

89
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,374
"or clinical privileges

90
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,959
"during the time
he has practiced

91

at Baylor Medical Center

92
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,675
- Dr. Henderson, tell me...

93
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,219
you're in my position.

94
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,471
What would you have done?

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,436
- They warned 'em...

96
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,230
this nurse, Preston's her name,
she and some other somebody.

97
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,565
- Who?
- I don't know.

98
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,941
A scrub tech. It doesn't matter.

99
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,743
They warned the administration
about Duntsch.

100
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,920
They looked him up
on the Internet.

101
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,296
They found a ton of crap
about him.

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,405
I'm not talking good crap.

103
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,757
I'm talking he's
a crappy surgeon.

104
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,199
- I get it.
- Here's the kicker.

105
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,367
When they went to show them

106
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,161
what was on the Internet,
it was all gone.

107
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,621
Everything negative about him,
completely wiped way.

108
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,165
- Well, how does
somebody do that?

109
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,435
- I don't know... hacking's not
really my area of expertise.

110
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,420
The point is they warned them,
and they blew it off.

111
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,755
Due diligence.

112
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,548
We're up against
a citadel of bullshit here.

113
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,133
Most ass-covering...

114
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,927
In fact, I should use this
to wipe my ass.

115
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:08,928
Definitely...

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,305
- Written by lawyers.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,599
- Are we completing
each other's sentences now?

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,602
- Ah...

119
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,773
I'm going to see Amy Piel
over at Baylor.

120
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,318
- You give me a ride?
- Jag's right this way.

121
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,646
- So?

122
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,107
- They're gonna grant me
privileges to operate.

123
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,902
- They're gonna grant,
or they have granted?

124
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,987
They are going
to grant me privileges

125
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,740
when they see
my roster of patients.

126
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,496
Don't... It's...

127
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,498
It's not a big deal, Wendy.

128
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,291
I have a ton of patients.

129
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,794
All I got to do
is make a couple calls.

130
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,480
- Well, that place looks like
a Port-a-Potty.

131
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,672
Not like Baylor.

132
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,841
- Fuck Baylor.
- Yeah, fuck Baylor.

133
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,426
Fuck Dallas Medical.

134
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,052
Fuck whatever that last one was,

135
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,848
that Legacy Frisco place you
were at for, like, two weeks.

136
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,391
It's been quite
the fucking year.

137
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,935
- Can you just drive me
to my clinic, please?

138
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,941
- Where does it end, Chris?
- Oh, my God.

139
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,986
Wendy, I'm handling it, okay?

140
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,738
You left me, remember that?

141
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,531
- I don't feel sorry for you.

142
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,199
Why don't you go
fuck your nurse again?

143
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,326
Maybe she'll make you
feel better.

144
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,580
- I'm driving
your sorry ass around,

145
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,792
not because I trust you
or because I'm here for you...

146
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,128
but because I can't let you
mess things up for him.

147
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,077
- Can I come by this weekend?

148
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,662
- Why don't you make a call
to your roster of patients?

149
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,539
Then we'll talk.

150
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,687
- It's from my dad.

151
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,805
- Mrs. Demmings.

152
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,349
How's that Scheuermann's
kyphosis coming along?

153
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,060
Is the tingling in your legs
pretty consistent?

154
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,813
- I can't stand long enough
to hold my grandbabies now.

155
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,898
- And it started in your teens?

156
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,192
- Had no pain
until two years ago.

157
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:57,240
- The problem is these
two vertebrae right here...

158
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,575
T7 and T8.

159
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,952
- The ones sticking out.
- Exactly right.

160
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,954
It's actually the discs
in between them.

161
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,457
Spinal discs are like
natural shock absorbers,

162
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,875
and when they're healthy,

163
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,877
they kind of have
the consistency of rubber.

164
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,004
But when they get diseased,
they harden,

165
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,797
and these two are pushing

166
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,467
those vertebrae
right into your spinal cord.

167
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,636
- Every doctor I see said
there's nothing they can do.

168
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,722
- Well, you haven't seen me yet.

169
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,809
- What are you saying?

170
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,188
- Well, your preexisting
kyphosis is an issue,

171
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,065
- but there are new ways...
- Surgery.

172
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,776
- It's minimally invasive.

173
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,944
A thoracoscopic anterior
spinal fusion.

174
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,114
We make a small incision,
about the size of a dime.

175
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,991
We go in there
and pull out the bad discs,

176
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,243
and then we fuse the vertebrae
together with a plate.

177
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,496
And that's it.

178
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,747
- One surgery?

179
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,832
- In and out in about two hours.

180
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,793
You wake up... no pain,
no tingling,

181
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,228
and you're about
a good inch taller.

182
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,421
It... it straightens out
the curvature of the spine.

183
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,423
So the bad news is, you're
gonna have to bend down

184
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,109
a little bit lower
to pick up those grandbabies.

185
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,885
- Can I have a word with you?

186
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,076
I get that you're
the golden boy around here,

187
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,685
but you're a resident.

188
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,687
These are not
your patients, yet.

189
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,897
- I'm just presenting her
her options.

190
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,315
- You gave her a fantasy.

191
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,401
With her kyphosis,
she's not a candidate.

192
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,195
Raising her hopes
is unethical and cruel.

193
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,700
- I spent all night
researching this.

194
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,702
- You diagnosed her off
of Google?

195
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,036
- Just look at it.

196
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,455
It's a case from NYU...
worse than hers.

197
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,792
I can show you how to do it.

198
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,168
Just look.

199
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,047
Look, all anterior
decompressing arthrodesis.

200
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,049
- See the end plate?
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,553
- See the retractor?
- You see the angle?

202
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,439
- When the presenting symptoms
are pain,

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,443
decreased mobility, headaches,
and speech dysphasia,

204
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,903
what would your differential
diagnosis include?

205
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,531
- Cervical stenosis?

206
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,199
- Are you asking or stating?

207
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,951
Either way, it's incorrect.

208
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,079
Eventually...
you'll want to decide

209
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,081
if you're Semmes-Murphey fellows

210
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,125
or Semmes-Murphey dropouts.

211
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,627
- Dr. Skadden? Excuse me.
- Christopher, yes.

212
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,629
- Uh, um, I was...

213
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,174
- Wondering if I'd read
your proposal on obtaining

214
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,551
and culturing disc stem cells?

215
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,094
- Yes.

216
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,055
- Eliminates the need
for extraction.

217
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,599
Tons of potential.

218
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,309
I'd love to read more,

219
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,191
once you've fleshed out
the research you cited.

220
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,814
- Of course. Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Dr. Skadden.

221
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,816
Chiari malformation.

222
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,569
Speech dysphasia.

223
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,238
It's likely related to pressure
on the cerebellum.

224
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,366
That would be my diagnosis.

225
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,970
I'd really like to be considered

226
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,274
for your
fellowship program, sir.

227
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,627
If and when the time is
right, Christopher.

228
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,435
- Kayla, Kayla,
hey, I got great news.

229
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,189
Skadden read my proposal.

230
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,233
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry about it.

231
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,986
- Wait, are you leaving?

232
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,072
- Don't play fucking dumb
with me, Christopher.

233
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,950
Oxy, Adderall... it's like
a C-V-fucking-S in there,

234
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,010
and your name's all over it.

235
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,661
- The scrips?
- Scrips.

236
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,995
- They're for friends.

237
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,431
They're all friends in there.
It's no big deal.

238
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,165
- Okay, well enjoy your friends.

239
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,583
And whatever's left
of your career,

240
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,044
you stupid son of a bitch.

241
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,595
- Oh, this man's a hero.

242
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,806
Partied us under the table
last night,

243
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,224
then did his rounds,

244
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,602
saving lives
like Mother-fucking-Theresa.

245
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,690
- What the fuck happened
with Kayla?

246
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,983
- Kayla's cool.

247
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,419
Give her the night,
she'll calm down.

248
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,070
And if she does dump your
dumb face, I'll talk to her,

249
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,740
take care of everything,
like always.

250
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,533
You'd lose your big, ugly head

251
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,369
if I didn't tighten the screws
every morning, wouldn't you?

252
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,789
- I'm the one
with the big, ugly head?

253
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,124
- Yeah.

254
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,210
Oh!

255
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,046
Duntsch on the offensive.

256
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,174
Trying to reverse Summers
with a Granby roll.

257
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,051
But Summers dominates.

258
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,346
Oh, he dominates.
He dominates so hard.

259
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,974
Uncle! Uncle, uncle!

260
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,976
Shit.

261
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,483
Hey, Skadden said
he'd take a look at that.

262
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,735
You just got to come on down,
and we'll do some imaging.

263
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,986
Get you fixed up.

264
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,413
Whew.

265
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,831
I got to work.

266
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,347
Have you seen my LSD blotter?

267
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,147
How many hits did you take?

268
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,694
Oh, I must be
tripping hard, bro.

269
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,612
The letters
are all squiggly and shit.

270
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,198
- No, it's Cyrillic.
- It's psychedelic.

271
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,409
Oh, stem cells.

272
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,619
Is this for your PhD,
Dr. Doctor?

273
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,955
"Glioblastoma's
the most prevalent

274
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,915
malignant brain tumor."

275
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,459
That's harsh.

276
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,753
- The glioblastoma stem
is so dominant

277
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,589
that it takes normal cells,

278
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,259
and it changes them
into cancer cells.

279
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,302
- It dominates.
- It dominates hard.

280
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,096
- And everybody's trying
to figure out

281
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,723
how to stop glioblastoma.

282
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,683
But what if...

283
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:00,603
you could just program it
to make healthy cells?

284
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,398
- Then it... it wouldn't be
cancer anymore.

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,233
- Right.

286
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,402
Exactly right.

287
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,696
It can be whatever you want.

288
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:13,116
A cell that takes over
another cell

289
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,201
to make something good.

290
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,621
- A molecular biological
Granby roll.

291
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,374
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

292
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,627
Stem cells you inject
directly into a diseased disc,

293
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,505
making a brand-new
healthy baby spine.

294
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,966
- Preach.
- 50% of all spinal surgeries

295
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,551
are to repair diseased discs.

296
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,262
- We're talking about a startup.
- You're Dock Ellis.

297
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,515
You're pitching a no-hitter.
You're crushing it.

298
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,850
I can be your guinea pig.

299
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,060
- What?

300
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,370
- Inject that shit into my neck,

301
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,314
so I can grow a new baby neck
with no pain.

302
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,649
Pain's a pain, bro.

303
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,992
That could be your slogan.

304
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,931
Fuck.

305
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,265
Fuck!

306
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,216
Shit.

307
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,373
- Bob.
- Hello.

308
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,458
- What a surprise.
- Hey, Amy.

309
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,253
- Afternoon, Randy.

310
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,714
So how can I help you?

311
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,510
- Christopher Duntsch.
- Oh, boy.

312
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,471
Well, that about sums it up.

313
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:09,723
- He operated on a patient

314
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,142
at Legacy Frisco a few days ago.

315
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,810
- He left a hole
in her esophagus,

316
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,687
sliced through her vocal cord.

317
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:20,692
- We parted ways with
Dr. Duntsch almost a year ago.

318
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,486
- Well, what can you tell us
about this reference

319
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,071
that you wrote for Dr. Duntsch?

320
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,573
- I didn't write anything.

321
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,414
- Well, whatever law firm
you paid to write...

322
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,760
- And it isn't
a reference letter.

323
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,470
It's a letter stating there
were no restrictions

324
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,996
or suspensions
of his privileges.

325
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,123
- But it implies that there's
nothing in this record

326
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,625
to preclude him from working
at other hospitals.

327
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,169
He... he maimed people here.

328
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,920
He killed Shelley Brennan

329
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,131
by drilling
through her vertebral artery.

330
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,675
- He also did that to another
patient at Dallas Medical.

331
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,510
- Shouldn't that have
precluded him

332
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,387
from employment
at other hospitals?

333
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,809
- I have to be careful
about what I say right now.

334
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,686
Whoa.

335
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,855
I feel like I'm in the fucking
Twilight Zone here,

336
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:02,400
like I'm staring
at the face of a coverup.

337
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,943
- That's offensive.

338
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,737
- Oh, well,
I'll make sure to pass on

339
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,697
how offended you are
to his other victims.

340
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,200
- Facts were disputed
in some of his surgeries here.

341
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,659
- Surgeries?

342
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,870
Yeah, I saw one of his
"surgeries" here firsthand.

343
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,455
- And yet somehow, Dr. Kirby,

344
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,832
I didn't receive your complaint.

345
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,085
Our letter for Dr. Duntsch

346
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,671
is our fair and honest
appraisal of his standing

347
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,255
at this institution.

348
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,882
- Was Duntsch ever suspended?

349
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,093
Your letter indicates that
he was under investigation,

350
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,302
and since it's your policy

351
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,805
to suspend any doctor
under investigation,

352
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,015
I assume that you followed
through with your policy.

353
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,559
- Yes, you're correct. We did.

354
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,061
As I recall, it was 21 days.

355
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:41,022
Well, that's convenient.

356
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,399
- Excuse me?

357
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,775
- National Practitioner
Data Bank.

358
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,236
- That thing established
by Congress...

359
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,445
- I know.
- To warn the public

360
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,322
and other hospitals
about bad doctors.

361
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:50,949
- I know.
- You only have to report

362
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,743
the ones that are suspended
for 30 days or more.

363
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,412
- How come
you didn't report Duntsch

364
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,996
to the Texas Medical Board?

365
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,793
- I think we're done here.

366
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,629
- Can I ask you
a personal question?

367
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,048
Would you let Duntsch
operate on you?

368
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,929
- Lies of omission
do not make this institution

369
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,141
any less complicit, Ms. Piel.

370
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,309
- Nobody here is gonna help us.

371
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,246
- I'm not sure what kind
of help we're looking for.

372
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,998
- Come on, we can be sitting
in Skadden's office

373
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,148
in a few hours.

374
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,816
- We spoke to him already.
- I know.

375
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,276
- He says he
doesn't know anything.

376
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,610
- I know!

377
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,446
Come on, waste some time
with me.

378
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,407
Maybe we'll find out U.T.
turned out a fraud.

379
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,680
- Hi, everybody.

380
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,432
So sorry I'm late.

381
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,059
Katya, Dr. Duntsch.

382
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,311
Ilya, Dr. Duntsch.

383
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,146
Welcome to DiscGenics.

384
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,648
Thank you all so much
for coming.

385
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,109
That's for you. That's for you.

386
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,277
For you, sir.

387
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,072
And do you mind
passing those around?

388
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:15,575
I just need some vitamin C.
Be right back.

389
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,346
Okay.

390
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,723
Sorry about that.

391
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:43,770
Now, let me tell you
why you're all here.

392
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:46,648
I'm hoping that you will
continue to be interested

393
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,525
in what it is that I'm trying
to accomplish,

394
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,485
maybe financially interested.

395
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,736
- We already know.

396
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,197
- Our work
with osteosarcoma stem cells...

397
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,532
it's a simple deduction.

398
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:58,284
You wish to research
spinal cancer.

399
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,703
Nyet.

400
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,913
Nothing so basic.

401
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,207
I brought you here because
of your cancer research.

402
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,917
I practically memorized
your paper

403
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,211
on phenotypical heterogeneity
of neural cells.

404
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,880
But, look, we can all cure
cancer another day.

405
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,383
Right now your research
can be exploited

406
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:17,387
to create stem cells
to grow new spinal discs.

407
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,681
Eliminate the need for surgery.

408
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:22,225
That's what we're doing here
at DiscGenics.

409
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,112
- I question if you understand
the most basic science.

410
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,366
- Um...

411
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,161
may I see that for one second?
Thank you.

412
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:45,999
Um, if you'll all turn
to page...

413
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,959
13.

414
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,379
This is your work
in spherical clone generation.

415
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,924
You were able to demonstrate
stem cell markers OCT 3/4,

416
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:58,136
NANOG, and STAT3,
unless I misunderstood.

417
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,930
- That is correct.
- Right, but unlike with STAT3,

418
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,059
where there was robust
expression in both spheres

419
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,103
and adherent cultures,
NANOG and OCT 3/4

420
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,105
had more variable patterns
of expression.

421
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:13,026
Ergo, the key determinant in
self-renewal and pluripotency

422
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:17,405
for stem cells in embryonic
settings are variable.

423
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,116
Am I right?

424
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,286
I'm right. So all I'm asking
is that we take your work

425
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,205
into stem cell
self-renewal markers,

426
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:28,750
and we use it to create
a new cell therapy.

427
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,794
We build stem cells

428
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:34,047
to repair diseased spinal discs.

429
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,468
Will you help me out?

430
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,143
Well, what do you think?

431
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:49,771
Definitely intrigued.

432
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,483
- Outside the obvious,
how can I help?

433
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,777
- Honestly...

434
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,280
My surgical reps are killing me.

435
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:02,075
You know, there's only
so many hours in the day.

436
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:05,120
- You are an M.D./PhD.

437
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,914
You have to be able
to balance both.

438
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,624
You look tired.

439
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,085
Yeah.

440
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,921
I'm burning the candle
at both ends and the middle.

441
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,969
- A little friendly word...

442
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,471
if I had a future ahead of me
as bright as yours,

443
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:27,517
I would never want to be a
minute late showing up for it.

444
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,728
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

445
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,523
- I'm gonna go press some flesh.

446
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,255
- Today I will be performing

447
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:00,592
an anterior cervical
discectomy and fusion.

448
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:04,054
The vertebral bodies are
exposed, and so is the disc.

449
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,973
Chris, I'm thinking DiscGenics
is gonna need some more money.

450
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,850
- What do you mean?

451
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,935
- You should meet
with some investment bankers.

452
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,104
I am drilling directly
into the disc

453
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:17,692
until I encounter the posterior
longitudinal ligament.

454
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,986
Beyond that is the spinal cord.

455
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,447
- Before I get the patent?
- The PLL is pierced.

456
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,742
Inside the diseased disc
resembles crabmeat.

457
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:29,537
I use a nerve hook
to remove the disc

458
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,873
and decompress the spinal cord.

459
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:34,167
It's classic
chicken-and-the-egg.

460
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,544
Private equity
is a lusty courtship.

461
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,254
The spinal cord is the white,

462
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,716
glossy structure with a juicy
blood vessel on top,

463
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,718
and that is the dura.

464
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,553
Now, we tease out...

465
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:55,563
We now tease out the disc.

466
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,404
Dr. Duntsch has successfully
removed the disc.

467
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,988
Well done.

468
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,574
Don't worry.
You'll get your patent, Chris.

469
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,536
And you and your company
will make us obsolete.

470
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,414
- We now drill holes

471
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:16,543
for the twin screws
in the vertebra.

472
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,378
You ready?

473
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,762
The only useful thing
you learned at Harvard

474
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,556
was how to name-drop
the word Harvard

475
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,974
into any given conversation.

476
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,727
Oh, here are
our two esteemed visitors

477
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,103
I was telling you about...

478
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,272
Dr. Robert Henderson
and Dr. Randall Kirby.

479
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,441
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance

480
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,442
in the flesh, gentlemen.

481
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,694
Dr. Kirby went
to Rice University

482
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,571
and Baylor College of Medicine.

483
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,490
And Dr. Henderson...

484
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,951
I'm so sorry.
I-I'm completely forgetting.

485
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,995
Uh, where did you get your M.D.?

486
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,956
- University of Nebraska.
- Yes.

487
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:58,418
Right, right.
Um, go, Corn Huskers.

488
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:04,424
- Duntsch's friend, if you can
believe he actually had one.

489
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,634
- Turned him
into a quadriplegic.

490
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,136
As of today, he's closing in

491
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,472
on two dozen
botched surgeries...

492
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,766
holes that drilled
through muscle,

493
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,559
nerves severed, arteries.

494
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:18,188
I mean, the guy can't define
basic regional anatomy.

495
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:20,065
- He approaches spinal surgery

496
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,693
like a child
playing with Tinkertoys.

497
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,863
- This is not
the Christopher Duntsch I knew.

498
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,493
These things here, I...

499
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,661
I never saw.

500
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,038
I just can't explain it.

501
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,557
- Well, perhaps
you could help us unpack

502
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,458
the reference you provided
for Duntsch?

503
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,460
- Of course.

504
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:42,420
- He met all
of his training hours?

505
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,048
- Yes, though I-I can't speak
to his... his residency.

506
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,633
You'd have to check
with them for that.

507
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,527
- I'm sure you wouldn't have
included him in your fellowship

508
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,321
if you didn't think he was
properly trained, correct?

509
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,388
- Correct.

510
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:53,431
- You oversaw his
surgical reps here?

511
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:54,474
- Yes.

512
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,726
And if you were one
of my fellows

513
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,895
and I was watching

514
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:01,314
and you did
what you've shown me here,

515
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,441
that would be the end
of your fellowship.

516
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,068
- Any drugs?

517
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,319
- I never saw anything

518
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:07,862
that would lead me
to that conclusion.

519
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,197
- Psychiatric issues?

520
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,824
- He may have sought counseling.

521
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,243
A lot of students do.

522
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:16,246
I'm afraid that's really all
I can help you with.

523
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:19,249
- With all due respect, I have
to disagree with you there.

524
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,751
- His references are
the bedrock to his bullshit.

525
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,294
He can get credentialed
anywhere.

526
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,671
- You're in a unique position

527
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:27,090
to tell them
what you know about Dallas.

528
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,884
- I did,
on the form for Forest Park.

529
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,928
I mentioned poor outcomes
at Baylor.

530
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,055
- But not Dallas Medical?
- No, no.

531
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,391
They wanted the form back
immediately.

532
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,728
So I checked the boxes
as requested,

533
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,063
stated that he was...

534
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:45,066
satisfactory, which he was.

535
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,152
- If it had been me,

536
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,195
I would have done everything
in my power to say,

537
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,655
"No, I cannot recommend him."

538
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,907
- I can read you the form
for privileges,

539
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,868
but it only relates
to his time here.

540
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:58,121
You're only allowed to attest
to what you directly observe,

541
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,707
that period of time
the observation is made,

542
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,417
and your role as observer...

543
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,669
what happened
during his training.

544
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,759
- What about the images
we've provided you with?

545
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,470
Yeah.

546
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,263
Yeah, I'm sorry.

547
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,767
I-I'm afraid I'd have to throw
the ball back to Dallas.

548
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:22,395
What happened, he did in Texas.

549
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,105
Makes you think
the hospitals there

550
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,732
will take any surgeon
with a pulse.

551
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,114
I see why you're so upset...

552
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,992
these hospitals
not reporting him,

553
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:39,120
Not vetting him properly.

554
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,916
But this is a Texas problem...

555
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:45,627
not a Tennessee problem.

556
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,477
Hi, it's Christopher Duntsch.

557
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,521
Dr. Christopher Duntsch calling.

558
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:07,107
Uh, just following up
on that exam you had

559
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,650
a couple of months ago.

560
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,961
I just wanted to see if you're
still interested in surgery

561
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,529
to correct all that pain.

562
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,614
I'm still working
out of Baylor-Plano,

563
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,450
but I did actually start
working at another hospital.

564
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,746
I'm just following up.
How's that neck pain?

565
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:22,831
A tingling foot?

566
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,958
The exam is free.

567
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,005
You are interested.

568
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,257
Oh, you moved.

569
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,259
Out of state.

570
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,805
You know, January is
Spinal Health Awareness Month.

571
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,557
Hello?

572
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,852
Mrs. Bloom?

573
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,645
He passed.

574
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,276
I will say hi to Jerry for you.

575
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,028
Kim is great.

576
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,487
Yeah.

577
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:57,240
No, she's great.

578
00:35:57,282 --> 00:36:00,452
Well, Jerry...

579
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,787
moved on.

580
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,124
That's a hairline fracture.

581
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,286
You... you could be paralyzed
if you don't correct it.

582
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,549
Kim is great.

583
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,555
Yes.

584
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,015
Yes, yes.

585
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:25,810
I promise I'll never call back.

586
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,362
- Dr. Duntsch?

587
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,618
The Dr. Duntsch?

588
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,388
- Can I help you?
- We're kind of closing up.

589
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,455
- Uh, I'm Stan Novak.

590
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,290
I, uh, found 'em in your door.

591
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:31,751
- Oh, it's that
damn office manager...

592
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,670
so scatterbrained.

593
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:40,510
When did you hurt your neck?

594
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,470
- Motorcycle crash
six years ago.

595
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:45,640
I've had five back surgeries.

596
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,309
How'd you know it was my neck?

597
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:51,730
It's kind of what I do
for a living.

598
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,982
Let me guess...

599
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,316
when the spasms happen,

600
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:56,901
it feels like an electric shock?

601
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:58,486
- Oh, any little thing
sets 'em off.

602
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,822
Sometimes hits me
when I'm driving.

603
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,323
I almost go off the road.

604
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,784
- Yeah, that's Lhermitte's sign.

605
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,328
We're looking
at a cervical fusion.

606
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,539
You got severe compression
of the spinal cord,

607
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:12,334
but if we decompress that,
you'll have a full recovery.

608
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:17,339
I've seen so many doctors,
but I wanted you.

609
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,050
Saw your award video.

610
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:23,219
Best Docs.

611
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,102
- Two reasons why patients
normally present

612
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,605
to their doctors for pain
related to the spine...

613
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:36,691
the first is related to
the peripheral nervous system.

614
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,193
That's called radiculopathy.

615
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,904
Now, that's normally
associated with compression

616
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,530
or degenerative changes

617
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,949
to the spinal structure
irritating the nerve, or...

618
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:48,036
- Award for best doctor
in Texas, huh?

619
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,392
You caught me in the middle
of an expansion.

620
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:56,169
I'm a little short-staffed
right now.

621
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,838
- You can still do it, right?

622
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,840
- I'm all booked up at Baylor,

623
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,967
but I did just start
at University General.

624
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,845
I can squeeze you in there.

625
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,653
- We get the process, Duntsch.

626
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,863
- And we do
like disruptive tech.

627
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:25,532
- Then you're gonna
love DiscGenics.

628
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,009
- Oh, it's just that
I was forced to take

629
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,803
the "D to a C" program,
in high-school biology, so...

630
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,412
- I put the fucking
A in AP chem,

631
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,871
and I still don't get
what it does.

632
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:33,289
- Okay, brass tacks...

633
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:34,708
I'm inventing

634
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:37,043
an injectable fountain
of youth for the spine.

635
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,046
- Work for his wanker?
- That's phase two.

636
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:41,589
- Hey, there's hope.

637
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,384
- Look, simply put, stem cells
take over diseased cells

638
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,219
in spinal discs and repair them.

639
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:48,972
- How far along is it?

640
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,766
- We're looking for partners
right now to raise capital

641
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,811
based on lead assets
that we've already generated.

642
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:56,563
I mean, look, I am developing
a key process

643
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,356
in the manipulation
of stem cells,

644
00:39:58,398 --> 00:39:59,899
but, equally important,

645
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:02,610
our competitors are going
to need to use this step

646
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:04,404
if they want to play
in our space.

647
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:07,032
We'll own it,
and they'll have to pay.

648
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:09,617
- And how'd you come up
with the concept?

649
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,620
LSD.

650
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:14,289
- I knew it.
- I knew it.

651
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,167
- ♪ Bass down low,

Yo, what the fuck's a MISI?

656
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,846
- Minimally Invasive
Spine Institute...

657
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,139
M-I-S-I, MISI.

658
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,017
- Minimally invasive spines
are your jam, man.

659
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,270
Too many choices.
What are you gonna do?

660
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,855
- What are we gonna do?

661
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,168
I don't think you should
sell anymore, you know?

662
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,193
- Come on, man.

663
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:45,236
- It's no big deal.
- No, no.

664
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:47,072
Come with me.

665
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:50,283
- Where?

666
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,661
- I got job offers in Dallas,
California, wherever.

667
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,039
- What am I gonna do?
- You already live with me.

668
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,415
You drive me.

669
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,125
We're best friends, right?

670
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,294
- Goddamn right we are.

671
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,880
Wherever you go,
I'll work for you.

672
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:08,468
Hey, how about director
of marketing?

673
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,845
Preach the empire of Duntsch.

Just wanted to introduce myself.

684
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,373
- Get out of here.
- My name's Chris.

685
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,208
- What's yours?
- I paid for this, Chris.

686
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,668
Back the fuck off.

687
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,396
- Touch my friend again,
I'll break your spine,

688
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,797
and you'll have to pay him
to fix it.

689
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,508
- So, what's your name?
- Crystale.

690
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,510
It's a little early
for Halloween.

691
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,681
- I like your costume better.
- You gonna pay for it?

692
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:57,183
- No, 'cause you are priceless.

693
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:01,563
- Oh, if only I hadn't heard
that line seven times tonight.

694
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,940
- I bet you break a heart
every time you say that.

695
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,695
- If you're really a doctor,
what kind are you.

696
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:11,406
Aside from being
a cheap-ass one?

697
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:14,617
Well, Crystale,
unless you're board certified

698
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:16,411
in neurosurgery
and molecular biology,

699
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:19,247
I don't think I could
explain it to you.

700
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,958
- I'm board certified
in knowing you're an asshole.

701
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,084
- Hey!

702
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,252
- My name's not "hey."

703
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,838
- Well, it's not
Crystale either.

704
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,965
Look, I've had a crazy day.

705
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:32,218
A bunch of dreams
just came true all at once.

706
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,054
Has that ever happened to you?

707
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:36,848
- Dancing here is my trifecta
of dreams come true.

708
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:41,978
- Okay, so I'm an asshole,

709
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,189
and I'm sorry
for what I said earlier.

710
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,732
- Pardon the interruption.

711
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,526
Listen, bro, I don't need
to be marketing director.

712
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:50,695
Only title I want in your life
is friend,

713
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,655
and you can never fire me.

714
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:54,449
I go where you go,

715
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:56,409
but you do need
a slogan for DiscGenics.

716
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:58,787
- A slogan?
- I'll give it a whirl.

717
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:01,748
- You don't know what it is.
- Do you know what it is?

718
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,875
- I don't need to. I'm good.

719
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,922
- Holy shit. Done fucking deal.

720
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:11,257
Fuck, yeah.
Chris, you got to hear it.

721
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:13,218
She's rock and roll.

722
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:16,471
- ♪ La, la, la, la-la, la-la ♪

723
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,223

734
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,276
Hey! Come on!

735
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,487
- No, no, no... oh.

736
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:57,364
I came at a bad time, I'm sorry.

737
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:59,824
- No, no, no! Come on.
- It's opera night, come on in.

738
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:01,066
- Come on.
- Hey, look at this.

739
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,705
He got another job.

740
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:07,916
University General Hospital.

741
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:09,268
You know what?
I went to med school

742
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,853
with the owner
of this place... Dr. Sasani.

743
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:12,045
We should go there.

744
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,838
- And do what exactly?
- I don't know.

745
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,881
We'll figure it out.

746
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:17,342
We'll, uh, denounce him
publicly.

747
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:20,011
No more half measures, right?

748
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:22,263
- Okay.
- Come on.

749
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:24,808
Jacqueline, look who's here!

750
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:28,103
This is Dr. Bob Henderson.
