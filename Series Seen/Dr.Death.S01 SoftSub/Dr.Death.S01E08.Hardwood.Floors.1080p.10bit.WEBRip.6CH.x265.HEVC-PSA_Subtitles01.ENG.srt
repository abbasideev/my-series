1
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,217
- Looking like a veritable
movie star.

2
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,261
- Don't know how I got picked,
Mr. Summers.

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,138
- Oh, you were
our number one choice, Janet.

4
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,389
See you out there.

5
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,725
- Here, Ma. Excuse me, Jerry.

6
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,851
Where do you want this?

7
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,645
- Oh, exam room. Thanks.

8
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,897
- I feel bad asking,

9
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,778
but do you think
I could talk with Dr. Duntsch?

10
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,151
- Oh, he's real busy.
- Can I do something?

11
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,694
- It's more
of a doctor-patient thing.

12
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,047
- Definitely don't want me
handling that stuff.

13
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,447
I'll talk to him.

14
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,115
- Thank you, Jerry.

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,593
- Will you make sure your mom's
memorized on what she's saying?

16
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,534
I don't want her
getting distracted

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,412
with lights, camera, action.

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,915
- Two reasons why patients
normally present

19
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,876
to their doctors for pain
related to the spine.

20
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,088
The first is related to
the peripheral nervous system.

21
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,923
That's called radiculopathy.

22
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,841
Now, normally, that type
of pain is associated

23
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,483
- with depression or with...
- Yo, Chris.

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,762
- Degenerative changes in...
- Cut.

25
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,518
Okay, um, let's take a break.

26
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,977
Knock out the patient's portion.

27
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,229
Come back.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,940
- Good idea.

29
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,317
Fuck me.

30
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,570
I am so sorry.

31
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,324
You're looking good.
Feeling good?

32
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,288
- I thought it'd be
more professional.

33
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,418
- Tell me what needs fixing,
Chrissy, anything.

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,921
- Kim's all over it.

35
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,009
- I know you're in the zone,
but Sarah wants to talk to you.

36
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,303
Janet's daughter. Our patient?

37
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,348
- Oh, yeah, that's fine.

38
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,145
- Hey. Dr. Duntsch,
how can I help you?

39
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,188
- Hi, Dr. Duntsch.

40
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,817
I noticed something
in my mom's scar.

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,904
Like, blue peeking out,
like a piece of sponge.

42
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,783
So I got some tweezers and...

43
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,163
- Oh, wow.
- You should not have done that.

44
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,914
- Oh, my God. What did I do?

45
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,499
- No, it's just a stitch.

46
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,668
It's fine, but...
okay, you should call me

47
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,212
before you go digging around
in there again, okay?

48
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,798
- I did call a few times.
- Quiet on set.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,592
You ready, Jenny?

50
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,804
- Should I tell my own story?
- Because this isn't my story.

51
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,726
- Janet, you look great today.

52
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,644
Thank you so much
for doing this.

53
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,611
- You did good.

54
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,240
Yeah.

55
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,582
- Roll camera. And action.

56
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,672
- Dr. Duntsch is one great man.

57
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:38,343
He is the best doctor I think
that you could ever go to,

58
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,721
and if you're having
the problems that I had,

59
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:47,894
you know, give him a call
because he'll fix you.

60
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,238
- No God damn way.

61
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,864
- Mr. Duntsch...
- Doctor.

62
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,384
- I don't think you appreciate
the position you're in.

63
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,910
- Doctor.
- Dr. Duntsch,

64
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,930
I don't think you appreciate
the position you're in.

65
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,664
- No, I don't.

66
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,376
I do not appreciate
being locked up in a cage

67
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,795
like a dog
for a year and a half.

68
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,648
And I certainly do
not appreciate you telling me

69
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,716
that my best bet going forward

70
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,343
is not just to fire your asses
and hire real lawyers,

71
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,678
but to ask for a continuance.

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,639
- I need to find someone
to testify on your behalf.

73
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,641
- Put me on the stand.

74
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,476
If anybody else tries
to describe what it is

75
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,603
that I do or how I do it,

76
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,665
they're just gonna end up
looking like a bunch of jerks.

77
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,151
- See, that right there is why
you can't take the stand.

78
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,694
You're emotionally driven.

79
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,822
And when you're emotional,
you can't control what you say.

80
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,628
Try me.

81
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,390
You are a drug- and alcohol-
addicted surgeon

82
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,642
who was too impaired
to perform surgeries.

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,911
- Allegedly. None of that was...

84
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,772
- Like a drunk driver,
which, by the way,

85
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,166
you have on your record,
Mr. Duntsch.

86
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,358
- Doctor.

87
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,151
- No, you're no longer a doctor.

88
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,527
You had your license stripped.

89
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,820
- Temporarily.

90
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,489
- Not if we have anything
to do with it.

91
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,657
And how about that email?
The one in which

92
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,910
you're prepared to become
a cold-blooded killer.

93
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,346
- I never meant for that
to be taken literally...

94
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,121
- You wrote it.

95
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,664
So it was just a coincidence

96
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,958
that you wrote
that email to your lover,

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,960
who also happens to be
your assistant,

98
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,254
just prior to killing
or maiming over 33 patients?

99
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,547
- It's not my fault!

100
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,257
The anesthesiologists
and the nurses

101
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,135
and the fat fucking patients...

102
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,562
- Fire me,

103
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,731
but know whoever
slides into this seat

104
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,067
is gonna tell you
a version of the same thing.

105
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,694
I am trying to keep you

106
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,405
from spending the rest
of your life in prison.

107
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,827
- I don't want to.

108
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,721
You've got my deposition,
and you've got my records.

109
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,056
I don't have anything
more to give.

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,040
- The judge ruled you have
to testify in front...

111
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,267
- How could the emails
not be true?

112
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,376
He sent them to me.

113
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,544
- The defense has a right

114
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,088
to cross-examine you
and confirm that.

115
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,283
- You know, I thought
the other side of the world

116
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,060
was far enough.

117
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,901
They don't want me there
because of the emails.

118
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,615
They wanna know about us,
about our relationship.

119
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,248
What are they gonna ask?

120
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,208
- If it were me,

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,919
I would remind them
as often as I could

122
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,880
that you two
were sleeping together

123
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,548
to establish
a conflict of interest.

124
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,134
- You mean to call me a whore
who can't be trusted?

125
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,012
- I know you're trying to leave
this all behind, Ms. Morgan,

126
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,598
but there's only
one way to do that.

127
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,895
- This is hostile.
- She's being hostile.

128
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,480
- Do you need her to testify?

129
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,149
- I do if I wanna introduce
that email.

130
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,234
- Can you prove your case
without the email?

131
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,986
- Precedent-setting
is precedent-setting,

132
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,655
Dr. Henderson.
No one's ever done this before.

133
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,491
Gotta assume
every little bit helps.

134
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,992
- She's been through enough.

135
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,636
- What the hell are you
talking about, Bob?

136
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,579
She was in the O.R.
She was in the consult.

137
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,122
She had to know
what was going on.

138
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,999
You ask me,
she hasn't been through enough.

139
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,960
- What about questioning his
training and the investments?

140
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,521
And we have the hospitals
moving him around.

141
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,672
What? What?

142
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,465
- We brought charges
of elder abuse.

143
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,800
The only way to prove that

144
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,551
is to prove that
he was trained well

145
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,904
and that he knew
what he was doing,

146
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,514
the whole time, he knew
he was going to harm her.

147
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,616
- Well, what about the drugs?

148
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,974
- That would be helpful, but...

149
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,102
- Fine, fantastic.
- Drag Kayla Gibson in here.

150
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,813
- Unless Ms. Gibson knew
he was high and was with him

151
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,232
in surgery that day,
it's inadmissible.

152
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,234
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

153
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,779
You came to me
to help you stop Duntsch.

154
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,197
We have to choose.

155
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,657
If he's our goal,

156
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,618
then we have to focus on him
and only him.

157
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,081
- State, call
your first witness.

158
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:18,998
- Drew Sweeney.

159
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,500
- Joe Padua.
- Harold Brennan.

160
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,502
- Earl Burke.
- Elaine Johnson.

161
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,586
- Henry Aldrich.

162
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,588
- Cindy Tremblay.
- Stan Novak.

163
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,590
- Would you tell us
a little about yourself?

164
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,426
- I'm 41.

165
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,971
I work for the Collin County
Medical Examiner's Office.

166
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,472
- I worked for a pool company.

167
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,976
- My wife, Shelley, was an
elementary education teacher.

168
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,520
- Dorothy and I were married
46 years.

169
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,481
Two kids, nine grandkids.

170
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,859
- Commercial construction
project manager.

171
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,652
- Started driving trucks in '98.

172
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,071
- Two children... both had
better be in school right now.

173
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,948
- I'm an
air conditioner contractor.

174
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,118
- What were your symptoms
prior to seeing Dr. Duntsch?

175
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,454
- Light back pain.
- Lower back pain.

176
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,414
- We were decorating
the Christmas tree,

177
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,623
and Shelley missed a rung.

178
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,000
- Neck pain.

179
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,711
- Pain in the neck
and numb pinky.

180
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,254
- Numbness.
- Tingling in my finger.

181
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,839
- Back pain.

182
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,525
Hard to be a mom when
you can't pick anything up.

183
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,719
- Broke my back.
- Motorcycle accident.

184
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,804
- How did you hear
about Dr. Duntsch?

185
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,389
- My doctor.
- Family doctor.

186
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,016
- Website called Best Docs.

187
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,226
- Baylor Medical website.
- Five stars.

188
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,562
- Seemed like he knew
what he was talking about.

189
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,856
- He told us
he was gonna fix her.

190
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,399
That's all we needed to know.

191
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,193
- Arrogant.

192
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,570
Told me he was the best
in the metroplex.

193
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,531
- So it's the day
of the surgery.

194
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,450
- I had second thoughts
that day.

195
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,744
- My understanding
was my surgery was supposed

196
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,664
to last a couple of hours.
It took four.

197
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,917
- When you woke up from surgery,

198
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,251
what was that like?

199
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,379
- A nightmare.

200
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,008
I woke up in a nightmare,
tubes coming out of everywhere.

201
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,552
Feeding tubes, drain tubes.

202
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,639
- I couldn't move,
and the pain...

203
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,808
- They were pumping me
full of blood,

204
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,434
and I didn't know why.

205
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,311
- I was sore. I hurt.

206
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,771
I was worse.

207
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,149
- Couldn't move, and my wife
told me he'd found a tumor

208
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,443
and had to abort the surgery.

209
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,029
It turns out it was
a piece of my neck muscle.

210
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,616
- Every bone hurt. I was crying.

211
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,285
I'm sober,
so I can't take the meds.

212
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,954
- She never woke up.

213
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,289
- I went home. I laid around.

214
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,667
Wasn't eating
or drinking anything

215
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,127
'cause of the sore throat.

216
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,878
- I remember being
like I was a baby.

217
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,773
You know, like a baby
who can't hold himself up.

218
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,300
First thing that went through
my mind: What's he done to me?

219
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,512
- He looked at the incision
and said everything was fine.

220
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,139
- He kept repeating himself.

221
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,491
He kept saying that
what was wrong

222
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,017
wasn't related to the surgery.

223
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,978
- I knew there was
something wrong with this guy.

224
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,146
Sorry, man.
You looked high as a kite.

225
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,981
- Objection.
- Sustained.

226
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,649
- Has this changed your life?

227
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,609
- I walk with a limp.

228
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,862
I have trouble
with incontinence,

229
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,488
erectile dysfunction.

230
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,782
- I can't sing.

231
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,703
Not that I was
ever a good singer,

232
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:05,707
but that's just
an everyday reminder.

233
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,336
- She was the love of my life.

234
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,214
It's hard to get over
a broken heart.

235
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,883
- Just living one day at a time,

236
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,426
just like recovery.

237
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,179
- I can't play with my children
like I used to.

238
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,307
- I learned ways
to control the pain,

239
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,851
mostly through
prayer and meditation.

240
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,271
- I sit in a recliner, watch TV,

241
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,691
a lot of medicine,
antidepressants.

242
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,402
- I miss her.

243
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,906
She was...

244
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,659
she was a very...

245
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,579
very good woman.

246
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,458
And that's all I can say.

247
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,836
- Can you tell us
how old you are?

248
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,047
- 70.

249
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,717
- And what did you do
for a living?

250
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,261
- I was a teacher's aide,

251
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,391
and then I worked
in physical therapy for a bit.

252
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,768
Ironic.

253
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,730
- What took you
to Christopher Duntsch?

254
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,775
- I had back pain for years,

255
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:18,238
and it radiated
to the end of my foot.

256
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,491
And I tried all the treatments.

257
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,744
Steroid shots, PT.

258
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,371
Nothing worked.

259
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,916
- Before you met the defendant,
had you had surgery?

260
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,960
- Mm-hmm. 2008.

261
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,294
A laminectomy.

262
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:37,549
It helped for a number of years,

263
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,470
but it didn't last and then
my pain management team

264
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,764
referred me to Dr. Duntsch.

265
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,935
- How did you feel going
into the surgery?

266
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:53,148
- Fine. Good.

267
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,402
I walked into
the hospital happy,

268
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,032
and I was thinking,
"This is gonna fix it."

269
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,994
- And how did you feel
when you woke up?

270
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,081
- I was in pain.

271
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,628
I was in pain,

272
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,465
and no one could tell me
what was wrong with me

273
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,967
until Dr. Henderson.

274
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,803
He said that he thought that

275
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,307
the fusion
was improperly placed,

276
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:32,312
and that something
was pressing against a nerve.

277
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,314
He said he didn't want to wait

278
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,151
to operate on me,
so they rushed me in.

279
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,654
- What happened after
Dr. Henderson operated on you?

280
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,949
- The pain was much better,
and I could...

281
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,370
I could move
my right foot a bit,

282
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,455
but not my left.

283
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:54,459
- So prior to surgery
with Christopher Duntsch,

284
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:59,381
you had pain,
but you could still live life.

285
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,551
And now?

286
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,013
- I wish I could go back
to the days

287
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,766
before I met
Christopher Duntsch.

288
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,174
- Would you please
introduce yourself to the jury?

289
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,325
- Randall Parker Kirby.

290
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,537
I went to Rice undergrad.
Baylor for medical school.

291
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,621
Stayed at Baylor for

292
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,748
my five-year
general surgery residency

293
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,501
as well as my two-year
vascular surgery fellowship.

294
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,879
I have privileges at every
major hospital in Dallas,

295
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,465
including Baylor,
Medical City Dallas,

296
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,217
Medical City Children's,

297
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,512
Methodist,
Dallas Medical, Presbyterian,

298
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,432
and approximately
40 other smaller hospitals

299
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,518
and outpatient surgery centers
here in the metroplex.

300
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,189
My area of expertise
is anterior spinal access.

301
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,442
I work with most
of the neurosurgical

302
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,695
and orthopedic spine
surgeons here in DFW.

303
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,782
I open up the chest and
the abdomen so they can correct

304
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,827
whatever deformity they need
to correct in the front.

305
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:16,332
I perform between two to four
of these operations per day.

306
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,752
Five... call it six days a week.

307
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,714
I do hernias, gallbladders,

308
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,383
blockages of the legs
and the neck arteries, anyone?

309
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:30,055
But my area of expertise
and the chapters I've published

310
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,307
have all been
on anterior spine access.

311
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,933
- And were you called in
on a case

312
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,061
regarding a patient
named Joe Padua?

313
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,022
- Yeah, he works
with the company

314
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,273
that takes care of my pool.

315
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,942
I was asked to come in,
lend a hand.

316
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,444
It seemed nobody else
was available.

317
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,445
- Available?

318
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,780
- Nobody wanted
to work with him.

319
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,114
- Objection.

320
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,300
The witness has
no way of knowing that.

321
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,742
Oh, I do.

322
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,827
- Sustained.
- Eh.

323
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,206
- Did you know Dr. Duntsch
prior to this surgery?

324
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,833
- I met him one time
before we had a conversation.

325
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:03,088
I was scrubbing in on a case,
and he tried to convince me

326
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,092
that he was
the best spine surgeon in town.

327
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,761
I found the conversation
disturbing.

328
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,555
I mean, sure, most surgeons
are superior sons of guns,

329
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,265
some would even say yours truly,

330
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,851
but this guy was next level.

331
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,977
I mean, he tried to tell me

332
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,354
that all the surgeries in Dallas

333
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,357
were being performed
incorrectly.

334
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,360
- And what did you observe
during your operation with him?

335
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,029
- An anterior lumbar fusion
at L5-S1

336
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,616
is about the easiest procedure
a spine surgeon can perform,

337
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,535
and he just struggled.

338
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,120
I mean, he was functioning
at the level

339
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,831
of a first-
or second-year resident.

340
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,667
Instead of using a scalpel
to remove the disc,

341
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,295
he just started grabbing at it
with a double-action rongeur.

342
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,842
All right, imagine, instead
of using a pizza slicer

343
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,845
to divide and conquer
your extra-large pepperoni,

344
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,306
you went after it
with a pair of lockjaw pliers.

345
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,809
Not appetizing, right?

346
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,310
- Did it appear to you

347
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,147
that there was more blood loss
than there should be?

348
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,857
- When he was taking
the disc out,

349
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,483
he took off a bit of bone

350
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,528
from the bottom
of the L5 vertebral body.

351
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,157
In surgical parlance,
he violated the endplate.

352
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,492
Very difficult to do
in healthy bone.

353
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,327
He did the same thing
to the sacrum.

354
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,163
When you start chewing
into bone,

355
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,706
you get a lot of bleeding.

356
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,710
It's not easy to stop bleeding
when it's coming from bone.

357
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,504
You're just really
not supposed to do that.

358
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,715
- What are you supposed to do?

359
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,884
- Curet off the cartilage.

360
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,635
A curet is like a scraper.

361
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,471
You scrape off all the cartilage

362
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,932
so you can get a proper fusion,
and then heal bone to bone.

363
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,851
- When did you leave
the surgery?

364
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,480
- Midway, I was called into a
previously scheduled operation.

365
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,439
Grudgingly.

366
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,108
- Grudgingly. Why grudgingly?

367
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:56,242
- He was the neurosurgeon.
- He was in charge.

368
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,827
I did my job.

369
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:03,333
I did my best to guide him,
and then I left.

370
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,213
In hindsight, I suppose I could
have dragged him out of there.

371
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,508
If there's ever a next time,
I will.

372
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,098
- State passes.
- Defense.

373
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,235
- You stated that Dr. Duntsch
was operating at the level

374
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,196
of a first- or second-year
surgical resident.

375
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,573
How many years does
a neurosurgical resident

376
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,783
typically study?

377
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,535
- Six.

378
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,662
- And would that include
his training?

379
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,623
Or lack thereof.

380
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,336
- Or lack thereof.

381
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,090
Well said.

382
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,217
Defense passes the witness.

383
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,095
- We stand in recess
until tomorrow.

384
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,613
- We can shift the blame
to your training.

385
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,161
- My training was some
of the best in the world.

386
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,497
- No, it was some of the worst.

387
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,292
- What are you talking about?

388
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,502
- We'll say you slipped
through the cracks.

389
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,855
You were told you were
good enough to graduate,

390
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,440
but you didn't have enough
training hours.

391
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,008
Your financial ties to Skadden

392
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,260
and the rest of the investors
blinded them to your...

393
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,470
- to your flaws.
- Stop.

394
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,697
- The entire medical community

395
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,222
of Dallas
should have recognized it.

396
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,309
Instead, they simply moved you
from hospital to hospital.

397
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:48,521
- You are erasing my legacy.

398
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,358
- Legacy?

399
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,736
Christopher, you're done.

400
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:55,904
- Fuck you.

401
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,173
- You'll never practice
medicine again.

402
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,823
- Fuck you.

403
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,343
And why aren't you pushing back
on any of their witnesses?

404
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,802
- How exactly would I do that,
Chris?

405
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,787
- I don't know.
- That's your job, isn't it?

406
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,914
You break them down.
You tell them they're wrong.

407
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,541
You get them to admit...
admit whatever it was

408
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,102
that they lied to me about
that messed up their surgery.

409
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,294
- Chris...

410
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,296
- You do something to defend me.

411
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,673
- The only witness,

412
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,466
the only defense
that I have right now

413
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:20,178
is gonna speak
to your narcissism.

414
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,597
Our best bet is to prove

415
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,325
that you never should
have practiced medicine.

416
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,102
Give me this.
Please give me this,

417
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,312
and we might be able
to save you.

418
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,451
- Thanks for being here today,
Mr. Summers.

419
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,996
Can you tell us
how you know Mr. Duntsch?

420
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:35,170
- We were classmates.
- Went to high school together.

421
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,755
Lost touch.

422
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,050
Reconnected when he returned
to medical school in Memphis.

423
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,636
- What led you to have surgery
with Mr. Duntsch?

424
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,223
- Sharp, stabbing-like
sticking pain in my neck.

425
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,600
Numbness.

426
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,685
- Did he explain the risks?

427
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,188
- He advised it was dangerous.

428
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,899
He promised to take care of me.

429
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,527
- What did you do the night
before the surgery?

430
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:13,208
- Watched a game. Basketball.

431
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,169
Then I went to bed around 10:00.

432
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,964
May... maybe more like 11:30.

433
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,678
- What's the first thing
you remember after the surgery?

434
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,599
- I could barely move.

435
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:35,021
I just kind of started
freaking out, hollering.

436
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,481
Wanting to know
what was going on.

437
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,734
- And did Chris
come and talk to you?

438
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:44,030
- Not at first, but eventually.

439
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,117
And then they took me
in for a second surgery,

440
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,953
and when I got out,
I couldn't move at all.

441
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,914
- Do you remember making
a statement in the ICU

442
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,458
that you and Chris
were doing cocaine together

443
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,003
the night prior to surgery?

444
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,929
- I wanted to see him.

445
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:13,184
He wasn't coming around,
and I... I was mad.

446
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,311
I made it up.

447
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,231
He was my doctor.

448
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,525
I wanted to know
why I couldn't move.

449
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,652
He was in charge.

450
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:26,156
He wouldn't come see me.

451
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,491
- And he was your friend?

452
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:34,497
Let the record show
the witness nodded.

453
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,750
He was your best friend?

454
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,046
Let the record show
the witness nodded.

455
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,342
And he abandoned you?

456
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,682
The State passes the witness.

457
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:03,068
- I'm terribly sorry
for what happened to you.

458
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,075
You and Chris played
football together, yes?

459
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,284
- That's right.

460
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:14,245
- And did you have
some victories

461
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,581
and some not-so-great games?

462
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,626
- Yeah.

463
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,920
- And how did Chris deal
with those games?

464
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:26,091
Did he always go in
and always try to do his best?

465
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,594
- Yeah.

466
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,515
- Were you aware that he was
in a fellowship program

467
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,809
studying under
Dr. Geoffrey Skadden?

468
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,227
- Yes.

469
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,813
- And from your understanding,
was it very important,

470
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,023
what he was doing
for Dr. Skadden?

471
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,360
- Yeah.

472
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,612
- And things like
doing surgeries

473
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:51,241
while he was there
under Skadden's supervision,

474
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:54,536
that was important to becoming
a successful surgeon?

475
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,912
- Yeah.

476
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:59,082
- Did you ever see Chris
get out of obligations

477
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,834
that he had at school?

478
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,087
- I felt that way sometimes.

479
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,089
- Can you give us
an example of that?

480
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:09,801
Like, something that you saw
or that made you think that?

481
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,262
- I can just remember
maybe making a phone call

482
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,722
to a doctor,

483
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,598
maybe Dr. Skadden
or another doctor,

484
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,310
to say that he had stuff
to do for DiscGenics.

485
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,731
And I can remember them

486
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,650
let him out
whatever he had to do.

487
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,610
- When you would find out
that Dr. Skadden

488
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,571
and/or some other doctor
would just excuse him

489
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,991
from doing things at school
in lieu of staying in the lab,

490
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,659
I mean, did you think
that was a problem?

491
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,786
- I never knew that,
you know, what was happening,

492
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:40,749
and so I... I... I don't know
what he was missing

493
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,376
or where he was going.
So I... I don't know.

494
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,461
- Okay.

495
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:45,712
Well, did you ever meet

496
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:49,215
any one of his classmates,
or anyone

497
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,301
who went to the University
of Tennessee Med School,

498
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:52,886
and talk to them
about the rigors

499
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:57,057
of completing medical school
and completing that fellowship?

500
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,725
- I don't remember.

501
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,518
- You don't remember
anyone saying

502
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,521
that he only got
through medical school

503
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,273
because Skadden liked him?

504
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,192
- I heard that after... you know,

505
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,319
something similar to that
since my surgery.

506
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:12,530
- Do you remember who that was
that told you that or is that...

507
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,491
- I heard it from a friend

508
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,676
who heard it
from another friend,

509
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,118
and he made a comment

510
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,664
that Chris was able
to circumvent the program.

511
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,418
- Did they attribute that
circumventing to Dr. Skadden

512
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,188
- or some other doctor or both?
- I don't know.

513
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,421
I don't... I don't know.

514
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,923
- Okay.
- I don't know.

515
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,633
- Okay, you said
you understood...

516
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:32,985
- I think what
they attributed to is the fact

517
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,028
that they had companies
with them.

518
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,512
- Well, that was the next thing

519
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:36,805
I was gonna ask you about.

520
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,266
You said they had
companies with him.

521
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:43,353
They gave all the funds
to those companies.

522
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,646
- Right.

523
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,981
- For him to do
the research, right?

524
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,149
- Right.

525
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,443
- Okay, and it was
very important

526
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,530
that research be successful
to those companies.

527
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,573
Is that correct?

528
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,368
- Yeah.

529
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,370
- Now, when Chris moved here,

530
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,122
did he cut off all work

531
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:05,250
with Dr. Skadden and DiscGenics?

532
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,459
- Not that I know of.

533
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,044
- So Chris came to Dallas,

534
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,672
and he worked at the Minimally
Invasive Spine Institute.

535
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,048
Is that correct?

536
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,049
- Yeah.

537
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,926
- And while he was
working there,

538
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,013
he was being pursued
by Amy Piel at Baylor-Plano.

539
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,055
Is that correct?

540
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,724
- Well, she was interested
in having

541
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,684
a successful clinic
on the property.

542
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,312
- Mm-hmm. All to herself.

543
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:30,066
Because if he was with Missy,

544
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:33,945
she wasn't getting all the fees
that he would generate.

545
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,782
- Yeah.

546
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:43,913
- So both the chair
of his fellowship,

547
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:45,832
the person responsible
for his training,

548
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,168
and one of the largest hospitals

549
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:52,130
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area
had financial reasons

550
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:56,718
for ensuring that Christopher
Duntsch was successful.

551
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,892
- I'd say so.

552
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,481
- Defense passes the witness.

553
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,775
- Redirect.

554
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:16,780
Did Christopher ever visit you
after the surgery?

555
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:19,949
After you returned home
to Memphis?

556
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,162
- Once. He came to visit.

557
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:29,334
- What did you talk about?

558
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:33,338
- His baby, his practice.

559
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,006
Nothing in depth.

560
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,676
- Did he ask about you?

561
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:42,722
About what was happening
in your life?

562
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,394
- No.

563
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:51,815
- Ms. McClung said
that she was sorry

564
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,316
for what happened to you,

565
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:56,319
even though she has
no connection to your surgery.

566
00:28:56,361 --> 00:29:01,491
Has Christopher
ever said he was sorry?

567
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:10,041
- No.

568
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:17,173
- Final question, Mr. Summers.

569
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,300
He's here now.

570
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:22,012
Is there anything
you want to say to him?

571
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,764
- Objection.
- Sustained.

572
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,187
- I love you.

573
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:35,025
- The jury will disregard
that last statement.

574
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:38,111
- The State has
no further questions.

575
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,375
- Would you please
introduce yourself to the jury?

576
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,918
- Major Kimberly Morgan.

577
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,420
United States Air Force.

578
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,797
- And are you currently
out on deployment

579
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,883
in a location
you cannot disclose?

580
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,676
- Yes, ma'am, due to security.

581
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,553
- Are you familiar with a person

582
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:04,888
named Christopher Duntsch?

583
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,222
- Yes, ma'am.

584
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:07,682
I ran the office at his clinic

585
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,184
and assisted in surgery.

586
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,519
- Can you tell us
what the defendant was like?

587
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,812
His demeanor?

588
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:15,648
- Caring, kind,

589
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,776
always very nice
to the patients.

590
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,277
He took time to listen to them.

591
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,030
- And did that change
over the course

592
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:24,366
of the time you were with him?

593
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,910
- Yes,

594
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,704
after the event
in February 2012.

595
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,041
- The event?

596
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,668
- Jerry Summers' surgery.

597
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,300
Mr. Summers wasn't able
to use his limbs,

598
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:46,012
was having difficulty breathing,

599
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,223
and then he talked about
how he and Dr. Duntsch

600
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,059
were doing cocaine
the night before the surgery.

601
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,728
- You were ordered
to take a drug test?

602
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,315
- Myself and Dr. Duntsch.
- I took it right away that day.

603
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,566
- Did the defendant?

604
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,984
- Eventually.

605
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,319
It came back clean,

606
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,488
and Baylor reinstated
his privileges.

607
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,031
- Shelley Brennan would be

608
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,492
the last patient
you assisted on?

609
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,870
- Yes.

610
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,415
- What do you remember
about her surgery?

611
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:27,846
- It's a simple surgery.

612
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:31,141
In one day, home the next.

613
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:37,397
- This is an email
from Duntsch@TNiclinic.net

614
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,566
to Kimberly Morgan.

615
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,651
The subject is "Occam's Razor."

616
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:46,740
"Kim, unfortunately,
you cannot understand that

617
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:50,076
"I really am building an empire,

618
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:53,121
"and I am so far outside the box

619
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:57,208
"that the Earth is small
and the Sun is bright.

620
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,253
"Anyone close to me thinks
that I'm likely

621
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,922
"something
between God, Einstein,

622
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,091
and the Antichrist...

623
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,302
- Because how can I do
anything that I want

624
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,095
across any discipline boundary

625
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:12,182
like it's a playground
and never ever lose?

626
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,351
Unfortunately, despite the fact

627
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:17,896
that I am winning, it is not
happening fast enough.

628
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:20,273
What is the problem, Kim?

629
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:23,568
It is simply that
everyone else is human,

630
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,154
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

631
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,282
So I pick and choose my humans

632
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,369
and try to help them.

633
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,206
You, my child,

634
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:41,252
are the only one standing
between me and the other side.

635
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:46,591
I am ready to leave the love
and kindness and goodness

636
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:50,845
and patience that I mixed
with everything else that I am

637
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:53,348
and become
a cold-blooded killer.

638
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,310
The sad fact is,
I could go faster, do better,

639
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,521
catch more honor and respect

640
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,023
by fucking everybody
in the brain,

641
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,858
emotionally and mentally
controlling them

642
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,111
in a manner
that borders on abuse,

643
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:10,323
taking no prisoners,
sending everyone in my way,

644
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:13,493
especially that
fucks with me, to hell

645
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:17,163
for the simple fact
that they thought they could.

646
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:23,003
What I am being as what I am,

647
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:26,047
one of a kind,

648
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,927
a motherfucker
stone-cold killer.

649
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,643
- I'll pass my witness,
Your Honor.

650
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,103
- I don't think it's morning

651
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:43,398
where you are, but good morning.

652
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,485
Now, the State is making
a big deal out of this email

653
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,237
they just read.

654
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,032
Did you know Christopher
liked poetry?

655
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,825
- I found out later.

656
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:57,620
- But you're not surprised
by his... his flowery language.

657
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:58,955
I mean, he sent emails

658
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,391
like that one quite often,
didn't he?

659
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,791
- Yes.

660
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,627
- Do you think Dr. Duntsch
was a cold-blooded killer?

661
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,212
- No.

662
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:09,090
- Now, it's no secret
that you and Dr. Duntsch

663
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,926
had an intimate relationship.

664
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:14,012
We know that involves sex,

665
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,139
but was there
an emotional element?

666
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,307
- Meaning?

667
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,976
- Well, among the people
in his life,

668
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,270
based on everything you saw

669
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,898
working with him day in
and day out,

670
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,274
sleeping with him,

671
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,568
you thought
you were pretty close?

672
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,736
- I thought so.

673
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,404
- Close enough that perhaps

674
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:35,200
you didn't allow yourself
to see the truth?

675
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,035
- The truth?

676
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,120
- About his abilities.

677
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,747
- I don't understand.

678
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:43,333
- Was he a good surgeon?

679
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,212
- That's outside my area
of expertise.

680
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,464
- You were in his office.
- You were in the O.R.

681
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:51,007
You don't have
a professional opinion?

682
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,176
- No.

683
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,220
- Okay, well,
after Shelley Brennan,

684
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,430
did you ever work
with Dr. Duntsch again?

685
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,932
- No.
- Why not?

686
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:03,228
- I didn't wanna be
in that environment anymore.

687
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,605
- That environment?
- What environment?

688
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:14,239
- Unhealthy, you know?

689
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,282
- You mean the environment
in which patients

690
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:17,534
were being maimed and killed?

691
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,703
- Objection.
- Sustained.

692
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,329
- Just one more question.

693
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,832
If you believed that Dr. Duntsch

694
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:26,418
wanted to hurt patients,

695
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,670
you certainly would go
and tell somebody about that,

696
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:31,423
wouldn't you?

697
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,555
- Yes, ma'am.

698
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,599
- Pass the witness.

699
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,979
Stay safe, Ms. Morgan,
wherever you've gone.

700
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,373
- How are you feeling?

701
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:08,543
- If they ask me questions
about Duntsch's training,

702
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:11,755
I can't promise you
what I'm going to say.

703
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,175
- Yeah.

704
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,888
If we can't present
our entire case,

705
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,432
the good, bad, everything,

706
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,143
if we can't lay it all out
and still win,

707
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,020
then we shouldn't win.

708
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,190
- You take that call.

709
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,650
- Hey, Ma. Hang on a sec.

710
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:35,195
Dr. Henderson.

711
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:39,407
If they ask,
answer how you want.

712
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:44,120
- Thank you.

713
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,500
- Yeah, I'm here.

714
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,734
We asked you here
to give your opinion

715
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:17,904
on four different cases
the defendant performed.

716
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:21,574
What surgery did the defendant
recommend for Jerry Summers?

717
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:26,746
- An anterior cervical fusion
at C3-4 and C4-5.

718
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,958
- What was the outcome
of Mr. Summer's surgery?

719
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,168
- He was rendered
a quadriplegic.

720
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,505
- Would you walk us through it?

721
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,215
- There was a lot of bleeding.

722
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,802
- Suction.
- Suction.

723
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,555
- Sponge. Give me a sponge.

724
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,307
- How many CCs were lost?

725
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:52,147
- A typical loss is somewhere
between 25 and 200 CCs.

726
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:55,525
Mr. Summers lost 1,900 CCs.

727
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,903
- What accounts for that amount
of blood loss?

728
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,947
- Injuring a major structure.

729
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,407
- Pituitary.

730
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,577
- He removed the disc
from C3-4 and C4-5,

731
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,370
as he was supposed to do,

732
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,789
and then he removed
a tremendous amount of bone

733
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,833
on the left side.

734
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,086
Over a third of
the vertebral body.

735
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:19,549
And in doing so, he lacerated
the vertebral artery.

736
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,307
- The defendant chose to go
back in for a second surgery.

737
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,017
What procedure did he perform?

738
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,727
- Double action.

739
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:34,481
- A laminectomy in order to
relieve pressure on the spine.

740
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,566
But by removing excessive bone

741
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,693
from both the front
and the back,

742
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:41,780
you're compromising
the entire structure.

743
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:44,616
- In layman's terms?

744
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:48,328
- His head was barely attached
to his spine.

745
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,708
- Let's move on
to Shelley Brennan.

746
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,294
The surgery Duntsch recommended,

747
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:58,713
was that a surgery
that would fix her issue?

748
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,090
- Yes.

749
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:03,093
- What was the outcome
of Mrs. Brennan's operation?

750
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,844
- She died.

751
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:07,389
- Is that normal
for this type of procedure?

752
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,351
- Mortalities are less than
1 in 10,000.

753
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:14,145
The pituitary rongeur
went through

754
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:17,357
the ligament in the front and
lacerated the iliac vessels

755
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,567
that lie directly on the side.

756
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:22,070
- So Mrs. Brennan was bleeding?

757
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,154
- Heavily.

758
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:24,364
- Would there have been blood

759
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,700
visible in the operative site?

760
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,076
- Sometimes, yes.

761
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,203
It doesn't appear
to have been the case here,

762
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:32,431
but they should have noticed
a drop in her blood pressure.

763
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:37,585
- Should a neurosurgeon know
that a drop in blood pressure

764
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:39,212
means there's a bleed somewhere?

765
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:44,050
- It's a fundamental rule,
but the likelihood of them

766
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:47,053
being able to address
the issue is small.

767
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:51,266
They'd call in a vascular
surgeon for assistance.

768
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,935
- But he didn't do that.

769
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:58,231
- No.

770
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,733
- Dorothy Burke.

771
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,986
- Mrs. Burke had a previous
anterior cervical fusion

772
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:07,991
at C5-6 and C6-7 that resolved
her symptoms for a time,

773
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,577
but she began experiencing
neck and shoulder pain

774
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,371
that had nothing to do
with her prior surgery.

775
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:17,042
Dr. Duntsch diagnosed
a disc protrusion at C4-5

776
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,712
and a disc extrusion
at the C7 T1 level.

777
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:25,216
He sliced through
the vertebral artery again.

778
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:35,352
- We've been talking a lot
about the vertebral artery.

779
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:37,937
Is it common for it
to be hit during surgery?

780
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,397
- Exceptionally rare.

781
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,732
- How many times
have you hit it?

782
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:42,150
- Never.

783
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,736
- And what happened to
Mrs. Burke after her surgery?

784
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:48,448
- Her heart rate elevated.
- She couldn't open her eyes.

785
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,910
No verbal response
to questioning or commands.

786
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:56,498
- And what does that indicate
to anyone in the medical field?

787
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,708
- An impending disaster.

788
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,086
- What should Mr. Duntsch
have done

789
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,880
as soon as he was informed
of that information?

790
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,466
- Physically examine
the patient.

791
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,760
Order appropriate studies.
Scans.

792
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,221
They were ordered
by the ICU physician,

793
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,348
which showed she was brain dead.

794
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,814
- Where was Dr. Duntsch?

795
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,732
- He was operating
on Madeline Beyer.

796
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:25,819
- Had the defendant focused
on Dorothy Burke

797
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,239
rather than Madeline Beyer,
would she still be alive today?

798
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,657
- Based on what I know

799
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,325
of Dr. Duntsch's approach
to surgery,

800
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:35,203
Mrs. Burke was dead the moment
she agreed for him to operate.

801
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:36,496
- Objection.

802
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,581
- Sustained.

803
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,544
- Madeline Beyer?

804
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:46,715
- Mrs. Beyer is the reason
I'm sitting here today.

805
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:50,135
I... I tried to fix her.

806
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:53,263
One of the screws
was violating the spinal canal,

807
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:56,349
damaging dura and nerve roots.

808
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,601
- How do you know
when you've hit the dura?

809
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:01,062
- Cerebral spinal
fluid leaks out.

810
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:05,400
I found evidence of three
attempted screw placements

811
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,945
on the left side
where he put no screws.

812
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,323
The most disturbing part was,

813
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:15,618
the entire reason
he was operating

814
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,080
was to remove the disc,
and he didn't touch it.

815
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:20,707
- What did he take out?

816
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:24,044
- A large piece
of the psoas muscle.

817
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,629
He made a portal
through that muscle

818
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:29,174
and stuffed an implant in there.

819
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:30,717
- Cage.

820
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,344
- Is a trained neurosurgeon

821
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:36,514
going to know the difference
between bone and muscle?

822
00:42:36,556 --> 00:42:38,141
- Yes.
- Mallet.

823
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:40,060
- Would a trained
neurosurgeon know

824
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:43,021
that by malpositioning
the interbody device,

825
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,523
he was reasonably certain
to cause her injury?

826
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:47,067
- Yes.

827
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:49,277
- Would a trained neurosurgeon
have been aware

828
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,113
that if he malpositioned
the pedicle screws,

829
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,782
he was reasonably certain

830
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,867
to cause her
serious bodily injury?

831
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,243
- Yes.

832
00:42:57,285 --> 00:43:00,163
- Would a trained neurosurgeon
have been aware

833
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,499
that if he amputated
the nerve root,

834
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,667
he was reasonably certain

835
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:06,086
to cause her
serious bodily injury?

836
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:07,295
- Yes.

837
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,589
- The way the surgical tools
were used

838
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:11,383
in Madeline Beyer's case,

839
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:13,426
do you think they were used
in a manner

840
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:17,639
that was capable of causing
death or serious bodily injury?

841
00:43:21,434 --> 00:43:23,770
- Yes.

842
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:26,815
- We pass the witness.

843
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,571
- Dr. Henderson,
Ms. Shughart made

844
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:38,034
quite the point
that a trained neurosurgeon

845
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,912
should have done this
or done that.

846
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:44,457
You're aware Christopher
has both an MD and a PhD

847
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,459
from the University
of Tennessee.

848
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:47,877
- I am.

849
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:51,423
- UT isn't some fly-by-night
medical school.

850
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:52,799
It's not like one of those in...

851
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,301
in Guadalajara or Granada,
is it?

852
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:57,595
- No, it's in Memphis.

853
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:00,640
- Do you know
Dr. Geoffrey Skadden?

854
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:02,183
Does he have a good reputation?

855
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:04,019
- I do, and he does.

856
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,812
- And what was
he responsible for

857
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:07,897
in Christopher Duntsch's
training?

858
00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:11,609
- After Dr. Duntsch
finished his residency at UT,

859
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:14,487
he came under the tutelage
of Dr. Skadden

860
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:15,822
for a fellowship training

861
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,158
in minimally invasive
spine surgery.

862
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,618
- Were you familiar
with the fact that Dr. Duntsch

863
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,371
was doing medical cancer
research on the side

864
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:26,416
and that Dr. Skadden
was involved in that research?

865
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,917
- I wasn't at the time, no.

866
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:31,504
- Should any doctor
under any circumstances

867
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:36,051
have their surgical training
hours disrupted by research?

868
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:37,177
- Absolutely not.

869
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:40,430
- So a neurosurgical resident
or fellow

870
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,557
can't just skip those hours.

871
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,268
The supervisor has to sign off,
no matter the excuse.

872
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,811
- Correct.

873
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:49,314
- Do the doctors in charge
of the program have to sign off

874
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,483
that they're qualified
to go and operate?

875
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:52,692
- Yes.

876
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,486
- Did Dr. Skadden write letters

877
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:56,821
of recommendation
for Dr. Duntsch?

878
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:58,365
- Yes, he stated Dr. Duntsch

879
00:44:58,406 --> 00:45:02,369
was a satisfactory surgeon
in his fellowship.

880
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,372
- Well, had Dr. Skadden heard
what was happening in Texas?

881
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:07,123
- Yes, because he had mentioned

882
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:09,584
poor outcomes at Baylor
when filling out

883
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:11,544
a credentialing form
at Forest Park.

884
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:14,673
- Do you have any idea why he
wouldn't have explicitly told

885
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:17,384
these hospitals
not to hire Dr. Duntsch?

886
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:20,178
- Dr. Skadden said that he had
to write recommendations

887
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,056
based on what he'd witnessed
in his program.

888
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,934
He couldn't speak to whatever
was happening in Texas.

889
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:28,269
He didn't write any more
recommendations for Mr. Duntsch

890
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,854
after we spoke.

891
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:32,482
- Has there ever been
an instance

892
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:37,112
in which a doctor was sued for
not writing a recommendation?

893
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:39,364
- Yes.

894
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,574
- Well, that's frightening,
is it not?

895
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,576
- It is to me.

896
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:46,079
- So Skadden had
to sign off on him,

897
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,415
or he wouldn't have been able
to get their credentials?

898
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:49,624
- Correct.

899
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,810
- I mean, Baylor wouldn't let

900
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,419
somebody just walk in
off the street,

901
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,837
start doing neurosurgery.

902
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:55,880
- I also assumed they would
have reported

903
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:58,550
the outcomes of his surgeries
to the authorities.

904
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,093
- As a matter of fact,

905
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:04,597
they didn't say
anything negative to anybody.

906
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,269
Neurosurgery
is a big moneymaker.

907
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,980
Do you think the corporate
level of the hospital

908
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:14,733
was more interested
in making money

909
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:16,985
than in protecting
their patients?

910
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:29,039
Yes, I do.

911
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,500
I think everyone was
more interested in making money

912
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,252
and protecting themselves

913
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:37,797
rather than protecting
their patients.

914
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,763
- Thank you for the truth,
Dr. Henderson.

915
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:47,098
No more questions.

916
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,310
- I'd like to add something.

917
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:52,437
- Redirect.

918
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:55,982
Anything you'd like to add?

919
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:59,444
- Everyone knows the first tenet

920
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,989
of the Hippocratic Oath,
"First, do no harm".

921
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:06,951
But there are others.

922
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:10,288
"I will respect
the hard-won scientific gains

923
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,542
of the physicians
in whose steps I've walked."

924
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:16,044
He did not.

925
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:18,630
"I will apply,
for the benefit of the sick,

926
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,757
"all majors which are required,

927
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:24,552
"avoiding those twin traps
of overtreatment

928
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:26,513
and therapeutic nihilism."

929
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:28,306
He did not.

930
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:31,059
"I will not be ashamed
to say I know not,

931
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:33,728
"nor will I fail to call them
my colleagues

932
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,106
"when the skills of another
are needed

933
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:39,693
for a patient's recovery."

934
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:42,862
He did not.

935
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:47,742
Had I performed
any of the 33 surgeries

936
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,619
in the manner
that he performed them,

937
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:51,705
I never would have
allowed myself

938
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:56,167
into an operating room again.

939
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:59,963
Any one of them.

940
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,258
Not ever again.

941
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,274
- The State flooded you

942
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:21,359
with every possible patient
they could,

943
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:25,113
but Madeline Beyer's case
is the case the State chose

944
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:28,199
to go to trial on,
so let's focus there.

945
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:31,244
Now, according to the state,
Dr. Duntsch didn't head

946
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:34,456
into Madeline Beyer's surgery
to fix her...

947
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:36,332
he wanted to hurt her...

948
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,960
but that's not
what the evidence shows.

949
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:44,674
The evidence shows he was
a suboptimal surgeon.

950
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:47,510
Now, are we trying
to blame the hospitals?

951
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:48,762
No.

952
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:50,305
Are we trying
to blame Dr. Skadden?

953
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,932
No, but the State asked
time and time again,

954
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:57,062
what would
a well-trained surgeon do?

955
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:59,064
I mean, what did
Dr. Henderson tell you?

956
00:48:59,105 --> 00:49:01,900
He got on the phone,
called Skadden, and said,

957
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,443
"Hey, we got this guy here.

958
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:06,404
"It says he graduated
from your medical school,

959
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:07,864
"went to your fellowship,

960
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:10,408
and I need you
to stop recommending him."

961
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:15,121
And Skadden replied, "Yes,
he did train at my fellowship.

962
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:18,041
But I don't know what to do."

963
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,335
Because Skadden has figured out,

964
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:23,588
"I screwed up. I let him out."

965
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,215
I mean, Jerry Summers told you,

966
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:30,220
he let him out of surgeries
in order to do research.

967
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:33,807
Now, you don't get to punish
Dr. Skadden.

968
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:35,934
You don't get to punish Baylor.

969
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:38,019
You don't get to punish
Dallas Medical,

970
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:41,439
but you have the right to know
what they didn't do.

971
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,526
They didn't report him.

972
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,277
They didn't challenge him.

973
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,446
They didn't tell him that he was

974
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:53,451
a suboptimal surgeon
who needs to find other work.

975
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:56,454
If you're a teacher
and the children don't do well,

976
00:49:56,496 --> 00:50:00,417
your principal tells you
you're a suboptimal teacher.

977
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,085
If you're a mechanic

978
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:04,379
and the cars you're working on
keep breaking down,

979
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:07,257
you're told you're
a suboptimal mechanic.

980
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:11,553
If you're a pilot
and you can't land,

981
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:15,140
well, you're told
you can't do this anymore.

982
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:17,976
Well, Baylor does the opposite.

983
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:21,062
They allow him to resign.

984
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,897
And then they send
a clearing letter

985
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:24,024
to Dallas Medical,

986
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:26,443
who hires him and then watches

987
00:50:26,484 --> 00:50:29,571
as three surgeries
in as many days go bad.

988
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:31,489
And what do they do?

989
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:34,200
Nothing.

990
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:35,910
They don't report him

991
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:38,621
to the National Practitioner's
Data Bank

992
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:40,373
or the Texas Medical Board.

993
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:46,921
They allow this poorly-trained
suboptimal surgeon to move on.

994
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:53,178
The system broke down
from the very beginning.

995
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,057
Now, I don't envy your jobs.

996
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:59,100
Both sides have
their own perceptions

997
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:01,186
of... of what happened,

998
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:05,023
but you're the sole judges
of the facts.

999
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:07,859
Render your verdict
according to the law,

1000
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:09,444
not according to emotions

1001
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:12,280
or sympathies
or sending a message.

1002
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,991
It's about whether or not
the State has proven to you

1003
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:18,078
that a crime was committed.

1004
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,164
It was a failure.

1005
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:25,710
It was a human failure,

1006
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:31,633
a systemic failure,

1007
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,344
but it wasn't a crime.

1008
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:38,807
- On July 25th, 2012,

1009
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:42,560
Christopher Duntsch went into
surgery with Madeline Beyer,

1010
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:44,062
an elderly individual.

1011
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,648
He crippled her.

1012
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,527
Pedicle screws,
drilled and redrilled.

1013
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:54,948
Nerves shredded.
Leaking dural sacs.

1014
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:57,575
Muscles hacked into.

1015
00:51:57,617 --> 00:52:00,036
These things happened.

1016
00:52:00,078 --> 00:52:03,540
But was it intentional?

1017
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:06,710
How do you know
what he intended?

1018
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:12,382
You look at what he does
before, during, and after.

1019
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:15,969
He lied,
about "this is normal pain."

1020
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:18,096
"This is something new.

1021
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,348
"I didn't do this to you.

1022
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,726
"It's simply swelling, Jerry.

1023
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:25,228
"Surgery went fine, Madeline.

1024
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,480
"It's the surgical team's fault.

1025
00:52:27,522 --> 00:52:32,068
Your wives are dead,
Earl, Harold."

1026
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,365
Look at them.

1027
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:42,370
Look at the faces
of the lives that were ruined.

1028
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:45,248
We didn't bring them to you
to have you convict him

1029
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,459
based on sympathy.

1030
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,295
We bring them to you
so that you can know

1031
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:53,882
everything the defendant knew.

1032
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:56,301
How many patients should it take

1033
00:52:56,343 --> 00:53:00,555
before you know that what
you're doing is hurting people?

1034
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:08,563
One, two, three?

1035
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:12,609
You make your best friend
a quadriplegic?

1036
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:17,655
Four, you kill? Five, you kill?

1037
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:19,824
Should I list all 33?

1038
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:23,244
I want to call them tragedies,

1039
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:27,832
but that implies no one
could have seen them coming.

1040
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:30,794
These were assaults.

1041
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:34,673
We're here talking
about Madeline Beyer.

1042
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:38,468
I know you don't have a doubt
that when Christopher Duntsch

1043
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,387
went into Madeline Beyer's
surgery,

1044
00:53:40,428 --> 00:53:45,141
he was reasonably certain
he was going to hurt her.

1045
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,143
That's the standard of knowing.

1046
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:50,438
Not that you know 100%,

1047
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,608
but that
you're reasonably certain.

1048
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:57,946
The defense is implying
it was his training.

1049
00:53:57,987 --> 00:54:00,448
He was trained for 17 years

1050
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,284
prior to operating
on Mrs. Beyer.

1051
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:05,412
Trained at the University
of Tennessee.

1052
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:07,747
Trained at Semmes-Murphey.

1053
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:09,708
Institutions with doctors

1054
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:12,669
who would not put
their reputations on the line

1055
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:16,798
by recommending
a poorly trained surgeon.

1056
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:24,264
Don't blame his training.
Blame him.

1057
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:28,143
Don't blame the system.
Blame him.

1058
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:32,522
He went into
all those operations.

1059
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:36,609
He put the scalpels
to those patients' backs.

1060
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:40,613
He kept going.

1061
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:44,117
All these people.

1062
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,537
If you're a human
who values life,

1063
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:51,124
who understands suffering...

1064
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,626
You heard Dr. Henderson.

1065
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:56,755
One botched surgery, just one,

1066
00:54:56,796 --> 00:55:01,634
and he never would have entered
the operating room ever again.

1067
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:05,597
If you don't stop him,

1068
00:55:05,638 --> 00:55:10,018
Christopher Duntsch
will leave this courthouse,

1069
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,438
leave this city, this state,

1070
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,775
maybe even this country,

1071
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:19,652
and he will find
a corner of the world

1072
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:24,574
that allows him
to continue hurting people.

1073
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:32,082
Only you can tell him no more.

1074
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:41,174
- They don't understand.

1075
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:46,137
All I wanna do
is go back to my research.

1076
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:47,847
You gotta tell 'em, Dad.

1077
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:51,267
I will never practice
surgery again.

1078
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:54,020
If they let me,
I can still do good.

1079
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:55,271
I can still help.

1080
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:58,108
- Just stop, okay?

1081
00:55:58,149 --> 00:55:59,859
It's time to stop.

1082
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:11,413
We had these hardwood floors
when you were little.

1083
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,709
Active, always active.

1084
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,336
So energetic.

1085
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,714
You were so strong.

1086
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:24,426
You would push the furniture
around across these floors.

1087
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,389
You never played with toys.
It was always the furniture.

1088
00:56:30,598 --> 00:56:32,684
And how many times did I ask you

1089
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:36,479
to stop it with the furniture?

1090
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,773
But you wouldn't stop.

1091
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,902
You wouldn't stop.

1092
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:50,869
Maybe jail's the best thing
for you, my boy.

1093
00:56:57,792 --> 00:57:00,754
- You were less dull than
I thought you'd be.

1094
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:05,050
- You're too kind, Randy.

1095
00:57:05,091 --> 00:57:09,346
- Probably blown
the whole case, but nice job.

1096
00:57:12,932 --> 00:57:17,687
- We could have done more.
- We should have done it more.

1097
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:20,607
This is gonna happen again,
you know.

1098
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:23,401
- Suppose we could do something.

1099
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:26,488
- I suppose we should.

1100
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:28,490
- Jury's back.

1101
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:31,159
- All right, well,
we got time for some hoops.

1102
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,828
I wish.

1103
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:37,582
- We gonna win?

1104
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:45,465
- I don't know.

1105
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,808
- I'm sorry.

1106
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:57,894
- You did great.
