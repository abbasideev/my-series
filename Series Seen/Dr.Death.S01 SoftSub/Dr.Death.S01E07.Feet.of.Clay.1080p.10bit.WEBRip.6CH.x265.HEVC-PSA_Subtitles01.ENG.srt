No, sir.

47
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,260
I just woke up
from a nap when y'all came by.

48
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,887
That's why I'm still
in my pajamas.

49
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,764
- I see.

50
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,266
Well, we would like
to hear your side of things.

51
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,727
But first thing
is you've been charged

52
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,854
with five counts
of aggravated assault

53
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,608
and one count
of harm to an elderly person.

54
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,528
So you have the right
to remain silent.

55
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,339
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

56
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,614
in a court of law.

57
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,408
You have the right
to an attorney.

58
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,076
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

59
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,079
one will be appointed to you.

60
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,790
Do you understand these rights?

61
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,916
- Yes.

62
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,352
- And you waive your right
to a lawyer?

63
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,794
- Yes.

64
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,379
- Okay, then.

65
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,340
Can we walk you
through these charges?

66
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,259
- I've got every case memorized.

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,012
I can tell you everything you
need to know about my patients.

68
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,346
But start here.

69
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,892
Every single surgery
I performed was textbook.

70
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,853
- Okay, then.

71
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,438
Stan Novak.

72
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,607
- Mr. Novak.

73
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,444
Presented with severe neck pain.

74
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,653
He had difficult insurance.

75
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,405
I was helping him out.

76
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,700
There was significant bleeding,
but luckily, I was able to see

77
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,745
that there was some tissue
growing on the bone.

78
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,622
Appeared to be cancerous,
so I aborted surgery,

79
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,874
sent it off to biopsy,

80
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,917
got him closed up
and off the table.

81
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,377
- And was it?

82
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,795
- Was it...

83
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,047
- Cancerous?

84
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,758
- No. Neck muscle.

85
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,802
But abnormal.
It appeared to be cancerous.

86
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,180
- Anything else?

87
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:09,434
- Well, my staff is responsible

88
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,661
for counting
the number of sponges

89
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,895
that are used in surgery,

90
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,688
and they were all accounted for.

91
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,982
But in post-op, I discovered

92
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,359
that a member of my staff

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,819
had left a sponge in his neck.

94
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,238
They should be held responsible.

95
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,867
Cindy Tremblay
was a very heavyset woman.

96
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,327
I can prove that.

97
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,954
Surgery was textbook.
Lower back pain.

98
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,682
I'd have preferred
to do minimally invasive,

99
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,458
but she was such
a heavyset woman

100
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,211
that the hole was large.

101
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,171
That caused some bleeding.

102
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,964
I inserted the pedicle screw,

103
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,342
but it drifted
a little bit off midline.

104
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,511
But that happens
in about 6% of surgeries.

105
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,888
- Sixty?
- Six.

106
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,516
I make sure everything
is done exactly right.

107
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,518
She was only in a hospital
for a couple days.

108
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,520
Never complained.
Textbook surgery.

109
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,979
Shelley Brennan.

110
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,023
The anesthesiologist
gave her fentanyl,

111
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,859
so there were complications
associated with that.

112
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,737
- Shelley Brennan died
from blood loss.

113
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,699
- But the anesthesiol...

114
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,702
That... that wasn't
a... a surgery problem.

115
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,370
- What about Dorothy Burke?

116
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,587
- You know,

117
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,297
Madeline Beyer and Dorothy Burke

118
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,134
is a large part of the reason
I came down today.

119
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,552
- You came down today?

120
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,887
- I just thought
it was medically ethical

121
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,557
for me to report those cases
to the board...

122
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,143
To the... to the... to the police.

123
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:37,897
Because somebody
has to be held accountable.

124
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,524
That's criminal.

125
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,775
On the hospital.

126
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,570
Mrs. Beyer...
I mean, Mrs. Brennan...

127
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,405
My... my... my surgery
from the previous day

128
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,614
was still in recovery.

129
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,366
And they just kept on coming in.

130
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,827
And coming...
It's very distracting.

131
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,370
If I had just been allowed

132
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,914
to follow my surgical training,

133
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,876
you know, and then
my... my medical staff

134
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,837
was also, um, working
against my wishes,

135
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,589
which is very distracting.

136
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,798
And I was trying to help her.

137
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,508
And I do have to say,

138
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,969
these allegitations
of... of drug use?

139
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,263
I voluntary...

140
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,765
I-I-I-I...

141
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,519
I voluntary, um,
voluntary drug tests,

142
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,064
hair and urine,
through this entire time.

143
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,107
Never failed a drug test.

144
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,568
And then...

145
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,654
In the first 22 years
of my career,

146
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,366
I never had any...
Any suggestions

147
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,326
or allegations of drug tests.

148
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,286
But now all of a sudden,

149
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,121
there's this... this comment.

150
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,790
This mention.

151
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,792
And that's coming
from them, obviously.

152
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,919
They are conspiring against me.

153
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,588
- Who's conspiring against you?

154
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,382
- Dr. Randall Kirby

155
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,425
and Dr. Robert Henderson.

156
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,854
Look, I just came down here
to visit my boy.

157
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,483
I'm going back
to Denver tonight.

158
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,319
- Dr. Duntsch,
you're under arrest.

159
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,363
We have to book you.

160
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,407
And you'll be seen by a judge

161
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,535
and taken to holding
to await your bond hearing.

162
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,498
- So I can't go home?

163
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,712
- Hello. This is a free call

164
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,880
from Dallas County
Correctional Facility.

165
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,840
- Hello?

166
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,259
- Dad.
- Chris.

167
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,679
- The police came by,
picked me up.

168
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,432
What is it this time?

169
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,892
- They're confused, Dad, okay?

170
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,645
It's those accusations,
my patients.

171
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,648
It's all ridiculous.
I need you to come down here.

172
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,025
Down to Dallas.

173
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,901
The bond hearing's on Tuesday.

174
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,404
- What exactly did they
charge you with?

175
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,780
- Elder abuse.

176
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,949
- Elder abuse? How?

177
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,534
- I told you. It's ridiculous.

178
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,536
But I just need you
to come down.

179
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,204
- Okay.

180
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,541
- And it's probably
gonna be expensive.

181
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,043
- Yeah. Don't worry about that.

182
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,754
- I need to get out of here.
- I should be working.

183
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,047
I just need to get

184
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,466
my medical license
approved in Colorado.

185
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,967
- Your medical license?

186
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,345
- Yeah, yeah, make some money,
hire an elite legal team

187
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,389
to expose this
conspiracy bullshit

188
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,724
for what it is:

189
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,601
Professional jealousy
and desperate slander.

190
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,852
- We'll figure something out.

191
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,146
- Tuesday.
- I'm on my way.

192
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,233
- Dad?
- Yeah?

193
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,779
- I love you.

194
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,782
- Okay.

195
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,280
- Hi, Mrs. Brennen.

196
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,165
You'll be okay.

197
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,299
- Tubular retractor.

198
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,933
Dr. Morgan, tubular retractor.

199
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,856
Kim.

200
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,859
Tubular retractor.

201
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,684
Kerrison.

202
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,017
- Kim.

203
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,605
Kim.

204
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,148
Kim.

205
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,735
I need to see Duntsch.

206
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,257
Shelley Brennan's
blood pressure plummeted.

207
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,847
It happens.

208
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,574
You stabilize the patient
and keep on moving.

209
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,768
- Is that what you did?
- Stabilize Miss Brennan?

210
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,440
Are you trying to blame me?

211
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,568
- I'm trying to understand how
a simple one-level laminectomy

212
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,778
ends up with a dead patient.

213
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,947
- That surgery was perfect.

214
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,699
We were in and out
in 50 minutes.

215
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,160
- She was in DIC
within three hours.

216
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,953
Her body covered in hives.

217
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,706
- That sounds like
an allergic reaction to me.

218
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,833
That's an anesthesiology
complication.

219
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,836
- You've had quite a few
anesthesiology problems.

220
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,422
- What exactly are you implying?

221
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,257
- You're not gonna deflect
this one.

222
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,760
- I don't think I like
your tone, Miss Piel.

223
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,763
- I came here
to tell you face-to-face

224
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,931
that you are done at Baylor.

225
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,143
Effective immediately.

226
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,856
- No.

227
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,820
I'm not leaving.

228
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,133
- Do you think I'm asking
your permission?

229
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,617
- The burden of proof
is bouncing

230
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,035
all over your court right now.

231
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,245
I haven't done anything
that warrants a termination.

232
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,791
- James, Sweeney,
Padua, Summers.

233
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,001
- I was investigated
and cleared.

234
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,253
If you fire me now, that's
a breach of our contract.

235
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,964
- Don't make this ugly.
- Bow out gracefully.

236
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,677
- Who are you calling?

237
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,137
- My lawyer. Lawyers, in fact.

238
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,823
- You think you can win a fight
against Big Baylor?

239
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,057
- I'm not fighting Big Baylor.

240
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,475
I'm fighting you.

241
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,894
I have a right to defend myself.

242
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,271
- I'm not intimidated by you.

243
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,173
- Let me have one more case.
- There's no scenario

244
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,466
that I let you back
into my hospital.

245
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,009
- Give me one more case,
and I'll let you observe.

246
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,828
- Not a single doctor or nurse
is willing to work with you.

247
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,246
You're radioactive.

248
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,164
- You recruited me from MISI.

249
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,459
I wasn't even thinking
about coming to Baylor.

250
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,672
I accelerated operations
to fill the day.

251
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,465
Bring in money.

252
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,485
- What do you want?
- You know exactly what I want.

253
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,511
- You won't get it.
- I want you gone.

254
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,721
You have to be gone.

255
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,888
- Okay. Fine.

256
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,807
Then we're negotiating.

257
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,184
I'll resign.

258
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,395
You'll write me
a recommendation.

259
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,151
- That's not up to me.
- It's up to legal.

260
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,778
Whatever it is,
we'll protect Baylor Plano.

261
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,989
Because we did nothing wrong.

262
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,094
Knock, knock.

263
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,306
What is the status of our
application for privileges

264
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,516
over at Dallas Medical Center?

265
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,144
- Why? What happened?

266
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,104
- Oh, nothing.

267
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,398
It's just exhausting
working for people

268
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,025
with limited mental capacity.

269
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,070
Baylor's out.

270
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,738
Will you follow up with DMC?

271
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,761
- The defense is requesting
bond, is that correct?

272
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,138
- That's correct, Your Honor.

273
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,973
However, the state's motion

274
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,434
for $600,000

275
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,145
is not just generally egregious,

276
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,313
but particularly inappropriate
in this matter.

277
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,691
Dr. Duntsch
is currently unemployed.

278
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,318
And as you can see
from his bank accounts,

279
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,321
submitted as exhibit four,
that his personal assets

280
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,825
do not allow for such a bond
to be met at this time.

281
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,618
- State's response?

282
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,911
- The state agrees.

283
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,248
$600,000 is not appropriate.

284
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,625
We're filing
to deny bond altogether.

285
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,170
- The state's request
is beyond the pale.

286
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,339
Denying bail for a doctor?

287
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,841
- A doctor charged with serious
and flagrant damage

288
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,509
to his patients.

289
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,429
Christopher Duntsch is a flight
risk and a danger to society.

290
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,265
- As it relates to Dr. Duntsch

291
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,683
being a flight risk,

292
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,312
he has ties to the community,
a home, and a child.

293
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,522
And as far as his privileges
are concerned,

294
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,233
Dr. Duntsch has refrained
from practicing medicine

295
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,527
from the moment
his reputation and credentials

296
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,696
were so baselessly questioned.

297
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,868
- Well, I guess, then,
at this time,

298
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,328
the state would like to call

299
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,705
Donald Duntsch to testify.

300
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,874
- Objection. Your Honor.

301
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,879
Don Duntsch is present in court
today in support of his son.

302
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,589
He's not prepared to be called.

303
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,509
- Miss McClung, Donald Duntsch
is on the state's witness list.

304
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,178
It's the state's prerogative
to call him when they wish.

305
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,057
It's your responsibility to
prep your witnesses beforehand.

306
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,277
- We appreciate you being here
today, Mr. Duntsch.

307
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,987
Where did you travel
in from again?

308
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,824
- We live outside
Denver, Colorado.

309
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,575
- Well, that must be hard

310
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,869
to have Christopher so far away.

311
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,580
- Well, Chris has chosen
to stay near his family.

312
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,332
His son.

313
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,376
And I'm proud of him for that.

314
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,837
- You seem to place
a great deal of import

315
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,840
on integrity in your life.

316
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,800
- I like to think so, yes.

317
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,345
- Mr. Duntsch, is Christopher

318
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,639
trying to get
his medical license back?

319
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,558
- W...

320
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,855
Well, I think, at one point,

321
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,314
he would have liked
that to happen.

322
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,275
But you know, now,

323
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,527
with all that's going on...

324
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,155
- So you don't know
if his medical license

325
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,824
was about to be reinstated?

326
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,327
To be specific,
a Colorado medical license?

327
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,622
- Uh...

328
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,708
I can't say,

329
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,002
um, decisively.

330
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:32,547
I, uh... that's not something
he and I talk about a lot.

331
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,216
That's a hard one
for me to answer.

332
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,551
I... I don't know.

333
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,220
- Mr. Duntsch,
did Christopher tell you

334
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,556
he wants to make bond

335
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,975
so that he can go back to work

336
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,810
and raise money for a defense?

337
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,571
- Yes. I suppose that's true.

338
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,157
- Doesn't this all point
to the fact that Christopher,

339
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,451
despite his bad outcomes,

340
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:05,163
will continue practicing
medicine, no matter what?

341
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,901
- Get the fuck away
from my house!

342
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,404
So I walk out of my office,

343
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,406
- and I'm like, "Where's Kim?"
- Enough.

344
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,549
- And all I get
are blank stares.

345
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,867
Confusion. She just walked out.

346
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,160
- Are you high?

347
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,079
- I gave you the chance
to get in, ground up.

348
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,539
And you just walked out.

349
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,308
You walked out on me,
walked out on the empire.

350
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,751
- You're goddamn right I did.

351
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,045
And seriously?

352
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,007
You're slithering
around my house?

353
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,758
How sad.

354
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,428
You're making this
pretty fucking easy, Chris.

355
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,931
I'm filing a restraining order
against you.

356
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,517
Stay away.

357
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,477
You never had an empire.

358
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,939
You never will.

359
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,770

Shit.

365
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,034
- We should be celebrating.

366
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,494
- Defense will argue
this isn't a criminal case.

367
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:34,039
They'll say it should be
settled in malpractice court.

368
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,707
- How do we counter that?

369
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,083
- I've talked to his patients.

370
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,335
Their stories,

371
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,670
anyone with half a heart
will feel for them.

372
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,339
- And what's the "but"?

373
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,593
- This isn't just about
his medical skills.

374
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,887
Defense will say,
and it's hard to disprove,

375
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,057
that these were accidents
or the fault of others.

376
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,975
So we gotta make it
about the man.

377
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,645
About what made him, about
his choices, his character.

378
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,648
We need to show that this
all started way before Dallas.

379
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm gonna talk to the people
closest to him.

380
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,112
His friends,
girlfriends, teachers.

381
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,199
- What?

382
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,659
- Skadden?
- We already tried that.

383
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:15,121
And what got back to us was,
"He came out of there trained."

384
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:18,083
- I contacted U.T.
- and Semmes-Murphey,

385
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,043
asked for his training hours.

386
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,544
This is what they gave me.

387
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,133
- 683 cases.

388
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,761
- Of which only 230 were spinal.

389
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,137
- How many should there be?

390
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,681
- Well, there's
no required minimum,

391
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,517
but a good number
would be around 400.

392
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,269
- That's his residency.
- Where's Semmes-Murphy?

393
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,105
- Told me they
don't keep records.

394
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,524
- Oh?
- Not required to by law.

395
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,777
But according to them,
he had enough.

396
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,737
I'll hear it from
the horse's mouth himself.

397
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:48,905
- I'm not sure that's

398
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,699
the end of the horse
he best represents.

399
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,203
- We should help her.

400
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,871
- I'm not going to Memphis.

401
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,081
- No. God, no.

402
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,291
Never again.

403
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,295
- You want to come to my house?

404
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,216
- Your parents home?

405
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,366
Here's Duntsch's Facebook page.
You're gonna love this.

406
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,683
Listen to this horseshit.

407
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,227
"The sound of the sea
grows near.

408
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,271
"I feel waves upon my heart.

409
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,273
"All I want, all I need,

410
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,483
the answer awaits at the start."

411
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,236
Well, he's a better surgeon
than he is a poet.

412
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,571
- Duntsch holds three patents.

413
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,533
Two with Ilya Burkov
and Katya Melnikov.

414
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,411
Registered to a company
called Discgenics.

415
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,080
- Discgenics, okay.

416
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:46,087
D-I-S-C-G-E-N-I-C-S.

417
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,965
Discgenics.

418
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,133
- Hello, doctors.

419
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:53,762
- Hey! Do svidaniya!

420
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,138
- Hello, doctors.

421
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,016
- I appreciate your
willingness to speak with us.

422
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,810
I know this puts you
in an uncomfortable position,

423
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,103
but we wanted to ask you

424
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,397
about Dr. Duntsch's time
at Discgenics.

425
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,774
And now, it goes without saying

426
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,609
that we will protect
your identity.

427
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,486
We don't want to get you
in any trouble.

428
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,113
- Trouble? What trouble?

429
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,698
- Well, it seems everyone

430
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,868
is afraid to talk
about Christopher Duntsch.

431
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,620
- We're not scared.
- We're Russian.

432
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,622
What do you want to know?

433
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,124
- Anything and everything
you can tell us.

434
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,337
Hello? Hello?

435
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,067
- What, you got hamsters
powering your Wi-Fi here?

436
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,259
- I don't think that's how
Wi-Fi works, actually.

437
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,570
- Yeah.
- I don't know why I did that.

438
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,262
And they decided it...

439
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,515
That it was...
For him to be away.

440
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,393
- Yes, but he still
had to complete stage four.

441
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,437
- Could you repeat
what you just said, please?

442
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,772
- Which part did you miss?

443
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:48,191
- The drug part
or the investor part?

444
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,193
- All of it.
- We missed all of it.

445
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:54,072
- I was saying that Duntsch
met with investors.

446
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,991
Skadden among them.
Everything was fine until...

447
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,493
- We don't know it was drugs,

448
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,412
but it was definitely something.

449
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,081
His behavior,
his performance devolved.

450
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,793
- Geoffrey Skadden
was an investor in Discgenics?

451
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:09,587
- Research, Dr. Henderson.
- Research.

452
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,047
You've clearly done none.

453
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:14,175
- He was one of the first
investors in Discgenics.

454
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,984
- Hi. Wendy Young?

455
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,666
- I have nothing to say
to you media folk.

456
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:35,363
- I'm not media.
- Name's Michelle Shughart.

457
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,823
I'm the assistant
district attorney

458
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,950
overseeing
the Christopher Duntsch case.

459
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,703
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

460
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,165
- Well, you got some kind
of subpoena or something?

461
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,542
- I don't. But I can get one.

462
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,544
Question you in
a more formal setting,

463
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,796
if that's what you're
most comfortable with.

464
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,506
It's up to you.

465
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,595
- Come on.

466
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,392
Mason.

467
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,066
- You were with him in Memphis?

468
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,901
- Yeah. Just for a bit.

469
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:16,696
A couple of months
before we moved to Dallas.

470
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,449
- But you know
what he was like at home,

471
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,077
in social settings?

472
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,579
- What do you want me to say?

473
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,247
That he was a druggie?

474
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,918
An alkie? A fraud?

475
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,295
- If that's what you have
to tell me.

476
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,305
- You're not
that much older than me.

477
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,599
- Probably not.

478
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,186
- And already a DA.

479
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,814
- Assistant.
- Assistant.

480
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,488
You like your parents?

481
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,490
- Yes.

482
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,784
- Treat you good?

483
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,077
- Very.

484
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,330
- Support you?
- Always.

485
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,502
- Must be nice.
- Such a perfect life.

486
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,895
- I'm not gonna help you.

487
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,568
- He deserves it.
- His patients, they...

488
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,445
- No, no, no. Stop.

489
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,321
The world's a shitty place.

490
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,949
He dealt them a shitty hand.

491
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,993
Look, I've got a boy
who needs to eat.

492
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,662
Needs a roof, needs clothes,
a piece of crap toy

493
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,457
from the supermarket
now and again.

494
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:53,043
And I applied for the good jobs.

495
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,669
Nothing doing there.

496
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,213
And I'm no welfare queen.

497
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:58,691
'Cause the moment
I start taking money

498
00:29:58,715 --> 00:29:59,942
from the government's
when they start poking around

499
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,926
wondering about Mason's
well-being.

500
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,889
So all I've got right now
is Chris's parents

501
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,141
and their checks.

502
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,185
So yeah,

503
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:13,021
in case you're wondering,
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

504
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,442
Thank you, Christopher Duntsch.

505
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,530
- Thank you for your time.

506
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,574
- Of course.

507
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,623
- Teresa, Melanie,

508
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,166
this is Mr. And Mrs. Keller.

509
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,168
- Howdy.
- Pleasure.

510
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,628
- Where's Dr. Morgan?

511
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,382
- Newer pastures.
- The commute was getting to her.

512
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,717
- She's from McKinney, right?
- She is.

513
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,720
- It's not 20 minutes from here.

514
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,223
- Are you saying
she didn't like me anymore?

515
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,726
Hardly possible.

516
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,396
Oh, that's too bad.
She was lovely.

517
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:56,147
- Still is, I imagine.
- Come on back.

518
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,483
You're operating at
the Dallas Medical Center now?

519
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,568
- That's right.
- You're my first case.

520
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:05,824
- Oh!
- No, I'm sorry.

521
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,118
- Oh, please. Not at all.

522
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,494
- It dills my pickle

523
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:12,872
that anybody'd fill in
half a crossword.

524
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:16,001
- Mm. Incorrectly, at that.
- Hmm?

525
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,420
- I did the same thing not ten
minutes before you walked in.

526
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,257
So what's keeping you
from doing the Frug?

527
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,591
Neck or back?

528
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,803
- Well, it's my back.

529
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,264
Just one thing after another.

530
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,266
You know. How about you?

531
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,642
- Neck.

532
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,145
Doctor says
I need a "disctectomy"?

533
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,563
Is that how you say it?

534
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:39,816
All Greek, far as I hear.

535
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,739
- My son's getting married
next year.

536
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,157
- Congratulations.

537
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,700
- Thank you.
- Where?

538
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,702
- Nothing's sorted;
He keeps telling me

539
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,912
we got plenty of time
to figure it all out.

540
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:55,165
- You're gonna be planning it.

541
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,750
- That's the truth.

542
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,461
That's the truth.

543
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:00,670
Kids?

544
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:04,257
- Oh, yes. Yes, but, you know,

545
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,509
weddings now are all...

546
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,262
done and gone for me, though.

547
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,514
- Time for rest, I suppose.

548
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,558
- Doctor's ready for you, hon.

549
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,144
- Oh. Well, good luck to ya.

550
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,480
- You too, dear.
- Your turn, Dorothy.

551
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,732
- Thought you fell in, Earl.

552
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,651
Yeah, I'm up. Let's go.

553
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:24,819
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

554
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:43,588
- Ms. Shughart,
Dr. Skadden will see you now.

555
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,729
- Ms. Shughart. Please come in.

556
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,151
Nice to meet you.
Won't you have a seat?

557
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,193
- Thank you.

558
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:34,389
- Hi, Jerry. Nice to meet you.

559
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,938
Like basketball?

560
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,234
I like basketball.

561
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:49,154
Helps take my mind off things,

562
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,822
blow off steam.

563
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,120
I'll jump in.

564
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,497
I'm trying
to establish a pattern

565
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,583
to prove
Dr. Duntsch's recklessness.

566
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,209
From what I can ascertain,

567
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,712
it goes as far back
as medical school.

568
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,674
Is that a fair assessment?

569
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,347
- Yeah.

570
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,892
- Was he properly trained?

571
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,523
- What do you think?

572
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,281
- Did you ever witness him
take drugs?

573
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,579
Mr. Summers?

574
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:46,336
- Take drugs?
- Yes.

575
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:54,052
- What's gonna happen to him?

576
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,429
- How do you mean?

577
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:01,101
- If I tell you all this stuff,

578
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,520
what is gonna happen?

579
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,314
- We'd schedule a deposition
that'll go on the record,

580
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,317
after which you'll
testify in court

581
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,653
and hopefully get a conviction

582
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:16,950
and justice for you
and the others he hurt.

583
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:21,705
- So he'll go to prison?
- I hope so.

584
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,044
- I didn't do right by him.

585
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,463
He worked so hard,
harder than everybody.

586
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,465
He never stopped.

587
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,050
And then he takes a job
at a hospital,

588
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:35,427
someone else makes a mistake,

589
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,971
and they blame him for it,
saying he's a bad doctor.

590
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,891
You have any idea
what that does to a person?

591
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,311
He was depressed.

592
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,564
I just wanted
to be there for him.

593
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,442
He needed a win.

594
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:56,031
- That's why you let him
operate on you?

595
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,574
For a win?

596
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:00,744
- I had my neck looked at
right out of high school.

597
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,328
The doctor said
I needed surgery,

598
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,748
but life got in the way.

599
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,250
And then Dr. Skadden
took a look at me.

600
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,003
- Skadden? From Semmes-Murphy?

601
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,629
- Favor for Chris.

602
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:14,674
And he didn't want to operate.

603
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:17,302
Said I had a narrow canal
or something.

604
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,804
No insurance.

605
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:21,514
But...

606
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:24,476
Chris is the smartest guy
I know.

607
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:27,020
If anyone could do it,
it was him.

608
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,900
- So the operation
was your idea?

609
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,155
- Yeah.

610
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,327
- If I was in your position,

611
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,164
I'd be upset, angry.

612
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:49,918
How are you not angry at him
for doing this to you?

613
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,881
- I could have stopped him.

614
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,591
I saw it.

615
00:36:56,633 --> 00:37:00,053
I was strong,
and I could have stopped him.

616
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,389
Kayla tried to stop him.

617
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,475
- Who's Kayla?
- Kayla Gibson.

618
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,686
With him at U.T.

619
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,938
She tried to stop him.

620
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,774
But we were just having fun,
you know?

621
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:19,656
- Do you think he did it
on purpose?

622
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,992
- No.

623
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,012
- Do you think he deserves
to be punished?

624
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,413
- He has a family.

625
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:29,124
- When was the last time
you saw him?

626
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,001
Has he come to see you
since the operation?

627
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,395
Has he come to check in
on his friends?

628
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,045
- Stop. Stop, stop.

629
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:36,548
- Has he said, "I'm sorry"?
- Get out, get out.

630
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,425
- He's not your friend, Jerry.
- Get her out.

631
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:39,735
- He did this to you.
- Get her out.

632
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,219
- Let's go.
- He killed other people.

633
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:42,345
- Come on.
- Just help me...

634
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:43,805
- Fuck you!
- He's my friend, okay?

635
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:46,057
- We need you need to testify.
- He's my fucking friend!

636
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,352
He's my friend!
He's my fucking friend!

637
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,770
Okay?

638
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:54,024
He's my fucking friend!
He's my fucking friend!

639
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:57,485
Fuck you.
He's my fucking friend.

640
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:01,281
- I bring you
more glad tidings of joy.

641
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:02,699
Thank you.

642
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,492
I gotta start inventing
some shit.

643
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:07,287
- What?
- From 2001 to 2006,

644
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,748
Skadden made $27 million

645
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,958
in royalties from Medtronic.

646
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,127
- The largest medical device
company in the world.

647
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,503
That's nothing to them.

648
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:18,256
- From 2006, "Medical
device maker Medtronic Inc."

649
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,632
"Agreed to pay 40 million

650
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,801

"to surgeons to induce them

655
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,270
to use the company's products."

656
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:34,939
Medtronic is not admitting
illegality, of course.

657
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:36,524
- Was that because of Skadden?

658
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,818
- "Spine surgery patents
are valuable,

659
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,654
"and litigation in this area
is tricky terrain.

660
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:42,965

665
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,643
Some other dude whose name
I can't pronounce,

00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,585
"are highly regarded

667

"with Medtronic.

670

"Dr. Skadden said that he has
more than 50 issued patents

00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,737
"and that he has received
reasonable royalties

672
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,054
"for inventions

673
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,776
that have nothing to do
with his practice."

674
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,700
- Well, he deserves to get paid
for his inventions.

675
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,142
I guess so.

676
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:14,437
- This is the SEC
filing for Discgenics.

677
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,814
You can see
that Skadden's listed

678
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,816
as the Executive Officer
and a Director.

679
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:21,277
That's in 2007, three years
into Duntsch's residency.

680
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,155
Two years after that, he was
admitted into the fellowship.

681
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,950
- Well, how do you like that?
- What a coincidence.

682
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,994
Why do you think
Skadden wouldn't mention

683
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,122
that he was an investor
in Discgenics?

684
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,623
- Would you?

685
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,166
- I'd like to think I would.

686
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,168
- But?

687
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,671
- Probably not,
because I'd want to hide it.

688
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:40,922
Because it's wrong.

689
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:42,674
How can I be an investor
in his company

690
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,276
and the head of his fellowship
at the same time?

691
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,178
I mean, that's what
we would call... anybody?

692
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,973
- That's the definition of
a conflict of interest, Robert.

693
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,766
- Uh-huh.
- I'm in love with your wife.

694
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,435
I am in love with you.

695
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:54,853
I know.

696
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,980
- The two of you are making
a moral argument,

697
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,231
not a legal one.

698
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,650
And nothing he did
crosses that line.

699
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:03,653
- I think we can all agree that
he definitely pissed on it.

700
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,281
- That's the American way,
Randy.

701
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:08,491
- I think we ought to do
something about that.

702
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,285
- Yes. We should.

703
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,032
- Breakfast for dinner?

704
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,702
- Kayla.

705
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,245
Thank you for coming.

706
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,122
- I turned around twice.

707
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:57,791
- Wanna sit down?

708
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:03,713
I'm sorry for springing
that article on you like that.

709
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,758
- Oof, you knew exactly
what you were doing.

710
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,551
I haven't seen him in years.

711
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:10,303
Not since med school.

712
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,263
- Okay.
- Not sure what I can offer.

713
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:14,933
- Please, sit.

714
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,735
Did that article make sense?

715
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:26,986
- No.

716
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:30,281
- But you're here.

717
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:33,451
- You talked to Jerry?

718
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,453
- I did.

719
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,247
- And?

720
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,666
- He's in a tough place
right now.

721
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,671
- And he's protecting Chris.

722
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,469
What do you wanna know?

723
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:55,306
- I'm trying to get a picture
of who he is, why he is.

724
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,935
- You're trying
to put him in prison.

725
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:08,653
I'm having a hard time
reconciling the person I knew

726
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,364
with the person in that article.

727
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,366
- It's all true.

728
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:14,909
In fact, that article

729
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:18,246
sorta just scratched
the surface.

730
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,503
- He was charming.

731
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:28,298
Intelligent, focused, handsome.

732
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,883
Very handsome.

733
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:31,968
- Y'all partied a lot?

734
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,387
- We did what most
med students do.

735
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:37,057
Work hard, party harder.

736
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:39,976
He had a wild side,
but didn't everyone?

737
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,145
- Did you witness him
using drugs?

738
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:45,648
- The thing about med school

739
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,108
is no one cares
how hard you party

740
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,943
as long as you can handle it.

741
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:50,528
Chris handled it just fine

742
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,072
until he didn't.

743
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:53,740
It started off with him

744
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,909
handing out tabs to his friends.

745
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,287
Then he started writing
prescriptions at parties.

746
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:01,790
I tried to stop him,

747
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:04,709
but he didn't care.

748
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:08,171
People knew to go to his place
to get whatever they wanted.

749
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:10,965
- You're the one
who made the anonymous call

750
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,300
to the program?

751
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,263
- I had to do something.

752
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,017
- What about his training?

753
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,896
- I can't overstate to you

754
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,482
how brilliant Chris was.

755
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,985
I'd say he was
the smartest person in school.

756
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:34,572
But he's a researcher.

757
00:43:34,614 --> 00:43:35,824
That's his gift.

758
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:38,034
He had no business
going the surgery route.

759
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:42,997
If he'd stayed
in the research field,

760
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,416
I think he'd have

761
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:47,377
one of the biggest mansions
in Germantown right now.

762
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,547
- Germantown?
- They have museums for homes.

763
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:54,467
Chris and I used to take
drives there on Sundays,

764
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:57,595
picking out the houses
we'd buy one day.

765
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:58,930
He'd say things like,

766
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,574
"Me and you, Kayla,
we're gonna run this town

767
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:02,934
and sleep on mattresses
full of cash."

768
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,477
A power couple.

769
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:07,939
Yeah, it's funny.

770
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:09,125
It's funny you should say that,

771
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,650
'cause he used to call
me and him

772
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,652
a Black and white power cookie.

773
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,742
That was Chris.

774
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:20,452
He'd say silly things like that.

775
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,580
School was stressful,

776
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:26,124
and he made it fun.

777
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,625
Whenever I was with him,

778
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,794
it felt like...

779
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,838
things were gonna be okay.

780
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:34,507
Sorry.

781
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:38,136
Maybe I should have had
an intervention.

782
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:40,138
But I was in a top program,

783
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,766
and I didn't want to deal
with any drama,

784
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:44,351
so I left him.

785
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,562
Who does that?

786
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:52,817
My parents always taught me
to care for the ones around us.

787
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,487
I didn't do that.

788
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:57,030
That article,

789
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:59,657
that is not the man
I fell in love with.

790
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:08,166
I don't even know why I came.

791
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,502
I don't want to get involved

792
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:13,004
in any of this.

793
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,297
If you use me as a reference

794
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,174
for anything I said,
I'll deny it.

795
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:19,260
- I understand, and I won't.

796
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,890
But I appreciate
you talking to me.

797
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:29,229
- I, um...

798
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,815
I wish you knew him back then.

799
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:51,251
- Maybe we can try to cut
some sort of plea deal?

800
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:52,711
- The ADA isn't offering a deal.

801
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,587
- Well, can you try
to secure one?

802
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:57,674
- They won't go for it,
Mr. Duntsch.

803
00:45:57,716 --> 00:46:00,885
- 18 months
until the trial starts.

804
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:07,851
18 months in here.

805
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:09,185
- Chris...
- No.

806
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,230
No.

807
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:16,234
This cannot be.

808
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,236
I am not guilty.

809
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,779
They can't do this to me.

810
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:21,031
- Look, we can go...

811
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:24,117
- 18 months
until the fucking trial starts!

812
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,036
That's the best that you can do?

813
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:27,346
- The system
isn't as fast as you'd...

814
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,789
- Just go. Go, go.

815
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:32,292
I need to talk
to my father alone.

816
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,632
- This lawyer,
she isn't working.

817
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:41,217
- She's a good lawyer, Chris.

818
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:43,136
- What about Mr. Damelio?

819
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:44,888
Could he work the case?

820
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:46,431
- Damelio's a tax attorney.

821
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,767
- I'm not going to make it, Dad.

822
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:49,851
I can't do this.

823
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:51,603
- No, don't... Chris.
- Don't say that.

824
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:53,355
- I'm alone.

825
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:58,068
My friends, my colleagues,

826
00:46:58,109 --> 00:46:59,527
they've abandoned me.

827
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:03,365
Family is the only thing
I have left.

828
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:07,202
And Wendy hasn't visited
in months.

829
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:10,997
She won't bring Mason.

830
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,375
And I need to see my son.

831
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,634
Maybe you could talk to her.

832
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:28,723
Remind her how important it is
that families stick together.

833
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:35,230
They never know when they might
need something from us someday.

834
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,366
Can you hear
how loud it is in here?

835
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:48,284
- Yeah.
- Do you hear how loud it is?

836
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:50,036
- Yeah, it's loud.

837
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:52,455
- It's like that all the time.

838
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:55,542
Everything you say

839
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,669
echoes off the floor,

840
00:47:57,711 --> 00:47:59,212
off the ceiling.

841
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,548
You can't hear yourself speak.

842
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:03,883
You can't hear the TV.

843
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:06,344
You can't hear anything.

844
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,972
So people just keep on talking

845
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:10,557
louder and louder,

846
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:13,435
and they turn the TV
louder and louder.

847
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:17,272
And it is like this
all the time.

848
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:18,481
I'm so sorry, Chris.

849
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:21,735
Sorry? That's funny.

850
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:24,404
Because the bond hearing
was your fuckup.

851
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,048
I could be out there
with my son right now

852
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:28,908
and not begging
for visits from a cage.

853
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,786
You are the goddamn reason
I am in this hellhole.

854
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:34,748
I'm done.

855
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:47,761
"I have burned my tomorrow

856
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:51,264
"and I stand inside today.

857
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:53,767
"At the edge of the future

858
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:56,519
where my dreams all fade away."

859
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:01,107
"I face all my sorrows.

860
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:04,819
"Shadows stand in my way.

861
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:07,864
"At the edge of the future,

862
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:12,035
"what will happen, none can say.

863
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:14,079
"You see only darkness

864
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,581
"as you ran away.

865
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,958
"You know now you were sleeping.

866
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,836
And your dreams
will turn today."

867
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,262
- It's going everywhere.

868
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:33,431
- Look.

869
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,684
- Hey, buddy.

870
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,021
Is that for me?

871
00:49:41,022 --> 00:49:42,899
- Oh.
- Guess the toy.

872
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,693
- I gotta guess the toy?
- Yeah.

873
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:46,128
- Okay, what do you think
is in here?

874
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,654
I think...

875
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:51,324
it's a PlayStation.

876
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:52,951
- Look.
- Look?

877
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:57,997
A truck! Oh, my God.

878
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:01,334
- A PlayStation can't fit

879
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,919
in that big of a box.

880
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,754
- I should have known.
- You're right.

881
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:06,524
A PlayStation can't fit
in that big of a box.

882
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,217
- And it can't fit
in that bag either.

883
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,011
- And I got it all wrong.

884
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:14,097
- Yeah.
- You got the whole thing wrong.

885
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:36,536
- 8,000 people carried
at 8,000 miles.

886
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:38,038
That's pretty encouraging,
isn't it?

887
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,707
- Yeah, now a whole bunch
