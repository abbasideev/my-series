1
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,804
I can't move.

2
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,438
Why can't I move?

3
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,858
Chris?

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,362
Where's Chris?

5
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,197
- Try to relax.
- Where's Chris...

6
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,091
- Doctor's going to come in...
- Duntsch? He's my doctor.

7
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,384
- Take a look and see
what's going on.

8
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,328
- Nothing's going on. I can't...

9
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,163
Nothing works.

10
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:28,505
I can't feel shit.

11
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,466
Chris!

12
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,388
Chris!

13
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,183
Chris!

14
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,311
Chris!

15
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,827
- And move your shoulders.

16
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,040
Shrug up...

17
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,042
and down.

18
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,794
That's it.

19
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,131
Some mobility.
That's a good sign.

20
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,967
- Fuck some mobility.
- I want it all.

21
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,219
Jesus Christ!

22
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,263
- Jerry...

23
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,474
do you remember me?

24
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,352
I'm Dr. Ivers.

25
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,855
I was the anesthesiologist
in your case.

26
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,524
- What's happening to me, Doc?
- We're not sure.

27
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,361
I'm here to ascertain whether
your partial paralysis...

28
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,654
- Paralysis?

29
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,908
- Is being caused
by the anesthesia.

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,119
- Dr. Ivers...

31
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,789
I need Chris...

32
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,000
Duntsch...

33
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,462
my doctor.

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,382
Please, call his ass.

35
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,428
Page his ass. Hunt his ass down.

36
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,200
Excuse me?

37
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,036
Excuse me?
Where are you taking me?

38
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,414
Where are you taking me?

39
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,124
- Dr. Rosario
ordered some images.

40
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,628
- Who the fuck is Dr. Rosario?

41
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,510
- Worst part's over.

42
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,889
Now, remember to lay very still,

43
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,183
or else we'll have to
start all over again.

44
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,845
- Hi, there, my name
is Michelle Shughart.

45
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,471
I'm the
Assistant District Attorney

46
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,991
overseeing
the Christopher Duntsch case.

47
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,558
- Uh-uh.

48
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,994
We don't want to have nothing
to do with that asshole.

49
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,495
- I just need a few minutes
of your time...

50
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,146
- Our family has been
through enough.

51
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,523
- Yes, ma'am.

52
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,610
- It feels like there's
an ice pick in my back.

53
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,904
- He always talked
about being the best.

54
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,865
My experience...
you got to preach it,

55
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,575
probably isn't true.

56
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,910
But I didn't feel
that way about him.

57
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,952
I liked him.

58
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,789
- We tried.

59
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,708
No lawyer would take up the case

60
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,085
'cause of the reform
down there in Austin.

61
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,796
- Tort reform. House Bill 4.

62
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,298
- Politicians.

63
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,801
I can't believe that I voted
for that dipshit Rick Perry.

64
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,804
I can't even bring
a malpractice claim.

65
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,639
Well, I mean, I suppose I could,

66
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,101
but no matter what happens...

67
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,855
no matter what somebody does
to you or the people you love,

68
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,608
all you're gonna get
is $250,000.

69
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,777
Now, what's the lawyer's cut
of that?

70
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,403
- Not a whole heck of a lot.

71
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,322
- Who wants to get all tied up
and twisted

72
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,657
for "not a whole heck of a lot"?

73
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,660
Meanwhile, Slick Rick
and his cohorts

74
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,914
and his lobbyists line
their war chests with donations

75
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,251
from insurance companies
and hospitals...

76
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,545
like Baylor.

77
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,883
- My husband made me go
to Duntsch.

78
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,760
He wanted me to be able
to get back to work

79
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,888
and help more with the kids,
but now he's gone,

80
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,975
and I'm alone
and worse than I was before.

81
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,983
- I looked into the operating
lights, said a prayer...

82
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,988
"Protect me from all danger.
Keep me safe."

83
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,308
- He spun a good tale.

84
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,396
- For every one
of his victims...

85
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,982
I've spoken
to too many of them...

86
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:43,528
and he made them all feel
comfortable until it was over.

87
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,239
- You want my help, hmm?

88
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,784
- If you can testify...

89
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,912
it'll go a long way
to putting him in prison.

90
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,498
- Will it make me whole again?

91
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,419
- No.

92
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,796
But it could bring justice.

93
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,674
- I'm too old to go looking
for justice.

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,054
I'd settle for a peaceful heart.

95
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,486
- So you want murder?

96
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,864
- How are we going
to prove intent?

97
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,159
- He killed two people.

98
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,619
- Any good defense lawyer

99
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,829
would bar other victims
from testifying.

100
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,042
With no other victims,
we have no pattern of behavior.

101
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,295
It's just
a medical misadventure.

102
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,172
- What about manslaughter?

103
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,008
- Second-degree felony.
- Carries 2 to 20.

104
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,513
And since this is a doctor,
I'm taking the under, at best.

105
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:57,310
I mean, honestly, Steph,
if you heard these people...

106
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,479
their stories,

107
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,316
saw what he did to them...

108
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,777
and they have no recourse.

109
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,487
Can't sue anybody.

110
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,740
The state of Texas took
that option away from them.

111
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,456
I feel bad.

112
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,083
- About what?

113
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,754
- I want Duntsch to die in jail.

114
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,887
- You know you're a prosecutor?

115
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,599
Dying in jail is an oft-pursued
avenue of justice.

116
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,025
- I don't know.

117
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,946
Let's focus
on aggravated assault.

118
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,491
Jury might buy he purposely
caused serious bodily harm.

119
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,909
- How could they not?

120
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,329
- Well, "purposely"
is the keyword there, Steph.

121
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,331
Hi, there, Dr. Henderson.

122
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,959
It's Paul Racconti
with "Dr. Phil."

123
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,920
I heard about your involvement
in the Dr. Duntsch story

124
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,380
down there in Texas...

125
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,424
- Dr. Henderson,
my name's Liz Geller.

126
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,717
I'm with "The New York Times."

127
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,302
We're planning on doing a piece

128
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,928
on Dr. Christopher Duntsch...

129
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,305
- Hi, Dr. Henderson,

130
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,474
this is Maya Comici
of The Blaze.

131
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,352
Please call me back at
your earliest convenience at...

132
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,604
- What is The Blaze?

133
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,189
- Yeah, I thought
about looking it up,

134
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,857
but then I decided life
is too short.

135
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,734
- And incredibly irritating.

136
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,402
- You could have
your 14 minutes of fame.

137
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,780
Now, there was a story I
thought you'd find interesting.

138
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,573
A journalist in town
did a piece,

139
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,283
and Duntsch commented on it.

140
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,451
- Where?

141
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,745
- In the comments section, Bob.

142
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,413
It's a bunch
of rambling nonsense

143
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,249
about how this is all
a witch hunt, a scam, a hoax.

144
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,544
He says he can't wait
to get back and clear his name,

145
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,631
"My patients need me."

146
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,050
- Are you commenting back?

147
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,468
- I am now.

148
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,057
"Dear Dr. Death"...

149
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:03,061
"I wish you knew
how satisfying it felt

150
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,730
"to rip your medical license

151
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,275
"out of your grubby paws
this past summer.

152
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,111
"I sleep better at night

153
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,698
"knowing you'll never practice
in Dallas

154
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,784
or the state of Texas again."

155
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,953
- You're gloating.

156
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,956
Don't complicate
Michelle's case.

157
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,459
And you shouldn't be out there
harassing the defendant.

158
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,461
- Gloating feels so good.

159
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,385
- Heavenly Father, we thank You
for blessing us with this meal

160
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,303
and for our health.

161
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,097
We thank You
for this opportunity

162
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,975
to break bread with our son.

163
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,477
Thank You for leading him home.

164
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,396
And we pray, with Your wisdom,

165
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,733
that You will guide him
back to the light.

166
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,234
Amen.

167
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,236
- Amen.

168
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,238
Lovely.

169
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,603
You know, Dad,
this is only temporary.

170
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,897
I mean...

171
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,942
I'm sure it's awkward
having me in your home.

172
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,863
- If it were up to me,

173
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,449
all my boys
would be under one roof.

174
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,165
- Well, look, I'll be gone soon.

175
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,209
I'm planning
on heading back to Dallas.

176
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,295
I'm gonna start practicing
just as soon as this bullshit

177
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,507
with the Medical Board
is cleared up.

178
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,884
I'm gonna have
my medical license back

179
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,096
before you know it.

180
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,265
- What about your son
and your girlfriend?

181
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,935
Do they factor into your plans?

182
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,273
- Well, yeah.
- I mean, of course, they do.

183
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,068
You know, I-I've got, uh,
visitation with Mason

184
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,904
once a month, and...

185
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,382
it does piss me off
that I have to spend

186
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,116
all this money
flying back and forth

187
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,244
and pay her child support,
but, you know,

188
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,996
once things are back to normal,
money won't matter.

189
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,507
This is an attempt

190
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,592
to collect an outstanding
debt, Mr. Duntsch.

191
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,052
Give us a call back,

192
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,655
as your American Express card
is in danger...

193
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,222
This is Bank of America.

194
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,807
Concerning your loan payment...

195
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,100
Chris, you keep

196
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,227
ignoring my calls,
I'm gonna have to sue.

197
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,228
Call me.

198
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,981
- Stay out of my business.

199
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,816
- Your business keeps coming
to me, Chris.

200
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,777
- Why can't you just support me?

201
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,572
- All I do is support you...

202
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,574
and your family.

203
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,218
Now, this is simple...
if you're gonna stay here,

204
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,452
you will do as you're told.

205
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,579
You're gonna declare bankruptcy.

206
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,707
I can't have these pe...
I will not have these people

207
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,460
coming after your mother and me.

208
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,588
Just wipe
the slate clean, Chris.

209
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,381
You start over...

210
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,467
not just for you,
but for your son.

211
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,054
You'll still have a chance
at a future if...

212
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,121
- Hi.

213
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,123
I know normally people
mail these in,

214
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,542
but I always like
to give a personal touch.

215
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,295
- You're certainly taking
the initiative.

216
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,007
- Carpal tunnel?
- All the typing.

217
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,551
- Do you mind
if I take this off?

218
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,264
If you approve
my medical license,

219
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,141
with my stem cell research,

220
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,852
we'd be able to relieve
the pain on the median nerve...

221
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,145
Eradicate the problem.

222
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,980
Free up all those little nerves,

223
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,816
and your pain'd be gone.

224
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,984
- Wow.
- Wow's right.

225
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,820
And just like those nerves,

226
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,198
I believe that we are all
connected to a greater purpose.

227
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,826
And I'm really hoping that
you can help me achieve mine.

228
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,119
- Oh...

229
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,829
well, you got my vote.

230
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,163
Not sure it'll help much,

231
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,000
but I'll be sure
to put your application

232
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,419
at the top
of my supervisor's pile.

233
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,422
- Great.

234
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,090
I hear you're having

235
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,344
some muscle weakness
in your extremities.

236
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,888
- Where you been, Dump Face?

237
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,017
- I had an L4-L5 lumbar
procedure right after yours.

238
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,227
Look, Jerry,
once you're out of my OR,

239
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,021
your case and care
are transferred

240
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,564
to other hospital staff.

241
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,542
It wouldn't be appropriate
for me to leave another patient

242
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,901
to come see you.

243
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,988
- Well, they really sucked
at taking over my care.

244
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,991
But fuck it. You're here now.

245
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,080
What's going on with me, man?

246
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,998
- The anesthesiologist
administered

247
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,541
an incorrect dosage.

248
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,210
This led to swelling
in your spinal cord

249
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,670
and the quadriplegia,

250
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,130
but you give it a week,
a course of steroids,

251
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,092
you'll be better than before,
as promised.

252
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,890
- Okay, Chrissy.

253
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,893
You say it's temporary...

254
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,687
I'll believe you.

255
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,192
- I'll chill out.
- Good.

256
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,529
- Hey, Chrissy...

257
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,614
thanks.

258
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,914
- Why did you tell him that?

259
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,290
It's clear
from the images that...

260
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,377
- The swelling is not
going down... I am aware.

261
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,088
We need to alleviate
the pressure on his spine.

262
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,506
I want you to prep an OR.

263
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,299
We're going back in...
posterior this time.

264
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,718
- Are you going to tell him?

265
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,178
- No. He'll just freak out
more than he already is.

266
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,014
- But he needs to sign
the consent forms.

267
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,641
- I spoke to his grandma.
- She signed off.

268
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,185
- Are you sure
you want to do this?

269
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,065
Maybe Dr. O'Connor
could take over the case?

270
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:57,243
- We were doing eight balls.
- Excuse me?

271
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,791
- Christopher Duntsch and me...

272
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,294
Cocaine.

273
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,881
You hear me?

274
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,133
All night long.

275
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,305
The night before my surgery...

276
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:23,311
We were blowing coke
all night long.

277
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,483
Chris Duntsch and me.

278
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,320
All fucking night!

279
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,699
- Cocaine?

280
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,785
Amy, seriously?

281
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,580
- Given the seriousness of what
he's claiming, I have to ask.

282
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,583
- Well, now you have,
and it's ridiculous.

283
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,794
I mean, maybe he was.
I don't know.

284
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:51,256
Honestly, I think he's
suffering from ICU psychosis.

285
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,733
His nurse told me
that he hasn't slept

286
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,259
since the night
of the second surgery.

287
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,095
That would make anybody crazy
and hallucinate.

288
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,639
He just needs to sleep.

289
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,475
- He's hallucinating that
you did cocaine together

290
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,936
the night before surgery?

291
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,189
- Well, I-I don't have
another explanation.

292
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,491
- I d... I don't know what
Mr. Summers is talking about.

293
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,784
- I have an OR to grace...

294
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,704
- Please sit back down,
Dr. Duntsch.

295
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,672
In light
of the poor surgical outcomes

296
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,317
- of Mr. Summers surgeries...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

297
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,842
Whatever poor surgical outcomes,

298
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,678
while unfortunate,
they're not my fault.

299
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,930
Mr. Summers should've had
that surgery done years ago.

300
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,641
- Our internal investigation
will hopefully confirm that.

301
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,311
In the meantime, Baylor
is suspending your privileges.

302
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,645
- This is bullshit!

303
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,332
- You'll have to undergo
a psych evaluation

304
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,690
with Baylor's
board psychiatrist,

305
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,901
and both of you will have
to take a drug test.

306
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,652
- Give me the cup.
- I'll do it right now.

307
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,989
- This is totally
and completely baseless!

308
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,161
I mean, yes, of course,
so will I.

309
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,996
I mean, if that's
what we got to do,

310
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,748
that's what we got to do.

311
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,210
- I'm sorry, Chrissy.

312
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,256
I didn't know what to do.

313
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,763
I feel like
I ain't getting the truth.

314
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,142
Like...

315
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,020
after my first surgery...

316
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,023
I could move a little...

317
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,609
but now I can't move at all.

318
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,948
So what the fuck's going on?

319
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,619
Am I gonna be able
to walk again?

320
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,207
I mean...

321
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,877
"swelling and steroids,

322
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,296
and I'll feel better
than I did before"?

323
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,054
How do I know
you're not lying to me?

324
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,439
Don't you have anything to say
about all this?

325
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,070
- You ruined everything for me.

326
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,245
Good luck.

327
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,766
- No. I-I'm...
- I'm driving around

328
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,310
looking for the lab right now...
I can't find it anywhere.

329
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,563
No, I'm standing outside
right now.

330
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,523
They're telling me
they're closed.

331
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,195
Of course I know
they close at 4:30.

332
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,405
They're just saying
there's not enough time today.

333
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,657
Yeah, Preston Road...
I'm on it now.

334
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,079
What's that?

335
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,206
It's traffic.

336
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:15,418
You're not going to believe
this, but I forgot my ID.

337
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,504
They won't let me take it.

338
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,591
Yes, of course, absolutely...
loud and clear.

339
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,468
I will be there
first thing Monday morning.

340
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,387
Okay, thank you.

341
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:32,102
Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday,

342
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,875
Hey.

343
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,716
- Fucking pathetic.

344
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:11,099
I warned you...
no drugs around Mason, ever.

345
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,851
He was napping.

346
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,145
- I told you,
I got this all under control.

347
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,397
- Was all this part of your big
Dallas plans?

348
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,541
- What?
- Wind up a junkie...

349
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,984
- You can't take Mason.
- Without a job?

350
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,486
I got a job!

351
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,739
- This isn't right!
- No, it isn't right.

352
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,491
But you know who is right?
Your Dad, about you.

353
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,161
Mason and I do deserve better.

354
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,361
- I have a relationship
with Dr. O'Connor.

355
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,363
I talked to him.

356
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,948
He wants to take over
your case...

357
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,457
See if he can help make this
as normal as possible for you.

358
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,761
I know it won't ever be
the same, Jerry.

359
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,060
We're here to help.

360
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,232
I'm here to help.

361
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,536
- Kill me.

362
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,005
- I can't.

363
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,554
- Get the fuck out.

364
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,281
- I'd like to start
our time together

365
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,700
by offering my condolences.

366
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,954
Your friend, Jerry.

367
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:43,501
- We went to the same
high school.

368
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,879
- Well, at any rate,

369
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,132
you surgeons have so much
pressure on you to perform.

370
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,385
Drugs and alcohol
can become a crutch.

371
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,806
Look...

372
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,017
I drink as much
as the next person.

373
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,603
Glass of Malbec here,
Glenlivet there.

374
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,856
Never within 12 hours
of operating.

375
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,526
These allegations against me
are completely baseless.

376
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,195
- And what about drugs?

377
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,573
- I mean, sure.

378
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,575
I have tried cocaine
back in college.

379
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,785
It wasn't for me.

380
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,162
- What about Summers's surgery?

381
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,124
I understand
you're just doing your job.

382
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,293
They told you
I needed a psych eval.

383
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,170
I was just doing my job, too,

384
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,965
to the best of my ability,
which is pretty goddamn good.

385
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,842
- Do you regret the outcome?

386
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,220
- Of course I do. I'm human.

387
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,597
But you have to get back
on the horse.

388
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,018
I just need to get back
on the horse.

389
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,853
- You don't feel the need
to take time off?

390
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,021
- I already have, too much.

391
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,898
- I'm talking
about personal time

392
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,067
not ordered by
the administration.

393
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,071
- I read somewhere once

394
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,240
that if, from time to time,
you don't have

395
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,409
negative surgical outcomes
in your practice,

396
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,285
you're not operating.

397
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,747
My patients
mean everything to me,

398
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,225
and the longer
I'm here on this couch,

399
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,710
the longer they're out there
in crippling pain.

400
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,799
- Okay, I hear you.

401
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,219
I'll let Piel know

402
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,638
I've determined
you're fine to operate.

403
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,104
- Thank you for your time,
Dr. Roman.

404
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,398
- Let me know
if you ever need anything...

405
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,441
ever need to talk.

406
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,031
- You know, there is something

407
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,949
I've been having
trouble with lately.

408
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:41,911
- What kind of trouble?
- Ah, with...

409
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:45,290
concentration,
since the suspension.

410
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,002
- Ever during surgery?
- No, no, no, no, never.

411
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,755
I was just wondering
if maybe you could...

412
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:54,090
just give me something
to bridge the gap

413
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,426
between suspension and surgery.

414
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,267
All right. There's that.

415
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,436
And...

416
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:10,065
I remembered this time.

417
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,858
Thank you.

418
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,320
Um, hey, I'm taking Ritalin
prescribed by my doctor.

419
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,131
I just want to make sure
it's not going to cause

420
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,490
a positive test.

421
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,576
- Dr. Roman already called,
told us all about it.

422
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,244
- Great.

423
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,045
- I'm not after you.

424
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:37,133
So he first shows up
here in Dallas

425
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:40,303
with a job at the Minimally
Invasive Spine Institute?

426
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,763
- MISI. Yes.

427
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,348
- But he wasn't there
for very long.

428
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,435
- Do you know why?
- Baylor recruited him, hard.

429
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,062
- Why?

430
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,481
- Neurosurgeons make big bucks.

431
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,817
- What about drugs?

432
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,194
You ever witness any of that?

433
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,200
- I flushed it.

434
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,494
- Was it cocaine?

435
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,204
- I don't know.

436
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,710
- What were you doing
in his bathroom late at night?

437
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,922
- What are you getting at?

438
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,758
- The defense
will ask you, too...

439
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,468
under oath.

440
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,938
- Briefly, and I ended it.

441
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,443
- May I ask why?
- What's next?

442
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,655
- Jerry Summers...

443
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,365
his surgery.

444
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,452
Any truth to those
eight ball allegations?

445
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,372
- I don't know.

446
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,791
- Did Jerry do drugs
the night before?

447
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,227
- I couldn't know.
- I don't live there.

448
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,503
- Is there anything that
you can think of

449
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,340
that would point
to how all of this happened?

450
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,638
- He sent me an email.

451
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,892
But I want to be clear here.

452
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:12,270
I didn't think
a damn thing of it.

453
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,607
Duntsch was always spouting,
self-aggrandizing

454
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,567
nonsensical bullshit.

455
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,195
- May I see it?

456
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,321
The email?

457
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,576
- I didn't second-guess
the email

458
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,036
until after Jerry's surgery.

459
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,830
Duntsch refused to see him.

460
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,168
He was so...

461
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,423
He was so dismissive of him...

462
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,384
of his fear and his pain.

463
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,014
And then Shelley Brennan
comes in.

464
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,855
And she's dead.

465
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,734
20 minutes into her surgery,
she's dead.

466
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,740
And I start thinking...

467
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,618
about that email.

468
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,079
- What were you thinking?

469
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,623
- Was he...

470
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,879
Was he doing it on purpose?

471
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,303
- Like banging your head
on a cupboard...

472
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:30,932
- Mm.
- Or grabbing a hot pot.

473
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,644
One little missed step.

474
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:35,937
Didn't even fall,

475
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,773
just slipped a little bit
off the ladder

476
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,900
hanging Christmas lights.

477
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,988
Work's been near impossible
ever since.

478
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,866
I'm an elementary-school
teacher.

479
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:52,328
The kids keep me on my feet.

480
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,582
Surgery is a big decision,
Mrs. Brennan.

481
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,334
- I hear you.

482
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:01,338
PT, steroids, none of it worked.

483
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,090
Surgery seems all that's left.

484
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:12,015
Going on a cruise
with my husband,

485
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,350
another couple.

486
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,728
- That right?
- Yeah, Antigua...

487
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,522
in a couple months.

488
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,692
I haven't been
on a vacation in...

489
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,736
I don't know...

490
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,447
whoo, a long time.

491
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,285
- How did you hear
about Dr. Duntsch?

492
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,747
- He came recommended
by my family doctor... highly.

493
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,999
I checked
all his reviews online.

494
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,085
Everyone loves him.

495
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,847
- Are you sure you don't want
to find a doctor

496
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:54,474
closer to where you live?

497
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,482
Mrs. Brennan.

498
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,859
- You're the man who's gonna
make everything better.

499
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,403
- Dr. Duntsch.

500
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:07,922
I've been speaking with your
GP about this spine of yours.

501
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,406
- Mm-hmm.

502
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,574
- It sounds like we need
to relieve some pressure

503
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,952
on that nerve right here.

504
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,121
But it's a simple micro lami.

505
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,164
We should have you in and out
in 20 minutes.

506
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:19,749
- 20?
- Yeah.

507
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:23,586
It takes longer to boil a pot
of pasta at a high altitude.

508
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,423
What's the schedule
looking like?

509
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,466
- Um, I'm not sure, Dr. Duntsch.

510
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:31,177
Did Baylor clear some of their
operating rooms for our use?

511
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:33,019
- Why don't you give them
a call and find out?

512
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:36,725
We'll get you
in first available.

513
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,685
Now...

514
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,336
- Do you have a drug
and alcohol problem, sir?

515
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,778
- No, sir, never have.

516
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,031
- We caught up with
Dr. Duntsch outside Denver

517
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,240
where he now lives.

518
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:53,658
I talked to a doctor

519
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,036
who said you're a sociopath
and a killer.

520
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,579
Do you have a response?

521
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,456
- Yeah, I'm gonna deal with that

522
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:03,585
in the context of libel later
when I'm defending myself.

523
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,796
- His patients all say there's
a more fitting punishment.

524
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:09,466
- Ms. Shughart, this is amazing.

525
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:13,219
- You know, I may have
bitten off a mouthful.

526
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,805
- We get it.
- How can we help?

527
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,518
- I need to prove that Duntsch
assaulted these people,

528
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,022
that he should've known what
he was doing to his patients.

529
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,440
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,817
- The only way to do that
is to differentiate

531
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,197
between a normal medical
procedure and what he did.

532
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,783
And the only way to do that
is to be able to teach

533
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:38,953
a stripped-down version
of neurosurgery to the jury.

534
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,663
So...

535
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:44,209
I need you to teach me
neurosurgery.

536
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,629
- "Pain.

537
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,632
"Pain is the most common reason
patients seek medical care.

538
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,093
"Pain has sensory
and emotional components

539
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:56,388
"and is often classified
as acute or chronic.

540
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,307
Acute pain is frequently
associated with anxiety,"

541
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:01,149
and that's how
my mother slept with my father.

542
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:05,105
Uh-oh, Bob, looks like
we've lost the class.

543
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,981
- No, no, no.

544
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,401
Um, maybe. Yes.

545
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:13,363
- Well, maybe you're more
experiential learners, huh?

546
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,325
All right, you, Come on up here,

547
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,662
lose the shirt,
and bend over the table.

548
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,832
I'm a doctor.
You are all lawyers.

549
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,917
Come on.

550
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:31,339
Okay, pay attention.

551
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:36,469
Here we have
the prominent vertebra

552
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:39,347
in the lower neck, the C7.

553
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,766
Okay, I'm just going to mark it
out here... C7.

554
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,144
- No, no, no.
- Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor.

555
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,603
You're marking it too big

556
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,814
because it's going to overlap
with the T1.

557
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,149
- How am I supposed to see that

558
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,668
if I'm not actually
inside of his body?

559
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,545
- Well, if you don't operate
as fast as you talk...

560
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,529
- Eh, Randall Kirby
is the preeminent surgeon...

561
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,198
- I'm calling it.
- Time of death is right now.

562
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,658
Uh, let's try again tomorrow?

563
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,329
- Anybody want to grab a bite?

564
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:04,515
There's a neat little place
around the corner

565
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,623
with an early-bird special.

566
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,059
- You are nothing
if not consistent.

567
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,376
- Short rib sliders, $3.

568
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,545
- Why don't you
throw your AARP card down

569
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,255
and maybe you can get it
for $2.75.

570
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,257
- Well, that's not exactly
how it works, but...

571
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,925
- Let's hop on your Rascal
and find out.

572
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,218
- Elder abuse.
- Thank you.

573
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,137
- He's not that old.
- No, no.

574
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,723
Madeline Beyer's over
65 years old.

575
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,142
She qualifies.

576
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:27,062
Injury to an elderly person
or a minor.

577
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,396
- With that charge,

578
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,398
there's no limit
to the scope of the complaint.

579
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,442
- We can introduce
all of our victims,

580
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,903
even the ones
outside our jurisdiction.

581
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,404
Show intent,

582
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:40,742
and the maximum sentence
is life in prison.

583
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:41,785
- Hmm.

584
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,248
- Shit.
- She doesn't want to testify.

585
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,751
- Why don't you let me
talk to her?

586
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,712
- We may need a lighter touch,
Dr. Kirby.

587
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,714
No... no offense.

588
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,813
- No, we had an agreement.
- We said once a month.

589
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,940
- This would be twice a month.
- Wendy, please.

590
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,233
- No, fly away.

591
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,693
- No.
- Hey!

592
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,279
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.

593
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,281
- I brought you something.
- Thanks.

594
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:21,574
- That's for you.

595
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:24,285
Hey, what is with
this little dinky ball?

596
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:25,704
We got to get you
a regulation ball

597
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,622
if you're ever going to play
for the Broncos.

598
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,725
- Okay, I'm calling the cops
for trespassing and kidnapping.

599
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,852
- He's my son, too, Wendy,
and I pay for this apartment.

600
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,837
- No, your dad pays
for this place.

601
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:36,798
- Get the fuck
out of here, fat boy.

602
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,299
- Ow. Shit.
- Who the fuck is... Ow!

603
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:40,343
- Stop it! Both of you!

604
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,225
- Shawn! Shawn, stop!
- Shawn, stop!

605
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,351
Stop, Shawn!

606
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,011
- Dad?

607
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,305
Dad, I need help. I was...

608
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,890
I was robbed.

609
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:31,019
I need some... I need you
to send me money.

610
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:37,025
I was robbed.
I need some help, please.

611
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:40,278
Please, just send me
some money, to Dallas.

612
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:43,740
Please, Dad.

613
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,054
- I sent you money, Chris.
- I'm not in the mood, Dad.

614
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,931
- You asked me,
and I sent you money.

615
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,433
- I know.

616
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:54,978
- Shoplifting? Shoplifting.

617
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,188
First, it was a DUI,
and now it's shoplifting.

618
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,458
- I told you I'd pay you back.
- How are you going to do that?

619
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:01,002
You gonna borrow
some more money from me

620
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,777
to pay me back
the money you owe me?

621
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:04,154
- It's Wendy.
- It's not.

622
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:05,947
- It is.
- Stop it, Chris.

623
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,283
- It's Wendy.
- You know, you keep playing

624
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:11,161
to the edges, and you wonder
why you're falling off.

625
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:14,289
- She won't let me see Mason.
- Well, good for her.

626
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,124
You deserve what you get.

627
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:41,900
Want?

628
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:30,115
- Texas is never gonna
reinstate my medical license.

629
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:38,456
- Well, maybe that's
a good thing.

630
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:47,882
- Nobody'll even hire me
to do research.

631
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:52,053
After everything I've done,
everything I've achieved...

632
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,016
I got nothing left.

633
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:59,894
- It's not nothing, Chris.

634
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:02,063
It's just going to be different.

635
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,533
- Nobody robbed me...

636
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,243
in Dallas last year.

637
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:18,163
Um...

638
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:23,460
I lied to you.

639
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:29,507
- Luke 15, verses 3 through 7.

640
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:31,259
"The shepherd that left
his flock

641
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,011
to find the one lost sheep."

642
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:39,642
I doubt the sheep got beaten
with a plastic bat

643
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:41,644
by a meth-head shepherd,
but all right.

644
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:48,044
- I know it's not going
to be easy, Chris,

645
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,945
but go back to Dallas
with a pure heart

646
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:54,157
and make things right
with Wendy.

647
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,787
The first step to atonement,
and the hardest, is confession.

648
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:01,122
And you've already taken it.

649
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:15,178
- Oh.

650
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,281
It's nice to see that you're
back out in your garden.

651
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:19,224
- Mm-hmm.

652
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:23,269
I had to hire someone to help,
and they're trying their best.

653
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:24,813
But...

654
00:43:24,854 --> 00:43:27,524
If you want it done right...

655
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,696
- Ms. Shughart sent you?

656
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:36,324
- Yes.

657
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,785
- She's young.

658
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:41,204
Yes.

659
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:46,251
But no one else would help us
until she came along.

660
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:50,046
I'm gonna cross a line here,
but I'm asking you to testify.

661
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:52,632
I consider myself
a fairly intelligent person,

662
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:53,967
a decent doctor.

663
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,470
I can open and fix
and close a living being.

664
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:59,139
And I can't get my brain

665
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,267
around the case
that Ms. Shughart is building.

666
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,269
But I do know this...

667
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,981
without you, there's a chance
that Duntsch may walk away

668
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,483
with just a slap on the wrist.

669
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:12,652
You're asking me

670
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:16,072
to relive something
I'd much rather forget.

671
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:19,242
- I don't see
how you can do that.

672
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:23,163
You live with the reality
of this wheelchair every day.

673
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:27,667
Duntsch belongs in prison
for the rest of his life.

674
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,753
Now, I came in too late
to save you.

675
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:32,297
I can't give you anything back.

676
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:36,009
But your testimony will ensure
that Duntsch never does this

677
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:38,762
to another patient ever again.

678
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:43,933
- What would I have to say?
- The truth.

679
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:47,312
Just tell your truth,
and everything will be okay.

680
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,858
- You're old enough to know
truth in our world

681
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,277
rarely works out for the teller.

682
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:58,740
- Mm.

683
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:02,702
What choice do we have?

684
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,913
- Morning, fellas.

685
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,373
- You're on my to-do list.

686
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:09,209
We got eyes on
Florence Nightingale's motel.

687
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,253
- Booked to be here in 72 hours.
- Great. Thanks.

688
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:15,215
- Duntsch's trips are getting
a little few and far between.

689
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:16,800
If he ever stops coming,

690
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:19,386
Denver police are slow as fuck
when it comes to extradition.

691
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:20,887
- I'm on it.

692
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,765
Trying to slip into
an already convened grand jury.

693
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,101
We've got one chance
to get this indictment.

694
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:28,269
- You know, I can't believe
this is for a doctor.

695
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:31,022
You should arrest
my elementary-school nurse.

696
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:35,068
She diagnosed me with measles.
I had the chicken pox.

697
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:44,661
- I'll see you back
at the office.

698
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:48,998
- Did we win?

699
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,084
- It's gonna be a few hours.

700
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:53,128
- Well, we cleared
