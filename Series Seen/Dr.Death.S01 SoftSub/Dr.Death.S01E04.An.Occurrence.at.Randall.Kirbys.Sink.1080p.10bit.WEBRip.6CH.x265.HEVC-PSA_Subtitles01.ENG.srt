1
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,238
- Look, I had my pick
of hospitals,

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,699
and not just in Texas...
around the country.

3
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,218
Around the world,
if we're being honest.

4
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,327
I'm talking about
top spinal centers.

5
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,288
But the reason I chose UGH

6
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,248
is because I believe in

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,042
building something
from the ground up

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,835
and really entrenching
the culture

9
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,796
into the DNA of the hospital,
make sure that every doctor

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,274
that walks through
those doors after me

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,966
knows how to do things
the proper way,

12
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,469
'cause I'm gonna change how we
do surgery here in Texas,

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,887
bring it into the 21st century.

14
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,972
- Rolling out the red carpet
for this guy,

15
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,307
offering him heaven and Earth.

16
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,017
Doesn't make any sense.

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,936
So what's the plan to deal with
this human hot air balloon?

18
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,188
- It's incubating.

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,648
- Well, we're off
to a rollicking start.

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,651
I ever tell you the broken
arm story I heard in Landstuhl?

21
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,278
- No, and I don't want
to hear it now.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,489
- It was right after
Operation Phantom Fury.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,075
The Marines got this guy,
Abdul something-or-other.

24
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,219
He and his men had been leading
these guerrilla attacks

25
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,287
in Afghanistan,
took out a bunch of Humvees.

26
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,164
He's interrogated,
doesn't say a word.

27
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,416
They must have had him
five, six days.

28
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,085
They get these orders
to release him.

29
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,544
Everybody knows he's the bastard

30
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,272
who's been attacking 'em,
but now they gotta let him go.

31
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,714
So you know what they did?

32
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,342
They broke both arms
in four different places,

33
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,885
wrapped him up,
sent him on his way.

34
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,886
Never heard from him again.

35
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,946
- So you're saying
that we should

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,430
break Duntsch's arms?

37
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,932
- Abso-fuckin'-lutely.

38
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,534
- Before it was his hands,
and now it's his arms?

39
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,268
- I'll settle for his fingers.

40
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,937
- Oh, my God.

41
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,606
- Feel free to share
your nuggets of brilliance.

42
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,986
- There's Sasani.
- We should go and talk to him.

43
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,947
- Discuss our way to justice?

44
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,824
Sexy plan, per usual.

45
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,369
- I'm more than happy
to do this on my own.

46
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,745
- Lead the way.

47
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,098
- A city with a thriving
medical community.

48
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,749
But in looking around,
UG wanted to find a niche,

49
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,418
areas where we could specialize,

50
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,270
provide quality health care for
those who don't have millions...

51
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,629
- Congratulations, bud.

52
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,756
You wanted a neurosurgeon,
you hired a Neanderthal.

53
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,177
- This is Dr. Randall Kirby.
- We were in med school together.

54
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,054
- Mm.
- Been a kidder all his life.

55
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,348
- Ever the kidder.
- Now may we talk in private?

56
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,659
- Well, we want to stick around,

57
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,727
sing like canaries
so everybody can hear.

58
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,395
La-la-la-la-la!

59
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,813
- Please come with me.

60
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,649
Dr. Kirby, would you grab me
a cocktail, a margarita,

61
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,319
spicy, with one of those
little umbrellas in it?

62
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,988
So I take it you heard
about Duntsch.

63
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,323
I've only heard good things.

64
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,992
I've got X-rays of his handiwork

65
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,368
in the trunk of my car.

66
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,662
I could pass them out
as party favors here.

67
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,473
- Thought you were supposed
to be the nice one.

68
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,832
- That's funny.

69
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,792
- He received a clean letter
from Baylor.

70
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,003
There was no negative reports
from Dallas Medical,

71
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,965
nothing in the National
Practitioner's Data Bank.

72
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,841
- You've got to fire him.
- On what grounds?

73
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,927
- Whatever grounds
you come up with.

74
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,096
- UGH isn't Baylor-Plano.

75
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,016
We don't have investors
lined up at the door.

76
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,352
Hate to be crass,
but the average neurosurgeon

77
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,521
is worth $2.4 million
in revenue.

78
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,483
Our entire mission is to
provide affordable health care

79
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,324
to low-income patients
who've been turned away

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,628
by every other hospital
in the city.

81
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,780
- Duntsch is not the only game
in town.

82
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,281
- I just hired him.

83
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,825
If I fire him without incident,
I'll be facing a lawsuit.

84
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:25,288
- So morality equals, what,
dollars and cents?

85
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,558
- If you've got some kind of
personal vendetta against him,

86
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,543
that's your matter, not mine.

87
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,021
And you'd better be prepared
to be called

88
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,673
the surgeon that turns against
his colleagues.

89
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,385
Now, I would have expected that
kind of behavior from Kirby,

90
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,262
but not from someone
of your stature.

91
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,078
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,788
- Oh.

93
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,830
- So...

94
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,918
so was he fired
or was he allowed to resign?

95
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,462
- That's confidential,
Dr. Henderson.

96
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,589
- Your hospital
did not report him

97
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,924
to the Texas Medical Board.

98
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,718
You did not report him
to the Data Bank.

99
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,012
- He had temporary privileges.

100
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,097
- So you weren't required to.

101
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,933
You called me to perform the
revision surgery on Mrs. Beyer.

102
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,143
- Yes, I did.

103
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,103
- So you saw firsthand
what he did to her,

104
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,247
what he did to Dorothy Burke.

105
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,355
And after all that,

106
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,624
Dallas Medical
let him walk away.

107
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,442
- They were untoward outcomes,

108
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,752
and we did what
we thought was best.

109
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,154
- Except for the patients.

110
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,450
- Every neurosurgeon makes
mistakes, Dr. Henderson.

111
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,577
Have you had complications
in your career?

112
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,914
Someday the untoward outcome
could be your own.

113
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,374
And you wouldn't want
a rogue doctor

114
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,293
breaking up your welcome party.

115
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,635
- I'll have a shot

116
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,262
of whatever's closest
to your hand.

117
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,023
I think I figured it out.

118
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,152
You wanted him under
an exclusive contract

119
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,862
with your hospital.

120
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,490
Someone like Duntsch, from
a program like Semmes-Murphey,

121
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,491
he's the perfect target.

122
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,117
Not only is he marketable,

123
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,995
but Baylor makes a profit off
of every procedure he performs.

124
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,915
So if the hospital
makes significantly more money

125
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,601
from the ones it owns
as opposed to the doctors

126
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,293
who only have privileges,
then it is about

127
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,505
the goddamn bottom line
in the end, am I right?

128
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,064
- Got a minute?
- Oh, yes, sir. Please. Sit.

129
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,441
- You told me you were going
to stop him.

130
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,528
- What are you doing here?

131
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,922
- They're throwing a party
for him.

132
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,746
- Well, I know you're
frustrated, and so am I,

133
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,282
but I've got it under control.

134
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,701
- Under control? How, exactly?

135
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,744
- There's a process.
- What process?

136
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,414
Mrs. Beyer could have died.
Dorothy Burke did, she died.

137
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,558
And how about that hole
in Elaine Johnson's esophagus?

138
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,894
- Hey, whatever it is you think
you're gonna accomplish today,

139
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,461
I guarantee you
it's not gonna work.

140
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,422
I've used every tool
in this system

141
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,756
available to me to stop him.

142
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,967
I contacted the Medical Board.

143
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,511
I filed a report.
I talked with Skadden.

144
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,513
- And you've accomplished
nothing, Robert.

145
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,181
All of the mechanisms
that are in place

146
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,783
to deal with these problems
have failed.

147
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,143
Your system has failed.

148
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,436
I've always respected you.

149
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,122
I thought you were a man
of high moral standing,

150
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,941
but you're just another spoke
in the wheel.

151
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,184
- Do I know you?

152
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,853
- We never met.

153
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,314
- Hmm.

154
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,566
You look so familiar.

155
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
Just one of those faces,
I guess.

156
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,868
- I know you.

157
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,205
- Well, I am the man
of the hour.

158
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,999
Mind passing me a towel?
I'm out over here.

159
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,182
Dr. Christopher Duntsch.

160
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,475
- Robert Henderson.

161
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,354
- Robert Henderson.

162
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,608
Robert Henderson.

163
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,952
You're the one who turned me
in to the Texas Medical Board.

164
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,288
- I am.

165
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,628
You came for me,
and I'm still here.

166
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,338
Why is that?

167
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,841
- Well, I can't figure out
if you're just incompetent

168
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,384
or you're doing all this
on purpose,

169
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,178
and that makes you insane.

170
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,807
- Did you know that people
used to say that Nikola Tesla

171
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,810
was possessed by demons?

172
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,895
Regular folk had to come up
with a negative label

173
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,024
'cause they just couldn't
comprehend his genius.

174
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,692
- I've gone over
all of your cases,

175
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,029
and I don't see
any signs of genius at all.

176
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,698
- That's because you're staring
into the sun.

177
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,535
My surgeries were perfect.

178
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,038
Every one.

179
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,456
Now,

180
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,876
circulating nurses, X-ray techs,

181
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:08,214
administrators,
they can all be so distracting.

182
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,092
We've all had complications,
right?

183
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,678
Even you, Robert.

184
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,389
Woodland Arp comes to mind,
doesn't he?

185
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,852
It's all so human, isn't it?

186
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,397
You look at someone like me,

187
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,568
someone younger, smarter,

188
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,446
more capable,

189
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,407
just filling up all the spaces,

190
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,369
sucking up all the oxygen.

191
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,829
And then there's you.

192
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,209
Tired, old, weak.

193
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,421
- I'm gonna revoke
your medical license.

194
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,346
- Well, shit. You can try.

195
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,057
Maybe you'll even succeed.

196
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,642
But if you take
my license in Texas,

197
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,394
there's still 49 other states.

198
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,063
Hell, there's an entire world
out there.

199
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,940
And everybody's looking
for a good surgeon

200
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,441
with good credentials.

201
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,904
But if you come for me,

202
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,783
you better be ready
for what I'm gonna do to you.

203
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,327
I will take your money.

204
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,621
I will take your career.

205
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:26,167
I will take what little
reputation you've ever had.

206
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,463
You want to hit me?

207
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,342
Go ahead, Robert.

208
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,844
I'm right here.

209
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,139
That's what I thought.

210
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
You don't...

211
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,004
Hey!

212
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,006
If you need a plunger,
there's one under the sink.

213
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,010
- We're not going to Duntsch's
welcome party.

214
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,154
- Come on,
you gotta be shitting me.

215
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,322
What the hell happened in here?

216
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,805
- It's not gonna work.

217
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,308
We've exhausted
every possibility.

218
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,227
- So what do you wanna do?

219
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,413
You wanna roll over
on your back,

220
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,356
put your little paws up
in the air?

221
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,242
- Afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Doctor.

222
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,619
- Everyone in here today get
a chance to meet Dr. Duntsch?

223
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,745
- Welcome, Dr. Duntsch.

224
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,181
- I just wanna say
how thankful I am

225
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,001
to have each and every
one of you on my team.

226
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:38,133
- Today, we're gonna do a TLIF
at the L4-L5 level.

227
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,527
It's gonna be challenging
for me to do a surgery

228
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,720
from over here, Dr. Duntsch.

229
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,056
Perhaps you'd allow me
to squeeze in right there,

230
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,392
since you're assisting.

231
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,606
Scalpel.

232
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,861
Scalpel.

233
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,967
I'm gonna need a scalpel,
Dr. Duntsch.

234
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,417
- I thought that you were going
to be observing my surgeries.

235
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,459
- Why is that?

236
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,605
- Because that's what you
told me in my interview.

237
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,924
- Oh, well, apologies
for your misunderstanding.

238
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,718
Bovie.

239
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,219
I didn't...

240
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,846
Misunderstand anything.

241
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,073
- If it's all the same to you,

242
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,366
we should have this
conversation at a later,

243
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,684
more appropriate time,
Dr. Duntsch.

244
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,894
Retractor.

245
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,647
- How long until I'm doing
my own surgeries?

246
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,484
- Well, I guess we're having
this conversation right now.

247
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,945
Dr. Sompura is one
of my finest surgeons.

248
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,530
He assisted me for three years,

249
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,949
plus an additional two years
under my supervision

250
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,535
prior to his performing
solo procedures.

251
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,163
- Five years?
- I graduated top of my class.

252
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,123
- Oh, I'm quite aware
of your qualifications.

253
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,292
You've reminded me
several times.

254
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,628
That's why you were hired.

255
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,008
This is where you hone
your education to skills.

256
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,259
I need to concentrate.

257
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,719
So if you're not prepared
to assist,

258
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,347
please step outside.

259
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,225
I can finish on my own.
Suction, please.

260
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,293
- You don't need
to worry about it.

261
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,237
He just wants you to get
your sea legs under you.

262
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,905
It makes sense.

263
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,617
Come on down here and let's eat.

264
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,261
You're the one who
is so desperately hungry.

265
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,538
- Yeah, I'm almost done.
- What do you want?

266
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,859
The chow mein or the fried rice?

267
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,545
- Looks good. Um, Kung Pao.

268
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,346
- We need to get
the fish tank started.

269
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,141
I was thinking something exotic.

270
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,601
You should be writing
this stuff down.

271
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,311
- I'm eating.

272
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,691
- We need art for the walls
as well.

273
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,817
Expensive art.

274
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,070
From that... uh, damn.

275
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,882
What's the name
of that fancy gallery?

276
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,009
- Um, the mall guy? Kinkade?

277
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,453
- No. No. The mall guy.

278
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,038
Sotheby's.

279
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,974
We need at least two or three
pieces of art from Sotheby's.

280
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,642
And I want you to coordinate
with Jerry about the floors

281
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,377
'cause I don't want any of that
cheap-ass vinyl shit.

282
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,796
I want it wall-to-wall marble.

283
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,299
I want the patients to feel
like they're walking on glass.

284
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,776
- Is that okay for people
with bad backs?

285
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,611
- Because I want the patients
wowing when they come in.

286
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,804
You know, like they
just walked into Graceland.

287
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,157
- You sure you wanna do
all this right away?

288
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,474
It's gonna get expensive quick.

289
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,143
- Wendy, when a patient
is choosing between me

290
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,187
and Dr. O'Connor
with a boring office,

291
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,706
who do you think
they're gonna choose, okay?

292
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,190
Which one are they
going to remember?

293
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,858
Trust me, it's gonna
pay for itself.

294
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,486
And I don't need
to get my sea legs.

295
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,404
- What?

296
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,992
- I know how to operate.

297
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,744
- I get it.
- So fuck Bishara.

298
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,746
Fuck Bishara.

299
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,494
You ever thought
of nursing school?

300
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,931
- No.

301
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,933
- I thought that was
every stripper's dream,

302
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,559
to pay for nursing school.

303
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,522
- I don't do that anymore.

304
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,024
- I'm not saying it
in a bad way.

305
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,069
I just think you have potential.

306
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,362
I think you're amazing.

307
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,044
You're smart,
smarter than half the nurses

308
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,365
I've ever worked with.

309
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,787
What?

310
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,541
Okay, then if not nursing,
then what?

311
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,084
What is it that you want to do?

312
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,753
- Honestly?

313
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,465
I just want to be a mom.

314
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,094
Making school lunches,

315
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,847
giving them those cute, little
fruit cups for their snack

316
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,142
or...

317
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,935
I don't know,
maybe even homeschool them.

318
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,234
I know it's old-fashioned,

319
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,945
but my Aunt Josephine,
the one that lives in Ferris,

320
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,574
she did it, and all of her kids
are in college now, so...

321
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,749
I just...

322
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,004
- What?

323
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,173
- I guess I just thought you had

324
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,759
so much more potential,
you know?

325
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,804
You know,
I think you're amazing.

326
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,890
You're basically the pinnacle
of human evolution.

327
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,267
Two X chromosomes.
Plus, you're smart.

328
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,643
- You keep telling me I'm smart

329
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,038
like you're trying
to convince yourself that I am.

330
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,247
- I'm trying to be supportive.

331
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,790
- It feels manipulative.
- Manipulative?

332
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,792
- You didn't say anything
about me becoming a nurse

333
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,901
when we were in Memphis.

334
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,003
And now all of a sudden
we're here...

335
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,254
- I'm just trying
to help you out.

336
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,696
- You got this fancy
new clinic...

337
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,458
- You're blowing this way
out of proportion.

338
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,842
- And you're trying to force me
to go to nursing school.

339
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,160
Don't point your fork at me!

340
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,578
Are you embarrassed by me,
Chris?

341
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,582
- Of course not.
- I'm just making a suggestion.

342
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,959
I'm just trying to help you out.

343
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,675
Wendy, come on. Just...

344
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:17,263
- No. It's fine.
- Okay. Hey.

345
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:26,648
You know what?
You're right. I'm sorry.

346
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,151
Forget I said anything.
I just...

347
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,279
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

348
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:40,370
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,252
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,900
- Where do you see yourself
in five years?

351
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,822
What's next?
"What's my greatest weakness?"

352
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,949
- That was gonna be
my third question.

353
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,080
When I was looking for space
for my clinic,

354
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,834
I saw this vacant, eight-story
building over on Frankford.

355
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,228
It wasn't much,
needs a lot of work,

356
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,754
but I want to turn it

357
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,674
into a multibillion-dollar
neurosurgical center.

358
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,926
Everything state-of-the-art
and all in-house.

359
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,430
Diagnostics, surgery,
PT, nutrition, the works.

360
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,140
- In five years?

361
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,933
Meteoric rise, wouldn't you say?

362
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,935
- I thought that was
a conservative estimate.

363
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,230
- Fortunately for MISI,
Dr. Skadden didn't lock you up.

364
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,358
- Dr. Skadden
is an amazing doctor

365
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,234
and a great friend and mentor.

366
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,694
And for sure,

367
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,547
the easy path for me would have
been to stay in Memphis.

368
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:01,618
But I wanted to challenge
myself, expand my horizons.

369
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,454
Plus, I was getting recruited
from New York, San Diego,

370
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,789
even UCLA.

371
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,791
- How do you like working
with Dr. Bishara?

372
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,088
- He has a very particular way
of doing things.

373
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,507
- I know he's partial
to keeping the training wheels

374
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,801
on all his surgeons.

375
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,220
- It would be nice to be doing
my own surgeries.

376
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,805
- Sure.

377
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,366
Otherwise, what's the point
of paying you all that money?

378
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,016
MISI is a fine institution.

379
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,685
And please don't take this
the wrong way,

380
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,326
but I think for someone
of your pedigree,

381
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,896
it's a step backwards.

382
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,691
You've studied under some of
the best surgeons in the world.

383
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,527
Your work at DiscGenics
seems groundbreaking.

384
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,156
- You've been in contact
with DiscGenics.

385
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,658
- We reached out.

386
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,496
They said you stepped away from
your day-to-day obligations,

387
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,039
but you're still a board member.

388
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,502
Lucky for us, you did.

389
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,964
You should join
the Baylor family.

390
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,008
We're better suited
for you than MISI.

391
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,762
Well, MISI recruited me.

392
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,391
I guess that call from Baylor
must have got lost in the mail.

393
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,519
- That was our mistake.
- I admit it.

394
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,604
But the timing couldn't
be more perfect for you.

395
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,524
We're in the process
of new accreditation.

396
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,068
The plan is to offer
an even wider array

397
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,611
of surgical services.

398
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,197
We're expanding our network
of hospitals around Texas

399
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,701
and need to recruit top
surgeons to handle the influx.

400
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:30,081
So from my perspective,
you're central to our plans,

401
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,208
and we can be to yours.

402
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,878
- I'm under contract.

403
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,714
- If your hesitation is about
the 600,000 advance.

404
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,549
MISI gave you,
I wouldn't worry about it.

405
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:40,884
- Well, I don't exactly have

406
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,069
that kind of money
just laying around.

407
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,054
- We have a relationship
with Frost Bank.

408
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,264
They can set you up
with a loan to help pay it off

409
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,474
and cover the expenses

410
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,476
associated
with opening a clinic.

411
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:54,064
- I'm still not seeing
the fine print.

412
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,776
- I'm gonna lift
the velvet rope for you, okay?

413
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,111
You're gonna be successful here.

414
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,114
Whatever you need,
just make it known to me.

415
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,201
We have marketing consultants
to help build your brand,

416
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,745
expand your business.

417
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,414
Obviously, we can't
point patients your way,

418
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,668
but we help you draw them in.

419
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,213
If everything goes
as I imagine it will,

420
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,842
one day, you'll be chief
of neurological surgery.

421
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,642
I can't be married
to just one institution.

422
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,936
I have to be free
to pursue my own interests.

423
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,664
- Seems to me you're looking
for a springboard

424
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,815
to launch your career.

425
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,984
What better place to do that
than Big Baylor?

426
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,201
One day, your name's
gonna be up there

427
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,203
for all the world to see.

428
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,006
I assume you're a sports fan?

429
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:09,848
- America's Snoretime.
- Come on, Jerry.

430
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,307
This was very generous.

431
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,393
- You said she had a picture
of Cuban in her office?

432
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,620
- Mm-hmm.
- Think she can score

433
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,938
tickets to the Mavs in the fall?

434
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,649
- Oh, beer's me.
- Salty Jack is the lady.

435
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,068
- Dom for me.

436
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,903
To Baylor.

437
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,947
You're taking the job, Chrissy.

438
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,991
You're definitely
taking the job.

439
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,493
- I don't know yet, Jer.
- Come on, horsey.

440
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,722
This is the biggest no-brainer
since brains were invented.

441
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,123
Dude, you're Baylor's
number-one draft pick,

442
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,684
and you even have
the arm candy to prove it.

443
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,585
- Are you flirting
with me, Jerry?

444
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,937
- You're out of my league,
but it's okay.

445
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,588
One day, I'll find my Wendy.

446
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,173
- When you find the right girl,

447
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,675
all the strip clubs in Dallas
are gonna go out of business.

448
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,010
Truth.

449
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,095
But seriously, dude,
do you have any idea

450
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,097
how much Baylor's
gonna make off of you?

451
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,933
Those billboards, all that shit
generates business.

452
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,661
They don't put any punk-ass
doctor up on there,

453
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:56,770
only the superstars.

454
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,522
Wendy, can I get an amen?

455
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,233
- I don't get it.
- Get what?

456
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,403
- The billboard, this box,
the everything.

457
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,821
It just seems fast, is all.

458
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,782
- Not fast enough
for my boy-genius.

459
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,217
He's got that Brad Pitt thing
going on.

460
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,035
Well, pump the brakes.

461
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,120
Your boy's a lot of things,
but he's not Brad Pitt.

462
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,165
- Ooh. Ouch, a hater.
- I'm just asking.

463
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,958
- Wendy, when life
gives you lemonade,

464
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,460
don't make fucking lemons.

465
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,380
The more surgeries Chris does,
the more elite he becomes,

466
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,923
the more money they generate.

467
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,901
- I don't even have the clinic
up and running yet.

468
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,970
And I still have to hire a PA.
Still need my Bonnie.

469
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,223
- Dr. Bishara sent over a list
of recommendations.

470
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,034
I'll start setting up
interviews in the morning.

471
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:38,603
- Jerry on the spot.
- Okay.

472
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,146
So I was gonna wait

473
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,066
until we had the articles
of incorporation,

474
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,192
but screw it.

475
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:51,616
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

476
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,867
- I love it.

477
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,745
- Really?
- It's so good, Jerry.

478
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:56,996
Thanks.

479
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,248
- You know, that reminds me,

480
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,709
I haven't hired
a marketing director yet.

481
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,460
You know,
someone to promote the clinic.

482
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,462
- I'll put a list together.
- No. You know what?

483
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,089
- I think I found the guy.
- Word.

484
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,425
Give me his contact info.
I'll reach out.

485
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:12,595
Mm. Okay, so his name...

486
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:15,223
is Jerry Summers.

487
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,519
- You fucking with me?

488
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,812
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

489
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:24,065
- You just got a promotion!
- Holy shit, dude!

490
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,359
Oh, my God.
I won't let you down. I swear.

491
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,201
I'll make cards,
I'll make flyers, everything.

492
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,089
I've even got this dope-ass
idea for a killer website,

493
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,364
got a guy who can build it.

494
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:35,326
- That's what I like to hear.
- So...

495
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,870
Baylor?

496
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,015
What's it gonna be, Chrissy?
You gonna nut up or what?

497
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,293
- Here's to Jerry Summers,
Executive Marketing Director,

498
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,295
and here's to Baylor-Plano,
bitches!

499
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,714
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

500
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,366
- Hey.
- Hey.

501
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:19,913
- We're supposed to have lunch
with Dr. Isaacs today.

502
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,515
But one of my procedures
got rescheduled,

503
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,042
so can you call him
and tell him I'm gonna be late?

504
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,920
And Medtronics was gonna
deliver all their screws.

505
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,439
I might not be back in time;
If I'm not,

506
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,341
can you just sign for it
and have them leave all there?

507
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,343
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

508
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,053
What's up? What's wrong?

509
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,893
What is it, Wendy? What?

510
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,482
B-A-B-Y.

511
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:54,364
- Are you serious?

512
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,032
How?

513
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,534
- A stork fucked me.

514
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,038
- Are you sure?

515
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,667
- I took a test. Twice.
- Well...

516
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,712
They give false positives.
That could be a bad batch.

517
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:11,840
- Okay.

518
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,261
You're not happy?

519
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,097
Of course I am.
It's just big news.

520
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,058
Honestly,
I'm a little hungover today.

521
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,188
And I can't be late, but I am
over the moon with joy.

522
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,566
When I get back,
we can celebrate.

- Mind if I call you doctor?

553
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,377
Kim will do.

554
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,089
You last worked
for Dr. George Clondike,

555
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,358
but only for a couple months.
Why?

556
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,260
- Know him?
- No. I'm new in town.

557
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,179
- He's an ortho-oncologist
and an ass,

558
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,222
and that's the nicest thing
I can say about him.

559
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,600
What happened?

560
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,727
- Uh...

561
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,079
I'm not even trying
to get into all that,

562
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:13,772
but it was a shit-show.

563
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,231
Pardon my French.

564
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:18,151
So I quit and went straight
to Padre for some R&R.

565
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,986
And Dr. Bishara called
and told me

566
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,946
you were looking
for a physician's assistant.

567
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,698
- Yes, he speaks
very highly of you.

568
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,452
- I just do my job very well.

569
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,180
- You also worked
for a neurosurgeon before.

570
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,498
- How was that experience?
- We got divorced.

571
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,958
- You married your neurosurgeon?

572
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,418
Interesting.

573
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,380
- They're not that interesting.

574
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,133
- You just haven't met
the right one yet.

575
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,303
So what happened?

576
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,348
- What happened with what?
- You said you got divorced.

577
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,909
- Are you asking why I'm not
working with him

578
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:50,975
or why I got divorced?

579
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,519
- Why you got divorced.

580
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,355
- Sounds like
an unprofessional question

581
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:56,690
for a professional interview.

582
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,026
- You're the one
that brought it up.

583
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:04,155
- It got stale.

584
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,701
I needed excitement in my life.

585
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,497
Buy one, get one at Target.

586
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,674
So what do you know about me?

587
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,927
- You graduated
top of your class

588
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,470
from University of Tennessee

589
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,723
where you received a PhD and MD.

590
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,267
While in the program, you also
became the majority shareholder

591
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,394
and Chief Science Officer
at DiscGenics.

592
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,438
The research you've done
on stem cells

593
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:39,274
is gonna change the face of
spinal surgery as we know it.

594
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,568
At least according to you.

595
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,155
Yeah, I don't sleep much.

596
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,074
My philosophy on the current
state of neurosurgery

597
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,701
is that it's primitive.

598
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,161
It is, of course,

599
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,163
every surgeon's goal
never to operate.

600
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:54,748
But so long as humans
have bodies,

601
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:57,417
spinal surgeries
are gonna be necessary.

602
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,294
I want to modernize it.

603
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,855
What's the point
of removing a diseased disc

604
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,256
if you can use a stem cell
to regenerate it?

605
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,900
- You're either really smart
or really crazy,

606
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,302
but if you pull it off,

607
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,763
that's one hell
of an achievement.

608
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,099
- So how is that
for interesting?

609
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,728
- I'll give you my answer
if I get the job.

610
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,566
You see, that's why I need a PA
who can keep up with me.

611
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,109
'Cause I'm like
the "USS Enterprise"

612
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,211
moving at warp speed eight,

613
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:25,320
and I need a Number One

614
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,738
who can help me
navigate the ship.

615
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,467
- I don't know
what any of that means,

616
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,368
but I'll give you
this one for free.

617
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,246
Your clinic is being run
by a bunch of dummies.

618
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,796
And who is this guy?

619
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,089
- Jerry Summers,

620
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,924
uh, Executive Director
of Marketing.

621
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,969
- So what do you do, like,
hand out flyers or something?

622
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,262
- Well, yeah.

623
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:53,598
But I'm also his website guy.
I'm building it.

624
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,935
Not my personal self,
but I hired a guy.

625
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,854
- So you're the website guy,
but not the website guy.

626
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,106
- I'm the guy that...

627
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,108
- Jerry helps out
around the office.

628
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,111
- Okay, so you got this...

629
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,404
fake website marketing guy,

630
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,864
and I'm sorry... but not sorry...

631
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,157
your front desk girl is rude

632
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,759
and doesn't have basic
office etiquette.

633
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,428
- Her name is Wendy Young,
and she's a pretty good...

634
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,871
- She's a temp.

635
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,373
She was with us in Memphis

636
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,334
and wanted to move to Dallas
to be closer to her husband.

637
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,478
But don't worry, she's pregnant.

638
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:23,771
She's not gonna be here
very long.

639
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,714
- You need at least two people
working the desk.

640
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,298
One to do phones and scheduling,

641
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,859
the other to handle
all the intake stuff.

642
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:31,511
I know a couple of girls
that'll be perfect.

643
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,430
And, dude,
those construction guys

644
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,140
are not gonna be done
before you open.

645
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,809
I get it.

646
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,394
You're a whip.

647
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,955
You're the type of person
who's gonna come in here

648
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,772
and make this place work.

649
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,817
I'm more like a hammer.

650
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,862
But I get what you're saying.

651
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,488
My references
are on the second page.

652
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,656
You can call any of them

653
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:52,800
and they'll tell you
the same thing.

654
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,868
- You know,
I'm more of a gut guy.

655
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,871
I used to play football
back in college, all-American.

656
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,832
Coach was always telling us,
the one thing in the world

657
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:04,669
that will never lie to you,
your instincts.

658
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,588
That's kind of how I operate.

659
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,133
- So what's your instinct
telling you?

660
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,555
- She's a stone-cold bitch.
- I like her.

661
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,616
- Doesn't bother you she was
married to her neurosurgeon?

662
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,309
She gives off
that money-digger vibe.

663
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,644
- Gold digger.
- Mm, money digger.

664
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,563
No one digs for gold anymore.

665
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:26,524
When were you gonna tell me
about the baby?

666
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,068
- You know, just didn't come up.

667
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,819
- Well, that's great news.

668
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,197
You, Wendy, baby.

669
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,907
I'm happy for you all.

670
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,409
Why did you say
all that shit about Wendy?

671
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:38,745
- What shit?

672
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,748
- She's just a temp, she's
married to some guy in Memphis?

673
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,043
- "Oh, hello, Dr. Morgan.

674
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,045
"Welcome to our
state-of-the-art facility.

675
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,338
"For your information,

676
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,006
"our secretary
used to be a stripper.

677
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,817
Would you still be interested
in the position?"

678
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,551
- She's about to be
your baby mama.

679
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:54,969
Who cares if she was a stripper?

680
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,697
Some of the best people
I know are strippers.

681
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:57,681
- Huh.

682
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,349
Everybody you know
is a stripper.

683
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,227
Besides,

684
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,479
Kim said she had two other
candidates for the positions.

685
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,106
- Chris, you know me.

686
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,565
I've always been supportive.

687
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,275
Don't fuck it up with Wendy.

688
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,486
- What is that supposed to mean?

689
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,863
- I mean, it was just me
and my mom,

690
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:15,740
you know, my whole life. No dad.

691
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,742
- And now I see it, this woman...
- Jerry.

692
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,011
- She's coming in
all hot to trot.

693
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,705
- Jerry, I'm not leaving Wendy,
okay?

694
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,457
And I'm not leaving the baby,
okay?

695
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:29,713
Kim is ambitious,
she's confident,

696
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,007
she has an impressive résumé,

697
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,342
and I need the best people
working for me.

698
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,432
Kim's my physician's assistant.

699
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:43,809
Okay.

700
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,826
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.
- Not now, not now.

701
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:02,746
- When are we gonna talk?
- Babe, not now. No! Not now.

702
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:06,499
- No, I don't give a shit.
- We're having a baby.

703
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,168
And you haven't said
a word about it.

704
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,132
Fine.

705
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,884
If you wanna talk, let's talk.

706
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,894
- You don't want
to have this baby?

707
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:32,692
We've only been together
a couple months, Wendy.

708
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,111
Sorry if I'm not
lighting cigars.

709
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,281
- So that's it?

710
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,492
"Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am"?

711
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,118
- No.

712
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,623
Look, I don't expect you
to fully grasp this,

713
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,708
but everything that I'm doing

714
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:54,214
will help you live
past your wildest dreams.

715
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,884
I have a plan.

716
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:03,223
All I need is for you
to go to nursing school.

717
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,058
- You fucking kidding me?

718
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,268
I'm not an accessory
in Chris's world.

719
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,812
Wendy, give me a break.

720
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,998
You had no problem playing the
role of doctor's girlfriend,

721
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,500
but now when it's not working
for you,

722
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:13,900
all of a sudden it's an issue?

723
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,294
- Nothing with you
has ever worked for me.

724
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:16,629
- It's always been on your terms.
- Oh, bullshit.

725
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:17,933
That is fucking bullshit, Wendy.

726
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,241
I wanted to go to UCLA;
That was my first choice,

727
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,802
but you're the one
that said you wouldn't move

728
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,762
unless we came to Dallas
because of your aunt in Ferris.

729
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,204
So don't pretend like
it's been me

730
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,415
just dragging you along
for this whole ride.

731
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,208
- You're blaming me?
- Oh, Jesus!

732
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,129
Can you not play the victim?
Just try it. See what happens.

733
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,922
You're the one
who wanted a boyfriend

734
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,591
who could buy your shoes and
your perfume and your makeup

735
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:40,361
and pay your rent
and whatever the fuck else.

736
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,388
And you know what?
Congratulations, you got it.

737
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,557
You won in life.
You got what you wanted.

738
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:48,893
But life is a double-edged
fucking sword.

739
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:52,105
This is what it's like
to date a god.

740
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:53,356
Keep up.

741
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:54,709
- You might be able to hustle
these stuffy,

742
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,192
buttoned-up assholes,
but not me.

743
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,652
I know you're a fraud,

744
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,505
always acting like you know
everything, but you don't.

745
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:01,698
You can't even keep a job.

746
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,909
- What the fuck does that mean?

747
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,512
- They dumped your ass
out of DiscGenics.

748
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:09,289
- I'm on the board!
- "On the board"

749
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,250
means they're too embarrassed
by you to fire you!

750
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,794
- I made $1/2 million just
by stepping foot in this city!

751
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:17,130
And everything that you have
is because of me!

752
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:19,174
I picked you up
out of the fucking gutter,

753
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,509
and I can throw you
right back there if I want.

754
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:23,053
You'll end up some sagging hussy

755
00:38:23,094 --> 00:38:25,096
working the pole
for chump change.

756
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:25,972
And you know what?

757
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,599
If I'm being perfectly honest,

758
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,784
the best thing you could
probably do

759
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,393
is abort that fucking baby,

760
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:34,814
because you are not the type
of person who can raise it.

761
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:36,649
And I'm saying that with love

762
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:39,819
because I am trying
to help you win in life!

763
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:41,571
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

764
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,199
- Fuck you!

765
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,743
Fuck you!

766
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:48,137
- Hey, open this... open the...
- Fuck you!

767
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,788
- Fuck!
- Tex-Mex, y'all. Hey!

768
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,182
- Open this door!
- Fuck you, Chris! Fuck you!

769
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:52,558
- Ungrateful bitch!
- Hey! What the fuck?

770
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:53,726
- Open up! Open up!
- Get out!

771
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,852
- Hey, shut the fuck up!
- Both of you.

772
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:56,127
- Get out!
- Open the fuck up!

773
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:57,671
Get out of my goddamn
hotel room!

774
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:58,672
- Get him out of here!
- You need to calm down.

775
00:38:58,713 --> 00:38:59,714
- Get him out!
- Fuck.

776
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:01,091
- All right.
- Get off of me!

777
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,526
- Cool it, bro. Cool it, bro.
- Get off of me!

778
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,030
- All right.
- What the hell happened?

779
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:08,139
Hey, we have to talk
about this, okay?

780
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,788
Oh, fuck.

781
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:37,002
Ah, fuck.

782
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,753
Oh, fuck.

783
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,362
Hopefully, in the future,
you stay away

784
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:07,240
from whatever unsavory
character did this to you.

785
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,785
I did it to myself.

786
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:17,167
- You don't care to share,
fine by me.

787
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,545
Let's not kick this new phase
of our relationship off...

788
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:25,300
- With an untruth.

789
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,596
- New phase?

790
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:37,979
- Articles of incorporation

791
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,316
for the Texas
Neurosurgical Institute.

792
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,319
You're officially official,
Dr. Duntsch.

793
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:53,244
Clinic's up and running,
got a gnarly man scar.

794
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,289
- So much to make whoopee about.

795
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,126
Classy.

796
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:14,974
- Most people
are so close-minded...

797
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:18,144
so narrowly focused on their
tiny, little cocooned worlds

798
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:21,272
that they don't even understand
the greatness

799
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:24,651
that I am offering them.

800
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:27,112
But that's okay,

801
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,989
because if I have to stand in
front of them a thousand times

802
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:35,370
to explain my genius to them
to make them understand...

803
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:37,831
then it's all worth it.

804
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,250
And it starts at Baylor.

805
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:44,796
I am going to
make them understand.

806
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:51,594
And this isn't
the unstoppable force paradox,

807
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:55,348
because there's only me.

808
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,642
I embody everything.

809
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:04,983
- And what am I looking at here?

810
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,193
- A screw imbedded
in soft tissue.

811
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,571
- He missed the spine entirely.

812
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:11,531
- If what you're telling me
is to be believed,

813
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:15,368
then it seems to me that
this is a case of incompetence.

814
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,495
I can train
a couple of circus monkeys

815
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,873
to do a better job.

816
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:22,792
- How do you like your steak,
Mr. Yarborough?

817
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:24,794
- Do I feel an analogy
coming on?

818
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,463
- Mm.

819
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:28,173
- Texan born and bred.

820
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:32,260
- When you slice into that
perfect rare to bloody steak,

821
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,679
it's soft, like you're cutting
through a stick of butter.

822
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:38,058
Now, if somebody stuck a piece
of wood into that steak,

823
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,392
when your knife made contact,

824
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:40,911
you'd be able to tell
the difference, correct?

825
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:42,395
- Of course.

826
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,332
- Well, the contrast between
the wood and the steak

827
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:48,068
is the same as the spine
and the muscles surrounding it.

828
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:50,403
And Duntsch couldn't
tell the difference?

829
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,405
- Which is a damn near
impossibility unless he was

830
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:55,075
actively trying to insert
the screw in the wrong place,

831
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:56,576
which would answer
your questions

832
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,328
about showing criminal intent.

833
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,332
- To bring criminal charges,

834
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:05,627
a certain threshold
has to be met.

835
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,837
I'm not sure we're there.

836
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,422
What's evident, though,
is it appears

837
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:12,467
you have a compelling
medical malpractice complaint,

838
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,594
which should be taken up
in civil court.

839
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,680
- But pushing this off
to the civil court, I mean,

840
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:20,475
if that isn't passing the buck,
I don't know what is.

841
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:26,314
- We're dancing
in a field of gray.

842
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,734
This office deals with
drug dealers and murderers.

843
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:33,405
The law is explicit.
Don't sell drugs, don't kill.

844
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:37,200
It's an undeviating line
any jury can follow.

845
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:41,287
What you're presenting me is
eight years of medical school

846
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:43,790
that we'd have to shove down
the jury's throats

847
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,166
in a handful of days.

848
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,002
They'd have to be so versed
to the point

849
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:48,461
that they could differentiate

850
00:43:48,503 --> 00:43:51,548
between sound medical practice
and criminal negligence.

851
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:53,508
- I don't think it would be
that hard for them

852
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,385
to understand
the scope of what he's done.

853
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:58,304
We're not asking the jury
to perform surgery.

854
00:43:58,346 --> 00:43:59,824
- Well, tell that
to juror number seven,

855
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,099
who doesn't wanna be there

856
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:03,268
'cause she's losing
valuable days at work,

857
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:06,730
and her kids' Christmas
wish list is going up in smoke.

858
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:08,690
- Duntsch has two deaths
that we know of,

859
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,860
and the state of Texas
has executed people for less.

860
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:15,238
- I'm not negating
what has transpired.

861
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:19,743
But you're asking us to start
up a very steep mountain.

862
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:23,455
- Ah, well, you know,
the degree of difficulty

863
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:25,498
shouldn't dictate how you
do your goddamn job,

864
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,560
otherwise we should all be
selling hot dogs at a ballgame.

865
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,502
I had a patient once.

866
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:33,465
Woodland Arp, very successful
lumbar spine fusion,

867
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:35,175
recovered nicely for six months.

868
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:36,861
Then he started having
recurring back pain in the area

869
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:38,887
where the device was implanted.

870
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:40,347
And by then,
the fusion was intact,

871
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:42,033
so Mr. Arp decided
to have the hardware removed

872
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:44,309
to alleviate the discomfort.

873
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:47,103
Straightforward, neat procedure.

874
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:50,065
35 minutes, skin to skin,
got the hardware out.

875
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:51,876
I rounded on him later on;
He was on his feet,

876
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,401
walking around, no pre-op pain.

877
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,362
He was ecstatic.

878
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:58,031
The next morning, they found
him dead on the bathroom floor.

879
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:01,409
Pulmonary embolism.

880
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:06,873
I did nothing wrong.

881
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:10,293
I did everything by the book,
and not a week goes by

882
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:11,586
that I don't think about him.

883
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,422
Now, whether he's doing it
on purpose or not,

884
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:19,260
Duntsch knows that
he is not a competent surgeon.

885
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:23,390
That's intent.

886
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:24,617
And what's gonna happen
if people find out

887
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:28,895
that you had an opportunity
to stop him...

888
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,605
but you didn't take it?

889
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:57,507
- George, take the lead on this.

890
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,676
We'll conduct
a thorough investigation

891
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:02,053
and see where
the evidence leads us.
