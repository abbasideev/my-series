1
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,940
- We here at
Baylor Plano believe

2
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,316
choosin' your own doctor

3
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,944
is man's sacred,
God-given right.

4
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,531
Advocacy,
innovation, collaboration.

5
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,324
Excellence in these arenas
compelled.

6
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,536
"U.S. News & World Report"
to rank Baylor Plano high

7
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,955
on its list of the nation's
finest hospitals.

8
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,500
But it's our down-home
Texas values

9
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,045
that won us the trust
of our community.

10
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,547
And we owe it to that community
to spare no expense

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,758
when it comes
to their health care.

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,595
That begins by recruiting
only the best.

13
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,597
Countries from around the globe,

14
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,975
37 to date, have sent
their citizens to be treated

15
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,395
by renowned surgeons,
Doctors O'Connor and Crosby.

16
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,439
They've made
the Baylor Scoliosis Center

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,317
the very first institute
of its kind devoted

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,737
to the treatment of this
devastating spinal curvature.

19
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,824
Recently, Dr. Shapiro
was awarded a preceptorship

20
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,620
under Professor
Juha Mikkelsgaard of Helsinki.

21
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,038
Finally,

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,958
representing the exciting
future of neurosurgery,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,294
we have just recruited
a rising star

24
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,922
of minimally invasive technique,

25
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,258
hailing from the University of
Tennessee and Semmes-Murphey,

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,095
the very institute that blazed
the trail in that approach.

27
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,441
- Dr. Duntsch, good morning.
- Good morning, Dr. Morgan.

28
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,838
- I'd like to go over
the equipment you ordered

29
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,489
for the procedure.

30
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,449
Yasargil micro bayonet,

31
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,285
French Fukushima teardrop
tapered suction tube,

32
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,664
micro dissector set
in titanium with case...

33
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,458
oh, wait, we have
the Yasargil bayonet forceps.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,086
You need the micro bayonet
as well?

35
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,131
- If I asked for it, I need it.

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,634
- Uh, we have Kerrisons,

37
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,553
retractors,
microdiscectomy systems.

38
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,639
Cupboards bare?

39
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,308
That's, uh, quite the
grocery list you got there.

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,352
- I'll see you in the OR,
Doctor.

41
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,483
How many surgeries
you doing here today?

42
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,445
- Just one.
- First at this institution.

43
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,655
- Oh, congratulations.

44
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,199
Insurance is never gonna cover
any of that shit.

45
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,327
- That is not my problem.
- Fixing people is.

46
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,620
Unlike the rest of this town.

47
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,955
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

48
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,249
What passes for neurosurgery
down here is a sham.

49
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,168
I'm here to nuke this place
into the future.

50
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,086
- Wow.
- Well, you impress me.

51
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,089
Usually, it takes surgeons
at least a good decade

52
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,632
to refine their God complex.

53
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,179
Christopher D. Duntsch. MD-PhD.

54
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,430
- Randy.

55
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,848
So do they have
to enlarge the door

56
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,850
to get your Northern head
into the building?

57
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:08,271
- I'm from Tennessee.
- North of Texas is north.

58
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,150
- You know what, I think I'm
gonna make you my access guy.

59
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,361
- Do I get a say in the matter?
- Nope, that's it.

60
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,196
From now on, you're doing
all of my access.

61
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,655
You are my fuckin' guy.

62
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:22,202
- Oh, goodie.
- You're my guy, Randy.

63
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,255
- Craig James. Congratulations.

64
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,691
You're about to enter
the history books.

65
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,467
- First surgery at Baylor Plano?

66
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,718
- Staff treating you okay?

67
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,345
- Everything's been just fine.

68
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,263
- Have any questions
before we begin?

69
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,557
Gonna fix my leg?

70
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,892
You'll be playing
so much tennis,

71
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,435
the next time
you're in my office,

72
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,396
you're gonna be griping
about that elbow.

73
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,028
See you soon.

74
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,492
Morning, Ma.

75
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,287
Yeah. Thanks for the alarm.

76
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,708
You, too. Yeah.

77
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,377
Love you back. Bye.

78
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,975
Double shot espresso bad
or double shot mezcal bad?

79
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,435
Quarterlies came in.

80
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,480
- Violent crime's up 2%.
- Oh, that's on DPD.

81
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,398
- With a 5% drop in convictions.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,816
- Stats don't tell
the whole story.

83
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,860
- But they don't fib, either.

84
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,905
- We've got a 99%
conviction rate.

85
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,532
Ed won't lose his head
over some horsepucky calculus.

86
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,911
- Not when he can have George's.

87
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,497
- George?
- Decade at Public Integrity.

88
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,501
That's some horsepucky
for you right there.

89
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,879
Election season can get
real ugly real quick.

90
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,344
- What happens
to George's caseload?

91
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,308
- It's an unprincipled waste
of time and taxpayer treasure.

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,102
What do you think?

93
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,271
- Perhaps "unparalleled"
is a better way to put it.

94
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,190
There's something here, Ed.

95
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,276
George didn't do anything
with it for months.

96
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,569
I want it.

97
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,282
- Your wants and needs mean
nada to me.

98
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,951
Why?

99
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,204
- Because I'm young
and naive and idealistic.

100
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,375
- And there's something
about those two doctors.

101
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,835
- Their passion?
- Exactly.

102
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,670
- Their passion means shit.

103
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,255
Someday, you'll get old
and cranky

104
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,590
and look back on this moment
from your deathbed

105
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,218
with deep abiding regret.

106
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,513
There's a reason no quack has
ever been criminally charged.

107
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,640
- What if we don't have to?

108
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,726
Build a case,
but go for the squeeze.

109
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,769
License forfeited in the plea,

110
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,414
a public health hazard
is off the streets,

111
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,523
and you get the W.

112
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,359
- That makes a lot of sense.
- Thank you.

113
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,069
- Which is why I don't trust it.

114
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,446
- Car's almost here.

115
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,989
- What car?
- For your speech.

116
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,199
At the YMCA?

117
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,659
It's on the schedule.

118
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,578
- Oh, shit. Shit!

119
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,955
Now I gotta write something.

120
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,665
- I wanted to work
in this office

121
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,460
because I was inspired
by your leadership

122
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,089
and your eagerness to do the
right thing no matter the cost.

123
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,799
- Well, that's good.
- I like that.

124
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,718
- I'm here to make a difference,

125
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,512
to fight the tough fights,
to stand up for the folks

126
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,097
who have no one left
to fight for them.

127
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,725
- Little diabetic,
but it's all in the delivery.

128
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,603
- I haven't let you down.
- First time for everything.

129
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,563
- And I'm not gonna stop asking.

130
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,483
Really politely.

131
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,989
- You are the youngest ADA
in this office's history.

132
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,367
- Which means I could be
the youngest former ADA

133
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,827
in this office's history.

134
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,544
- Kirby's been burning out
my ringer for months now.

135
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,381
Holidays included.

136
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,632
- Thank you.

137
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,384
- Don't get me over
your skis on this.

138
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,844
- You don't know how to ski, Ed.

139
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,554
- Feels good to be rid of him.

140
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,264
Doubt there's a man alive
in Texas

141
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,016
more sick of that guy than me.

142
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,645
Merino wool. That's the secret.

143
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,022
Doesn't trap the heat
or the dampness.

144
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,067
Believe me, my feet
go clammy quick.

145
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,361
You know, they say
if it's not the frostbite

146
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,406
or the gangrene that gets you,
it's the Death Zone,

147
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,367
that last 848 meters of Everest.

148
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,160
There's so little oxygen

149
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,539
that your body starts to die
minute by minute, cell by cell.

150
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,416
- But this is my office,

151
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,876
where I spend a lot of time
breathing in the air.

152
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,044
- Don't worry about it.

153
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,921
These things are
anti-microbial fibers.

154
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,524
I've been wearing these things
for three days.

155
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,175
My feet are as dry as...

156
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,897
I don't know, you fill
in whatever metaphor

157
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,222
is least offensive
to your delicate sensibilities.

158
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:41,146
- Dr. Henderson, Dr. Kirby.
- So sorry I'm late.

159
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,233
Good to see you again.
We met briefly.

160
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,919
Well, we didn't meet,
but I was in the room

161
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,696
when you came to our office
a little while back.

162
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,031
Michelle Shughart.

163
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,533
- Little while back?
- That was months.

164
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,744
So is Yarborough
parking the car?

165
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,496
- Just me today.

166
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
I get it. You're disappointed.

167
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,542
- Oh, absolutely not.

168
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,713
- When you say just you today,
do you mean just "today" today?

169
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,882
- Every day hereafter.

170
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,135
You'reour lead?

171
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,889
- Like I said, I get it,
you're disappointed.

172
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,807
I'm probably a little too young,

173
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,729
maybe a little too woman
for your liking, but...

174
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,145
- Neither is true,
Miss Shughart, please.

175
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,396
- Thank you.

176
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,066
But what I can tell you is that

177
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,069
I am passionate about this case.

178
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,905
Well, really every case,
but especially this one.

179
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,407
And people tell me
that I'm good at my job

180
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,369
even though it makes me
exceedingly uncomfortable

181
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,577
to say so.

182
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,870
- If that son of a bitch thinks

183
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,081
I'm donating one blessed cent
to his election,

184
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,291
he's got an edema
on that medulla of his.

185
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,543
- I apologize.
- He gave us his word, Bob.

186
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,296
We served up a psychopath
on a silver fucking plater,

187
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,256
piping hot,
and he goes and shits the bed.

188
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,844
- Oh, I promise I'm not
the... uh, you know, in the bed.

189
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,846
And I assure you
there's a strategy.

190
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,307
- Yeah, it's called "lock
the bastard up," all right?

191
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,768
He's down the road
at University General.

192
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,645
- We're gonna take care of it.

193
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,772
We're building
a swift, focused case

194
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,232
to compel maximum leverage.

195
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,150
- So you're cutting
a deal with him?

196
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,527
- Plea of guilty

197
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,338
in exchange for forfeiture
of his medical license.

198
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:16,241
- Your boss is an idiot.
- It was my idea.

199
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,245
- I don't take it back.

200
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,539
- I wouldn't expect you to,
Dr. Kirby.

201
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,499
I don't know medicine.

202
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,044
That's why I so desperately
need your expertise.

203
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,964
But all due respect,
you don't understand the law.

204
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,799
- You don't understand
who we're after.

205
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,259
- Dr. Kirby is correct.

206
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,386
And believe me, there is
no string of four words

207
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,013
I find more disagreeable.

208
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,974
But stripping Duntsch of his
Texas license is not enough.

209
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,243
- What he said.
- Especially the part

210
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,977
about you-know-who
being you-know-right.

211
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,603
- He'll find another job.

212
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,231
He has to go to prison until
either he's too old to practice

213
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,526
- medicine or...
- He's in a crematorium.

214
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,031
- I understand.

215
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,159
But the burden of proof
for that is insurmountable.

216
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,539
- Miss Shughart, Dr. Duntsch's
victims are the proof.

217
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,334
Duntsch is never gonna stop.

218
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,378
He's never gonna stop
on his own.

219
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,668
- Keep it up, and I will cancel
your birth certificate!

220
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,004
- Hands off!
- Mr. Novak.

221
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,508
- Jesus, Moses, and Joseph.
- He lives.

222
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,345
- So to review,

223
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,348
I'm going to be performing a
cervical fusion on two levels,

224
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,975
C3-4 and C4-5.

225
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,686
I'll also be making
a minor incision in...

226
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,437
- Three hours.

227
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,398
That's how long
they got me lyin' here

228
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,192
in this dress,
ass flappin' in the wind.

229
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,361
Won't let me eat,
won't let me drink.

230
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,238
- I had a flat tire.
- It held me up.

231
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,280
- Flat tire.

232
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,949
You know what I had
this morning?

233
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,076
Not one, not two,

234
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:27,372
but three black cats
scattering across my road.

235
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,249
If that ain't the devil
hollering, nothing is.

236
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,544
I am out.

237
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,546
- The longer you wait,

238
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,465
the faster your condition
is gonna deteriorate.

239
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,514
- Slicker than owl shit.

240
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,224
You said you worked at Baylor.

241
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,728
- I have privileges
at every hospital in Dallas.

242
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,022
- And you brought me here.

243
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,732
- Your insurance dictated.

244
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
- I'm not a rich man,
Dr. Duntsch,

245
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,569
but I'm no church mouse neither.

246
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,738
I got Blue Cross Blue Shield.

247
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,949
And you gave me...
hammer and sickle!

248
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,079
Mr. Novak...

249
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,331
what this hospital lacks
in ambience,

250
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,792
it more than makes up for
in heart.

251
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,544
I have never worked
with a finer,

252
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:19,591
more dedicated crew of nurses
than the ones here at UGH.

253
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,925
Never.

254
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,611
I don't have any other
procedures scheduled

255
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,929
for the rest of the day.

256
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,015
The OR is prepped and ready.

257
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:31,603
And the staff,
they came in just for you.

258
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,482
You will not find this level of
five-star care anywhere else.

259
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,614
What else can I say
to change your mind?

260
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,784
To make this happen? Today?

261
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,336
Scalpel.

262
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,845
Dr. Duntsch.

263
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,848
- I shouldn't have to ask
for suction every fuckin' time.

264
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,017
- Dr. Duntsch, BP is falling.
- Sponge.

265
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,693
Scissors.

266
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,205
It's a tumor.

267
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,459
He has cancer.
There's nothing we can do here.

268
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,421
Sew him up.

269
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,344
- First month at Baylor
in the books.

270
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,054
Looks like you're finding
your way around.

271
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,555
- Back of my hand.

272
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,766
- That marketing man of yours
has logged some miles.

273
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,143
Jerry's the best.

274
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,771
- And your OR schedule
is filling out nicely.

275
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,397
- Teamwork makes the dream work.

276
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,709
Baylor is a hell of a calling
card; You guys make it easy.

277
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,736
Craig James,
your first operation here...

278
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,987
- Yeah?

279
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,031
- Dr. Shapiro left word
at my office.

280
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,033
Said Mr. James reached out,

281
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,077
scheduled a follow-up
appointment.

282
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,703
- Why would that make it
to your office?

283
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,747
- Honestly, I don't know.

284
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,415
Which is why I'm telling you.

285
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,875
- Okay.
- You should check in.

286
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,585
Make sure
everything's all right.

287
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,045
- Of course. Will do.

288
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,714
- Great. Any plans tonight?

289
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,175
- Uh, nothing special.

290
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,094
- Website's live.

291
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,805
We're getting hits,
but we can do better.

292
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,266
- Pliers.
- For a screw?

293
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,619
- You can tighten a screw
with pliers, Wendy.

294
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,520
- It's called leverage... pliers.
- Okay.

295
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,605
- My boy knows this dude
in Silicon Valley.

296
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,291
Claims there's this Russian
who can rig searches

297
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,109
so when you type
"doctor in Dallas,"

298
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,527
boom, Dr. D.

299
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,863
- No more Russians. Nail.

300
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,132
- It didn't come
with nails, Chris.

301
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,284
- Of course it did.

302
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,536
You know what? Never mind.

303
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,579
- Just give me another screw.
- We need buzz.

304
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,499
Something flashy, sexy,
lure people in.

305
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,835
- It's the wrong screw.
- There are no other screws.

306
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,854
- There's this company called
The Best Docs Network.

307
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,630
They'll send a whole film crew
to the office

308
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,674
and film testimonials
about your prowess.

309
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,138
- Duntsch.

310
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,016
Uh-huh. Okay.

311
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,309
I'll be right there.

312
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,519
An emergency at the clinic.

313
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,646
- It's the third emergency
this week, Chris.

314
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,983
- This crib's for your son.

315
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,502
- I'll finish it as soon
as I get back.

316
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,777
- Chris!

317
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,453
- Been busy at the clinic.

318
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,621
- Just shut up, Jerry! Just...

319
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,182
Will you give me a ride
to Babies R Us?

320
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,017
- Gotta grab my keys.

321
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,059
Thank you.

322
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,761
- Stop, stop. Hold that tongue.

323
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,940
Hurry up, woman!

324
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,346
Kim!

325
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,544
- I figured he learned to fight
like that in the frat house.

326
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,920
Nope.

327
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,606
You know what Brent said?
He said it was...

328
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,674
- Baltimore.
- Yeah.

329
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,510
- Good morning, everyone!

330
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,888
- Helluva dude, that Dr. Morgan.

331
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,558
- I owe my life
to that rat bastard.

332
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,602
- Dr. Morgan? Who? You?

333
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,104
- Dr. Brent Morgan, you know?

334
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,232
- Your ex?

335
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,571
- Can we turn that crap off?

336
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,284
I've got it from here.

337
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,829
Forceps.

338
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,418
- That segmental artery
is not tied off.

339
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,461
You... you're gonna...

340
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,881
- Sponge.

341
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,633
- That needs to be tied, Doctor.

342
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,468
It'll keep pooling
in the disc space.

343
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,638
- You can't see the...
- I work by feel, not by sight.

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,098
And turn that fucking music off!

345
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,558
Bone drill.

346
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,019
- You cannot drill
while he's hemorrhaging.

347
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,111
Jesus Christ.

348
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,247
- Careful where you wag
that thing.

349
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:51,584
- That wasn't medicine
in there; That was a disgrace.

350
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,169
You're not a doctor.

351
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,172
You're a butcher.

352
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,179
- Robert Henderson.
- Dr. Henderson,

353
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,724
this is Dr. Jacob French
from UT Memphis.

354
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,368
- Thanks for getting back
to me so quickly.

355
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,019
- Sure.

356
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,579
Your message said you were
calling from DMC.

357
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,731
- What's that?
- Dallas Medical Center.

358
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,024
- Ah, okay.

359
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,276
DMC. What's happening?

360
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,820
- You're the chairman
of the department there?

361
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,655
- That's right.

362
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,993
- Do you recall a student there
named Christopher Duntsch?

363
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,119
- Yeah.

364
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,872
- We have a...
- a bit of an issue here.

365
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,623
Do you mind if I fill you in?

366
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,294
- An anonymous call
tipped off his residency.

367
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,380
Purportedly, Duntsch would
round under the influence.

368
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,551
So he was sent to
a impaired physicians program,

369
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,802
was eventually cleared,

370
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,430
and, uh, allowed to continue
his studies.

371
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,849
- Look at you, Nancy Drew.

372
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,018
- They have no idea
who called it in?

373
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,061
- No.

374
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:54,939
- So we can't interview anybody?

375
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:59,277
Every one of his references
failed to mention this program.

376
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,196
Because of confidentiality?

377
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,239
- Well, maybe they didn't
even know.

378
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,741
- Isn't that an issue?

379
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,034
Shouldn't that be something

380
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,661
hospitals hiring doctors
take into consideration?

381
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,205
- This is one of the many ways

382
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,999
a Tennessee problem becomes
a Texas problem.

383
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,503
- How'd he get away with it?

384
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:21,424
Even after his first patient.
Uh, what was his name?

385
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,134
Craig James.

386
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,679
Duntsch operated
on the wrong vertebra.

387
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,099
Baylor found out
and still let him continue.

388
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,684
I mean, nobody said anything?

389
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,936
- You hear stories,
grist for the rumor mill,

390
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,312
but nurses are gossips,

391
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,272
and surgeons,
they're a finicky lot.

392
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,191
They tend to turn
their noses up at anybody

393
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,193
with an extra dollop
of personality.

394
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,737
- What changed your mind?
- What do you mean?

395
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,156
- Joe Padua.
- You operated with Duntsch,

396
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,535
and it looks to me
like he almost killed him.

397
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,619
- Right.

398
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,870
- So if you were there.

399
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,832
If you saw what you saw,
why didn't you stop him?

400
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,130
You don't have clue one
what you're talking about.

401
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,465
- That's why we're here.
- Clue me in.

402
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,759
- Yeah.

403
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,886
- He really doesn't like me,
does he?

404
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:12,183
- He can be challenging,
but he has a good heart.

405
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,477
- You understand
why I'm asking, right?

406
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,980
I have to stand in front
of a judge and jury and say

407
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,149
that, over the course
of two years,

408
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,819
this man butchered
all these patients.

409
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,989
It was so bad,
it was so out of the ordinary,

410
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,908
but nobody, not a nurse,
an administrator,

411
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,827
or shoot,
even Dr. Randall Kirby himself

412
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:31,953
was able to stop him.

413
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,706
Some didn't even try.

414
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,377
- I have an issue. I have to go.

415
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:50,180
- The politics inside
of an operating room...

416
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,639
are complicated.

417
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:08,448
- Whatever you need, tell me.
- I'm taking your patient.

418
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,716
Scalpel.

419
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,391
- Ugh.
- Quiet, please.

420
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,810
DeBakey.

421
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,735
There's something in there.

422
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,457
It's a sponge.

423
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,422
This is the cause
of the infection.

424
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,741
- With work, sometimes I forget
to eat, if you can believe it.

425
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:39,039
- You are the salt and light
this city needs, Christopher.

426
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,250
- We're proud of you, son.

427
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,753
And I hope
you're proud of yourself.

428
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,924
- Thanks, Dad.

429
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,762
- And we like her.

430
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,055
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,723
- Very much.
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,099
- A woman like that
by your side,

433
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,727
a man could move mountains.

434
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,270
- So sorry.

435
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,774
There was a five-car pile up
at the ladies room, right?

436
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:14,908
Wasn't this puny when I left.
Who stole a bite?

437
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,869
Don, I'm lookin' right at you.

438
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,080
- Oh. Cod at a steakhouse?

439
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,123
We would Code Red you for that
in the Marines.

440
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,335
Oh, Semper Fish.

441
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,837
- I don't eat any animal that
can't be felled by a bullet.

442
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,005
- Unless it's his bullet,

443
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,274
in which case,
we'd all starve to death.

444
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,133
- Keep talking, Mr. Big Shot.

445
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:35,178
- Our place in Colorado borders
the state game lands.

446
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,013
Don can hunt
in his own backyard.

447
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,474
- I can picture you out there
with your .30/30,

448
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,976
flinging peas
at some mountain goat.

449
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,020
- My .300 Savage begs to differ.

450
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,398
- Hmm.
- Winchester girl over here.

451
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,483
- Oh.

452
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,694
- I don't know what we would
have done without Kim.

453
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,004
Couldn't have got the business
up and running,

454
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,405
I can tell you that much.

455
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,078
- Take care of my boy, Kim.

456
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,289
He's gonna need all the help
he can get,

457
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,791
especially once
the baby gets here.

458
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,085
- Mm.

459
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,854
- Tell me, Susan, whatever...

460
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,689
whatever I can do to help.

461
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,692
- Well...

462
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,153
I know Wendy's got
tons of family in the area,

463
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,822
but I want my Chris
to help shoulder the burden.

464
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,658
- Mom.

465
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,719
- Have you made arrangements

466
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:43,038
for your boy's baptism yet,
Chris?

467
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:52,088
- Not really.

468
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,890
I don't have an opinion
one way or the other.

469
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,633
- Well, you better
have an opinion.

470
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,094
Your son's salvation
is on the line.

471
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,559
- Listen to your mother, Chris.

472
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,728
You need to book a church
well ahead.

473
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:29,084
Just a secretary moving
with her husband.

474
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,919
She'll be gone
once she gives birth.

475
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,713
- She will.

476
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:38,009
Look, Wendy is just a wrecked
stripper from Memphis.

477
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,552
She's got nothing going for her.

478
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,680
She doesn't even have a dream.
She is not like you.

479
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,975
She's got your baby.

480
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,312
It's your child, you sick fuck!

481
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,790
- Okay, so we give her
a couple of weeks

482
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,649
to get her shit together
after the baby comes,

483
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:57,070
and then she's out and I can
focus all my attention on you.

484
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,114
- I found them.

485
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:03,618
The drugs. In the bathroom.

486
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,120
I know.

487
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,266
What are you talking about?

488
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,309
There are no drugs
in the bathroom.

489
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,168
- Because I flushed them.

490
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:21,344
Oh, fuck... Jerry.

491
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,846
I'll talk to him, okay?

492
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,973
- Kim.
- I'm not stupid.

493
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,224
- Okay, okay. Kim.

494
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,769
Come on, come on, babe.

495
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,771
All right, look.

496
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,357
They're my neurostimulants.

497
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,960
But I only take them
when I need to focus

498
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,486
on writing a paper.

499
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,822
They're no worse than the shit
a third grader takes.

500
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:42,198
Come on.

501
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:47,328
- Don't... Chris.

502
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,414
Don't touch me.
Get out of my fucking way!

503
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,332
- Oh, my God! Not until you
stop acting absurd!

504
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,918
- You're being crazy right now!
- Oh, yes, I am crazy!

505
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,254
I am crazy for being
the only person left in town

506
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,797
who wants to work with you!

507
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,483
- You're not even making
any sense right now.

508
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,135
- Remember Dr. Darnton?
- Remember that?

509
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,679
And your little
pecker-pulling match?

510
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,431
All the access surgeons
found out about it

511
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,974
and don't want
to perform with you.

512
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,434
- Bullshit.

513
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,853
I have an L5-S1 fusion
scheduled for tomorrow.

514
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,271
- Not anymore!

515
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,534
- What happened with Mr. Padua?

516
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:30,497
- Well, the surgery was normal.
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

517
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,208
With the exception
of a scrub tech

518
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,251
with the pace of molasses,
and a resident who...

519
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:38,171
- Says here the procedure
was delayed...

520
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:41,383
for a week.

521
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,885
- Yes, there were some
challenges with the scheduling.

522
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,053
But we accommodated.

523
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:46,888
- Challenges?

524
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,892
- The access surgeons.
- They were all booked up.

525
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:54,062
- I was a nurse for many years
before entering management.

526
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,689
I'm so fluent
in doctor bullshit,

527
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,732
I can whiff it all the way
from Fort Worth.

528
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:00,902
Look, I'm not trying
to cause trouble here,

529
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,571
but I think...

530
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,824
there are some fragile
male egos in this town

531
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,617
that don't like my style.

532
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,161
You're new here.

533
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:13,456
It's on you to figure out how
to play nice in the sandbox.

534
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:15,458
We're invested
in this partnership,

535
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,128
and we need to know
that we can rely on you.

Oh!

549
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,912
I miss
those Tennessee girls, bro.

550
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,289
They strip for the love of it.

551
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,877
- We need aggressive expansion.
- Name recognition.

552
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,718
Go to the people directly,
then bring them in.

553
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,089
- Come on, man, I brought
you here to cheer you up.

554
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,342
- Take your mind off of...
- You fucked up, Jerry.

555
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,135
I relied on you
to bring me new patients.

556
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,928
- And I did!
- Not enough.

557
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,306
- Motherfuck...
- you've been mesmerized.

558
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,891
Get her out of your head, bro.

559
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:16,311
Dump Face I know
wouldn't wig out like this.

560
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:19,189
They're just jealous,
all those doctors.

561
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,982
That's why they came after you.

562
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,444
You're changing the game,
and they fear your ascendence.

563
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:28,573
Wait till they find out
you're winning an award.

564
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,242
- Award?
- I told you.

565
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:35,538
You are the best doc in Dallas.

566
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,375
Might as well make it official.

567
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,502
- ♪ You know I'm getting money ♪

570
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,008
- When are we doing this?
- Yes! That is what I'm saying.

571
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,261
It is in your calendar.
Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

572
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:52,722
Oh, and another thing,
you said a while ago

573
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,475
to tell you when I'm ready
for you to fix my neck.

574
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,019
Well, you need patients
and my neck fuckin' sucks,

575
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,354
so I'm ready.

576
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:05,360
- You're my friend.
- Fuckin' right I am.

577
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,042
- Some people frown on
that sort of thing,

578
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,446
operating on your friend.

579
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,031
- Well, I ain't breaking up
with you.

580
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:13,868
If anyone asks, I'll say
this is the U.S. of fuckin' A

581
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,288
and if I got to be cut open,
I want the best.

582
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,710
- And I'm the best.
- Get in there, man.

583
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:22,669
Work your magic.

584
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,005
- Teamwork makes the dream work.

585
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:28,758
- You and I are a team, bro.
- Goddamn right we are.

586
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:01,332
Brick.

587
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:02,542
What are you doing here?

588
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,127
- Your neighbor got tired of me

589
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,505
banging on your front door,
told me where I could find you.

590
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:09,924
- Do I want to know
how you found my address?

591
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,719
I don't know, do you?

592
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,554
- Huh.

593
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:18,183
One on one?

594
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,809
Definitely not.

595
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:27,442
So this is awkward, but, uh...

596
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,363
You asked about Joe Padua.

597
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:41,414
He's my pool guy.

598
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:43,583
- You know him?
- Yeah, he installed my pool.

599
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,959
I see him every spring and fall.

600
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,170
He's expensive as shit,
but worth it.

601
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,173
- Mm.
- Scalpel.

602
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,716
- It's good to have you here.

603
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,885
- I've got an ALIF in a hour
with O'Connor,

604
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,428
but I should be over and out
by then.

605
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,099
Who's the performing?

606
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,643
- Kirby! My man!

607
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,815
Christ.

608
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,944
You have to isolate the...

609
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:14,197
uh, doctor,
that's a nerve, a nerve root.

610
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,160
- Double action.

611
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,540
- Dr. Kirby, it's Dr. O'Connor.

612
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,292
- Okay, yeah, five... five
minutes, five more minutes.

613
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:32,048
I see you've invented a new use
for the double action rongeur.

614
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,135
- Dr. Kirby, I have done
thousands of these.

615
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,386
You can take off.

616
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:39,888
Trial.

617
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:47,522
Mallet.

618
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,791
Dr. Morgan, cage.

619
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,376
- He says he's going to call
Amy Piel

620
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:09,336
if you don't
get up there right now.

621
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,837
- Right, right. Yes, yes.

622
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,189
Just tell him a few seconds,
all right?

623
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,966
- Mallet.

624
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:27,395
- Need the persuaders now.

625
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,148
- You've got it off midline.
- It needs to go to the left.

626
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,568
- Mallet.
- To the left.

627
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,612
The other left.

628
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:44,871
- These plugs are shit.
- I can't get any purchase.

629
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,834
Dr. Kirby.

630
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,462
- Dr. Kirby,
thank you for your time.

631
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,547
Dr. O'Connor is pitching
a hissy fit, so...

632
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:57,634
You can run along.

633
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:31,126
- I just came from removing
a sponge from deep inside

634
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:34,587
the neck of one of
Duntsch's other patients.

635
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:37,674
Been sewn up in there for days.

636
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,927
- By accident?
- Oh, any other doctor, sure.

637
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,096
But not this one.

638
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:47,017
And the infection inside
this man was...

639
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:51,104
he was minutes away
from killing him.

640
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,273
- You mean it?

641
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:56,151
You mean the infection was
minutes away from killing him?

642
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,488
Duntsch claimed that
he had found a tumor

643
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,449
inside this man's neck.

644
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,701
He slices into it.

645
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:08,455
It's his esophagus.

646
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:12,542
This tonight
was attempted murder.

647
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:16,212
Nothing less.

648
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:18,548
Shelley Brennan was murder.

649
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,176
Dorothy Burke was murder.

650
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:29,726
I played by the rules,
and people died.

651
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:38,234
If we're gonna do this,
Shughart...

652
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,612
we gotta be all in.

653
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,702
I'm all in.

654
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:57,587
- I'm not hearing this,
Shughart, not now.

655
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,297
I'm late for a thing.

656
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,841
Gotta grip and grin it
and sing for my supper.

657
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,635
- I've seen enough
to be convinced.

658
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:05,553
- You came to me,
you asked, I gave.

659
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,055
- Henderson and Kirby are right.

660
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:10,642
A plea is not justice served,
it's justice denied.

661
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:11,851
He needs to be stopped.

662
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:13,603
- There's a reason
it's never been done.

663
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,690
- Because there's never been
a doctor like Duntsch, never.

664
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,817
- It's a civil case.
- It's not about money.

665
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,695
- It's always about money.

666
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:25,657
- Where are the damn tickets?
- Here.

667
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:30,662
These people were just trying
to fix their backs, Ed.

668
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,877
- Do me a favor, sit down.

669
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,796
I want to be clear.

670
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:42,298
You want this,
I'll give you rope.

671
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,178
But I'm not gonna cut you down,
you hear me?

672
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,726
Going after Duntsch publicly
means exposure for Baylor.

673
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:56,062
- And?
- Baylor is connected.

674
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:58,898
Members of Baylor's board
make donations.

675
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,650
- You mean for events

676
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,169
like the one
you're attending this evening?

677
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:04,237
- They don't donate to me,
unfortunately,

678
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,322
but to others we know.

679
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,825
- And as your mentor...
- You're my mentor?

680
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:19,502
- I'd advise you to focus
on something else.

681
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:22,756
- He's still operating, Ed.

682
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:32,515
- Okay.

683
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:34,851
Okay.

684
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,275
Morning.

685
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:41,686
- Hey. Tomorrow's the big day.

686
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,521
- Suppose I should
turn in early.

687
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:46,274
Get a good night's rest.

688
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:50,070
- As your doctor, I think that
would be the wise thing to do.

689
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,356
- I can keep driving.

690
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:29,484
Say the word.

691
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:31,027
You don't have to do this.

692
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:35,782
- He is the best doc in Dallas.

693
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:13,820
