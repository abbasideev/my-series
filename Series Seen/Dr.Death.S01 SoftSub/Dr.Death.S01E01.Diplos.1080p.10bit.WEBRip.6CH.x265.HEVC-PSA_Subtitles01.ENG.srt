1
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,354
- I had back pain for years.

2
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,482
- Broke my back.
- Motorcycle accident.

3
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,609
- Light back pain.
- Lower back pain.

4
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,777
- Neck pain.

5
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,530
- Pain in the neck
and a numb pinky.

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,615
- Numbness,
tingling in my finger.

7
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,409
- Back pain.

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:38,538
- I trusted that
he'd do the right thing.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,124
- He told us
he was gonna fix it.

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,002
That's all we needed to know.

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,338
- A nightmare.

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,465
I woke up in a nightmare.

13
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,900
- They were pumping me full
of blood...

14
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,402
- I was sore.
- And I didn't know why.

15
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,719
- I hurt.
- Every bone hurt.

16
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,304
- I was worse.
- I couldn't move.

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,597
- I was crying.

18
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,682
- And the pain.
- I woke with a limp.

19
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,893
- I had never felt pain
like that.

20
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,662
- The first thing that
went through my mind...

21
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,456
- And no one could tell me
what was wrong with me.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,874
- "What has he done to me?"
- I miss her.

23
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,459
- I can't play with
my children like I used to.

24
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,942
- She was a very...

25
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,070
- I have a feeding tube
attached to me with a bag.

26
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,321
- Very good woman.

27
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,073
- I learned ways
to control the pain.

28
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,283
- That's all I can say.

29
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,662
- I wish I could go back
to the days

30
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,749
before I met
Christopher Duntsch.

31
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,136
- Here you go.
- Great.

32
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,470
- You missed one.
- What?

33
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,431
- Informed consent.
- Have to sign that.

34
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,849
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No problem.

35
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,393
Just fill out the top...
name, age, address,

36
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,496
and everything here, and
then review all the statements,

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,622
and sign and date at the bottom.

38
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,315
- Madeline Beyer.
- Yeah, right here.

39
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,359
- You can finish that
in exam room.

40
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,194
- Oh, okay.

41
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,656
My daughter is parking, and...

42
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,324
- I'll let her know
they took you back.

43
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,160
- She can come?
- Yes.

44
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,870
- Thank you.

45
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,961
- You're gonna
take everything off

46
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,505
and get into the gown,
Ms. Beyer.

47
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,966
- Open on the back side.
- Okay.

48
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,010
- Have you had any medications
this morning?

49
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,219
- No.

50
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,512
- Anything to eat or drink

51
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,264
since 8:00 p.m. last night,
Ms. Beyer?

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,683
- No.

53
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,936
And it's Beyer, like the animal.

54
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,856
Everyone makes that mistake.

55
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,567
- Dr. Duntsch will have you
in and out before you know it.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,748
- Okay.

57
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,834
Here we are on Madeline Beyer.

58
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,879
Mrs. Beyer had
an L5-S1 posterior fusion

59
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,048
performed
by Dr. Christopher Duntsch

60
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,342
this past Wednesday.

61
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,886
Patient awoke reporting
intensified pain

62
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,721
and limited mobility.

63
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,558
Today, we're performing
the revision surgery.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,061
This whole midline structure
has been severed

65
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,979
from the underlying spine.

66
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,399
It's just flopping in here.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,902
It provides no protective
benefit to the nerves.

68
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,904
I just grabbed it.

69
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,824
Underneath that,
you can see fragments of bone

70
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,158
piercing the nerves.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,579
Also, the spinous process,
I'll be removing this.

72
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,417
I just grabbed the ligament,
and it's exposed the dura,

73
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,211
which is leaking spinal fluid.

74
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,089
I do see down here more bone.

75
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,091
It looks like putty,

76
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,635
just smashed in there.

77
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,473
What did he do to her?

78
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,899
Mrs. Beyer?

79
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,693
How are you feeling?

80
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,282
- I hurt a lot.

81
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,742
- Well, that's to be expected.

82
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,995
Is the pain better or worse
than before?

83
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,558
You don't have to answer that
right now.

84
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,375
- No, no, no, no.

85
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,629
Better. It's better.

86
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,524
- Okay, well, we'll get
the pain management team

87
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,467
up here and increase your meds.

88
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,177
- How does that sound?
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,889
- Now, would you do me a favor,
please, and...

90
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,603
press against my hand?

91
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,021
Excellent. Now pull.

92
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,942
Toes toward your nose.

93
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,944
Very good.
And now the left against.

94
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,115
Can you push against?

95
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,577
- I can't move it.

96
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,250
- Well, we'll run some tests,
see what might be amiss.

97
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,129
For now, sleep, okay?

98
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,383
- Dr. Henderson.
- Yes?

99
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,471
- I don't want him near me,

100
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,224
not ever again.

101
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,393
You keep Dr. Duntsch away.

102
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,079
- Ha, come on.
- It's less douchey than a BMW.

103
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,915
- I drive a CR-V.
- Oh, nothing wrong with that.

104
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,542
You know, Hondas,
they go forever.

105
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,544
Cheap parts, good resale.

106
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,188
Honestly, the only reason
I bring it up...

107
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,880
- can you turn up the suction?
- Suction.

108
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,465
- You ever see
that Will Ferrell skit?

109
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,842
"Jag-u-ar."

110
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,511
Hee-hee-hee,
I love Will Ferrell.

111
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,096
The only reason I bring it up...

112
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,055
- bipolara.
- Bipolara.

113
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,766
- Jag is a super trooper magnet.

114
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,269
One time I get called in
for an aortic aneurysm

115
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,563
doing a buck. Peddle up 35, 40.

116
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,732
Buck ten, trooper throws
on his lights,

117
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,400
chases me right up to the ER.

118
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,277
He follows me
into the scrub room.

119
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,321
He says he's gonna arrest me
for evading the police.

120
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,759
I tell him, go ahead,
but he's gonna have to wait.

121
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,869
Throw open the doors of the OR

122
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,412
just as they're splitting
the patient.

123
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,540
Fuck, his face.

124
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,500
Could not have been
better timing.

125
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,170
I think it was the rib cracking
that got me out of the ticket.

126
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,880
- Good morning, Dr. Kirby.

127
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,798
- Deleone, the grand poobah
herself.

128
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,051
To what do we owe the pressure?
I mean, pleasure?

129
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,178
- What is that
about the lowest form of wit?

130
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,930
- I believe it's brevity.
- Mm, if only.

131
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,641
- What can I do for you?
- Ooh, got a bleeder... cauterize.

132
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,353
- What do you know
about Dr. Duntsch?

133
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,313
- "Doctor" is a strong word.

134
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,773
Okay, good. Thanks.

135
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,733
- You worked with him
at Baylor Plano, right?

136
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,443
- One time only engagement.

137
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,944
I'm gonna retract here.

138
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,738
'Bout six months ago,
total shit show.

139
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,114
Can I get more light?

140
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,967
- Exactly what I was hoping
you weren't gonna say.

141
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,785
- Tell me you didn't hire him.

142
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,245
- Why wouldn't I? Great résumé.

143
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,289
Baylor Plano sent him along
with a clean letter.

144
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,707
No areas of concern.

145
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,310
- You gotta loop me
into these things, Jill.

146
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,378
I got more credentials
in this town than Tony Romo.

147
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,712
Debakey.

148
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,190
I could have told you
the guy was a hack.

149
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,465
What did he do?

150
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,137
- Jill?

151
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,600
What did he do?

152
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,611
- Josh, you got a minute?

153
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,196
- Yes, sir. Please sit.

154
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,493
- How's the chowder?
- July in Texas.

155
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,036
- Well, we all have to live

156
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,038
with our choices in life, right?

157
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,665
- You here to talk about my soup

158
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,584
or... Dr. Duntsch, sir?

159
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,169
- Am I that obvious?

160
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,588
- I was listening to you
in there, in the OR.

161
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,550
Look as bad inside Mrs. Beyer
as it sounded on the outside?

162
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,303
- Duntsch's surgery
on Madeline Beyer,

163
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,681
you were the circulating nurse,
right?

164
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,099
What was that like?

165
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,270
- It...

166
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,566
was like he knew what
he was supposed to do, and...

167
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,988
- He did the exact opposite?

168
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,743
- Everyone in that room could
have done better than him, sir.

169
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,871
I tried.

170
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,582
I mean, it isn't worth shit.

171
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,793
I tried to help Dr. Duntsch
in there.

172
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,545
Even tried to stop him, but...

173
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,548
- It wasn't your job
to stop him.

174
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,593
- Tell that to Mrs. Beyer.

175
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,095
Tell that to Dorothy Burke.

176
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,612
- Hey, Bob.

177
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,947
- Dr. Kirby.
- Danke.

178
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,574
- I have an MRI
that I have to get to...

179
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,910
- Jill Deleone stopped by,
told me you came across some

180
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,662
of Christopher Duntsch's
splatter painting.

181
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,873
- "Splatter painting"?

182
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,626
- You did a revision surgery
on Madeline Beyer.

183
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,045
How'd it go?

184
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,380
- Mrs. Beyer
is not your patient,

185
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,899
so I won't be speaking with you
about...

186
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,466
- Oh, fucking HIPAA.

187
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,388
- Well, why don't you tell me
exactly what it is

188
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,136
you're looking for, Dr. Kirby?

189
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,100
- January, I'm at Baylor.

190
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,851
No other access surgeons
are available.

191
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,312
I get asked to scrub in.
It was a last-minute favor.

192
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,565
Turns out, happenstance,
it's my pool guy.

193
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,275
L5-S1 fusion.

194
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,945
Now, on a scale of one-to-one,
one being easy,

195
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,280
the other one being easy,
how difficult is that?

196
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,490
- Let's go with one.

197
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,283
- Fucking caveman could do it,
am I right?

198
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,537
I got the patient opened up,
disc sitting right there,

199
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,831
shiny red bike under the tree,
Christmas morning,

200
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,976
just waiting to be plucked out
and the vice plopped in.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,644
And what would you do?
What would you ask for?

202
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,211
- I'm decomposing here,
Dr. Kirby.

203
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,588
- People tell me I have
the flair for the melodrama.

204
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,882
- I can't imagine why.
- I like to call it passion.

205
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,884
- What would you ask for?
- A scalpel.

206
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,303
- Fucking right, you would!
- Everybody would!

207
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,932
This yutz asked
for a Double-Action Rongeur.

208
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,851
- Did he get the disc out?

209
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,811
- With a great deal
of gratuitous elbow grease.

210
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,980
- Did he get the device in?
- Off midline.

211
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,457
- How far off?
- Is there any measurement

212
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,900
devised by the human hand
that would make it all right?

213
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,861
Duntsch almost killed
my pool guy.

214
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,654
- Could it have been
human error?

215
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,156
- Sure. Yeah, why not?

216
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,491
But after that case in January,
Duntsch had a bunch more,

217
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,077
which were all, shall we say,
less than successful?

218
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,163
But two of them were
borderline monstrous.

219
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,415
One is sipping through a straw
for the rest of his life,

220
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,833
quadriplegic.

221
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,210
The other, back in March,
dies on his table

222
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,297
after he slices
through her vertebral artery.

223
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,509
What?

224
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,261
- Duntsch performed surgeries

225
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,804
this past Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday

226
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,181
here at Dallas Medical.

227
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,862
Wednesday, the patient
was Madeline Beyer.

228
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,184
You know about that.

229
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,025
Tuesday, the patient's name
was Dorothy Burke.

230
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,812
She was in here
for a cervical fusion,

231
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,440
and he sliced
through her vertebral artery.

232
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,817
- Get the fuck outta here.
- She's on life support.

233
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,862
Duntsch has two surgeries

234
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,906
scheduled first thing next week.

235
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,702
We're gonna sit here chatting?

236
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,163
Or we're gonna do something
about it?

237
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,097

245

- Mrs. Keller!

246
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,956
Today's the big day.
How you feeling?

247
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,916
Hungry.

248
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,185
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

249
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,228
I haven't eaten yet either.

250
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,045
- How's business?
- Booming.

251
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,213
- No surprise there.

252
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,691
- Yeah, I got plans
for two new off...

253
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,134
- "I have plans."

254
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,261
- ESL teachers just can't
let that slide, can they?

255
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,470
- Mm-mm.

256
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,723
- I have plans
for two new offices opening

257
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,724
by the end of the year.

258
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,100
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

259
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,893
Expanding faster
than I ever could imagine.

260
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,895
Just trying
to figure it all out, really.

261
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,398
Moving up in the world.

262
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,899
Always.

263
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,402
- Thank you.

264
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,739
- Theresa, Melanie,
this is Mr. and Mrs. Keller.

265
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,323
- Pleasure.

266
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,827
- Where's Dr. Morgan?
- Nearer pastures.

267
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,412
The commute was getting to her.

268
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,998
- She's from McKinney, right?
- She is.

269
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,126
- That's not 20 minutes
from here.

270
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,462
- Are you saying
she didn't like me anymore?

271
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,090
Hardly possible.

272
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,509
Oh, that's too bad.
She was lovely.

273
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,511
- Still is, I imagine.
- Come on back.

274
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,930
- You're operating at
the Dallas Medical Center now?

275
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,682
- That's right.
- You're my first case.

276
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,100
- What happened to Baylor Plano?

277
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,935
Great facilities there.

278
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,645
- You know,

279
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,898
it is a very pretty building.

280
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,817
On the outside.

281
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,111
I let my privileges lapse there,

282
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,198
and I could go back
any time I want, but...

283
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,411
Honestly, I just felt boxed in
there.

284
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,080
They're inefficient.

285
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,664
They're living in the past,

286
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,584
and I am the future.

287
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,296
It's hard to be the future
in a place with no vision.

288
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,216
- I don't suppose I could've
been miraculously healed

289
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,343
these past three months,
could I?

290
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,306
- Disc is still
very much herniated.

291
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,144
Still pushing on the L5.

292
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,938
In fact, unsurprisingly,

293
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,817
it is even more compressed.

294
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,443
So here's what we're gonna do:

295
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,195
We're gonna put you
on your side,

296
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,656
make a little incision,

297
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,367
and we'll cut away a little bit
of the bone,

298
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,870
make a window, so we can see
down into the nerves,

299
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,163
push those to the side,

300
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,124
and then that disc is
just gonna...

301
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,459
pop out like a pimple.

302
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,848
Not the most delicate way
to put it, I know,

303
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,715
but it makes the point.

304
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,050
I am going to fix you.

305
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,844
- I know you will.

306
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,054
- How in Pete's name
did that happen?

307
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,101
- Oh, well...

308
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,353
let's just say
my dancing days are done.

309
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,732
I want to tell you both
how much I appreciate

310
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,359
you sticking with me
as I move down from Baylor.

311
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,712
There's a lot of options
out there.

312
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,488
- I don't change horses
midstream, Christopher.

313
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,449
And like you said
from the start,

314
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,034
you're the best surgeon
out there.

315
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,869
How could I not?

316
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,412
- You are a keeper, Mrs. Keller.

317
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,664
- You holding up
since last time?

318
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,209
- Last time?

319
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,213
- Back in March,
Rose was all hooked up,

320
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,257
ready to go, and...

321
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,218
a patient you lost that day.

322
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,679
- I... I didn't lose anyone.

323
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,390
- I thought they died...
- Charlie, you're being a bore.

324
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,392
- I think trying to find out
how a surgeon...

325
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,144
- It's all right, Mrs. Keller.

326
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,772
Mr. Keller's right to ask.

327
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,233
She did... die.

328
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,570
She had an allergic reaction
to the anesthesia,

329
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,324
and I did everything I could
to save her, but...

330
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,910
well, the anesthesiologist
made a mistake.

331
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,454
- Oh, my. Oh, poor thing.

332
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,040
- Yet another reason
I chose to move on from Baylor.

333
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,000
I found that their staff
was underperforming.

334
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,877
- I hope they don't have a job
anymore.

335
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,755
- Well, we're all human.

336
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,507
We all make mistakes.

337
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,217
It's just that,
in this line of work,

338
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,927
the consequences
of those mistakes

339
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,679
are simply more consequential.

340
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,430
- But not you.

341
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,225
No mistakes.

342
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:19,062
No, ma'am, not me.

343
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,607
Well, I will see you both
at Dallas Medical.

344
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,610
I'll have you up and
doing cartwheels in no time.

345
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,946
- You know,
you ever see Dr. Morgan,

346
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,615
you tell her we send our best.

347
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,706
- 12 dead.

348
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,290
Fucked up world we live in,

349
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,459
when a movie theater
becomes a gun range.

350
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,546
- Olympic torch arrived
in London this weekend.

351
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,923
8,000 people carried it
8,000 miles.

352
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,758
That's pretty encouraging,
isn't it?

353
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,802
- Now a whole bunch of 'em
are profiteering.

354
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,096
They're selling their torches
online for, like,

355
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,765
thousands of dollars.

356
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,267
People, man.

357
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,271
- You need
to stop reading the news.

358
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,690
- It's bad for you.
- Ha.

359
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,115
- What's the word, Mrs. Keller?
- Ready to go.

360
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,701
- First thing you're gonna do
when you're out of here, ma'am?

361
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,287
- Walk into school
without tears in my eyes.

362
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,206
- Shoot for the stars,
hit the moon, right, ma'am?

363
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:24,044
- I leave myself in God's
and Dr. Duntsch's hands.

364
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,005
- Stiff competition.

365
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,299
Dr. Duntsch.

366
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,508
I'm Josh Baker.

367
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,719
I'll be your circulating nurse,
sir.

368
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,557
You come from Baylor?

369
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,018
- That's right.

370
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,776
- Got a hole in your scrubs,
sir.

371
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,822
- You're the circulating nurse,
you said.

372
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,366
- Yes, sir.

373
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,786
- Shouldn't you be
prepping my OR?

374
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,537
- Absolutely, sir.

375
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,499
Mrs. Keller, I'll see you
on the other side.

376
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,503
- Now,

377
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,297
let's get you up
and doing those cartwheels.

378
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,937
Morning.
I'm Dr. Christopher Duntsch.

379
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,189
Today, we're gonna be
operating on Rose Keller,

380
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,816
age 72.

381
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,609
The patient presented
with severe back pain

382
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,611
diagnosed as a herniated disc.

383
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,490
We will be performing
a lateral lumbar fusion.

384
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,135
We're gonna open a window
between the ribs

385
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,452
and the iliac crest,

386
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,495
make a small incision
into the flank muscles.

387
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,790
The peritoneum will be
reflected anteriorly

388
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,334
to expose the psoas.

389
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,086
Once in, we will remove
the L4-5 disc

390
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,132
and replace it with a 12 by 50
by 10-degree cage.

391
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,301
As I hope you all know,

392
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,635
it is important
we are in and out

393
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,846
with as little fanfare
as possible.

394
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,390
So mouths shut, ears open.

395
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,227
Let's begin.

396
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,119
- How much longer?

397
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,843
The family was expecting
an update, sir.

398
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,428
Two hours ago.

399
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,507
Done.

400
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,467
Have them close her up.

401
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,936
- Morning, ma'am.
- Afternoon, Josh.

402
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:13,523
Hey, Josh, how did it go
this morning?

403
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,733
- How did what go, ma'am?

404
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,570
- Rose Keller's surgery
with Dr. Duntsch.

405
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,449
Oh. I think it went okay.

406
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,200
- You "think" okay?

407
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,536
- No, I don't mean that.

408
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,829
Seems like it went well.

409
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,998
Just took a little longer
than usual, you know?

410
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,249
- What's a little longer?

411
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,917
- About four hours.

412
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,627
- Four hours
for a lateral fusion?

413
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,258
- First day at a new hospital,

414
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,676
new system.

415
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,847
My guess is he was crossing
T's, dotting I's, ma'am.

416
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,309
- Okay.

417
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,942
Is now a good time?

418
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,029
- You pay the bills,
Ms. Deleone.

419
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,364
- What are you reading?

420
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,282
- Working on a cure
for glioblastoma.

421
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,784
- Ooh, is that all?

422
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,869
- I've been studying it
since med school.

423
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,413
Trying to find a new way in
with stem cells.

424
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,916
- That's admirable, ambitious.

425
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,876
- Well, I don't think
it's as complicated

426
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,461
as everybody makes it out to be.

427
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,088
- You don't think
utilizing stem cells

428
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,298
to cure one of the
deadliest forms of cancer

429
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,217
is complicated?

430
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,010
Quite self-assured, are we?

431
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,515
- Are you not?

432
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,141
- I'm a realist.

433
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,143
- Well, you gotta believe
you can beat death.

434
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,979
Otherwise, what's the point
of doing what we do?

435
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,690
- Well...

436
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,652
- How was surgery?
- Perfect.

437
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,737
- Perfect? Excellent.

438
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,990
I heard it went a little long.

439
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,450
- You heard?

440
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,203
- Mm-hmm. I did.

441
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,122
- A little long?

442
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,668
Do you mind if I ask
who you heard that from?

443
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,604
- Oh, there's no need
to name names, Dr. Duntsch...

444
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,481
- I'm just not used to people
talking shit about me.

445
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,298
- No one's talking shit
about you.

446
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,526
- Unless, of course,
it's to my face,

447
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,135
which I encourage.

448
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,761
- As the chief executive here...

449
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,739
- It was that suck-ass
circulating nurse, wasn't it?

450
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,533
- I asked how they thought
the procedure went,

451
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,034
and they reported
that it went a little long.

452
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,703
- I hope that you and I
are going to have a long

453
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,687
- working relationship, Jill.
- Me too...

454
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,939
- As I line your pockets
with millions of dollars...

455
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,024
- Not my pockets...

456
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,525
that you will come to trust me.

457
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,861
- If I didn't trust you,
I wouldn't have hired you.

458
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,865
- It went exactly as long
as it was supposed to

459
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,576
in order to get it done right.

460
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:32,537
- So there were
no complications?

461
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,789
- I don't have complications.

462
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,292
- Every doctor
has complications.

463
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,960
- Not me.

464
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,468
- Okay, then.

465
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,802
It's good to have you aboard.

466
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,891
- We should grab a bite
sometime.

467
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,976
I'll bore you with my biography.

468
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,561
- I'd like that.

469
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,897
- Oh, do me a favor?
- Of course.

470
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,358
- Make sure that door shuts
behind you on the way out.

471
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,490
- Are you the one
going under the knife?

472
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,118
Okay, so let's just buck up,

473
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,787
or I'm gonna make you wait
in the car.

474
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,469
- Dr. Duntsch!
- Yes?

475
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,263
- I'm Earl...

476
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,681
Burke.

477
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,725
Dorothy Burke's husband, Earl.

478
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,226
So how we looking?

479
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,479
- Well, I'm running
a little behind

480
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,230
but other than that, good.

481
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,692
- So you feel good about it?

482
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,988
- What's on your mind, Earl?

483
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,531
- I, uh...

484
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,244
I almost turned around
this morning.

485
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,663
I almost took Dorothy home.

486
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,500
- And why would you do that?

487
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,378
- I just had this feeling
that...

488
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,255
- I'm a surgeon, Earl.

489
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,799
This is what I do.

490
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,218
I attended one of the top
universities in the nation.

491
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,805
And granted, it's no Harvard,
but fuck Harvard, am I right?

492
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,474
I got an MD and a PhD
in molecular biology.

493
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,851
I did my residency
at the University of Tennessee,

494
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,687
where I studied general surgery
for a year

495
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,438
and neurosurgery for five.

496
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,856
I run two successful labs.

497
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,566
I've raised millions of dollars
in grants.

498
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:49,859
And I can go on and give you

499
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,403
all of my citations
and awards...

500
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,779
- You don't need to do that.

501
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:56,533
- I just want to remind you
that your wife of...

502
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,743
how long have you guys
been together?

503
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,037
- 46 years.

504
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,206
- Your wife of 46 years
is prepped and ready

505
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,042
on my table right now.

506
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:09,879
And look, some people might say
that what I just did was crass,

507
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,256
but the way I see it,

508
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,383
you're gonna go back
into that waiting room,

509
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,593
and you're not just gonna flip
through your "People,"

510
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,138
or "Us Weekly,"
or "Field and Stream."

511
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,890
You're gonna read it,
because you know

512
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,268
that I am gonna grant her
a second life.

513
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,274
So...

514
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,279
Need more sponges.

515
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,368
There's too much blood
in the field.

516
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,952
I can't see anything.
More suction.

517
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:25,288
Suction.

518
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,333
Suture.

519
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,297
This isn't right.

520
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,883
- No, it isn't.
- We gotta run the stat H and H.

521
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,386
- You need to say something.

522
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,062
Oh, shit.

523
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,676
Should we start the cell saver,
Doctor?

524
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,702
- Focus on your job.

525
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,372
- There's a lot of bleeding,
Doctor.

526
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:11,001
We should get an A-line kit,
14-gauge IV, blood warmer.

527
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,377
Maybe give ICU a heads-up?

528
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,756
We gotta get this
under control, Doctor.

529
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,633
- "We"?

530
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:19,759
You mean, me.

531
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,970
I need to get this
under control.

532
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,781
- Yes, Doctor, you need
to get this under control.

533
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:24,865
Perhaps, we bring in vascular.

534
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,307
- What's vascular gonna do

535
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,476
when you can't get the
blood pressure under control?

536
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:30,204
- This is not an issue
with the blood pressure.

537
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,272
- Well, why don't we start
there, shall we?

538
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,192
I see the disc. Retract.

539
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,531
I've got it.

540
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,308
What are you doing here?

541
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,227
- You called?

542
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,900
- You didn't have to come
right away.

543
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,152
- It sounded like
you needed me, Chris.

544
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:04,406
- I just needed
to talk to my dad.

545
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,866
It's no emergency. No big deal.

546
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,451
- Oh.

547
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,120
Okay.

548
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,163
So I suppose
I should just turn around

549
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,766
- and go back to Colorado then?
- No, no, no.

550
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,167
No. Come on. Come on in.

551
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:28,972
Because I used to work
for a Russian.

552
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:31,057
- You know better than that,
Chris.

553
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,893
- I don't think he cares
if you have a drink.

554
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,812
Particularly given his affinity
for wine.

555
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:38,148
- Oh, that's cute.

556
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:40,984
- Come on, Dad.
- Don't be like that.

557
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,569
I'm kidding!

558
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,992
So how's the physical therapy
business treating you?

559
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,326
- That's not why I'm here,
Chris,

560
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,138
in the middle of the night,
to talk small talk.

561
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,914
- Dad, for Christ's sake.
- Watch your mouth, please.

562
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,627
- For heck's sake, Dad.
- Is that better?

563
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,173
- Physical therapy's going well.

564
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:05,192
And your mother's well,
and your brothers are well,

565
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:08,011
and the roof needs
to be replaced,

566
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,262
and the dog's getting old.

567
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:10,889
He's got a bit of a limp, okay?

568
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:16,519
Now what's going on?
You need money?

569
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,482
- What? No.
- Okay, so what's happening?

570
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,233
- Nothing.
- I shouldn't have called.

571
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,360
- No, I'm glad you did.

572
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,819
Of course,
you should have called.

573
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,613
- Look, Dad, I got this, okay?

574
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:28,531
I'm the top
of the fucking food chain.

575
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,051
- You're top of what?
- Top of the world.

576
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,618
Top of the game,
top of the morning,

577
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,804
top of whatever the fuck it is
I'm supposed to be the top of.

578
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,205
- Who are you talking to?
- You.

579
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,099
- Who are you showing off for?
- I'm not showing off.

580
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,643
- It sounds like
you're showing off, Chris.

581
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,419
- I'm just saying
that tomorrow is another day

582
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:44,339
to prove how fucking good I am.

583
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,175
- That ego.

584
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,219
- It's confidence.
- It's ego.

585
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,553
Your mother instilled it in you.

586
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,971
- It's confidence, okay?

587
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,908
And I thought that's what
parents were supposed to do.

588
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:54,950
When did that become a sin?

589
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,060
- Pride is a sin.
- To you.

590
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,954
- You remember the story
of Nebuchadnezzer, right?

591
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,480
The king of Babylon?

592
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,708
He was the most powerful king
in the most powerful nation

593
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,442
on Earth, but he was prideful.

594
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:05,443
He boasted...

595
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,612
- Well, good thing
there is no god.

596
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,994
- Pride comes before the fall,
Christopher.

597
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,253
Okay.

598
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,587
- Where are you going?

599
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,357
Wait a minute.
Let's sit down and talk, okay?

600
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,758
- The pillows and blankets are
in the hall closet,

601
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,860
and feel free to make yourself

602
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,112
whatever you like for breakfast.

603
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,595
- Wait a minute.
- How's Wendy doing?

604
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:35,140
- Does she need anything?
- Oh, she's great.

605
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,851
- And what about Mason?
- How's my grandson doing?

606
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:39,227
- Thanks for coming, Dad.

607
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,646
- Where are you going?

608
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:40,622
- Get the fuck off my street!

609
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,457
- Kim. Kim.

610
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:43,833
I know you asked
for some space...

611
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,418
- I court-ordered space!

612
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,754
- Kim, the clinic needs you.

613
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,383
I need you.

614
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,218
- I'm done here.
- Kim. No, come on!

615
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,386
You don't understand.

616
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,346
I am surrounded
by fucking idiots.

617
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,139
My staff, the hospitals...

618
00:34:58,181 --> 00:34:59,849
they nearly lost a patient
today.

619
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:01,393
They nearly fucking killed her!

620
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,561
And, of course, I'm the one
left holding the shit

621
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,730
because of some stupid
fucking X-ray tech.

622
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,190
It's just unbelievable.

623
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,568
- You're still operating?

624
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,781
- Of course I am.
- Why wouldn't I be?

625
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:19,244
- After what you did.

626
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,787
- What I did?

627
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:23,707
- To your patients.

628
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:24,874
To Jerry...

629
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:28,420
- Don't you dare!

630
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,255
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself

631
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,715
for walking out
on your patients,

632
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,049
your responsibilities.

633
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:34,568
This is as much on you
as it is on me...

634
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:37,721
more, because
I didn't abandon them.

635
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,557
- The worst part
about all this is...

636
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,494
you don't have to go
under your knife

637
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:46,271
or into your bed
to get fucked by you.

638
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,234
Come back here again,

639
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,111
and you're going to jail.

640
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,536
- Kim!

641
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:40,784
- This is Josh.

642
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,414
What do you mean?

643
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,625
Did you call Dr. Duntsch?

644
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,194
Dr. Duntsch!

645
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,657
Dr. Duntsch!

646
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:23,076
- What?

647
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,452
- Dorothy Burke.

648
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,621
She's unresponsive,
can't palpitate.

649
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,456
Blood pressure's
in the basement.

650
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,418
Nurses have been trying
to reach you all morning.

651
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:33,878
Shit.

652
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,467
- Was it you?
- Sir?

653
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:40,719
- Cut the "sir" crap.

654
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,554
Were you the one talking shit
to Deleone?

655
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,014
- About?

656
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,599
- About how long it took me
to operate on Rose Keller.

657
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,101
And how is Mrs. Keller,
by the way?

658
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:49,912
- Have you checked in on her?
- She's doing well.

659
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,063
- How well?
- That's not the point.

660
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:54,607
- No, Nurse, that is the point.

661
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,985
You have no clue what it takes
to do what I do.

662
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,153
- Yes, sir.

663
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,505
- So why don't you
shut your mouth

664
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:02,323
and do your fucking job?

665
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,826
Is my OR prepped
for the Madeline Beyer surgery?

666
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,245
- The Madeline Beyer surgery
is elective.

667
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:10,165
- And she elected
to do it today.

668
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:11,541
Is my OR prepped?

669
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,185
- Let's push it off,
focus on Dorothy Burke...

670
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,271
- That's not what I asked.
- I understand what you asked.

671
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,672
- I don't think that you do.
- It's not fully prepped, sir.

672
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,883
- Go prep my OR.

673
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:37,025
- We're trying to make sense
of it ourselves.

674
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,444
That's why we're calling you,
Dr. Skadden.

675
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,321
Well, why don't we begin
with your experience

676
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,530
with Dr. Duntsch in Memphis.

677
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,050
You're the head
of the fellowship program

678
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,075
at Semmes Murphy?

679
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:46,368
- That's correct.

680
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,089
- Were there any issues
while he was there?

681
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,162
- What kind of issues?

682
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,538
- Come on, man!
- Dr. Kirby...

683
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,475
- No, no, no. I mean,
come on, performance issues.

684
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,167
What other kinds of issues
are there?

685
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,711
- Personality, safety,
compliance, productivity...

686
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:58,546
- Performance.
- That's what I said.

687
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,216
Fact, Duntsch is better suited
for a slaughterhouse

688
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,175
than he is a surgical unit.

689
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,760
Would you agree?

690
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:06,030
- That's most certainly not
how I'd describe Dr. Duntsch.

691
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,263
- How would you describe him?

692
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:08,723
- He was satisfactory.

693
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,350
His work ethic was
second-to-none.

694
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,268
- Well, Ted Bundy was
a good worker too.

695
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,561
- Dr. Kirby, please.

696
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,313
Do you mind if I take over
from here?

697
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,874
- I don't know what good
it's gonna do you.

698
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,233
- Let's give it a try.

699
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,693
- Have at it.

700
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,490
- Hello?

701
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,158
- Sorry about that, Dr. Skadden.

702
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,787
We'd like to fax you a picture
of Dr. Duntsch.

703
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:31,996
- To what end?

704
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,557
- To ensure that the surgeon
in question is

705
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,583
the same surgeon you know.

706
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:38,586
We're concerned that this person

707
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,588
stole your Duntsch's identity.

708
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,007
- He's not my Duntsch.

709
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,134
- Because if he's not
an imposter, he's either...

710
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:45,719
- Numb-nuts.

711
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,304
- The most incompetent
surgeon I've ever crossed paths

712
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,765
with and never should have been
let out of medical school,

713
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,934
or he's...

714
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:55,437
a sociopath.

715
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:58,106
And he's doing all of this
on purpose.

716
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,345
- What's the word, Mrs. Beyer?

717
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:15,725
- How is Mrs. Burke?

718
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:19,771
- Wednesday, July 25, 2012.

719
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:22,357
Patient is Madeline Beyer.

720
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:24,567
We'll be performing
a spinal fusion.

721
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,363
- Dr. Henderson.

722
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,532
- Yes, this is Dr. Skadden
calling you back.

723
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,283
It's Skadden.

724
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,702
Yes?

725
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:36,287
- I reviewed the photo
you faxed over.

726
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,914
- And?

727
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,961
- That is
Dr. Christopher Duntsch.

728
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:46,840
- Did you know?

729
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:47,966
- Know?

730
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:51,052
- Did you know
what he was capable of?

731
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,429
- No.

732
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,892
- Scalpel.

733
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,746
- We have just recruited
a rising star.

734
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:19,873
- And I am the future.

735
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:21,249
- You've studied under some

736
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,084
of the best surgeons
in the world.

737
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,253
- I checked
all his reviews online.

738
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,796
Everyone loves him.

739
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:28,840
- What did he do to her?

740
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,718
- He's closing in on two dozen
botched surgeries.

741
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,887
- He keeps getting
these surgical outcomes

742
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:36,115
because he's either doing it
on purpose, or he just sucks.

743
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,599
- The question isn't
why he did it.

744
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,100
It's how he got away with it.

745
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,353
- You're prepared to file
a formal complaint?

746
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:45,523
- You're the one who turned me
in to the Texas Medical Board.

747
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:46,941
- I am.

748
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:50,278
- I know you're a fraud.
- You can't even keep a job.

749
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,281
- I'm trying to get a picture
of who he is,

750
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,657
why he is.

751
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,242
- My patients
mean everything to me.

752
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:58,661
Was he doing it on purpose?

753
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:01,122
- If we're gonna do this,
we got to be all-in.

754
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:03,500
- We've got one chance
to get this indictment.

755
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,418
How are we gonna prove intent?

756
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,004
- Duntsch is never gonna stop.

757
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,548
He's never gonna stop
on his own.
