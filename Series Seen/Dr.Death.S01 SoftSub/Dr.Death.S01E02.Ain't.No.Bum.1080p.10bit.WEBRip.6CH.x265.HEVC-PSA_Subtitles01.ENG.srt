1
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,275
- Okay.

2
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,819
Here we are on Madeline Beyer.

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,698
Today, we're performing
the revision surgery.

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,451
This whole midline structure
has been severed

5
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,494
from the underlying spine.

6
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,998
I just grabbed the ligament
and it's exposing the dura,

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,500
which is leaking spinal fluid.

8
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,378
I do see down here more bone.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,297
It looks like putty.

10
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,092
It's just smashed in there.

11
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,261
What did he do to her?

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,240
- I reviewed the photo
you faxed over.

13
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,575
- And?

14
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,495
- That is
Dr. Christopher Duntsch.

15
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,872
- Did you know?
- No.

16
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,125
- Did you know what
he was capable of?

17
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,671
- No.

18
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,215
The things he is
reportedly doing there,

19
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,967
I never saw here.

20
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,034
Son of a bitch.

21
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,443
- Here you go.

22
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,325
Thank you.

23
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,994
- One of those for me this year?

24
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,996
- I know better than that.

25
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,414
- Here, trade me.

26
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,670
You doing okay?

27
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,508
Yeah, me too.

28
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,193
I get what they've been
telling me.

29
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,903
Braindead.

30
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:20,283
I know what they're saying.

31
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,203
And I've been looking at that
face every day for 46 years.

32
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,413
That's what she looks like

33
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,957
when she's asleep.

34
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,588
You want to tell me when
a person stops being a person?

35
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,841
What about the craniotomy?

36
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,259
- What do you mean?

37
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,845
- Duntsch said he could
save her with a craniotomy.

38
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,931
- I don't think so.
- You don't think?

39
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,224
- I know.

40
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,850
- It'd be worth a shot,
wouldn't it?

41
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,811
- No.
- Why no?

42
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,482
- She's beyond that now, Earl.

43
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,906
- You're not her doctor.

44
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,949
- I know that.

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,742
- You come in here
asking questions,

46
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,287
asking to look at her files,
and now you're telling me no?

47
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,255
Dorothy and I learned
how to sail together.

48
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,508
We bought a boat.

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,970
It was just a 24-foot cruiser
earlier this year.

50
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,056
Docked on Lake Texoma.

51
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,725
- Nice up there?

52
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,854
- Nice.

53
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,607
Quiet.

54
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,485
Especially in winter.

55
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,572
It took us 30 years
to buy that boat.

56
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:47,203
Why did it take us so long
to buy that boat?

57
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,420
- My son was here

58
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,089
just a few doors up that way.

59
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,054
Nine years ago this week,

60
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,724
he lasted a month.

61
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,644
I thought I was... I thought
I was managing the situation.

62
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,480
I figured someone
had missed something.

63
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,148
I mean, this is what I do
my whole life.

64
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,650
I save people,

65
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,695
and no matter
what anybody told me,

66
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,448
how they tried
to convince me otherwise,

67
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,450
I assumed...

68
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,123
Pretended...

69
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,375
there was a chance,

70
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,586
pretended I didn't know
the statistics,

71
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,340
cited miracle cases,

72
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,968
clung to them like facts.

73
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,849
No matter what...
and there's no way around this...

74
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,352
no matter what you decide to do,

75
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:56,564
you're going to hate yourself,
and...

76
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,900
more than a little.

77
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,659
She's not asleep, Earl.

78
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,916
- And you want me
to listen to you?

79
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,089
To trust you.

80
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,015
I trusted him too.

81
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,357
- All right?

82
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,234
Watch for the long count.

83
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,902
Stay disciplined.

84
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,239
You guys pointed to that
bullshit from last week.

85
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,782
I swear to God,

86
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,784
whoever you want to fucking

87
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,578
till you'll be puking
out of your assholes.

88
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,872
You understand me?

89
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,623
All right, so.

90
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,043
90% of the time, on first down,

91
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,587
they're running twins
to the wide side.

92
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,464
Do not fall for the play action.

93
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,466
It's a fake hand-off...

94
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,842
- He's gonna roll out.

95
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,636
He's gonna hit the inside
receiver with a quick out.

96
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,768
- Freshman?

97
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,603
- What's that?
- You a freshman?

98
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,313
You got that freshman focus.

99
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,940
- Sophomore.
- Oh, redshirted?

100
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,193
- Walk-on.

101
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,946
I just transferred
from Millsaps, Mississippi.

102
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,656
- Walk-ons aren't easy
to come by.

103
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,451
Must be a bitch.

104
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,995
- Well, I always
go the distance.

105
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,497
Chris.

106
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,750
- I'm Chris.

107
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,380
- Duntsch.
- Beton.

108
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,523
But nobody can pronounce
that shit.

109
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,591
- Call me Betts.
- Next up.

110
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,181
- 86.287.

111
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,391
Right on target, Martinez.

112
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,976
Nice work. Next up!

113
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,319
198.

114
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,737
- Um, Coach?
- Next up.

115
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,281
- But I think
that number is wrong.

116
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,450
It's just,
I'm weighing 220 back home.

117
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,660
- Ahh.

118
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,246
Well, you weigh 198 in here.

119
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,956
You're in your goal range.

120
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,041
No need to stress over
a few pounds, Daisy.

121
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,292
- Next up!
- No, no.

122
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,336
There's just no goddamn way.

123
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,922
- Yes, goddamn way. Get off.

124
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,133
- Coach, I think you need
to recalibrate this fucker.

125
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,468
- We can recalibrate
your position on this team

126
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,887
if you don't get
the fuck off my scale.

127
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,692
243. Two pounds light.

128
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,236
I want you up by next week.

129
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,780
- That was, uh, daring.
- Bullshit.

130
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,032
- Come on. Who gives a fuck?

131
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,783
- I bet you were right
on target.

132
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,869
- By your math, I'm fat.

133
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,708
Whatever, man.

134
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,960
- I need to bulk up.

135
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,088
My brother swears by this shit.

136
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,716
It's like his secret weapon.
Nathan gained, like, 40 pounds.

137
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,384
- Whoa. Hold up.

138
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,594
Nathan?

139
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,970
I have a brother Nathan.

140
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,056
- Get the fuck outta here.

141
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,725
That's not enough fingers.

142
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,144
Nathan is, like, a genius.

143
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,747
He got the brains
of the family for sure.

144
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,397
And then my other brother,
Matthew,

145
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,067
is just unbelievable
with a ball... any ball.

146
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,277
Put it into his hands,
he's unstoppable.

147
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,380
They just don't struggle
with things, you know, like me.

148
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,699
I got to outwork 'em or... you
know, that's what my dad says.

149
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,535
- Oh, fuck that guy.
- What's he do?

150
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,288
- Doctor,
or a physical therapist,

151
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,874
but it's cool,
'cause, you know...

152
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,001
"It really don't matter
if I lose the faith."

153
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,712
"'Cause all I want to do
is go the distance."

154
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,547
- Oh, Italian Stallion!
- Yeah!

155
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,258
Fucking classic.

156
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,387
- You know, I'm actually taking
a couple of cinema classes.

157
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,473
- What, like,
you watch movies for credit?

158
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,767
- I know, right?
- You pick a major?

159
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,602
- Eh, I don't know.

160
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,729
I'm looking into chemistry
or biology

161
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,692
or even giving
vertebrate zoology a look.

162
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,696
- That's not a thing.

163
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,989
That doesn't look right.

164
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,492
- It doesn't matter, anyway.
- I can't take it.

165
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,952
Conflicts with morning practice.

166
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,620
Coach would kill me.

167
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,540
What?

168
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,291
- Oh, come on, man.

169
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,520
I mean, the New Jersey is great
for chicks and parties and shit,

170
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,296
but it's not like
we're going pro.

171
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,424
- Maybe you're not.

172
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,847
All right.

173
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,225
Chicken, broccoli...
God, peanut butter?

174
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,144
Jesus, we're going
to eat all this?

175
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,270
- Yup.

176
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,188
I mean, we gotta
blend it up first, but...

177
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,028
- I got a better way
to put on weight.

178
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,201
Come on. You're gonna love it.

179
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,995
Get in there.

180
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,830
Look alive, handsome.

181
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,832
- Hey, Betts!
- Hey, there he is.

182
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,168
- Oh, hey. Thank you so much.

183
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,794
Drunken bastards. Look at you.

184
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,504
Let's have a drink.
Let's have a drink.

185
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,342
Hey, what are you doing?

186
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,886
Gettin' lucky.
Wear some protection.

187
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,679
Creerie, yeah!

188
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,972
You're a very nice man.

189
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,266
Thank you so much. Oh, hey.

190
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,351
- Yeah.

191
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,935
- See you later, okay?

192
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,773
How are you doing?

193
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,901
Thank you so much. Oh, yes.

194
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,819
Hey ladies, let's just
dance the night away.

195
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,405
Just us girls
dancing the night away.

196
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,532
Hey!

197
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,368
Never graduate!

198
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,744
Solomon!

199
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,246
Solomon!

200
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,291
Duntsch, come on.

201
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,876
- Faithful friend,

202
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,253
and future acquaintance, enter.

203
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,053
Some dope dope, my man.

204
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,723
- I'ma head home.

205
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,016
- Come on.

206
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,310
- School day's tomorrow,
you know?

207
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,728
But you have fun.

208
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,171
- Baylor let Duntsch resign.

209
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,216
- He wasn't fired?

210
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,968
- I asked around here two turns,

211
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,012
and all he had
were temporary privileges.

212
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,221
- Were they revoked?

213
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,265
- I was told
that was confidential.

214
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,229
You like peanuts?

215
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,857
Hate that part.

216
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,418
Sitting with the relatives
like that...

217
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,818
never got used to it.

218
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,236
- There was no getting used
to it.

219
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,089
The only thing you can do
is stay if they want you to,

220
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,614
get out of the way
if they don't.

221
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,907
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

222
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,784
Well, where the hell
was Duntsch?

223
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,829
Not sitting there offering
apologies or advice to that guy

224
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,914
on when to pull the plug
on his wife.

225
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,042
- Do you have any idea
where he is?

226
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,544
- Farting tornado.

227
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,589
What do you think?

228
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,965
- About?

229
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,593
- A guy from
a top medical program

230
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,429
followed by a top residency
followed by a top fellowship.

231
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,848
He keeps getting
these surgical outcomes because.

232
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,159
A, he's either
doing it on purpose,

233
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,518
or two, he just sucks.

234
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,355
- I can't make sense of it.

235
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,316
- Personally,
I'm leaning towards B.

236
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,610
- The question isn't
why he did it.

237
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,112
It's how he got away with it.

238
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,823
- You and I are mind-melding.

239
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,158
- I have no idea
what that means.

240
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,243
- We're on the same page.

241
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,080
I mean, Baylor Plano
has, what, three, four

242
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,582
of the top neurosurgeons
in the area on staff,

243
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,792
and I'm talking the best.

244
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,293
Well, instead
of these top, top guys

245
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,045
getting the patients,
Duntsch gets them...

246
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,130
the newbie,
just arrived in town,

247
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,300
zero experience,
zero business operating.

248
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,968
Come on, you'd think he was,
you know...

249
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,513
With somebody up the ladder.

250
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,556
- Now we're not even
in the same library.

251
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,975
- I'm just saying... motive.

252
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,478
- Move on.

253
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,523
- Are we gonna eat?
- I'm fucking starving.

254
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,459
- You have to make sure
that Duntsch never operates

255
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,777
at a hospital in Texas
ever again.

256
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,405
- Mm-hmm.
- I have a suggestion.

257
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,532
It's a bit extreme,

258
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,243
but I think
the situation warrants it.

259
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,289
We report Duntsch
to the Texas Medical Board.

260
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,376
What do you think?

261
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,547
- I'm still waiting
for the extreme part.

262
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,817
- I don't need to remind you
of what the stakes are here.

263
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,010
- Ooh, they got a porterhouse
in the menu for two.

264
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,636
- Halvsies?
- If we're not meticulous

265
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,847
in presenting our evidence,
if we don't get this right,

266
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,181
Duntsch will continue
to operate.

267
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,642
We need pure, hard facts,

268
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,644
not cocktail umbrellas.

269
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,856
I've been gathering evidence.

270
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,399
- Evidence.
- Yeah.

271
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,109
Patient files.

272
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,446
- Ooh, hee,
here's your girl, Bobbie.

273
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,489
HIPAA violations.

274
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,451
- Are you done?

275
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,803
- I don't know how you pulled
that one off,

276
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,079
and I don't wanna know how,

277
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,581
but I do wanna know how.

278
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,542
- I actually asked his patients
for their permission.

279
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,793
- Mm.

280
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,879
Boring.

281
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,006
- I have some other questions
I need to get answered.

282
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,799
So you enjoy your meal.

283
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,343
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

284
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,013
Can't trust a place with a red
wine milkshake on the menu.

285
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,016
- At the end, now I face that

286
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,060
which was alluding me
at the start.

287
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,520
The settling, the trading,

288
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,148
and embrace with disappointment.

289
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,691
The sky cracks open

290
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,235
and is crying out for me.

291
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,072
The ground has no shape.

292
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,824
My feet sink in

293
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,452
and takes me down to the depth.

294
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,579
The far depths.

295
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,958
- Chris.

296
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,585
Chris D.

297
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,630
Chris D.

298
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,692
- One day,

299
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,985
we're here without a why.

300
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,655
We grow and live

301
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,241
and always try.

302
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,619
We seek each day,
the reasons why

303
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,205
and push each day

304
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,290
against the tide.

305
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,003
At first, we seek
to find our dreams,

306
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,589
but dreams are never
what they seem.

307
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,758
Some are fast,

308
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,469
and some fall behind,

309
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,639
and push and pull

310
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,434
inside our minds.

311
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,575
- Keep your head up.
- Keep both feet moving!

312
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,661
- Stay wide.
- Here we go, here we go!

313
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,748
- Bring it in! Let's go!

314
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,167
Hustle up.

315
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,335
All right. Listen up.

316
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,712
Clench will be running
a 43 D next week.

317
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,631
Duntsch, you're up.
You're running the play.

318
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,593
Weak cross, plug zero.
Everyone get the concept?

319
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,304
- Yes, Coach!
- All right, let's go.

320
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,688
- Let's go now. Look sharp.

321
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,985
- Ready.

322
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,528
Ready.

323
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,696
Set, hut!

324
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,911
- Duntsch,
what the fuck is that?

325
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,204
You don't go left.

326
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,831
You blitz right. Hit the A gap.

327
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,751
Get your shit together.

328
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,795
Let's go.

329
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,718
- Ready.

330
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,221
Set, hut!

331
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,450
- If you're gonna suck
this hard,

332
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,618
you might as well
get on your knees, Daisy.

333
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,812
Go right, Duntsch.

334
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,230
Run it again.

335
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,898
On the ball.

336
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,316
- Set, hut.

337
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,613
Set, hut.

338
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,165
On the ball!

339
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,587
Run it again!

340
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,423
- Set, hut.

341
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,595
- You're done.

342
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,389
- No, Coach. Coach, I got this.

343
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,724
- No, you don't got this.

344
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,993
- I got this, Coach. Seriously.

345
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,560
One more try, please. Please.

346
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,812
Weak cross, plug zero,
hit the A gap.

347
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,897
One more try.

348
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,945
- All right, let's go.
- Let's chop some wood!

349
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,406
Let's go! On the ball!

350
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,616
- A gap.
- Yeah, yeah.

351
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,854
Son of a bitch! Duntsch!

352
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,609
What the hell was that?

353
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,153
Red jersey means do not hit.

354
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,864
Are you fucking dyslexic
and color blind?

355
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,799
- Want a ride home?

356
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,676
Ah, come on.

357
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,220
Yeah. Today was shit.

358
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,263
But we got practice
again tomorrow.

359
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,723
Two, as it turns out.

360
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,892
And the next day,
and the next day.

361
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,394
You'll get it eventually.

362
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,522
- Eventually doesn't help.
- I need to get it now.

363
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,816
- Tonight?
- You need to get it tonight?

364
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,651
- I don't understand.

365
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,545
I mean, what am I doing wrong?
Why can't I run this?

366
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,489
- Chris, man. I'm tired.

367
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,074
I got a six-pack, a party,

368
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,010
and a girl named Portia
waiting for me at the house.

369
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,869
- One hour. Tops.

370
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,168
Eye of the tiger, motherfucker.

371
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,753
- Yes!

372
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,223
- You did all these notes
in your playbook?

373
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,267
Dork.

374
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,562
Okay.

375
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,732
So you got your center
in the center, obviously.

376
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,900
And then you got guards,
tackles,

377
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,485
and tight ends
laterally on each side.

378
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,529
Here's you at mid.

379
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,865
Now, on the snap,
you blitz right

380
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,868
and hit the A gap
on the weak side.

381
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,453
X marks the spot.

382
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,247
- That's what I'm doing.
- No.

383
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,498
Weak side.

384
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,666
You're mixing them up,

385
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,418
and you're flattening
our quarterback.

386
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,462
Show me your right hand.

387
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,510
All right.

388
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,972
All right.

389
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,228
This gap here, on your right,

390
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,938
this is yours.

391
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,732
You got it?

392
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:56,983
Booyah.

393
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,443
Great. Let's drink.

394
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,403
- Run it?
- You know where to find me.

395
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,573
Got the sled? Okay, man.

396
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,594
- Come on!

397
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,229
- Hello? Help you?

398
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,231
- Where the hell are you?
- Josh?

399
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,608
- Be right up.

400
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,194
Dr. Henderson.

401
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,113
- Can we ask you
a couple questions?

402
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,823
This is Dr. Kirby.

403
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,243
- May I get you something?

404
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,512
- No, thank you.
- Beer would be great.

405
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,454
- Sure. I think I have a...

406
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,307
- Whoa, whoa, wait.
- Are you gonna say an IPA?

407
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,457
- Yeah.

408
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,583
- Seriously? Forget it.

409
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,793
What happened to beer?

410
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,461
You ask for a Bud,
you get an IPA.

411
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,422
You ask for a Coors,
you get an IPA.

412
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,799
- Life is hard for you, right?
- Can be.

413
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,886
- What's going on?

414
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,347
- Now, if at any moment
you feel uncomfortable...

415
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,016
- We're going after Duntsch.
- You in?

416
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,435
- You're like
a restless toddler.

417
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,689
We're planning
on reporting Duntsch

418
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,065
to the Texas Medical Board.

419
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,316
But we need more information.

420
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,752
Now, we don't have
to use your name, but if...

421
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,237
- Use my name. It's all yours.

422
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,490
- Madeline Beyer came in
for an elective laminectomy

423
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:28,742
and spinal fusion.

424
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,118
- Totally straightforward.

425
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,579
- We reviewed the pre-op notes
from last week.

426
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,664
Duntsch's plan
for Mrs. Beyer's procedure

427
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,999
was sound, well-reasoned.

428
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,042
He knew the science.

429
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,044
He knew what
he was supposed to do

430
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,420
heading into the OR.

431
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,713
- If you say so, sir.

432
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,090
To me, it was a disaster
from the start.

433
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,633
He showed up late.

434
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,719
And not surgeon late...
late, late.

435
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,054
And when he finally gets there,

436
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,555
that's when
I noticed his scrubs.

437
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,182
There was a hole in them.

438
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,266
- A hole?

439
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,601
- First saw it a few days before

440
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,187
at Rose Keller's operation.

441
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,688
You saying he was wearing

442
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,940
the same scrubs for days
into surgeries?

443
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,444
- At Mrs. Burke's surgery
on Tuesday, hole.

444
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,030
No underwear,
three surgeries in a row.

445
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,199
- Sorry.
- Where... where was this hole?

446
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,201
- How is that relevant?
- Oh, it's relevant.

447
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,994
- In the back.

448
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,204
- In the back, back?

449
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,081
A hole in the a-hole?

450
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,791
- All through
Mrs. Beyer's surgery,

451
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,626
he was mumbling
about Dorothy Burke.

452
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,045
He was preoccupied.
And then the blood?

453
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,463
A lumbar fusion...

454
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,090
acceptable blood loss
would be what?

455
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,717
200, 250 ccs?

456
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,680
She lost 1,700 ccs of blood.

457
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,391
That much blood loss?
Of course we were worried.

458
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,166
- There's a hemorrhage here.
- You need to fix it.

459
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,483
Do your goddamn job

460
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,111
and get her blood pressure
under control.

461
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,405
I can't see anything.
Get the blood out of my field.

462
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,623
Screw.

463
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,044
- Excuse me, sir.

464
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,546
I believe the screw
is out of place.

465
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,839
- I know where it is.

466
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,383
- It should be a little left.

467
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,470
Patient's left.

468
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,682
- I did a fucking visual, okay?
- I know where it is.

469
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,784
- Doctor, it looks
like the screw

470
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:17,994
might have missed the pedicle.

471
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,853
It seems to be
in soft tissue here.

472
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,646
- Is this guy on something?

473
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,523
- Am I talking to myself?

474
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,942
Reposition the C-arm
on Mrs. Burke now.

475
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,111
- You mean Mrs. Beyer?
- You know what I mean!

476
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,339
Cage. Give me the cage.

477
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,591
- Looks like the screw
is still outside the bone.

478
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:52,177
- The X-rays are bullshit.
- Get me the cage.

479
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,018
Mallet.

480
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,663
Craniotomy.

481
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,290
Get Dorothy Burke into pre-op.

482
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,709
- Dorothy Burke?
- We need to finish this, sir.

483
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,252
- I'm aware of that. Thank you.

484
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,838
Get Dorothy Burke
prepped for a craniotomy.

485
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,316
- Sir, this hospital
doesn't have privileges

486
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,675
to perform a craniotomy.

487
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,027
- Schedule it.
- We don't have the equipment.

488
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,931
- I'll do it with whatever
the fuck you do have.

489
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,846
Just get it scheduled. Now.

490
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,515
- I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't schedule it

491
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,059
because we do not perform
craniotomies at this hospital.

492
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,435
Maybe we could transfer
Mrs. Burke

493
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,145
out to an equipped facility.

494
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,897
Baylor Plano has privileges
for that.

495
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,650
- When I tell you
to do something, you do it.

496
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,235
- You're talking about
drilling a hole

497
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,904
into her skull, sir.

498
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,698
- Get the charge nurse in here.

499
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,954
Now.

500
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,709
Rod.

501
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:13,425
- Dr. Anthony?

502
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,469
There's a slight issue

503
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,346
with our lumbar case.

504
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,223
- Am I supposed to guess
what that issue is?

505
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,141
- Dr. Duntsch.

506
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,201
- Who's that? The new guy.

507
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,893
- Yes. This is his first week.

508
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,646
He's requesting a craniotomy.

509
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,190
- Brain surgery
on a lumbar case?

510
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,334
- No, sir.
- It's for a different patient.

511
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,943
- Dorothy Burke.
- I don't give a shit.

512
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,921
- We don't do craniotomies.
- I've told him that, sir.

513
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:37,365
I think he'd like
to hear it from you.

514
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,407
- Oh.

515
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,750
- I asked for the charge nurse.

516
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,543
- Yeah, well, you got
the chief of surgery.

517
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,171
- She's my patient.
- Her treatment is my decision.

518
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,381
- Well, today,
this is my hospital.

519
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,817
And when you applied
for privileges here,

520
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,027
you didn't check
the little red box

521
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,302
that said "brain surgeries."

522
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,636
- You are interrupting

523
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,513
an extremely delicate
spinal fusion.

524
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:01,765
- Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

525
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:02,867
I thought you called
for this interruption.

526
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,267
- Because I presumed

527
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,561
that you were shrewd enough
to simply sign off.

528
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,563
- Well, I'm just a country hick
from the Bronx,

529
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,733
so let me put this in a manner
even I can understand.

530
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,194
We don't do craniotomies
at this hospital,

531
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,905
and you are a guest here
at Dallas Medical.

532
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,090
If one of our staff tells you

533
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,342
we don't have privileges
for a procedure,

534
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,117
it is not an invitation
for debate.

535
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,953
- I have privileges
everywhere across this city.

536
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,348
- Oh, you do, do you?
- I will ensure

537
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,457
that not a single patient
comes through your door.

538
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,684
- Wow, that would be so tragic.

539
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,502
- Get the fuck out of my OR!

540
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:36,132
- I'm gonna walk you through
what's about to happen.

541
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,635
You will complete your work
on Madeline Beyer.

542
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,345
She's been over far too long.

543
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,556
You will then transfer
Dorothy Burke out of your care.

544
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,809
There will be no more
discussion of craniotomies.

545
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,436
No more arguments.
You will do it.

546
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:52,482
And then you will get the fuck
out of myOR.

547
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,182
- Anything else?
- What else do you need?

548
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,101
- We want you
to suspend his license

549
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,478
pending a formal investigation.

550
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,481
- Neither of you is in the
operating theater at the time?

551
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,858
That's correct.

552
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,860
- So this is all
secondhand information.

553
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,945
All hearsay.

554
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,657
- Yes.

555
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,409
- Just playing devil's advocate.

556
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,995
From your recitation
of the events that day,

557
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,955
Dr. Duntsch could make a case

558
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,541
that he was distracted.

559
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,835
- Did you not hear about
the hole in his scrubs?

560
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,670
I don't think she heard
about the hole.

561
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,380
- I agree. We all agree

562
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,632
that there were some surgical
misadventures at play...

563
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:00,884
- Misadventures?

564
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,194
- In. Dr Duntsch surgeries
last week,

565
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,012
but there are other issues.

566
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,222
We have a circulating nurse

567
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,892
demonstrating a measure
of non-compliance,

568
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,603
an X-ray tech
challenging a surgeon,

569
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,937
and then
an administrator barging

570
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,731
into an OR mid-procedure.

571
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,274
- They were doing their part

572
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,693
to stop
an out-of-control surgeon.

573
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,153
I was at Baylor Plano.

574
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,363
I saw what he's capable of...

575
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:24,908
or no, better put...
incapable of.

576
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,201
What about the craniotomy?

577
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,452
He was demanding a procedure

578
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,263
the hospital didn't have
privileges to perform.

579
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,873
- The doctor who took over
Dorothy Burke's case

580
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:34,376
stated a craniotomy
might've saved her life.

581
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,503
"I would have grabbed

582
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,173
the local handyman's drill
to perform it."

583
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,801
Dr. Duntsch may not have gone
about it the right way,

584
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,178
but it appears
he may have been right.

585
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,014
We receive hundreds
of these reports every year.

586
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,392
We take each case seriously,

587
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,810
but you both know

588
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,978
that there is context
to every story,

589
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,690
mistakes do happen
to every doctor,

590
00:30:56,731 --> 00:31:00,151
even I'm sure to you both.

591
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,698
You're prepared to file
a formal complaint?

592
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:07,325
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

593
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,828
- All right.

594
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,915
- You are going
to suspend his license?

595
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,709
I mean, what happens to him
in the meantime?

596
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,961
- We can't do that.

597
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,421
- Why the hell not?

598
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:20,964
- The attorneys
won't go for that.

599
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:23,299
We'd be opening ourselves up
to a lawsuit.

600
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,760
- I thought protecting
the public was the priority.

601
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,429
- That's our
number one priority.

602
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,597
- Well, what's to prevent him
from seeking privileges

603
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,600
at any one of the other
400 hospitals in the state?

604
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,145
- Dr. Duntsch has resigned
from Baylor.

605
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,479
- He should have
been shitcanned.

606
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,690
- He no longer has privileges
at Dallas Medical.

607
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,151
He has no privileges anywhere.

608
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,820
Perhaps he's taking
some personal time

609
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,697
getting his head straight

610
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,158
after what was a difficult week.

611
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,455
Difficult week.

612
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,081
You know what?
There was a urologist...

613
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,624
a urologist, you got me...

614
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,960
accused by a patient
of fondling his genitals.

615
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,338
A urologist!
These morons pursued the case.

616
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,024
I mean, this... this feels like
we've got to draw blood

617
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:04,341
in order to move the needle.

618
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:06,843
Duntsch was distracted?
Give me a fucking break.

619
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,386
- Well, they're not wrong.

620
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,013
He lost privileges
at two hospitals.

621
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,389
News travels fast.

622
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,682
- Not fast enough.

623
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:15,560
- We voiced our concern.
- We filed a complaint.

624
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,104
They launched an investigation.
What more would you like to do?

625
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,814
- I want to break
his goddamn hands.

626
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,042
- Dr. Kirby, we have no choice

627
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,026
but to respect the integrity
of this process.

628
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,503
- Did you hear those goobers
in there?

629
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:27,197
The process is gonna fuck us.
The system is broken.

630
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:28,615
- And we are a part
of that system.

631
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,492
- Oh, fuck this.

632
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,384
- Hey.
- Hey.

633
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,177
- Been looking all over for you.

634
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,404
- Yeah, I've been looking
for you too, man.

635
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,639
I got some news. Great news.

636
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:53,598
- Yeah?
- Yep.

637
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,142
I am going home.

638
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,269
I'm going back to Tennessee.
And I had an idea.

639
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,373
I haven't really thought
through all the details yet,

640
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,148
but I think
you should come with me.

641
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,526
- Come with you to Tennessee?
- Yes, man.

642
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,736
If you think football
is big here, you have no idea.

643
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,131
Like, two division one football
players retired in the South?

644
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,532
We would be like gods.

645
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:11,783
- Hold on. Back up.

646
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,427
Why would you leave now?
You just made walk-on.

647
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,870
- Oh, fuck this team.
- There's no future here.

648
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,247
It's bullshit. I don't need it.

649
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,915
- Then why you still
wearing the jersey?

650
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,670
- Look, this is good for me.

651
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,714
Okay? It's good for me.

652
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,299
So just come with me.

653
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,593
- I am not going to Tennessee.

654
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:33,596
What are you talking about?

655
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:34,889
- Your loss.

656
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,158
- Dude, I don't think
you thought this through.

657
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,226
- No, no, no. It is all settled.

658
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,561
Okay? I'm leaving.

659
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:42,063
I'm going home
'cause I don't need this shit.

660
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,249
I don't need any of it. Fuck it.

661
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,375
- Dude, what's going on
with you?

662
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,193
- I can't stay.
- I can't stay, okay?

663
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,820
I needed a football scholarship.

664
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,489
I didn't get it,
so I can't stay.

665
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:52,532
I'm going home.

666
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,243
I needed it,
and I didn't get it.

667
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,502
- Shit.

668
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,087
Dude, I had no idea.

669
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,714
- Forget it.

670
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,968
- No.

671
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,762
No!

672
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,388
It's gonna be good.

673
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,849
U fucking T, they're awesome.

674
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,185
Great record, solid coach,
and the way you work,

675
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,454
you'll be starting
within three games.

676
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:24,356
- My third school, Betts.
- My third transfer.

677
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,901
I can't play anywhere.

678
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:31,279
I'm not even eligible to sit
on the goddamn sidelines.

679
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,412
- Well, maybe
this is a good thing.

680
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,706
I mean, did you ever
really want it?

681
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,334
- What?

682
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,270
- It's just, I think you have
this idea in your head

683
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:50,131
of what football means
or what it's supposed to mean.

684
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,925
But does it...
does it mean that to you

685
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:54,177
or do you just think it should?

686
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:03,186
- Where were you all those
Monday morning film sessions?

687
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,647
Where were you all those hours
after practice,

688
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,024
the drilling, the weightlifting?

689
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,275
Huh? Where were you?

690
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,152
Partying? Sleeping it off?

691
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:13,405
And you ask me if I wanted it?
Fuck you, Betts.

692
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,906
- Yeah, and all that work
for what?

693
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,092
So you can act like an asshole

694
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,492
and sit
on the goddamn sidelines?

695
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:18,618
Fuck you!

696
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,629
Stop, okay?

697
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,812
- Stop.

698
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,038
- Come on.

699
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,205
Come on. Let's go.

700
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:06,416
No, fuck you...

701
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:11,921
- Stop!

702
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:13,882
You can't win.

703
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,051
Stop fucking trying.

704
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,635
- Dumb face!

705
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,570
- Is your grandma
good with this?

706
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:20,198
- Mee-maw? She's good.

707
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,950
This is a light night. Hey.

708
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:26,162
I'm sorry about
the whole dumb face thing.

709
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,248
- Old habits.
- Ah, don't worry about it.

710
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,378
- So, my hotshot friend,

711
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,715
word is you're a big-time
football player up in the CO.

712
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,925
- I was, yeah.
- Yeah, starting mid.

713
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:42,178
You should've seen the girls
I got in that jersey.

714
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,471
But some of the guys

715
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:44,699
on the practice squad
were kind of busted.

716
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,225
So that slowed me down
every now and then.

717
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,144
Honestly,

718
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,813
I'm kind of over football,
you know?

719
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,025
It just... it just feels
beneath me, you know?

720
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,484
- Hey, man. No love lost here.

721
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:59,487
My neck's still fucked
from junior year.

722
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:01,573
- Plus I got bigger things
going on here.

723
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,158
- What do you got brewing?

724
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,200
- Pre-med.

725
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:05,452
UT. I'm taking the MCAT.

726
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,246
- Oh, man! Like, ah!

727
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,640
I always knew
you were gonna end up

728
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,499
doing some crazy
high-end shit with your life.

729
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:14,210
You were always, like,
the smartest guy I knew.

730
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:15,420
- Yo.

731
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,967
- And given
the spaz company you keep,

732
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,595
that's not really saying much.

733
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,013
- Ah!

734
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,598
Dumb face!

735
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,392
So that's it.

736
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,227
You're back?

737
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,980
- I miss the weather.

738
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,148
- And your boy, Jerry.

739
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,194
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

740
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,695
My boy don't play.

741
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:42,697
He's going beyond.
Gonna change the world.

742
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,491
Someone get him a Boone's Farm.

743
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:45,825
Strawberry Hill, right?

744
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,036
- Yeah.
- Yeah, light and sweet, baby.

745
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,662
I knew it. Hey, yo, yo, yo.

746
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,247
Get my homie some Boone's.

747
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:52,415
- We don't got any of that.

748
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,209
- Then go get some,
you piece of shit.

749
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,628
Go, go! Get some.

750
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,135
Good to be home.

751
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,805
- I'm going to see you
every day.

752
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:16,064
- I know.

753
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:19,025
I know it's not ideal
me moving back home,

754
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:21,069
but Jerry did mention

755
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,196
that maybe I could live with him
for a little while

756
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,406
just until classes start.

757
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:25,990
And I really think

758
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,635
that I'm onto something
with this research.

759
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,339
I really think that
there's a future in it.

760
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,204
- What exactly does one do
with research?

761
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:32,539
- Well, maybe you could go

762
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,933
into the medical field,
like your father.

763
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:35,625
- Actually, Dad,

764
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,003
I've been looking into that
and giving it a lot of thought.

765
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:41,214
So not all of my courses
from CSU would transfer,

766
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,508
but the biology credits would,

767
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,051
so I'd only actually
need to do, like,

768
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:46,720
two additional semesters.

769
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,614
I mean, I thought I'd have to
do, like, two additional years.

770
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,223
Two semesters is nothing.

771
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,559
- Money's not nothing, Chris.

772
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,978
First it was Millsaps College
for football,

773
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,896
and then it was Colorado State
for football.

774
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,648
And now you're back
for research.

775
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,360
- I know, sir,
but I would be a doctor.

776
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,945
A neurosurgeon.

777
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,280
- Oh, I don't know.

778
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,282
I have a medical degree, Chris,

779
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,117
and I know the...

780
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,037
the difficulties that come
with that area of study.

781
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,788
- Well, this is not exactly

782
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,583
something you'd be
familiar with.

783
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:20,170
- Oh? How so?

784
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,425
- I just mean there's been...

785
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,469
there's been a lot
of advancements,

786
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,221
and there's new studies
and new technologies,

787
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:33,433
and I'd be an MD.

788
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:34,785
- You know,
this is what I always used

789
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,353
to tell your brother, Nathan.

790
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,229
He has that kind of mind.

791
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:39,957
Nathan should have gone
to medical school, you know?

792
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,233
- I think it's a great idea.
- Susan.

793
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:45,820
- Christopher, you have always
struggled to find something

794
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:48,615
that challenged you,
like Einstein.

795
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,658
Maybe you should
reach out to John.

796
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,077
- Dr. Davidson.
- Susan...

797
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:53,745
- He's like an uncle to him,

798
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,467
and maybe he could
help you find something.

799
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:57,207
- Chris is not going
to ask for favors

800
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:58,958
he definitely cannot repay,

801
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,878
not from my friends.

802
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,423
- Dad, I really think my stem
cell research has potential.

803
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:08,551
- Stem cell.

804
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:10,613
- Yeah, they're the... the
building blocks of the human.

805
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,514
- No, I know what
stem cells are, Christopher.

806
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,355
- Okay, so then you know
that they can develop

807
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:15,934
into other types of cells,

808
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,602
which is why they have
so much potential.

809
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,354
They're incredibly complex

810
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,456
starting right
from the beginning

811
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,707
of their formation
in the embryo.

812
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,483
- If they're in the embryo,

813
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,985
how does one access them
for research?

814
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,237
- We can isolate them

815
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,989
from immature human embryos
and fetal tissue.

816
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:33,386
- So you're talking about
spending your time

817
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,162
and my money parading around

818
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:37,539
masquerading as a doctor

819
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,376
promoting the exploitation
of unborn babies?

820
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:45,213
That is not medicine, Chris.

821
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,132
It's not science.

822
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,050
- Dad,

823
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,971
science is what
can be done by man.

824
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:54,222
What is conquerable?

825
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:56,224
And I plan on conquering this.

826
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,059
Well...

827
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,978
I wouldn't count on it.

828
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,107
- Well...

829
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,153
The MCATs disagree with you.

830
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,949
I got a couple wrong.

831
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,827
- Some things
can be learned, son,

832
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,371
and some things
are just biology.

833
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:26,439
- Hello?

834
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:00,974
- He was running on a platform

835
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,493
about reducing
the cost of government.

836
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:05,979
And his plan was to eliminate
three government agencies,

837
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,398
and he couldn't name them.

838
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,816
Fancy pants.

839
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:10,918
- That's definitely
his kind of...

840
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:12,235
- Shrimp!

841
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:16,239
- Oh, God.
- Ah!

842
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,532
Great party.

843
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:19,159
I did hear a nasty little rumor

844
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,160
about a lobster tail somewhere
with my name on it.

845
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:23,955
- Randy Kirby.

846
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:27,000
- Oh. You're Dr. Kirby.

847
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,336
- Oh, I see my reputation
has exceeded me.

848
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:30,712
- Indeed.

849
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:32,434
- Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

850
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:33,548
- Merry Christmas, Randy.

851
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,775
- Hey, season's greetings
to you.

852
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:36,426
- So they just let you in?

853
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:37,886
- Well, I told security

854
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:40,472
that we needed
to talk some doctor stuff.

855
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:41,848
- Doctor stuff.

856
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,892
- But firstly, I want to say,

857
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:46,394
I know I should have called
months ago.

858
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,937
I haven't been able to sleep

859
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:51,691
thinking about how we left
things after the Medical Board.

860
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:54,736
I just want to say I'm sorry.

861
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:56,905
- That's why you came?

862
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:58,406
- Partly.

863
00:44:58,448 --> 00:44:59,991
- All is forgiven.

864
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,326
- Thanks.

865
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:02,994
- What's the other part?

866
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:06,790
Duntsch is back.
