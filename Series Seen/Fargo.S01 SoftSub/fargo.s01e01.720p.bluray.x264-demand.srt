1
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,036
<i>They won't...</i>

2
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,794
<i>She won't stop, you know?</i>

3
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,916
<i>Day after...</i>

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,118
<i>I was a maker.</i>

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,432
<i>I'm gonna do it tonight...
when she's sleeping.</i>

6
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,679
<i>But I'm scared--</i>

7
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,833
She said that
I gotta make a meatloaf.

8
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,479
I said we'd bring
Jell-O salad,

9
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,230
but Kitty said
meatloaf, so...

10
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,834
Hon?

11
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,515
So... What's that, hon?

12
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,796
I said it's Gordo's
birthday tonight.

13
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,352
We're supposed to be at your brother's
at 4:00 with meatloaf.

14
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,320
It sounds different today,
don't you think?

15
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,629
Like, angry?

16
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,554
I'm washing towels.
It's a towel sound.

17
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,190
Oh.

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
Kitty said they just got one of 
those fancy European all-in-ones.

19
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,514
Says it washes and dries.
One machine.

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,353
Can you believe that?

21
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,033
Bet that set
them back a penny.

22
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,554
He can afford it,
your brother.

23
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,114
Kitty said he just
got a big promotion

24
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,159
after only working
there a year.

25
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,560
Kitty said they also got
one of those fancy new

26
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,553
surround sound systems.

27
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,559
Guess I married
the wrong Nygaard.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,029
Oh.

29
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,750
That's what I said.
We had a good laugh.

30
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,957
Well, it's just
slow now at the shop.

31
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,155
Hon... that's what
you always say. "Slow."

32
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,360
Well...

33
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,318
better get back to it.

34
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,395
You make your own wins.

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,756
That's what Kitty
said Chaz told her.

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,400
Salesmen make
their own wins.

37
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,076
You gotta try harder, hon.
Smile, for Pete's sake.

38
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,514
Maybe wear a nicer tie.

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,513
You gave me this tie.

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,875
Well, if you were
a better salesman,

41
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,872
I'd have bought
you a nicer tie.

42
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,993
At least take a look.

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,232
I keep thinking
maybe it's the settings.

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,116
Kitty says Chaz

45
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,999
fixes things around
the house all the time.

46
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,278
Says he took the toaster
apart over the weekend.

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Now it's good as new.
Browns to beat the band.

48
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,070
So that's...

49
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,311
Like I said, there's two kinds of policies
you should be thinking about.

50
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,914
You got your Whole Life

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,310
and your Whole Life Plus which covers

52
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,193
the same benefits of Whole Life

53
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,318
plus a heck of a lot more.

54
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,835
Well, we just came in to get Charlene
on my health care.

55
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,593
On account I'm having a baby.

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,670
Yeah.

57
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,830
A boy, we're hoping.

58
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,149
Or a little girl.

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,357
I'd just about hug the pants
off a little girl.

60
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,633
Yeah? Well, uh...

61
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,871
Even more... Yeah.

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,350
All the more reason to...

63
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,274
Because what happens...
what happens

64
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,875
if you have an accident
at your job?

65
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,189
I work at the library.

66
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,236
Okay.

67
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,360
What happens if you have a car crash
and go out the windshield...

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,320
or... or... or say you're 
up a ladder cleaning out the gutters

69
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,035
and you fall off the darn thing
and break your neck?

70
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,874
These things happen
every day.

71
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,510
And people fall
asleep smoking in bed.

72
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,239
They burn to death.

73
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,356
What... what I'm saying is

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,956
the morgue is full of guys thought 
they didn't need life insurance.

75
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,351
For peace of mind, I'm saying, 
to know that your little boy...

76
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,396
Or girl.

77
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,837
Right....or little
girl is taken care of.

78
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,754
We're supposed to be
at my mom's by 4:00.

79
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,957
Yeah, so we're gonna...

80
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,838
Oh, okay.

81
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,880
Well, at least let me give you a 
brochure or I got these pens.

82
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,680
I got these nifty pens...
Look at that, huh?

83
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,070
...with most of the colors.

84
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,631
Okay, well, if you change your mind,
then give me a...

85
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,630
Oh, heck.

86
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,436
Will you look at that?

87
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,670
What is it, Dad?

88
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,638
Yeah, Dad. What is it?

89
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,279
Hey, Sam.

90
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,716
That there, boys, is a black man.

91
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,519
He don't...
he don't look black, Dad.

92
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,599
Yeah, Dad, he don't look black. 
More like a big pumpkin.

93
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,990
Yeah! Yeah, like a big,
stupid pumpkin.

94
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,276
Lester Niggered.

95
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,311
Now, come on, Sam, it's Nygaard...
just like in high school.

96
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,278
You went to high school
with a black man, Dad?

97
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,350
Yeah, Dad, did you?

98
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,750
Shut up.

99
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,479
How you been, Lester?

100
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,676
Yeah, real good.

101
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,750
Yeah?
Yeah.

102
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,629
Me, too. Yeah, trucking
company's doing super.

103
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,280
Got rigs all over
the Great Lakes.

104
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,955
Just bought a summer
house up Bear Island.

105
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,633
It's pretty sweet.

106
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,800
Hey... you remember
the story I told you

107
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,669
of the boy I put in the oil drum
and rolled onto the highway?

108
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,830
Is that him, Dad?

109
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,910
Yeah, Dad, is that him?

110
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,670
Oh, you betcha.

111
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,750
Betcha.

112
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,876
Good old Lester
pencil dick.

113
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,633
Hey, say, Lester...

114
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,679
what was the name of that girl 
you went with in high school?

115
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,911
You know, the curvy one.

116
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,360
That's Pearl. Yeah.

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
Yeah, Pearl.

118
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,477
What a rack on that girl, huh?

119
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,152
Dad's saying she had big titties.

120
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,074
Yeah, I know what "rack"
means, you fairy-- Ow!

121
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,833
Yeah, Dad, ow...

122
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,757
You know, she gave me a tug once.

123
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,800
Homecoming senior year.
Had the nice fat hands.

124
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,076
Real soft.

125
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,392
We're married now.
Going on 18 years.

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,358
Oh, Dad,
that's embarrassing.

127
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,751
Yeah, Dad,
super embarrassing.

128
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,830
Eighteen years, huh?

129
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,274
Yeah.

130
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,192
That's something.

131
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,840
Never knew what she
saw in you, really.

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,876
Well, I...

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
No, I mean, help me out.

134
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,840
Is it your stupid pencil dick or your
little rat face?

135
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,272
Yeah, well, uh...

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,317
I should get back to it.

137
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,840
Come on.

138
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,915
Did I ever tell you
how I used to beat

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,152
this little guy up
in high school?

140
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,916
I'd write my name on my fist in 
Sharpie before I'd punch him

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,469
so everyone else
would know who did it.

142
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,596
That's a good one, Dad.

143
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,592
Yeah, Dad, real good one.

144
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,909
Remember?

145
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,671
Yeah, I... It's...
it's a long time ago, but...

146
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,198
What a day.

147
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,910
Mmm.

148
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,031
Excuse me, miss?

149
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,440
Do you think...

150
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,672
Will it be much longer?
This thing hurts like the dickens.

151
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,876
We'll call your name.

152
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,792
Yeah, but I've been
here an hour already.

153
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,712
We'll call your name.

154
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,919
Could I have a sip?

155
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,750
Oh.

156
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,277
Heck, take the whole can.

157
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,357
I can't drink the darn
thing without a straw.

158
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,879
Obliged.
Mmm.

159
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,350
What happened
to your nose?

160
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,274
It was...

161
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,751
it was just
a misunderstanding.

162
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,749
Now was this you misunderstanding
the other fella

163
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,957
or him misunderstanding you?

164
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,036
Pardon?

165
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,157
Who misunderstood whom?

166
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,550
No, what I'm saying...

167
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,075
It's...

168
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,676
it's not good to dwell
on these things.

169
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,240
Why?

170
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,515
Pardon?

171
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,717
Why is it not good to
dwell on these things,

172
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,799
especially things that
put you in a hospital?

173
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,793
Well, I was... I was outnumbered,
if you want to know the truth.

174
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,076
Three to one.

175
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,756
Big... big guys, too.
Well, one of them.

176
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,516
Other two were just
kids but big for their age, you know?

177
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,471
If I was any kind of man,
I'd have shown that Sam what's what.

178
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,356
Sam?

179
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,156
Hess.

180
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,119
The bully in high school
and he's a bully now.

181
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,078
So why didn't you...

182
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,600
show him what's what?

183
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,876
Well, his...

184
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,271
He had his sons with him and...

185
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,835
You let a man beat you
in front of his children

186
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,910
to send them a message?

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,639
No, that's not...

188
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,671
Heck.

189
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,639
Just... heck.

190
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,074
In my experience, if you let a man
break your nose,

191
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,232
the next time, he tries to break
your spine.

192
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,192
Sam? No way.

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,078
I mean, I don't think.

194
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,633
It just... I guess I embarrassed him
in front of his boys.

195
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,439
You embarrassed him?
Yeah, by...

196
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,352
He was telling me about a time where he 
and my wife, they were...

197
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,914
But he didn't know she was my wife

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,515
is the thing and when I told him...

199
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,557
This man slept with your wife and

200
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,711
you're worried about embarrassing him?

201
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,474
Not slept. No, they didn't...

202
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,678
He said it was just...

203
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,400
She has soft hands,
see, and I guess...

204
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,358
No, mister, we're not friends.

205
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,796
I mean maybe we will be someday.

206
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,709
But I gotta say, if that were me
in your position...

207
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,274
I would have killed that man.

208
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,712
Well, now...

209
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,520
Come on.

210
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,517
You said he bullied you
in high school, right?

211
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,829
Four years.

212
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,920
Gave me an ulcer.

213
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,110
You know what, one time,

214
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,557
he put me in an oil barrel
and rolled me in the road.

215
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,393
Seriously?

216
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,194
And now he tells you that he had 
relations with your wife.

217
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,479
He bullies you again
in front of his children.

218
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,071
This is a man who doesn't
deserve to draw breath.

219
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,072
Yeah, okay, but...

220
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,150
Here's the thing...

221
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,436
No, that is the thing.

222
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,954
Well, heck!

223
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,915
I mean, okay... okay,

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,277
but... what am I
supposed to do?

225
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,319
Heck, you're so sure about it.
Maybe you should just kill him for me.

226
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,711
You're asking me to kill this man.

227
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,634
No, that was... I was joking.

228
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,951
Mr. Nygaard?

229
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,158
Yeah, that's me. Just one second.

230
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,154
We... we... we... we...
We're just two fellas talking, right?

231
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,800
We're just blowing off steam?

232
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,678
Sir, it's real busy.

233
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,876
Like I said, one second.

234
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,792
Sam Hess.

235
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,951
No, just... just one second.
That is not--

236
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,190
Sir!

237
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,439
Just one word.

238
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,716
Yes or no.

239
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,473
Sir, I'm going to give your spot--

240
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,710
Yeah!

241
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,560
Yeah, I'm coming, for Pete's sake.

242
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,356
Cold enough for you, Chief?

243
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,716
Supposed to get down to negative 10 later.

244
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,916
Yeah, heard that.

245
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,395
Don't much like the sound of negative.

246
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,912
Thought I'd strip down to my shorts,
work on my tan.

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,753
So what's this here then?

248
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,400
Chief, I arrived on the
scene at 1300 hours,

249
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,392
found this '93 New Yorker.

250
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,870
Looks like she fled the road
and crashed the fence.

251
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,714
I found a set of footprints
leading away from the car.

252
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,871
Thought, possibly,
our driver, injured,

253
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,520
you know, got confused,
wandered into the woods.

254
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,353
I was just about to investigate.

255
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,909
There's blood here.
Hair, too.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,957
Yeah, saw that.

257
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,034
I was thinking maybe a deer, 
but couldn't find the evidence, so...

258
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,914
Here it is.

259
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,919
Son of a gun.

260
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,276
Blood on the steering wheel.

261
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,680
Driver could have hit his head.

262
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,114
Or her head.

263
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,510
You check the trunk?

264
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,080
No, sir.

265
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,910
Huh.

266
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,992
So you want to take a look
at those footprints then?

267
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,197
Sounds good.

268
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,636
How's Ida?

269
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,155
Any day now.

270
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,835
You got a name picked out?

271
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,711
Can't get that woman to decide what 
color to paint the nursery.

272
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,757
Can't believe I missed that
deer in the trunk.

273
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,797
Don't take it hard.

274
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,030
Been doing this a long time.

275
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,512
Never checked for a deer in the trunk
or any wildlife.

276
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,478
Chief.

277
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,636
Hiya, hon.

278
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,756
In the kitchen.

279
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,513
Something smells good.

280
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,717
Your boy wanted a hamburger.

281
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,952
Sounds like my boy.

282
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,557
Molly found a wreck out on 71.

283
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,960
How's she doing?

284
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,032
Molly? Yeah, good.

285
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,554
I always liked her.

286
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,756
Yeah, she's a peach.

287
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,869
Anyhoo, looks like the driver tried 
to head out on foot.

288
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,758
He got lost and froze
to death in the woods.

289
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,877
Oh, my.
Yeah.

290
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,192
Funny thing is, the fellow was just
wearing underpants.

291
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,350
That so?

292
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,476
Yeah.

293
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,394
No ID, nothing.
Hmm.

294
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,472
Couldn't find his clothes anywhere.

295
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,000
Maybe he ate 'em.

296
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,990
Hmm.

297
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,511
I was thinking maybe 
blue for the nursery.

298
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,239
Yeah?
Hmm.

299
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,154
Earlier, I was thinking maybe blue.

300
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,356
Then I changed my mind.

301
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,715
Blue's nice.

302
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,638
Maybe green.

303
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,280
Well... I'm ready to get painting.

304
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,591
Soon as you decide.

305
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,036
You're a good man, Vern Thurman.

306
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,192
My sister was crazy telling me 
not to marry you.

307
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,076
Your sister is crazy.

308
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,510
Hmm.

309
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,280
Dad said we could take turns.

310
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,629
Yeah?

311
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,713
Dad said that he also thinks 
you've got a potato brain.

312
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,076
So-- Hey!

313
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,236
You're doing it wrong.

314
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,313
You need to press your forearm into
the back of his neck,

315
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,915
grab your elbow with the other hand
to choke him right out.

316
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,991
What do you want, mister?

317
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,799
Yeah, mister, what do you want?

318
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,919
Sign outside says Hess & Sons.

319
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,957
Which one's the older boy?
Me.

320
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,839
Mickey.

321
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,516
So... that leaves me in
charge when Dad is gone.

322
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,875
Are not! Mom said...

323
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,077
Mom has nothing
to do with it, sister!

324
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,276
Hey!

325
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,960
Help you with something?

326
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,114
Sam Hess?

327
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,795
Who wants to know?

328
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,950
Me.

329
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,750
Only two reasons to
come to my shop, friend.

330
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,719
Either you need a truck
or you drive a truck, huh?

331
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,076
You a truck driver?

332
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,358
I was just talking
to your boys.

333
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,472
I think the younger
one's a little dim.

334
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,839
What did you say?

335
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,754
His IQ seems low, I'm saying.

336
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,194
Have you had him tested?

337
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,719
Hit him, Dad.

338
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,154
Yeah, Dad, hit him.

339
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,031
I'm gonna restrain myself.

340
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,794
You know, on account of you got 
an obvious head injury

341
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,156
and not beat you to death
with a tire iron.

342
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,597
But I'm gonna ask you again.
What the heck do you want?

343
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,151
I just wanted to
have a look at you.

344
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,554
Okay, that'll do it.

345
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,597
How does a grown man
fall over his own feet?

346
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,275
It was ice.
I slipped on ice.

347
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,430
We should have canceled.

348
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,557
Oh, don't be a baby.

349
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,350
Hi!
Hey, we're here.

350
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,676
We're here.
Hi.

351
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,071
Come on in.
Chaz is working the ham.

352
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,714
Took the whole team
down to Duluth Tuesday.

353
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
Big spread at the Marriot.

354
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,760
I've always
wanted to stay there.

355
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,115
Yeah, it's real sweet.

356
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,160
King-sized bed, view of the lake,
you name it.

357
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,232
Boss took me out for dinner.
Just the two of them.

358
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,959
Steak big as a catcher's mitt.

359
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,431
Said, "Chaz, you're going
places in this world."

360
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,557
Gave him a raise
and a corner office.

361
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,597
Yeah.
Hear that, Lester?

362
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,995
A corner office.

363
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,673
Yeah, real good.

364
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,433
And him, your younger brother.

365
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, I said I heard.

366
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,595
Vice-president,
sales, Midwest region.

367
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,353
Bought the surround
sound to celebrate.

368
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,119
I mean, it's pretty sweet, huh?

369
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,993
You're gonna have
to marry that ham,

370
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,356
you get any more familiar with it.

371
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,794
Saw it on <i>Rachael Ray.</i>

372
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,476
She said that massaging
breaks the muscle down,

373
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,630
makes the meat juicier.

374
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,754
Lester never wants
to try new things.

375
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,150
Now, hold on.
That's not true.

376
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,311
We make Gordo try
stuff all the time.

377
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,039
Chaz says we have
to open his horizons.

378
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,589
Broaden his horizons.

379
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,350
It's a big world,
you know.

380
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,593
There is more to life
than just Minnesota.

381
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,916
Took a real tumble, huh?

382
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,474
There's a spot over
by the fire station.

383
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,553
It's always icy.

384
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
Don't know what
the heck I was thinking.

385
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,440
Lester...

386
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,550
come out to the garage.

387
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,632
Help me get some more beer.

388
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,157
Took Gordo to a specialist last month.

389
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,356
Think he might
have the autism.

390
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,476
Yeah?

391
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,960
Won't stop drawing on the walls,

392
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,795
and Kitty, she said she found a 
Mason jar in his closet.

393
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,395
I guess that he
pees in it at night.

394
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,479
What's that about?

395
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,756
Hey... you want to see
something cool?

396
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,150
All right.

397
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,511
Sweet!
Yeah, not those.

398
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,274
Gee. What... what is that?

399
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,116
That there... is your M249 SAW
light machine gun,

400
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,840
sometimes referred to as "The Piglet."

401
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,638
Are you allowed...
Can you even have that?

402
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,756
Is it legal?

403
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,394
Technically, no way,

404
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,632
but I got a buddy who works supply
over at Camp Ripley.

405
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,830
And, heck, I'm an American.

406
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,434
I pay my taxes.

407
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,590
You want to take a look?

408
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:10,119
It's gas-operated, air-cooled, 
shoots 725 rounds per minute.

409
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,317
Okay.

410
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,710
Jeez.

411
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,113
You should have told
me it was so heavy.

412
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,910
Is it okay?
No, Lester, it's not okay! You...

413
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,115
Here.

414
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,511
You broke the darn...

415
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,319
Why are you such a GD screw-up?

416
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,470
Hey, now.

417
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,392
Ever since you were...

418
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,470
And now Kitty.

419
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,758
She said she talked to Pearl last week
and she's had it...

420
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,035
your wife.

421
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,591
Said you'd been acting plain weird,
just moping around.

422
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,677
Said she caught you
standing in the bathroom

423
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,434
with your toothbrush
in your hand just looking in the mirror.

424
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,758
Said foam was coming
out of your mouth like a rabid dog.

425
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,676
Come on. That's... not how
I may or may not be feeling.

426
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,353
And for your information,

427
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,875
I hadn't had a lot of sleep
the night before.

428
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,679
So... so... so, the toothpaste,
that was just nothing...

429
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,672
Did you really trip
on the ice and break your nose?

430
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,116
Yeah. Yes.

431
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,351
I... I told you,
outside the fire station.

432
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,352
You know they run the hoses
and wash the trucks,

433
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,274
and it gets all
slippery and wet.

434
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,795
You know, guys at work,

435
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,877
they talk about how they look 
up to their brothers...

436
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,114
their older brothers.

437
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,433
Sometimes I tell
people you're dead.

438
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,157
I mean, heck, Lester,
you're 40 years old.

439
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,799
When are you gonna
get your act together?

440
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,270
Your own brother?

441
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,391
You didn't have to hit him.

442
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,951
I mean, seriously, what is the 
matter with you?

443
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,639
Your own brother!

444
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,159
Yeah, it's one more...
Yes, one more time.

445
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,720
Before the 17th?

446
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,280
Do you need this
to look like an accident?

447
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,071
Figure it out
and call me back.

448
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,796
Realty.

449
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,996
<i>It's me.</i>

450
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,152
St. Paul, your call was
expected yesterday.

451
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,158
I got delayed.

452
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,197
<i>Problems?</i>

453
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,158
Car trouble. It's fixed now.

454
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,436
But you finished the assignment?

455
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,239
<i>Of course.</i>

456
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,437
And when can they
expect you in Duluth?

457
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,432
<i>The new client
is anxious to begin.</i>

458
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,274
Soon. I took a detour.

459
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,477
And the nature of this detour?

460
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,079
It's personal. 
Shouldn't be more than a day or two.

461
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,000
<i>I'll let Duluth know.</i>

462
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,799
All right.

463
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,639
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
big fella.

464
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,878
Oh, yeah.

465
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,839
Yeah... that's good.

466
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,278
Yeah? Yup?

467
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,230
Mmm.

468
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,470
Yeah?

469
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,474
Jeez. Where?

470
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,478
Okay.

471
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,199
Pick me up, huh?

472
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,359
Gotta go?
Mmm.

473
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,000
Homicide.

474
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,833
Molly's coming to get me.

475
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,515
Go back to sleep, hon.

476
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,592
Love you.
Love you, too.

477
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,516
Thanks.

478
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,716
Ida sleeping?

479
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,916
Yep.

480
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,075
What do you want me
to write for cause of death?

481
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,629
Put "self-explanatory."

482
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,677
You okay there, Bill?

483
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,035
Oh, yeah.

484
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,952
Threw up a bit ago.

485
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,157
Not in here, I hope.
Oh, no...

486
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,755
went out to the parking lot.

487
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,672
Wife made spaghetti for dinner.

488
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,480
Seemed a shame to barf it up.

489
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,152
I'm okay now...
so long as I don't look.

490
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,519
Heck.

491
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,711
That's Sam Hess.

492
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,752
Hess that owns
the trucking company?

493
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,072
Yeah, with the two boys.
Both dumb as a dog's foot.

494
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,800
Hold on.

495
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,600
Isn't Hess tied to
that syndicate of fellas out of Fargo...

496
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,080
gunrunners and such?

497
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,038
So they say.

498
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,191
Never seen the proof.

499
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,599
Well, jeez, you...

500
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,670
I mean, you think this could be,

501
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,877
like, an organized crime thing?

502
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,394
You know, a hit or the like?

503
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,795
I don't know what I think yet...

504
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,315
except I was warm in
bed half an hour ago.

505
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,350
How many times
I got to tell you?

506
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,875
You can't just
take the sheets off of one bed

507
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,110
and stick 'em on another.

508
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,236
It's unsanitary.

509
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,994
I shake 'em out first.

510
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,470
You don't have the sense
God gave a clam, do you?

511
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,319
Go shovel the walk.

512
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,077
I need a room.
Just you?

513
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,360
Pardon?
Is it just for you, the room?

514
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,669
What difference does that make?

515
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,399
It's a different
rate for two.

516
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,871
And if you got pets,
dog, cat, it's an extra 10 bucks.

517
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,360
What if I got a fish?

518
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,511
Excuse me?

519
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,637
Would a fish cost me $10?

520
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,639
Or what if I kept
spiders or mice?

521
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,200
What if I had bacteria?

522
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,351
Sir, bacteria are not pets.

523
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,715
Could be.

524
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,759
Sir, perhaps you'd
be happier in a different motel?

525
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,360
I just want to know the policy.

526
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,638
You see, I'm a student
of institutions.

527
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,436
Sir, do you have
a pet or not?

528
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,233
No, it's just me.

529
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,391
Why do you let her
talk to you like that?

530
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,392
She's not that bad.

531
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,154
Son, she compared
you to a clam.

532
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,834
Well, what should I do?

533
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,879
A guy insulted me once.

534
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,078
I pissed in his gas tank.

535
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,516
Car never drove straight again.

536
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,874
<i>Leroy's Motor Inn.</i>

537
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,596
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,157
I'm looking out my window,
and there's a young fellow

539
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,950
urinating in the gas
tank of a red Cavalier.

540
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,713
<i>Son of a--</i>

541
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,431
Hey!

542
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,318
You little...

543
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,190
Warm you up, hon?

544
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,634
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

545
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,710
Looking at?

546
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,314
Murder file.

547
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,835
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

548
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,640
Sam Hess got himself killed 
last night over at the Lucky Penny.

549
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,154
You don't say.

550
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,959
Knife in the head.

551
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,073
You didn't hear that from me.

552
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,837
Hey there, Molly. Lou.

553
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,149
Coffee?
Sure.

554
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,356
Eggs over medium?

555
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,516
Won't say no.

556
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,319
How's the leg?

557
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,638
Goes from my ass to
the ground just like the other.

558
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,313
Thinking of doing some
ice fishing this weekend.

559
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,629
Sorry to hear it.

560
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,439
Interested?
No, sir.

561
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,910
The only thing I ever
caught fishing in winter was a cold.

562
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,360
Say, Chief, listen,
I been thinking

563
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,432
about that fella
in the snow with the underpants.

564
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,193
Mmm-hmm.
Something odd about that.

565
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,114
You're saying other than the fact 
he was just wearing panties?

566
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,999
Yeah. See, we know from the wreck 
that whoever was driving

567
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,594
cracked their head on the 
steering wheel, right?

568
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,512
But the fella in the snow...
No head injury.

569
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,590
Yeah, so you see--

570
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,871
That's some good police work there,
Deputy.

571
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,679
Oh. Thanks.

572
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,150
But if he's not the driver,
I guess we gotta ask...

573
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,079
who is he?

574
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,719
Ran his prints, nothing.

575
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,678
Plus, it turns out
the car was stolen.

576
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,910
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

577
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,116
Yeah,
over in Grand Forks.

578
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,716
I called the local PD.
I'm just waiting on a callback.

579
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,071
Any thoughts
there on Hess?

580
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,396
No, not as such.

581
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
The, um...
lady that Hess was with

582
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,154
didn't get a good look
at the fella who killed him

583
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,913
on account of all the blood in
her eyes, but...

584
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,912
you know, we're checking
the knife for prints.

585
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,117
Also, Bill's going
around to local stores

586
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,193
to see if maybe the knife
was bought here in Bemidji.

587
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,557
You'll make
a good chief one day.

588
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,036
Me?

589
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,476
What about Bill?
He's got seniority.

590
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,196
Bill cleans his gun
with bubble bath.

591
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,600
No, it'll be you...

592
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,637
if you want.

593
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,435
When you talk to the
police, just keep it simple.

594
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,591
Thanks but no thanks,
in other words.

595
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,114
I've already
talked to Fargo,

596
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,759
and they want to
deal with this themselves.

597
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,954
They're sending guys.

598
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,554
Deal with what?

599
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,394
He was in a whorehouse.

600
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,880
I'm glad he's dead.

601
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,474
Ma, don't talk like that.

602
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,677
Yeah,
Ma, don't talk like that.

603
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,672
Makes me live in the North Pole,

604
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,229
and then he's got the nerve to...

605
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,630
I'm not kidding.

606
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,951
I'm gonna sing at his funeral.

607
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,510
Mmm-hmm.

608
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,790
Mr. Mickey,
you have a phone call.

609
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,070
She said me, you doofus.

610
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,633
Can I come?
No.

611
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,758
Jeez! Just stay
here with Ma.

612
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,878
Hello.
<i>Mickey?</i>

613
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,158
Louis Grossman,
your dad's estate attorney.

614
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,230
First of all...

615
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,114
I'd like to say
how sorry I am for your loss.

616
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,873
Okay.

617
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,191
<i>Next thing is...</i>

618
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm responsible for
overseeing the dispersal

619
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,470
of your dad's vast estate.

620
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,550
You mean the money?

621
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,756
<i>Right.</i>

622
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,837
Money, real estate, holdings,
automobiles and...

623
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,032
Well, there's no delicate
way to put this.

624
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,318
The will was very clear.

625
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,030
Your dad decided to give everything 
to your younger brother Moe.

626
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,349
Are you kidding?

627
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,760
<i>I know it's hard to hear...</i>

628
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,470
but the will was very specific.

629
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,719
Quote, I leave the entirety of
my vast estate

630
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,635
to my second-born
and favorite son Moe.

631
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,560
<i>That's sweet.</i>

632
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,155
<i>He must have
really loved that boy.</i>

633
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,873
Anyway, that's it.

634
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,237
Once again,
I'm sorry for your loss.

635
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,279
If you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to call me.

636
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,558
Well, like I said, Mrs. Hess, 
we're checking some things on our end,

637
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,074
but if there's anything
you could tell us

638
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,435
about your husband's business...

639
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,193
I appreciate the visit, Chief,

640
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,193
but Mrs. Hess had no kind of 
involvement with Sam's business.

641
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,237
Frankly, she's mystified.

642
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,119
Her husband being a pillar of
the community and all.

643
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,236
I mean, heck,

644
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,154
voted Bemidji Businessman of the Year,
1996 and '98.

645
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,515
Who... who was it?

646
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,750
I'll tell you there.

647
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,354
Yeah.

648
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,591
Like I said, it's a puzzler.

649
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,558
'Course, we both
know some of your boys

650
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,438
have had run-ins with
the law in the past.

651
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,591
Stolen merchandise
charges and the like.

652
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,956
And, you know,
the Staties had that case

653
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,480
as to maybe your
outfit's got ties

654
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,792
to that crime
syndicate out of Fargo.

655
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,270
You're gonna stand here...
Let me get this straight.

656
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,430
You're gonna stand here

657
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,240
and call the victim a criminal in 
front of his wife, his kids?

658
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,277
Well, now, no one's calling
anyone a criminal.

659
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,431
Just trying to figure
out what happened.

660
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,036
Chief! 217! 217!

661
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,560
What the heck?

662
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,396
Heya, Lester.

663
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,880
Hiya, Bo.

664
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,429
Jeez, what happened
to your face there?

665
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,313
You know that spot
near the fire station?

666
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,516
Where they wash the trucks?

667
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,590
Yep.

668
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,718
Slipped on the ice.

669
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,794
Say, Lester, I need you to
pull the file on Sam Hess.

670
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,718
On who now?

671
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,838
Sam Hess. You know, owns the truck
depot over on Winslow.

672
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,957
You know, big fella.

673
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,639
Yeah, well, he's dead.

674
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,795
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

675
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,917
Shame. It's a big policy.

676
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,469
Murder, they're saying.
Stabbed to death is what I heard.

677
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,234
You okay there, Lester?

678
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,158
Sure.

679
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,436
Sure... You know
I went to high school with him?

680
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,550
You don't say.

681
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,030
Well, anyway, I need you
to pull the policy on that.

682
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,476
I have to get on the phone
with his wife later.

683
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,030
Uh...

684
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,320
Did you...

685
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,675
Jeez.
Did you really kill him? Sam?

686
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,911
Oh, my God.

687
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,434
Is Sam dead?

688
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,949
How do you feel about that?

689
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,713
Well, I mean...

690
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,635
of course, it's...
you know, a tragedy.

691
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,949
Well, why'd you kill him then?

692
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,514
Now hold on a second!

693
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,670
I never--

694
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,956
Well, actually, you did.

695
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,599
Remember, yes or no?

696
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,239
I never said yes.

697
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,356
Didn't say no.

698
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,278
No, that won't-- Come on.

699
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,714
That...
In a court of law--

700
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,439
Who said anything
about a court of law?

701
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,510
Look, I just mean...

702
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,399
I... Jeez.

703
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,110
And he had a wife,
you know, and those boys.

704
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,715
Lester, he put you in a 
barrel and rolled you on the road.

705
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,320
Your problem is you spent your 
whole life thinking there are rules.

706
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,596
There aren't.

707
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,637
We used to be gorillas.

708
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,952
All we had is what
we could take and defend.

709
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,112
The truth is you're more of a man 
today than you were yesterday.

710
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,319
How do you figure?

711
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,551
It's a red tide, Lester,
this life of ours.

712
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,831
The shit they make us eat...

713
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,679
day after day,

714
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,073
the boss, the wife,
et cetera, wearing us down.

715
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,516
If you don't stand up to it,

716
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,356
let 'em know you're still an 
ape deep down, where it counts.

717
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,035
You're just gonna
get washed away.

718
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,791
Phone call, Chief.
It's the wife.

719
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,870
Hey, hon.
<i>White.</i>

720
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,519
White, what?

721
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,314
I decided we're gonna
paint the nursery white.

722
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,436
<i>It's already white.</i>

723
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,315
Well...
I want to paint it again.

724
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,313
The baby's room should have a new coat,
don't you think?

725
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,920
I do.

726
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,116
Any particular shade?

727
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,714
What do you mean?

728
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,838
Well, you got your
bright white, your snow white...

729
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,320
Eggshell.

730
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,877
Right, there's eggshell.

731
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,156
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

732
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,230
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

733
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,310
<i>Why don't I stop
by the hardware</i>

734
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,390
<i>and pick up some
different shades</i>

735
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,516
and we'll figure
it out tonight?

736
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,319
We're having a baby, Vern.

737
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,039
<i>That's true.</i>

738
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,999
No, I mean it's
finally sinking in.

739
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,070
We're gonna have a baby.

740
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,914
I can't wait.

741
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,673
I'll see you soon.

742
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,240
Is there anything else
you need there?

743
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,957
Nope, I'm good.

744
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,759
<i>Come in, Chief.</i>

745
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,240
This is Vern. Go ahead.

746
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,595
<i>Chief,
I'm over at the hospital.</i>

747
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,672
<i>I was checking on
the Hess boy and--</i>

748
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,796
How is he?

749
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,998
<i>You know, broken collarbone.
Got his bell rung pretty good.</i>

750
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,435
That's a shame.
<i>Yeah.</i>

751
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,433
Hey, so I got to
talking to Sue Roundtree

752
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,910
and I asked her if they 
had any head injuries lately,

753
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,117
you know, my theory about
the driver and the wreck,

754
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,556
and she says they did...
yesterday.

755
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,832
<i>Real peculiar fella, she says.
Real intense.</i>

756
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,115
<i>And here's where
it gets interesting.</i>

757
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,112
'Cause she says the fella with
the head injury

758
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,034
was talking to another fella
about Sam Hess.

759
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,480
Yeah?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

760
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,472
Says the two was
thick as thieves.

761
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,472
So suddenly I'm thinking
maybe these two cases,

762
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,789
maybe they're connected, huh?

763
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,592
Could be.

764
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,717
She say who
the other fella was?

765
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,996
<i>Lester Nygaard.</i>

766
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,110
Really?

767
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,910
You know him?

768
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,269
<i>Sure, I know Lester.</i>

769
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,151
Sells insurance
over at Bo's shop.

770
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,277
Yeah, yeah, I called over
and they're closed,

771
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,000
so I was gonna go
by Lester's place.

772
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,037
<i>No, I know Lester.
I'll do it.</i>

773
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,196
You call it a day.
Good work.

774
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,313
Lester?

775
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,710
In the basement.

776
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,036
Whatcha doing, hon?

777
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,192
I'm... trying to
fix the darn thing.

778
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,159
It looks like
the motor mount broke.

779
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,038
You sure you know
what you're doing?

780
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,919
It seems pretty
straightforward.

781
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,992
So, you want to
give her a try?

782
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,958
There's nothing in it.

783
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,316
For a test, I'm saying.

784
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,834
Turn it off.

785
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,600
Turn it off!

786
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,871
You killed it.

787
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,071
You killed my washing machine.
No, I was--

788
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,597
It was the...
the tide, you know?

789
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,435
I was standing up to the--
I was...

790
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,398
I was being a man.

791
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,594
But you're not
a man, Lester.

792
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,715
You're not even half a man.

793
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,514
Honestly, I don't know what 
got into me marrying you.

794
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,278
My mom said,
"Don't do it, Pearl."

795
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,831
She said, "He's the kind of boy
that loses all the time.

796
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,357
"And you know what those boys 
grow up to be, don't you? Losers."

797
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,190
Take that back.

798
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,510
Or what?
What are you gonna do?

799
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,110
You can't even face me
when we're having sex.

800
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,156
Now, hold on!

801
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,152
That is you not facing me!

802
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,516
That's so I can
picture a real man.

803
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,590
Oh!

804
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,671
You take that back.

805
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,798
Or what?
What are you gonna do?

806
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,870
Oh.

807
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,475
You gonna hit me?

808
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,310
That's a--

809
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,950
Oh.

810
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,596
Oh, jeez.

811
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,995
Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

812
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,796
Oh, God.

813
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,110
Oh, God.

814
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,073
Yeah, it's me.

815
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,277
You gotta help me out.
I've done something bad.

816
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,760
<i>Leroy's Motor Inn.</i>

817
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,470
Hi. Can...
can I have Room 23 please?

818
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,074
<i>Yeah?</i>
Yeah.

819
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,756
Yeah, it's... it's...
it's me. It's Lester.

820
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,071
She's... My wife...
my wife, she's...

821
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,480
Oh, hell!

822
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,594
Look, I think I...

823
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,195
She's in the basement
dead and...

824
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,354
Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.

825
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,591
<i>Lester, have you
been a bad boy?</i>

826
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,119
Jeez.

827
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,240
Yeah, I took the hammer and...

828
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,440
Look, can you come over?
I'm on Willow Creek Drive, number 613.

829
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,716
Please! Please?

830
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,159
<i>Sure, Lester.
I'll be right there.</i>

831
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,755
Thank you. Thank you!

832
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,880
Here we go.

833
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,558
What did you do?

834
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,271
You killed her!

835
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,320
What did you do?

836
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,959
You killed her.

837
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,993
You killed her.

838
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,950
Evening, Lester.

839
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,470
It's supposed to get down to 
negative 10 tonight, I hear.

840
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,712
Is Pearl home?
No.

841
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,190
No, she's at my brother's.

842
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,436
Okay, then.

843
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,918
How's the nose?

844
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,719
This...

845
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,996
It hurts.

846
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,554
How'd it happen, anyway?

847
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,233
Slipped, over by
the fire station.

848
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,119
You go to the hospital?

849
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,520
Yeah, they set it.

850
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,478
You talk to anyone
while you were there?

851
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,670
What do you mean?

852
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,393
Well, the reason I'm here...

853
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,630
I'm not sure you heard.

854
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,195
Sam Hess got killed
last night at the Lucky Penny.

855
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,000
Nasty business.
Yeah.

856
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,275
And, well...

857
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,319
I heard you were talking to another 
fella about Hess before he died...

858
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,199
over at the hospital.

859
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,396
No, I don't think so.

860
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,871
What was his name again...
the other fella?

861
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,878
You okay, Lester?
You seem a bit... seem a bit jumpy.

862
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,680
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it's just, you know...

863
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,832
Pearl is gonna be
home soon and...

864
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,879
Lester, listen to
me very carefully.

865
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,270
I need you to get
down on the ground.

866
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,430
Wait just a second.

867
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,590
Lester, on the ground!

868
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,955
This is not
what it looks like.

869
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,520
Now, hold on. Hold on.

870
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,717
Don't...
don't go down there.

871
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,473
Don't...
There's nothing down--

872
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,029
That's not-- I didn't do nothing.
I didn't... I just got home.

873
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,191
I just got home and...
There's nothing down there.

874
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,913
That's not-- I
didn't do nothing.

875
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,320
I didn't do nothing!
I didn't do nothing!

876
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,710
I just came home.
I just came home.

877
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,954
This is Chief Thurman.
I'm at 613 Willow Creek Drive.

878
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,072
Requesting back up.
613 Willow Creek--

879
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,789
<i>Chief?</i>

880
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,240
<i>Chief?</i>

881
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,636
<i>Chief?</i>

882
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,195
Any more?

883
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,433
Lester, are there
any more cops?

884
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,075
Mmm-mmm.

885
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,432
What did you tell him?

886
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,000
Nothing.

887
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,117
He... he asked about Sam.

888
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,120
You got any more shells for this thing?
No.

889
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,794
Is that the basement?

890
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,950
Mmm.

891
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,150
Jeez.

892
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,915
The police are here.

893
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,550
I said the police are here!
What do we do?

894
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,752
Officer down.

895
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,911
613 Willow Creek Drive.

896
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,271
<i>Roger that. 
Confirming code 3.</i>

897
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,516
Bemidji Police!

898
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,670
Oh, my God.

899
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,436
<i>All units,</i>

900
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,912
<i>officer in need of immediate 
assistance at 613 Willow Creek Drive.</i>

901
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,114
Bemidji Police!

902
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,319
If there's someone in the house, 
come out with your hands up.

903
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,391
Molly!

904
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,834
Down here!

905
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,119
Husband's alive.

906
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,670
Oh, jeez!

907
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,590
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

908
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,520
Yeah, Dad here.
Come back.

909
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,000
<i>Vikings up by 13. Over.</i>

910
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,520
What happened? Over.

911
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,434
<i>Kicked in another
field goal. Over.</i>

912
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,036
Sweet.
You brush your teeth? Over.

913
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,271
<i>Yeah. Over.</i>

914
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,795
Homework? Over.

915
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,436
<i>Did my math and science. I still have 
to do English. Over.</i>

916
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,239
Okay. Well, as soon
as the game's over.

917
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,437
Over.

918
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,756
Evening, Officer.

919
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,360
Evening.

920
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,478
License and registration,
please.

921
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,710
We could do it that way.

922
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,232
You ask me for my papers,

923
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,279
I tell you it's not my car,
that I borrowed it,

924
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,637
see where things
go from there.

925
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,200
We could do that...

926
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,198
or you could go get in your car
and drive away.

927
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,479
Now, why would I do that?

928
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,229
Because some roads
you shouldn't go down.

929
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,711
Because maps used to say,
"There be dragons here."

930
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,634
Now they don't.

931
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,320
But that don't mean
the dragons aren't there.

932
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,074
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

933
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,431
You step out of the car,
please, sir?

934
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,198
How old's your kid?

935
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,034
I said, step out of the car.

936
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,157
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

937
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:07,076
Let me tell you what's going to happen,
Officer Grimly.

938
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,832
I'm going to roll my window up.

939
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,834
Then I'm gonna drive away
and you're gonna go home to your daughter,

940
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,910
and every few years,

941
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,754
you're gonna look at
her face and know that you're alive

942
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:23,198
because you chose not to go
down a certain road on a certain night,

943
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,035
that you chose to walk into the 
light instead of into the darkness.

944
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,797
Do you understand me?

945
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,272
Sir.

946
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,632
I'm rolling up my window.

947
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,720
<i>Dad, come in, Dad. Over.</i>

948
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,193
<i>Dad...</i>

949
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,431
<i>are you there? Over.</i>

950
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,670
So, I got two kinds of sandwiches.
Tuna and turkey.

951
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,750
Tuna's for the fish...

952
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,558
unless you think
they'd think that's cannibalism.

953
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,637
You know, I've been looking for 
more help in the restaurant.

954
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,680
You know, someone to seat customers 
and answer the phone.

955
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,515
A hostess?

956
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,557
Is that what they call it?
Yeah.

957
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,997
Anyway...

958
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,756
not sure if that's something 
you might be interested in.

959
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,471
I'm a police officer, Dad.

960
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,119
Well, sure, I know that.

961
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,953
I also know that
people in this world

962
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,475
are... less inclined
to shoot a hostess

963
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,472
than, say,
an officer of the law.

964
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,914
That's true.

965
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,799
So, that mean you're gonna help
your old man out?

966
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,830
Nope.

967
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,313
But maybe you could
put that in the ad.

968
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:14,515
Listen, on second thought,
I think I'm gonna head into work.

969
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,910
Rain check on the fishing?

970
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,678
Sounds good.

971
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,036
Love you, Dad.

972
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,635
Love you too, hon.
