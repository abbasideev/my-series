1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,038
<i>Precedently on</i> Fargo...

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,720
Who?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,950
Fargo!

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,799
Freeze!
Police officer!

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,280
Halt!

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,751
That cop, the female,
says you are a suspect.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,870
Suspect of what?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,993
<i>For Pearl,
the Chief...
even Sam Hess.</i>

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,636
<i>If you want this to go away,
you gotta give 'em someone.</i>

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,116
<i>It's good waffles,
hon.</i>

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,314
<i>It's a mix.</i>

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,154
<i>Who's ready for seconds?</i>

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,870
<i>- Gordo?
- Yeah.</i>

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,151
<i>- Watcha doing there?
- Reading a comic.</i>

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,153
<i>It's breakfast time,
though. It's supposed to
be family time.</i>

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,232
<i>Yeah, put your
comic away, huh?</i>

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,913
<i>- One more page.
- That's not...</i>

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,913
<i>It's breakfast, mister,
family time.</i>

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,395
<i>You heard your mother.</i>

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,233
<i>700 to 1,000
people are without power...</i>

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,755
Your mom needs
help after school.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,990
Got hockey.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,434
After hockey, then.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,920
I'm supposed to
play with Kevin.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,435
Well, you can play
with Kevin tomorrow.

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,840
It's time you learned
some responsibility.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,520
<i>...thousands of fish
fell from the sky.</i>
Oh, hon, listen to this.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,429
<i>Meteorologists are saying
the incident was probably
caused by a tornado,</i>

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,356
<i>which sucked up water
and fish from a lake and
dropped them off miles away.</i>

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,200
<i>And we'll have more
on this developing news
story a little later tonight,</i>

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,192
<i>along with our
meteorologist's take on
exactly what happened...</i>

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,357
The darndest thing.
Come on, bud,
get your boots on.

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,119
You don't wanna be
late for the bus.

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,270
Kiss, kiss.
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,795
<i>...crews are out in force
this morning, and will be
working around the clock</i>

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,200
<i>to keep roads as
clear as possible.</i>
Love you.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,640
- And me?
- Dad.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,791
<i>...as cleanup continues
on what reporters are calling</i>

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,951
<i>the storm of the century.</i>

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,269
<i>Plow drivers have
been working</i>

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,558
<i>for 24 hours straight
without rest and
feel exhausted.</i>

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,199
<i>We spoke to
one earlier today...</i>

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,635
No funny stuff today.

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,072
So then, Neo's like,
"I'm the One,"

45
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,833
and Agent
What's-his-name is like...

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,832
"The sound
of inevitability."
Yeah.

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,991
And he's got him, right?
Around the neck.

48
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,753
You're hurting me a little.
Don't be such a baby.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,996
Guys.

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,595
So they're on the
tracks, right?
And the train's coming.

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,552
And Neo says,
"No way." And he...

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,390
Uh...

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,720
So we're in the room
with the stripper, yeah?

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,396
And Blackman
wants to know
how much for a blumkin.

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,032
Which, I'm like...
"What the heck is that?"

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,315
Blackman.
Yeah.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,711
So he says, you know,
"Why not stick around
and find out?"

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,916
And I'm like...

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,832
<i>Mr. Nygaard,
your wife is on one.</i>

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,320
Yeah,
I'll call her back.

61
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,039
<i>Oh, no,
she said it's urgent.</i>

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,716
Yeah, hon.

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,359
<i>Chaz,
the cops are here.</i>

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,159
<i>Gordo's been arrested
and the cops are here.</i>

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,276
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,789
What do you mean
the cops are there?
<i>In the house.</i>

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,236
<i>They think that
Gordo brought
a gun to school.</i>

68
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,595
<i>And they're tearing up
the house.</i>

69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
<i>They say they got
a search warrant.</i>

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,710
Don't... Don't let them.
I... I'll be right there.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,598
Just...
I'll be right there!

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,070
<i>Chaz, what have you done?</i>
I'm coming! I'm on my way!

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,316
<i>Chaz?</i>

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,590
Now...

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,114
Wait, hold on!

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,357
Hold on a minute What?

77
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,272
You son of a bitch!
He's my baby!

78
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,790
No, I got...
I got permits for those.
You son of a bitch!

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,758
Now, Bill Oswalt,
hold on...

80
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,759
Son of a bitch!

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,834
I can explain that. I...

82
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,954
What have you done?

83
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,913
What have you done?

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,919
You son of a bitch!

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,320
I hate you.

86
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,830
Hey. Bill...

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,594
Busy morning, huh?

88
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,152
Is there...

89
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,391
some kind of development
with the case?

90
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,709
Is that why I'm...

91
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,280
Where's the female deputy?

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,635
She got shot, Lester.

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,356
She got...
In Duluth.

94
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,999
I should be up
there right now,

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,351
but then there's
this mess.

96
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,193
I don't even know
where to start.

97
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,797
It's like... When you see
on the news...
A boat sinks in India

98
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,320
and 300 people drown.

99
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,996
And you ask yourself,
"Do I know 300 people?"

100
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,313
Or one of those
African massacres with
12 year-olds with machetes.

101
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,629
And they kill,
You can't even...

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,712
you can't even
count that high.

103
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,113
We lost 16 people in
1920 to the flu.
I looked it up.

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,954
In '78, six people died
in a pharmacy fire.

105
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,793
But nothing
like this, ever.

106
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,277
Three people murdered
in two days,

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
including the
Chief of Police...

108
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,513
Lenny Potts missing...

109
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,276
and a cop shot.
And now a kid brings
a gun to school.

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,236
A kid?

111
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,959
It was Gordo, Lester.

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,039
Gordo? My Gordo?

113
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,955
He had a handgun
in his backpack.
Unloaded, thank gosh.

114
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,000
But still, you can't
Not with the
current climate.

115
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,230
Is he in trouble?

116
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,314
Is he... He brought
a gun to school!

117
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,155
And still,
Gordo's the least of this.
We searched the house.

118
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,514
And, Lester,
I gotta tell ya,
I don't know whether to...

119
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,910
After all these years,

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,072
I'd like to think
that you could've...
come to me.

121
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,436
You could've trusted me
as a friend with...

122
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,840
We know you were
in the room when
Vern was shot.

123
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,992
You had a shotgun pellet
in your hand,
same as killed Vern.

124
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,476
Was your wife
having an affair?

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
With Chaz?

126
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,230
Mmm-hmm.

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,510
We found a photo...
photos...

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,195
at his place...
suggestive...

129
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,396
I don't wanna
talk about...

130
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,676
...boudoir photos
and a pair of...

131
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,036
Bill...
Yeah. And I know...

132
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,318
I know how much
you loved her.
I remember.

133
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,393
Ninth grade science class,
Mrs. Nagutuck...

134
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,755
Pearl walks in the
first day of class

135
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,519
and sits down
and you look at me...

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,910
"I'm gonna marry
that girl one day."

137
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,240
But she was always...

138
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,397
I know this is
out of line, but...

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,153
we all heard the stories.

140
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,790
But to sleep with
your own brother?
I know.

141
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,600
God! Your own brother!

142
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,320
And what then?
She tells him
it's over and he...

143
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,756
We all know your
brother had a temper.

144
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,956
He broke a guy's
nose once just

145
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,838
for cracking wise
at the state fair.

146
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,072
Yeah! I remember.
He had to do
community service.

147
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,477
So what?
She cuts it off,
the affair, and then he...

148
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,598
All I know is that I
came home from work

149
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,837
and they were arguing
in the basement.

150
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,116
I heard the voices.
I thought, "Is that Chaz?"

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,919
And so I went
over to the top

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,400
of the stairs to hear,
you know.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,559
And she says...

154
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,190
Uh...

155
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,637
"Love? Is that what
you think this is?"
Or something like that.

156
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,279
And she laughs.

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,195
And then she says,

158
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,920
"You know,
you're not half the
man your brother is."

159
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,277
Then I hear
this sound. This...

160
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,476
I'll never forget it.
So... Um...

161
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,079
...I run downstairs and...

162
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,309
...there's Chaz.
And he's got the hammer...

163
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,234
And he looks up
at me and says,
"Oh, geez, Lester.

164
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,350
"What did I..."

165
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm upset.

166
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,991
I try to get to Pearl,
you know,
to check if she's...

167
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,754
And Chaz says to me,
"Lester, this was
an accident."

168
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,471
And I'm... "An accident?"
He hit her with a hammer.

169
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,277
And... he raises up
the hammer again.
He's still looking at me.

170
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,591
I don't know if
he's gonna... or what.

171
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,880
So I say, something like,
"Chaz, what the heck..."

172
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,360
And the doorbell rings.

173
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,189
Vern?
Mmm-hmm.

174
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,320
I wanted to say
something, Bill.
I swear.

175
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,397
But Chaz,
you know, he's...

176
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,716
You were afraid?
Oh, I was afraid.

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,278
And Chaz is my
only brother.

178
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,514
So then what happens?
So then we go upstairs...

179
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,475
and Chaz says,
"Take care of it."

180
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,233
And he goes in the back.

181
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,158
Where you
kept the shotgun.
Where I kept the shotgun.

182
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,391
I should have thought
about the shotgun.
I know, I know.

183
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,597
But I... I was in shock.

184
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,991
So I let Vern in,
and right away,
I think to tell him,

185
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,275
to say what's happened.

186
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,113
Because Pearl
could still be
alive downstairs,

187
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,920
there might still be
time to...

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,471
And then Chaz comes
in with the shotgun.

189
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,230
I should've stopped him.

190
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,591
I should've said
right away...

191
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,592
"Chaz is in the
house and he's..."

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,473
But I was afraid,
like you said.

193
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,720
And now...
And now, it's...

194
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,032
Bill, if you think that
makes me guilty
of something, then...

195
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,955
Oh, I want you to throw
the book at me.
Put me in jail.

196
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,757
'Cause I loved her,
you know, Pearl.
Despite all...

197
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,829
She was...

198
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,475
She was my wife.

199
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,192
Lester? Lester!

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,559
Lester, what did you do?

201
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,712
Lester!

202
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,394
Lester!

203
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,033
Freeze!
Police officer!

204
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,234
Halt!

205
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,354
She's awake.

206
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,470
Hey.

207
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,269
What happened?

208
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,397
Um, you got shot.

209
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,952
Just go outside
now, okay?
Why?

210
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,350
Just do it.

211
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,989
Did we get him?
Who?

212
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,150
Malvo.

213
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,275
I had him and...

214
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,631
Till this other
fella popped up.

215
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,790
Um...

216
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,914
Look now,
I gotta tell you
something.

217
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,277
Do you know what
happened to
the fella I shot?

218
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,680
Is he...

219
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,511
He's... They got him
upstairs...
in Intensive.

220
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,319
I shot him twice.

221
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,033
Just like they
teach you...

222
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,430
center mass.

223
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,757
And him with
a bazooka.

224
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,200
How the heck
did I do that?

225
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,720
'Cause you're you.

226
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,273
Look, here's the...

227
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,636
Uh...

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,150
I shot you.

229
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,512
Well, that don't
make sense.

230
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,312
You... you ran off.

231
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,552
And I couldn't see
anything, you know?
I mean...

232
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,836
not that that's any...

233
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,391
There's... there's no
excuse for it,
for what I did.

234
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,550
You were out there...

235
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,150
alone, needing
back up and I...

236
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,754
What'd I lose?

237
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,070
A spleen.

238
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,150
Oh...

239
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,673
I'll get you a new one,
I swear.

240
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,592
Yeah, you better.

241
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,356
There's gonna
be an inquiry.

242
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,194
I... I was too shook up
at the scene to...

243
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,920
but... I'll...

244
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,838
I'll confess.

245
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,115
They'll probably
take my badge,

246
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,799
but with all
that's happened,

247
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,752
that's likely best.
So...

248
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,434
Come on now.

249
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,479
You said yourself it was...

250
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,791
a blizzard and
whiteout conditions.

251
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,036
And I...

252
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,191
I could have shot you
just as easy.

253
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,273
I... I've just been
messing things up
from the go.

254
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,880
Hey, now.

255
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,474
That's enough of that.

256
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,195
You want some pop
or something...

257
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,193
No, but I want a new spleen,
that's... what I want.

258
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,473
So... you know...
you better get
cracking, mister.

259
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,876
Dad... who's watching
the restaurant?

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,753
Screw the
damn restaurant.

261
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,154
I guess we both got
bullet holes now, huh?

262
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,676
You got premium channels?

263
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,999
I'm not sure.
I just woke up.

264
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,958
<i>...this work that
is extremely difficult.</i>

265
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,633
<i>The bark beetle carries
the worm to its nest.</i>

266
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,150
<i>He shoots,
he scores!</i>

267
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,674
Gophers are playing.

268
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,512
If that's what you
wanna watch.

269
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,756
Ben Schmidt says
you put down a guy
with an assault rifle.

270
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,511
Well, he was
pointing it at me.

271
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

272
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,040
Proud of you.

273
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,790
Hmm...

274
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,634
All right.

275
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,631
<i>Cleaners?</i>
Hi. Yeah, I got...

276
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,632
<i>How you doin' there then?</i>

277
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,359
I'm real good now.
How are you?

278
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,518
<i>You know, can't complain.
Wife's got a bit of a cold,</i>

279
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,279
<i>but that's life, right?</i>
Sure.

280
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,876
Well, my house needs...

281
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,313
It's... I'm not gonna lie.
It's a real mess.

282
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,437
<i>That's our
bread and butter.</i>

283
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,432
Well, do you fellas
do crime scenes?

284
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,034
<i>Had a breakin, huh?</i>

285
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,550
Yeah, it's a little worse
than a breakin.

286
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,036
<i>A lot of broken glass or...</i>
I'd rather not get...

287
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,594
<i>Sometimes they
defecate in your...</i>

288
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,672
Oh, let's just say
there's a lot of blood.

289
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,560
Hello?

290
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,680
Good!

291
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,672
And twist!

292
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,594
And front!

293
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,514
And side!

294
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,273
And two...

295
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,910
and three and good!

296
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,474
Left arm.

297
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,190
And bend... bend...

298
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,350
bend.

299
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,436
Good!

300
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,633
- It's one story.
- One story...

301
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,437
So I notice you got
a pin on your map in
every state but Georgia.

302
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,637
What the hell do you got
against Georgia?

303
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,750
My first wife.

304
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,957
She was Korean.

305
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,754
She used to spit at me
when we had sex.

306
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,590
Can I sit?

307
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,434
Or... did you wanna
kill me standing?

308
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,437
Two <i>hombres</i> took
a run at me in Duluth.

309
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,034
Mexicans?

310
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,318
That's the wrong
part of the sentence
to be focusing on.

311
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,956
The point is,
they said Fargo
sent them.

312
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,269
So I have two questions.

313
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,510
First...

314
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,316
did you tell these boys
where to find me?

315
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,990
Second...

316
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,630
who do I see
about this in Fargo?

317
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,916
Look...
you know I can't...

318
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,719
Did you put them on me?

319
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,314
No. Of course not.

320
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,631
But you gotta
understand...

321
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,757
this is a business
of relationships.

322
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,230
I can't just...
Of relationships?

323
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,039
Right.

324
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,231
And... well...

325
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,840
it's not my position
professionally to get
involved in squabbles.

326
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,192
Especially not of
a private nature.

327
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,551
How do you
know it's private?

328
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,349
If people are unhappy
with our services...
they call.

329
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,871
A guy screws up,
arrangements are made...

330
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,593
a cash settlement.

331
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,118
If that's not enough,
he'd break a leg
or an arm.

332
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,759
But no calls...

333
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,957
not about you.

334
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,040
So whatever it is...

335
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,520
it's gotta be personal.

336
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,039
It doesn't matter.
It's the principle.

337
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,511
This one calls an ambulance.
That one calls a hearse.

338
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,273
I'm gonna ask you again.

339
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,834
And depending
on the answer...

340
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,640
I pick up this or that.

341
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,232
Who do I talk to in Fargo?

342
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,430
You remember me?

343
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,310
Um...

344
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,029
Dead.

345
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,996
Can...

346
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,519
Can you talk?
Speak, I mean.

347
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,230
Right.
But you...
you read lips?

348
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,675
Okay.

349
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,916
Okay.

350
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,352
You know I'm the one
who shot you, yeah?

351
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,992
Do you remember me
from before?

352
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,190
In Bemidji?

353
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,195
The insurance office.

354
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,759
You were talking to
Lester Nygaard.

355
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,953
It just hit me,
lying in bed thinking
about that...

356
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,110
what happened, you know.

357
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,035
Hold the phone,
I know that fella.

358
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,875
Did you come here
looking for Malvo?

359
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
For...

360
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,269
Lorne...

361
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,557
Malvo. Lorne Malvo?

362
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,030
Did Lester tell you
where to find him?

363
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,236
It hurts.
Yeah... mine, too.

364
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,392
You know, it's crazy.
I never shot anyone before.

365
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm gathering this wasn't
your first time, though.

366
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,674
Look at us.

367
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,000
And you got a dad
somewhere I bet,
just like me.

368
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,917
And I mean,
what's the point,
you know?

369
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,479
Because here you are and...
your friend is dead.

370
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,150
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life
in jail.

371
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,315
And for what?

372
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,996
Okay.

373
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,316
Okay, Mr. Nygaard.

374
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,960
I gotta ask you to stand
and put your back
to the bars.

375
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,475
Listen, Officer,
this is a huge mistake.

376
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,310
This is a setup.
Sir.

377
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,153
Do you understand?
Evidence has been
planted...

378
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,230
Sir, turn and back
towards me...

379
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,470
It's been falsified
and if I...

380
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,550
...or I'm gonna have
to tase you!

381
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,677
...could just talk to
my brother...

382
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,433
This is a nightmare.

383
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,670
You...

384
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,952
You gotta believe me.
I didn't do these things.

385
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,440
Not for me to say, sir.

386
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,710
Where are you...
Transfer to county.

387
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,753
You'll be there
until the trial...

388
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,679
or until you make bail.

389
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,880
Jeez, Lester.
Oh, hey.

390
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,993
I heard
you got arrested.

391
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,276
Well, you know how it is.
Had a few too many,

392
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,073
slept it off at
the station.

393
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,994
Who can blame you really...
after what you've
been through.

394
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

395
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,152
They were real
sweet to me.

396
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,152
I'm the victim here,
you know.

397
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,560
Of course.
So...

398
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,831
what's on the
agenda for today?

399
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,594
I'm ready to go...
you know... start fresh.

400
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,478
I... I can work
late even.

401
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,320
There's nothing at home
but an empty house. So...

402
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,272
Right. Well...

403
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,557
I was just about to
call the widow Hess.

404
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,711
Yeah, her claim's
been denied.

405
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,519
You don't say.
Yeah.

406
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,035
It seems Sam stopped
paying the premium.

407
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,913
A shame, really.

408
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,720
I mean, good for us.
That was a big policy.

409
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,835
Well, she's not gonna be
happy about that.

410
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,758
No, she's not.

411
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
Why don't I take that
off your plate?

412
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,314
Really?

413
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,238
I mean, I don't know.
Are you sure
you're ready for...

414
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,358
Look, she can't
shout at me, right?
Not after...

415
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,715
I mean,
we're in the same boat.

416
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,190
So I figure I tell her,
she has a good cry,
and that's that.

417
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,158
Otherwise she's gonna
be all claws out.

418
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,159
That makes sense.
Yeah. Then it's settled.

419
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,159
I'll head over.
You don't wanna just call?

420
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,634
No, in person is better,
I think.

421
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,632
Give her a shoulder,
you know?

422
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,320
Come in.

423
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,320
I... brought you
some flowers.

424
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,151
Oh, thanks,
just put 'em...

425
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,676
What are you...

426
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,800
Oh.

427
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,714
It's making my
head hurt.

428
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,197
This whole case...
all the moving pieces.

429
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,876
I thought I'd put it up,
you know, graphically...

430
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,480
see if things made
much more sense.

431
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,520
I called back to Bemidji
to talk to Bill,
but he's...

432
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,038
I don't know.
Some kid brought a gun
to school or something.

433
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,391
So everyone's kind of
running around.

434
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,552
And to be honest,
everything they said didn't
make much sense anyway.

435
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,109
Who's the
deaf fella then?

436
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,396
Fella upstairs,
tried to murder me
with a bazooka.

437
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,034
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

438
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,594
Turns out he can't hear.

439
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,311
And the other fella
with his throat cut,
I'm guessing he translated.

440
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,631
And they're who now?

441
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,679
Well...
that's the thing.

442
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,234
All I can think is...
and maybe this is a stretch,

443
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,159
but heck if I know
any other way to
think about it.

444
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,039
Sam Hess, right?

445
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,397
So... he owns
a trucking company.

446
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,399
And we always thought
he had maybe alleged
ties to organized crime,

447
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,194
this operation
out of Fargo.

448
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,590
So... when Hess
gets killed,

449
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,758
I'm thinking maybe Fargo

450
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,349
sends these two boys
to figure out
what happened.

451
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,477
And how do they
end up here?

452
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,637
Well... follow me.

453
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,153
If we think...

454
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,839
which we do...

455
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,039
...that Lester...
on the day
of the murder...

456
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,077
got bullied by Hess...

457
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,470
and then met Malvo
at the hospital.

458
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,071
Right... and hired Malvo
to kill Hess.

459
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,913
Which he did.

460
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,195
And then...

461
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,795
these two boys come in
from out of town
asking questions.

462
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,435
Get to finding Lester.

463
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,313
And he sends 'em here.

464
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,957
So Lester knew
that Malvo was here...
in Duluth.

465
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,950
It would appear
that way, yeah.

466
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,837
Well, that's...
that's ammunition, right?

467
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,350
I mean,
to go back to Lester.

468
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,800
Oh, yeah. You betcha.

469
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,959
Took forever,
but I got 'em to sign off
on taking you home.

470
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,954
Oh, so you're...

471
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,069
Yeah. Sure that...
Recover at home,
you know, it...

472
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,356
makes sense, sure.

473
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,675
Thanks, Dad.

474
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,199
Well, okay.

475
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,993
I guess I'll see
you later.

476
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,551
Dad, my flowers.
Oh, yeah.

477
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,554
Thanks for these.

478
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,034
He bought me flowers.
You don't say.

479
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,998
Glad you like them.

480
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,629
I'm gonna put them in water
as soon as I get home.

481
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,158
You keep your chin up,
Gus Grimly.

482
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,714
We're winning this thing.

483
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,479
Don't you forget.

484
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,074
Say bye to
Greta for me.

485
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,236
So he's got the stick
in his mouth, right?
Biting down.

486
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,957
And I grab the arrow...
and Craig is in the
car having a giggle.

487
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,311
Thinks the whole
thing's hilarious, which...

488
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,437
That's my cousin
out there, right?

489
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,718
So I slip the knife
out of me boot.

490
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,916
Give him the
old what for.

491
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,191
Held the knife to
his bloody face.

492
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,749
And lunch is over.

493
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,394
I don't know how
they eat that crap
every day.

494
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,396
Speaking of...

495
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,000
What? It's fresh.

496
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,320
Do you know the
conditions of a modern
fast food restaurant?

497
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,238
I'm not just talking
about hygiene.

498
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,640
Get bent.

499
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,474
They did an
experiment once.

500
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,997
Scientist took two
glasses of water...

501
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,157
and he starts
cursing at one,

502
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,310
calling it all
kinds of names.

503
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,153
You're making this up.

504
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,873
I swear to God.
Mmm-mmm.

505
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,519
I swear to God.

506
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,157
He yells at one glass
and then whispers sweet
nothings to the other glass.

507
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,273
Okay? And in one week...
Just stop it.
Just stop it.

508
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,477
But, listen,
a week later...

509
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,515
Can I help you, sir?

510
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,676
Gun!

511
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,112
Is that shots?

512
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,669
Oh, my God! My God!

513
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,393
Drop it!

514
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,716
Call 911!

515
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,757
- Where's the top dog?
- The what?

516
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,956
The boss man.

517
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,872
Third floor.
Private elevator.

518
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,359
Oh, no! No!

519
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,950
He's got a gun!

520
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,353
Freeze, shit bird!

521
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,510
Shit! Ah...

522
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,115
What's the code
for the elevator?

523
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,236
Nine-thirty-three.

524
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,314
He's gotta be in there.

525
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,750
Son of a...

526
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,916
God damn it!

527
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,910
Get him!

528
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,916
Get him! Quick!

529
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,118
Come on, get back!

530
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,356
Get him!

531
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,273
Jesus!

532
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,471
What the... What?
Was that...

533
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,630
Call it in.

534
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,798
Oh. Okay.
Call it in, man.

535
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,991
Your pop is in the way.

536
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,197
Where are you...
Hold on.

537
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,873
Got me all...

538
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,350
Maybe we should get
in the car and then
back up a few feet

539
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,914
and then pull back in
like we just arrived.

540
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,912
Can we just
focus on the...

541
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,798
You need to have
fewer ideas.

542
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,760
Shitballs.

543
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,673
We're in so much...

544
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,957
Okay, let me
do the talking.
Why? I can do the talking.

545
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,634
Because
when you talk...
Back!

546
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,274
...bad shit happens.
Get back!

547
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,912
FBI! We're FBI!
Back! Get back!

548
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,957
Get back, please.
Police on the scene.

549
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,672
What have you guys got?
Really?

550
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,799
No... Well,
he doesn't know...
It's a body. Lock it down.

551
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,989
Multiple gunshots.
The shooter's still
inside the building.

552
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,634
You're gonna need
more patrolmen than this.

553
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,757
Okay, okay.
Okay, we're good.

554
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,240
We're going in. Back us up.

555
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,152
James, you follow us,
come on.
Yes, sir.

556
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,114
It's about time.

557
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,554
I've been calling.

558
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,199
Sorry about the delay.

559
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,391
You know the red tape
on these things.
Mmm-mmm.

560
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,639
Come on in.
Thanks.

561
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,553
You look
real nice today.

562
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,910
Thanks.

563
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,198
You're sweet.

564
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,875
The boys home?
No, thank God.

565
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,515
They have a game.
Good.

566
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,196
Good.

567
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,558
You don't go
then, no?
Are you kidding?

568
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,717
I just stay here trying
to drink enough

569
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,599
so I'm numb by
the time they get home.

570
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,840
Got one of those for me?

571
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,678
Why, Lester...

572
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,792
Hmm?
Sure.

573
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,554
Cheers.
Cheers.

574
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,397
To fresh beginnings.
Yeah.

575
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,390
So it's all set, right?
I'm getting paid?

576
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,870
Um...

577
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,713
Well, they should.

578
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,439
What do you mean
"should"?

579
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,358
When do I get
the money?

580
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,478
Like I said,
there's a few more hoops
on these homicide cases.

581
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,519
We're not just
talking about filing
a death certificate.

582
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,240
I don't think
I'm telling you anything
you don't know

583
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,674
when I say these
insurance companies,

584
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,150
they don't like
writing checks.

585
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,277
But I'm gonna
get it, right?

586
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,677
Well... that is
where a skilled

587
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,399
middleman such as
myself comes in.

588
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,472
You see,
it's all about
knowing who to call.

589
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,833
It's all about
knowing which...
palms to grease...

590
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,594
if you get my meaning.

591
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,910
I...

592
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,357
know a little something...

593
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,433
about greasy palms.

594
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,440
Well, why don't you
and me have another drink?

595
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,680
You can show me that.

596
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,274
Oh, Lester!

597
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,109
Lester.

598
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,190
<i>Slow down, tiger.</i>

599
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,471
You're hurting me.
I'm sorry.

600
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,918
God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

601
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,994
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

602
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,759
I should take you home
and put you to bed.

603
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,519
It'll just be a second.
I promise.

604
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,910
Hey.

605
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,590
Oh, my gosh. Are you...
They said you were still...

606
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,313
Oh, the bullet went
clean through.

607
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,119
Doc says take
a few days, rest up.

608
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,277
Otherwise, fine.
Where is everyone?

609
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,436
Celebrating.

610
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,552
We got him...
who killed the Chief.

611
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,669
Lester?

612
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,917
You arrested Lester?
No.

613
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,992
Didn't you hear?
It was his brother...

614
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,878
Chaz... the whole time.

615
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,032
He was having an affair
with the wife.
She broke it off.

616
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,236
What?
Yeah.

617
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,074
Beat her with the hammer,
then shot the Chief.

618
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,277
Lester covered for him.

619
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,039
Bill thinks 'cause of
Chaz's temper...

620
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,112
you know...
the fear factor.

621
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,110
Where...

622
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,709
That's not...

623
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,833
I gotta talk to Bill.
Where's Bill?

624
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,310
Yeah, with the rest...
over at Bernard's.

625
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,993
I'm supposed to go over
after my shift.

626
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,639
Okay, I gotta...

627
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,240
Shouldn't you go home?

628
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,560
You okay, hon?
