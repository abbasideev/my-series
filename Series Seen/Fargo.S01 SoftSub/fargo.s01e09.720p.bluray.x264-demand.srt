1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,632
<i>Erstwhile on</i> Fargo...

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,592
Mom home?
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,120
Let's eat.
I'm starving.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,190
<i>FBI.</i>

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,674
<i>I called a couple
times now about</i>

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,989
the Fargo
Syndicate massacre...

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,276
<i>Now I might know
the fella responsible...</i>

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,430
Jesus!

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,477
This is where you work now.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,960
I have a commendation.

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,230
<i>I give you...</i>

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,199
<i>Insurance
Salesman of the Year,
Lester Nygaard!</i>

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,193
So proud of ya, Lester.

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,034
Oh, Miss? Can we have
some more sparkling water?

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,872
And this is any animal.
Pig, gopher, chicken...

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,719
They go long enough
without sleep,

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,196
you start to see
abnormalities
behavior-wise.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,071
First there's
the inability
to concentrate

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,396
and perform certain
fine motor skills.

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,715
Then you start to see...

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,832
And the army did studies
on this in the '50s.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,759
The effects of
sleep deprivation
on the human brain.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,957
I know 'cause
a buddy of my dad's

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,952
was a subject back during
the Korean conflict.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,920
I mean, shit, Ray,
what's the longest

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,514
you've ever
gone without sleep?

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,510
Five days for me.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,960
This was back
in dental school.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,276
Marty Perlmutter
stole a prescription pad,

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,513
wrote us all
a scrip for amphetamines,
so we could cram for finals.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,272
And boy howdy, I tell ya...
After three days
of no sleeping,

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,680
I was an animal.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,993
All right, <i>mi amigo.</i>
That ought to do it.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm still a little worried
about the 203 and the 204.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,074
So we should
make an appointment

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,992
to get together again
in about six months.

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,800
Appreciate it, Doc.

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,034
Really.
This black fella rolled over
my foot with a steam cleaner.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,113
And I tell ya, this hurt worse
than that did by a long shot.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,879
Yeah, nerve pain,
that's a bear.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,751
Oh, you wanna
avoid nut brittles

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,480
for a few days,
and any kind
of fruit with pits.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,710
Jemma's got a pamphlet.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,995
All right.
Okay.

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,037
Yo, Mick Mike...

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,994
We still on for
golf next week?

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,475
Of course, we are,
Burty Burt.

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,640
But more importantly,
are you and Louise
still gonna make it on Sunday?

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,076
Uh, do dogs smell
each other's butts?

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,078
I think I might have
observed that type of
behavior on occasion.

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,798
Well, we'll be there.
Weezy's making her
famous five bean dip.

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,590
Aces.

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,553
Oh, thanks, babe.

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,717
Mick Mike.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,952
I just keep
pinching myself.

56
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,193
Honey, you've earned it.
It's like my mom always said,

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,637
"Boys, if you like the milk,
buy the freakin' cow."

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,040
Aw, that's so sweet.

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,234
I am gonna
stick my whole thumb
up your ass later.

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,390
Aces.

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,230
Yello.

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,390
Hey, hey.

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,312
Darling,
is this guy bothering
you or what?

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,390
You!

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,518
We're gonna tie one
on tonight, friend-o.
I'm telling you.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,314
No time like the present.
That's what I always say.

67
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,238
Bean dip?
You betcha.

68
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,350
Oh.

69
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,832
You look great.
You too.

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
Ice wine.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,513
Buddy of mine says
they swear by this
stuff in Finland.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,035
Well, they're all a bunch
of sex-crazed alcoholics.

73
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,440
So they should
know, right?

74
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,520
Sweet.
Hmm.

75
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,194
Weezy says you
popped the question.

76
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,272
Gonna make
Jemma an honest woman.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,558
Oh, yeah, I cried like a baby.
I'm not afraid to admit it.

78
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,711
Well, she's
something else,
that Jemma.

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,191
Just between us girls
that body, is it...

80
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,350
I mean...

81
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,872
What's she like in the sack?

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,474
Hellcat.
That's the only word for it.

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,789
Shit.

84
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,075
Weezy's basically
a Jew in the bedroom.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,152
Oh, you mean
she wears a wig

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,391
and makes you
do it through a hole
in the sheet? Yeah.

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,477
No. No.

88
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,359
She stopped
putting it in her mouth

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,159
as soon as the ring
went on her finger.

90
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,311
That's a national tragedy,
Burt.

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,076
Amen.

92
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,232
Gotta tell ya,
Mick Mike, I sure do like
having you around.

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,152
Likewise, Burty Burt.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,072
The office was dead dull
until you showed up.

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,357
Positively geriatric.

96
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,512
I'm a rascal.
There's no two
ways about it.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,398
Yessiree, Bob.

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,157
Like I told you before,
you and my brother

99
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,272
would get along
like gangbusters.

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,476
Well, I'd like to meet him.

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,596
Yeah.

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,672
Like I said, it's tricky.

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,115
He's in witness protection.
Say what?

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,398
I said, he's in
witness protection.

105
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,555
Turned state's
evidence against
these mob guys outta Chicago.

106
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,756
Told him not to.

107
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,112
Now, I haven't seen
him in over a year.

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,796
He still calls though.
Not supposed to.

109
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,753
You can't break
up the Canton boys.

110
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,479
I'll betcha.

111
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,109
Oh, screw it.
What are you
doing next weekend?

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,760
You tell me.

113
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,115
Oh, I like that,
"You tell me."

114
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,199
Well...
Weezy and me,
we're headed

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,193
for Vegas to
a little family reunion.

116
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,557
Why don't you and
Jemma tag along?

117
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,950
Aces.

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
<i>You did this to me.</i>

119
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,193
<i>I had a wife, family.</i>

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,353
<i>I was happy.</i>

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,190
<i>And then you started...
Started what?</i>

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,195
<i>All we did was talk.</i>

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,520
<i>No, that's not...
No, you said things...
Jumbled me up.</i>

124
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,479
<i>You told me I needed...
Now, they're dead.</i>

125
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,359
<i>Why'd I listen to you? Why?</i>

126
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,271
<i>Tell my wife I love her.</i>

127
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,957
Oh, honey, can we get
some more sparkling water?

128
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,360
Thank you.

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,470
I put my mask on.
Tawny hands me
the number two needle.

130
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,631
I start to give
the guy a novocaine shot.

131
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,712
Well, I stick
the needle in
my own finger.

132
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,154
And... Yeah.

133
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,713
And it hurt,
but I don't want
to look dumb,

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,430
so I try it again.
The next time,
I stick it in my thumb.

135
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,594
Now I'm so flustered
that I go to take my mask off,

136
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,276
while I'm still
holding the needle,
jab it right in my face.

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,952
And the patient is like...
"Doc, what's wrong?"
And I'm like...

138
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,879
I can't even move my arm.

139
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,314
I mean, it was insane.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,794
You're a riot.

141
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,997
He's a riot.

142
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,833
You have no idea.

143
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,999
So,
we are all set for tomorrow,

144
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,835
to go see
you-know-who.
Should be fun.

145
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,278
Real clandestine stuff,
change cars twice, no phones.

146
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,758
Geez, who did you say
is after this guy again?

147
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,474
Well,
what are the odds?

148
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,389
Sorry?

149
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,751
It's me, Lester.

150
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,436
I'm sorry, sir.
You must have me
confused with someone else.

151
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
No. Minnesota,
last year?

152
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,634
The emergency room?

153
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
I didn't recognize
you at first either,
'cause you got a whole new...

154
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,314
But hey, so have I.

155
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,080
What do you think
of the suit?

156
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,114
Bill Blass.
Check this out.

157
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,755
Salesman of the Year.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,276
They gave it to me
on a stage and everything.

159
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,033
Uh, Mick Mike.
You gonna introduce us
to your friend there?

160
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,270
You know,
I'd love to, Burt.

161
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,717
But unfortunately,
I've never met this
man before in my life.

162
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,154
What?

163
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,516
Right, we don't know
each other.

164
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,589
Okay, honey, let's go.

165
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,559
We're never
gonna make the show
if we don't get out of here.

166
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,109
Walk away.

167
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,199
Sorry, I must have...

168
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,431
Congratulations
on your award.
Thank you.

169
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,352
Burt, did I ever
tell you about the time

170
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,238
I made a night guard
for Britney Spears?

171
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,549
I swear.

172
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,520
Come on.

173
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,593
He was a piece of work, huh?
Who's that?

174
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,798
That guy in the bar.
You sure you don't know him?

175
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,351
People nab me all the time.
Just one of
those faces, I guess.

176
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,635
No.

177
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,756
You don't get to...

178
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's not right.

179
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,640
And when
something's
not right,

180
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,433
well, the old Lester,
now, he would have
just let it slide.

181
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,440
But not this guy.

182
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,716
I've worked too hard.
I've come too far...

183
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,075
Lester, stop.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,919
So now you do know me.

185
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,070
Honey?

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,074
Is this what you want?

187
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,476
Ah.

188
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,359
Hey, Mick Mike,
lighten up, huh?

189
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,396
Lester, is this
what you want?

190
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,640
Yes or no?

191
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,760
Yes.

192
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,154
Oh, my God!

193
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,230
Oh, my...

194
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,110
That's on you.

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,511
I worked this guy
for six months, Lester,
six months.

196
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,874
Can you imagine the number
of sewer mouths
I put my hands in?

197
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,438
The gallons of human spit?

198
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,352
Plus, the $100,000 bounty
down the toilet, but...

199
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,954
Still, the look on his face
when I pulled the gun.
Classic, huh?

200
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,996
Grab the fat guy's feet.
We'll throw him in a dumpster.

201
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,599
Shit, Lester.

202
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,038
See you later, Lester.

203
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,120
See you soon.

204
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,074
Shit.

205
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,075
All right.

206
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,595
Okay. Get dressed.
We gotta...

207
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,311
Lester, are you okay?

208
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,238
Get dressed!
Get dressed!

209
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,913
Get dressed!
Get dressed!
Come on.

210
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,594
Okay. Go, go.

211
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,799
All right. Let's go.

212
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,793
Keep up, hon.
Keep up.

213
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,596
Lester, you're
hurting my hand.

214
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,796
Sorry. Sorry.

215
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,160
Okay, okay. Come on.

216
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,471
A man has a fox,
a rabbit and a cabbage.

217
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,630
What man?

218
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,118
Any man. A man.

219
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,709
Colonel Sanders?

220
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,271
Could be, could be
George W. Bush.

221
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,797
Why would George W. Bush
have a fox and
a rabbit and a cabbage?

222
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,793
Just listen. A man
has a fox, a rabbit
and a cabbage

223
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,394
and he wants to
get across the river,

224
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,437
but his boat
can only carry one
of them at a time.

225
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,233
Get a bigger boat.
No, no. That's
not an option.

226
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,396
And here's the problem...

227
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,437
If the man leaves
the fox and the rabbit
alone,

228
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,398
the fox is gonna
eat the rabbit.

229
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,312
And the same
for the rabbit
and the cabbage.

230
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,632
So how does the man
get all three of his
items across the river

231
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,074
without losing
any of them?

232
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,196
A turducken.

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,229
A... What's that now?

234
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,032
He stuffs
the cabbage in the rabbit
and the rabbit in the fox,

235
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,720
and he eats all of them.

236
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,589
That's not the answer.

237
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,675
It's an answer.

238
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,756
Hello?

239
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,234
Incoming or outgoing?

240
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,591
I need you to pull
the Syndicate file.

241
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,510
Why?

242
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,830
Is it like
a clown car
back there?

243
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,434
Why do you need
the Syndicate file?

244
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,830
Yeah. Did something
happen with the case?
A break?

245
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,270
No. Just a phone
call I've gotta log.

246
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,635
Phone call from who?
Yeah, who called?

247
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,313
That's really
not your business.

248
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,110
Hey.

249
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,439
Deputy Solverson.
Solverson. What does he say?

250
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,398
Says he knows who did it.
Okay.

251
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,269
Where's Bemidji?

252
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,915
Thanks, Dad.

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,480
I think I'd look
cool with a limp.

254
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,713
Saw the profile of
Bill in the paper.

255
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,476
Yup.

256
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,315
For the record,
I advised against

257
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,119
wearing a sword
in that picture.

258
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,312
Honey, pass the syrup.
Yeah.

259
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,630
Anyway, I'm in charge
today on account of...

260
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,953
Bill's on his way
to St. Paul now for a...
What do you call it?

261
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,993
Law enforcement conference.

262
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,839
So, watch your butts.

263
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,516
How's the route?

264
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,637
Can't complain.
Takes me out by the lake.
It's a nice drive.

265
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,551
Dated the girl
who delivered
my mail once...

266
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,115
After her mother.

267
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,319
Convenient at first.

268
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,160
Awkward after,
once we broke up.

269
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,360
Seeing her every day.

270
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,833
Ended up moving to
a different neighborhood.

271
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,840
So that's why we moved.

272
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,279
You know you could
have just had
your mail sent to work.

273
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,040
I never thought of that.

274
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,350
So when's your last day?

275
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,519
About a month.
She's nesting.

276
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,513
Uh, geez. You know,
you buy one
throw pillow...

277
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,793
We better...

278
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,793
Bye.
Bye, kids.

279
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,312
Hey, and go fishing later?

280
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,951
You're the granddaughter
I always wanted,
but was afraid to buy online.

281
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,156
Bye.

282
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,230
You did good, hon.

283
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,556
Yeah, and you
by proximity, huh?

284
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,550
Solverson.

285
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,032
Bill? Yeah. No.
He's in the
Twin Cities for...

286
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,757
Oh, geez.
Three people, uh.
Killed how?

287
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,070
In an elevator, huh?
You say one's a dentist?

288
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,039
Yeah, I'm...
What do Las Vegas
police want me to...

289
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,958
Oh, sure. Yeah.

290
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,433
Yeah. No,
I can go see their witness,
get a statement.

291
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,592
What's... What's
the witness' name then?

292
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,349
Will you slow down?

293
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,796
You'd think we were
being chased.

294
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,190
Sorry.

295
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,674
Was it me?

296
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,194
Did I do something?

297
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,674
What?
No, I told you.

298
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,559
I made a lot
of new contacts
at the awards.

299
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,471
Big fish.
You have to strike
while the iron's hot.

300
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,995
I know, but you woke me up
in the middle of the night.

301
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,316
Oh, I'll make it up to you.
How's that?

302
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,032
We can take a trip.

303
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,199
Anywhere you wanna go.

304
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,717
Natalie says in
Acapulco you get

305
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,753
to drink rum right
out of the coconut.

306
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,240
Acapulco it is.

307
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,758
In fact, uh, why don't...
We should leave tonight.

308
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,270
Really?

309
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,840
Sure. Yeah.
I mean, why not?

310
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,832
A little fun in the sun,
drink from a coconut.

311
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,559
We deserve it, huh?

312
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,711
What about work?
Your big fish?

313
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,315
Well, you only
live once, right?

314
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,596
Let's just...
We'll go home,

315
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,797
pack some stuff
then head back
to the airport.

316
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,440
Have our toes in
the sand by dawn,
a real adventure.

317
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,920
Oh, Lester.

318
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,190
Okay.

319
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,231
Now, here is
what you're gonna do.

320
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,791
You're gonna go inside
and pack your best bikini.

321
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,156
I'm gonna get changed
and head to the office.

322
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,960
And I'm gonna buy the tickets,
get the passports...

323
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,794
And then we are
gonna run away together.

324
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,311
Heck, we might
never come back.

325
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,992
Thanks, hon.
There we go.

326
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,076
<i>Trust the circles,
whenever you go around,</i>

327
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,510
<i>just keep going, even though
you think you'll fail.</i>

328
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,277
So I checked and there's
an 11:00 out of Minneapolis.

329
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,589
So we should be on
the road by 6:00.

330
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,514
Okay. I'll defrost
that pea soup.

331
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,114
We can have
that before we go.

332
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,554
Oh, yeah, sounds good.

333
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,356
Love you, hon.

334
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,590
Love you, too.

335
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,276
Oh.

336
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,158
Scared me there.
Startled me.

337
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,471
Mr. Nygaard,
Deputy Solverson.

338
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,199
Maybe you remember?
Yeah, sure.

339
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,876
I'm sorry to bother you,
but we got a call
from Las Vegas PD.

340
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,317
What?
Las Vegas police?

341
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,073
And they said you were, um...

342
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,755
That you might be
a witness to a murder.

343
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,434
Uh, three murders, actually.

344
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,516
Lester?

345
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,796
It's fine.
Go back to your show.

346
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,075
Is everything okay?

347
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,516
Yes, ma'am,
just a routine inquiry.

348
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,159
Is now a good time
to ask you a few questions?

349
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,560
No.

350
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,070
Oh.

351
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,276
I've got an appointment.

352
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,040
I gotta get to work
and Linda's got shopping.

353
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,831
Now, Lester. Don't be rude.
We just got back
from Las Vegas.

354
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,750
Can you tell me
what this is about,
or is that classified?

355
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,680
Oh, well, yeah, actually...

356
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,754
I could come to the station
this afternoon and
give a statement?

357
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,836
Not that I,
you know,
saw anything.

358
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,470
Honestly, Lester, stay or go,
but I got a bladder
the size of a penny.

359
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,432
Oh, you poor thing.
Please, come in.

360
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,160
Thank you.

361
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,714
Hey, guys.
Is your dad around?

362
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,474
Yeah. Daddy!

363
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,835
Dad!

364
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,156
Help ya?

365
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,318
I'm not sure.
I'm looking for
Lester Nygaard.

366
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,353
Oh, yeah. We bought the place
from him in the fall.
Nice guy.

367
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,353
Yeah, that's Lester,
all right, nicest guy
you'll ever meet.

368
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,193
You got any idea
how I can find him?

369
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,600
Uh, I don't have
a forwarding address.

370
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,239
He's got the shop
over on Third, though.

371
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,674
Is that Bo Munk?

372
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,114
No. Got his own
place now,

373
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,192
with his name on it.
Oh, nice.

374
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,112
Like I said, over on Third.
You can't miss it.

375
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,395
Okay. Thanks.

376
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,030
Oh, uh...

377
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,916
One more thing.

378
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,560
You do know
people were murdered
in this house, right?

379
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,279
Hell of a thing.

380
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,239
Man in
the living room, shotgun,
woman in the basement.

381
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,232
I think it was
a hammering.

382
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,669
Afterwards Lester told me

383
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,355
he used to hear noises coming
from the basement at night.

384
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,032
Footsteps on the stairs,
a woman moaning.

385
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,230
That kind of thing.

386
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,392
But I'm sure it
was in his head.

387
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,076
You have a nice day.
Have fun, kids.

388
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,673
I don't like him.

389
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,110
<i>So you won an award.</i>

390
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,350
Uh, that's right.

391
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,635
Salesman of the Year.

392
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,791
Oh, hun...
Yeah, I...

393
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,958
It was
a national competition, so...

394
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,357
Uh, then it was
dinner with Buck Young,

395
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,636
who's the head
of the whole deal
that gives the award.

396
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,436
That was some spread.
I think we closed that
place down drinking.

397
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,270
Uh, and I said,
"I'm still up for some fun."

398
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,392
And Linda said she
wanted to go to bed.
I'm a morning person.

399
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,274
Yeah, but then
I thought, "Heck...

400
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,358
How often does something
like this happen.
Winning an award?"

401
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,434
So, yeah, a nightcap,
just to celebrate.

402
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,113
I told him to go.
Yeah.

403
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,311
So, sure.
So I went to the bar.

404
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,279
And this is the bar
at the hotel?

405
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,354
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Excuse me.

406
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,872
Uh. The Royale,
I guess it's called.

407
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,274
I ordered a drink,
I had a chat with
the bartender for a bit.

408
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,680
Uh, male or female?

409
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,191
Female. A woman.

410
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,671
Uh, but, you know,
one drink and I'm back
upstairs to bed.

411
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,838
And what happened
on the elevator?
Nothing.

412
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,834
I mean, it went up.

413
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,390
So everyone on the elevator
was alive when you got off.

414
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,400
Oh, yeah, they sure were.
Uh, they were laughing
about something.

415
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,877
Friday night in Vegas.
That is some place,
I tell ya.

416
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,277
Linda and me,
we'd never been before.

417
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,558
What I love most
are the fountains.

418
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,957
Also, you can
gamble at the airport.

419
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,749
Right.

420
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,112
Well, I checked
and it looks like you

421
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,759
changed your flight
at the last minute

422
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,513
to come back on
the first flight.

423
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,712
So, what was
the reason there?

424
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,200
That was me...
My idea.

425
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,918
I just...
I got homesick.

426
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,753
Woke Lester up in
the middle of the night

427
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,832
and told him did
we have to
stay another day,

428
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,230
'cause I was ready
to go home.

429
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,437
Yeah.
That's right.
That is right.

430
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,320
Uh, remember? I said, "Babe,
the room is paid for
through till Sunday."

431
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,551
But she was adamant.

432
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,553
I tend to get my way.
Oh, boy, does she?

433
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,791
Okay then. Well, uh,
thank you for your time,
Mr. Nygaard. Missus.

434
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,480
When's the due date?

435
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,711
Oh, I've got
a few weeks still.

436
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,957
Uh, listen. Vegas PD
is gonna send over

437
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,555
some pictures from
the hotel security camera.

438
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,757
So don't leave
town for a while.

439
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,196
I may have some
more questions for you.

440
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,993
Oh, shoot.
We were gonna...

441
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,719
No, absolutely,
absolutely.

442
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,280
We'll be right here
if you need us.

443
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,590
<i>Car four, come back.</i>

444
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,160
<i>Car four, come back.</i>

445
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,594
I'm coming.

446
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,635
Yeah, this is four.

447
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,717
<i>Hey, Molly,
a couple of FBI fellows</i>

448
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,712
<i>came by the station
looking for you.</i>

449
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,029
Oh, yeah?
<i>Yeah.</i>

450
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,270
<i>Couldn't reach
you on the radio.</i>

451
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,556
<i>Thought you'd
be at your dad's,
so I sent them there.</i>

452
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,518
To the diner?
<i>Yeah.</i>

453
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,193
<i>So you should
probably check in
on them.</i>

454
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,839
<i>They seem real
eager to talk to you.</i>

455
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,274
Okay then, will do.

456
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,834
Coffee?

457
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,434
Yeah. Decaf,
if you got it.

458
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,790
And a piece of pie.

459
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
I got apple and cherry.

460
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,960
No good ever came
from a piece of cherry pie.

461
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,756
Thanks, friend.

462
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
Local PD?

463
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,112
State cop, 18 years.

464
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,795
You got the look.

465
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,109
I spent some time
with the Tampa DA.

466
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,515
Lawyer?

467
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,080
Yeah, something like that.

468
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,953
Say, you may be
able to help me.

469
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,760
I will if I can.

470
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,793
Uh, I'm in town for
not too much time,
just passing through, really.

471
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,711
But I wanted to look up
my old pal, Lester Nygaard.

472
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,995
Oh, sure,
I know Lester.

473
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,599
Did you go by his shop?
Oh, first thing.

474
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,558
But wouldn't you know it?
They're closed.

475
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,320
Went by the house, too,
except it turns
out he's moved.

476
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,312
No kidding.
Hmm.

477
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,433
So you can see
my predicament.

478
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,749
You tried calling him?

479
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,276
Yeah, I could do that,
but I was hoping
to surprise him.

480
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,270
That's a pickle.

481
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,870
Yup.

482
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,594
That your boy?

483
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,913
In a way.
My daughter's
husband.

484
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,320
They look happy.

485
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,754
'Course, no one hangs
the sad pictures,
am I right?

486
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,636
Mom crying and
dad looking angry.

487
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,394
The kid with the black eye.

488
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,877
How long did you
say you worked
for the Tampa DA?

489
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,999
Oh, I didn't say
I worked there.

490
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,672
Spent some time, that's all.
But that's just me.
I'm a traveler.

491
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,157
<i>Big cities,
the small towns...</i>

492
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,435
Open road.

493
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,394
Which is why I thought,
"Here we are in a..."

494
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,552
What do you call it,
"A tight-knit community."

495
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,710
So, uh...

496
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,880
Thought I'll just ask.

497
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,718
So here I am,
asking you if you know
where I can find old Lester.

498
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,870
Had a case once.
Back in '79.

499
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,471
I'd tell you the details,
but it'd sound
like I made 'em up...

500
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Madness really.

501
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,834
Bodies?

502
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,950
Yes, sir...
One after another.

503
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,990
Probably,
if you stacked 'em high

504
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,918
you could have climbed
to the second floor.

505
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,439
<i>Yeah, I saw
something that year...</i>

506
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,432
<i>I ain't never seen
before or since.</i>

507
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,120
I'd call it animal.

508
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,673
Except animals
only kill for food.

509
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,954
This was...

510
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,992
Sioux Falls.
You ever been?

511
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,516
Went to Sioux City once.
Back in my scandalous days.

512
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,719
But anyway,
you didn't answer
my question there.

513
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,036
Well, I tell ya what?

514
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,510
You leave me your number,

515
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,996
I'll make sure Lester gets it
next time he comes in.

516
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,472
That's a solid offer, friend.
But like I said,
I'm just passing through.

517
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,793
Thanks for
the pie and the coffee.

518
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,436
I haven't had
a piece of pie like that
since the Garden of Eden.

519
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,836
Hey, Dad.
Hey, hon.

520
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,470
Everything okay?

521
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,590
Oh, yeah.

522
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,080
Sometimes you
just get a weird one.

523
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,069
Well, I'm supposed
to meet a couple of
fellows from the...

524
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,552
Never mind.
I see 'em.

525
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,272
Hey there, I'm...
Deputy Solverson?

526
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,595
That's right.

527
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,798
I'm Agent Budge and
this is Agent Pepper,
FBI from Fargo.

528
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,031
We went by the station.
They told us you'd be here.

529
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,074
Am now.

530
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,157
Should we grab a table?
Yeah.

531
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,071
You made a phone
call to the field office

532
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,356
yesterday about
the massacre last year.

533
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,915
Said you know who shot up
the Syndicate building?

534
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,310
Called seven times,
according to the file.

535
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,914
Wouldn't take
no for an answer.

536
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,879
I'm not clear on...

537
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,591
The FBI sent
a fella already.

538
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,032
He looked at my evidence
and said it was
circumstantial.

539
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,589
A worker bee...
Or what do
the ants call them?

540
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,751
A drone.
We're invested.

541
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,071
Got a personal stake,
is what my partner...

542
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,550
See, we were there
on the day at the Syndicate.

543
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,835
Surveillance.

544
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,830
Day 156, just logging
the comings and goings.

545
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,600
Six months and
nothing happens.
Going crazy with...

546
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,750
And then...

547
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,959
So, you see,
we're invested
personally, like I said.

548
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,430
And when
we heard you called...

549
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,398
That you have
an answer.

550
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,517
So please,
we have to know.

551
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,870
Who is he?

552
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,756
Um, Dad, I think
we're gonna need
some coffees to go.

553
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,600
My God.

554
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,119
You put all this
together yourself?
Oh, no.

555
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,237
Gus helped me...
My husband.

556
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,959
He used to be Duluth PD.
He's a mailman now.

557
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,232
But you can see
why I think this is your guy.

558
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,196
Okay, I'm here.

559
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,555
Hey, Chief.
These fellas...

560
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,909
Bill Oswalt.
I'm the chief here.

561
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,469
Sorry I wasn't around to...
I was at a conference.

562
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,116
And then Cindy called
and said there were
two agents from the FBI here.

563
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,555
Oh, no.

564
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,150
Now, Chief,
listen, before...

565
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,754
No, no, no.
I am so sorry.

566
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,470
I am so sorry.
Molly, these guys
aren't interested in...

567
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,874
Let's meet in
my office.

568
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,553
Have you seen this?

569
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,233
Have I seen this?

570
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,593
Son, this thing's been
giving me nightmares.

571
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,795
Come on, now.
That's not fair.

572
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,313
She did tell you
that we caught the guy

573
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,914
responsible for
killing the wife?

574
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,990
Didn't she?

575
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,520
Uh, the brother Nygaard
and he had
the bloody hammer...

576
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,160
So you don't care
about the fact

577
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,156
that this Malvo character
was seen with Lester
at the hospital?

578
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,680
Or that he ended up in Duluth
in direct conflict
with these other two?

579
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,231
No, because that, uh...

580
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,635
What happened in Duluth...

581
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,838
I'm gonna call HQ
and let them know
we'll be staying the night.

582
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,877
We can take another run
at Lester tomorrow.

583
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,360
Is there a motel?

584
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,314
Um, yeah, sure. I can...
I'll get you directions.

585
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,030
This is tremendous work,
Deputy. Impressive.

586
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,637
Yeah, I better just...

587
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,393
Come on.

588
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,990
Okay.

589
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,271
All set. Ready to go?

590
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,272
What? I thought
we weren't gonna go.

591
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,272
Acapulco,
here we come.

592
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,760
Oh, my God.

593
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,877
You betcha.
I talked to the deputy.

594
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,950
She said, "Sure, go."

595
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,236
So now, we just gotta swing
by the office and
pick up the passports.

596
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,720
What about my coat?

597
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,269
Oh, you're not gonna
need a winter coat
where we're going.

598
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,280
You know I had
a crush on you
right from when we met.

599
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,995
Hmm.

600
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,834
Oh, yeah?

601
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,479
Swear to God.

602
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,630
Used to sit at my desk

603
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,280
and dream about
you leaving your wife

604
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,995
or somehow getting
her out of the picture.

605
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,750
Not that I wanted...
No, of course not.

606
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,030
Nothing wrong
with dreaming.

607
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,159
Oh, I agree...
Like Cinderella.

608
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,230
Yeah?

609
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,552
I remember when
I was three.

610
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,711
And I told you
how we came
over to America,

611
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,713
settled in Minnesota,
my folks bought the motel?

612
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,470
Yeah?

613
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,313
Well, they put me
right to work.

614
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,438
Just...
Laundry at first...

615
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,553
Then making the beds
and cleaning the rooms.

616
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,759
You don't even
wanna know the disarray
people leave behind.

617
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,075
I bet.

618
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,359
One time...
I'll never forget this.

619
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,439
I was changing the sheets
on a king size, and I'm...

620
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,560
Suddenly, I'm like,
"What's that smell?"

621
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,231
Well, the guest had...

622
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,635
He made a BM between
the mattress and
the box spring.

623
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,710
What?

624
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,952
I guess he took
the mattress off
and did it,

625
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,591
and then made
the bed back up,
which...

626
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,400
It's a lot simpler
just to go to the toilet.

627
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,752
My point being...

628
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,913
That while I was cleaning up
I had this dream that someone,

629
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,280
a man... Would come
along and take me
away from all this.

630
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,354
And then I met you.

631
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,954
And here we are.

632
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,512
And we're going
to Acapulco.

633
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,073
I thought we were
going to the shop?

634
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,674
We are.

635
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,514
You know how icy it
gets right out front.

636
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,269
Lester?

637
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,079
You know I hate
to do this, but...

638
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,192
I kind of
tweaked my back before,

639
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,112
getting the luggage
out of the car.

640
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,395
Oh, you poor baby.

641
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,631
So do you think
you could run in?

642
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,360
The passports are
in the safe. There's
some cash in there too.

643
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,039
Can you...
Will you do that for me?

644
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,879
Of course, hon.
Thanks.

645
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,990
Linda?

646
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,470
Hmm.

647
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,478
It's cold out there.

648
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,398
You're sweet.

649
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,429
Oh, uh.

650
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,120
Put your hood up, huh?

651
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,996
I'd hate for your
pretty face to freeze.
