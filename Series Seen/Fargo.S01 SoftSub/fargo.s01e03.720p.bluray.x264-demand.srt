1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,990
Okay.

2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,992
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit!

3
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,791
No, wait.
Tell him... tell him
I'll pay it all back.

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,317
I-- I-- I swear...
No, no...

5
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,914
Please!

6
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,320
For the love...

7
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,312
I got kids.

8
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,352
Don't move.

9
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,557
Please, please.

10
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,352
<i>She won't stop,
you know.</i>

11
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,038
<i>...first
prize is three fun-filled
days in Bismarck.</i>

12
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,839
<i>So get your entries in
lickety-split.</i>

13
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,115
<i>The contest ends Friday.</i>

14
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,830
<i>Pleased to meet you.</i>

15
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,838
<i>So, uh, this is
where he worked?
Yeah...</i>

16
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
in accounting.

17
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,119
Just typing away
and this other fella
comes in,

18
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,431
drags poor Phil
out by the necktie.

19
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,193
Nice guy, too.

20
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,715
Super. Such a pity.

21
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,870
Gambling problem,
I heard.

22
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,519
You don't say?
I heard drugs.

23
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,956
I heard he,
like, slept with
a 13-year-old girl.

24
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,394
For Pete's sake, Bob!
Don't spread rumors
about the poor man.

25
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
No, it was
gambling, for sure.

26
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,595
I got the security tape
queued up downstairs.

27
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,670
Want to see that?

28
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,750
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

29
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,554
Hard to tell much.

30
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,239
Like I said.

31
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,518
Can you freeze
it there?

32
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,671
You say you found
the victim's clothes
in the garage?

33
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,433
Phil? Yeah.

34
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,116
Lab says the fella
cut 'em off with a knife?
Damn peculiar.

35
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,271
So, you think
this is your guy?

36
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,352
The one who killed
all those people
over in Bemidji?

37
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,193
Could be.

38
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,272
It's a nasty enough fella.

39
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,840
Who are you?

40
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,230
Great job, okay?

41
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,959
In through the nose and
out through the mouth.

42
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,319
Ladies, you are
looking great, okay?
Keep up the good work.

43
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,073
Well, hello, you.

44
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,440
You got bronzer on
your blackmail note.

45
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,595
Listen, listen, listen.
I swear on my--

46
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,832
You couldn't
find a smaller room
for us to talk in?

47
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,990
What?

48
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,116
Nothing.

49
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,317
Look, this...
this whole thing,

50
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,517
huge mistake.
Okay, I never meant...

51
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,431
See, I just...
I just wanted something
for Don, you know?

52
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,718
You done?

53
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,871
Here it is.
You're screwed.

54
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,873
You made a choice
and this is the consequence.

55
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,394
Me, I'm the consequence.

56
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,473
Please, please
don't tell Helena.

57
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,755
I don't work for Helena.

58
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,232
I work for her husband,
Stavros Milos,
the Supermarket King.

59
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,880
Oh, my God.

60
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,520
Oh.

61
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,274
Here. Squeeze this.
Yeah.

62
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,312
Oh, no.

63
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,040
You ready?

64
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,717
I've got two questions
and one comment, understand?

65
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,670
First question,
why $43,613?

66
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,477
Gonna start a Turkish bath.

67
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,153
See, back in
the Ottoman Empire--

68
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,392
Second question,
what do you know?

69
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,711
About what?

70
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,440
Stavros, the guy
you're blackmailing.

71
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,512
You wrote a note,
"I know about the money."

72
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,954
What do you know?

73
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,829
Uh... Nothing, really.

74
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,755
I mean, Helena told
the story so much...

75
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,038
about her husband
and how he lies
about his money.

76
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,592
So you're blackmailing
a guy for something but
you don't know what it is?

77
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,391
Are you ready
for the comment?

78
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,150
You're an idiot.

79
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,432
Good news.
I'm taking over.

80
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,994
Taking over what?

81
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,474
The blackmail.

82
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,677
You work for the guy.

83
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,194
Exactly.

84
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,797
And now you work for me.

85
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm confused.

86
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,351
That's okay. I'm not.

87
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,433
The first thing we need
is a new blackmail letter.

88
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,838
Hey, Maggie.
Lieutenant in?

89
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,830
What?

90
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,351
He's in the bathroom.

91
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,960
Ah.

92
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,154
Um...

93
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,594
Lieutenant?

94
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,080
What?

95
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,231
I'm takin' a dump.

96
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,079
Yeah, so, listen.

97
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,471
About that triple
homicide over Bemidji?

98
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,031
Oh, for Christ's sake,
talk to your shift
commander.

99
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,557
Well, yeah,
I would, you know,
but he don't listen to me.

100
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,552
Who's this?
Dan Hoskins?

101
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,998
Uh, no, sir.

102
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,116
Gus Grimly.

103
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,078
Grimly?

104
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,471
For Christ's sake,
aren't you animal
control?

105
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,679
No. I... I just sub
for those fellas
sometimes.

106
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,552
So, listen...
I pulled this car over
the other night, a speeder.

107
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,511
And, uh... well,
I let the guy go with
a warning, but then...

108
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,637
Well, it turns out...

109
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,397
I ran the fella's plates
on account of what you said

110
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,474
at the briefing about
watching our P's and Q's.

111
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,991
And, uh... well,
it turns out that the car

112
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,276
belongs to one
of the... victims.

113
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,633
One of the...
What?

114
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,832
Are you kidding me?
No, sir.

115
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,358
Lester Nygaard,
that's who the car
is registered to,

116
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,318
but he wasn't
driving, obviously.

117
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,110
So I'm thinking maybe
it might be the killer.

118
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,190
Shut up.

119
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,398
For Christ's sake!
You pulled over
a stolen car

120
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,399
and let the guy
go with a warning?
Well-- It wasn't--

121
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,759
See, it wasn't
listed as stolen, so--

122
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,071
And now, I checked
this morning,

123
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,640
and it's impounded,
as of yesterday, so--

124
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,949
Stop.

125
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,075
It's goddamn Sioux Falls
all over again.

126
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,310
Yes, sir.

127
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,950
What... what's
Sioux Falls?

128
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,110
Shut up.

129
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,911
You're gonna look
through every goddamn
mug book in the state.

130
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,799
Yes, sir.
And you're
gonna find this guy.

131
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,870
Yes, sir.

132
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,559
And you're gonna
call Bemidji...

133
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,078
and you're gonna tell them
that you screwed up. You.

134
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,039
Absolving the rest of us
of any dipshittery.

135
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,555
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

136
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,594
<i>He can afford it,
your brother.</i>

137
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,433
<i>Kitty said he just
got a big promotion</i>

138
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,079
<i>after only
working there a year.</i>

139
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
<i>Kitty said they
also got one of those</i>

140
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,000
<i>fancy new
surround sound systems.</i>

141
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,318
<i>Guess I married
the wrong Nygaard.</i>

142
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,596
<i>Or what?
What are you gonna do?</i>

143
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,354
<i>You can't even face me
when we're having sex.</i>

144
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,435
<i>Lester,
I need you to get
down on the ground.</i>

145
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,079
<i>Hold on. Don't...
There's nothing down--</i>

146
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,150
<i>Lester, on the ground.</i>

147
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,276
<i>That's not-- I
didn't do nothing.</i>

148
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,477
<i>I didn't...
I just got home.
I just got home and...</i>

149
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,313
<i>Now, hold on. Hold on.</i>

150
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,073
<i>Don't... There's
nothing down there--</i>

151
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,719
<i>There's-- That is not--</i>

152
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,075
I didn't do nothing!
I didn't do nothing!

153
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,278
<i>I just came home.
I just came-- Oh, jeez.</i>

154
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,916
Yeah, so I
closed it out with
a spare and a strike.

155
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,430
Two-twenty-two.

156
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,670
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

157
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,114
Lester.

158
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,835
Well, I'll be--
Hey... Lester.

159
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,634
I should've called,
I guess, huh?

160
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,519
Please.
What can we do for ya?

161
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,674
Well, I thought I'd...
do some work. You know,
get back to it.

162
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,399
You're so brave.

163
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,199
Jeez, ya think
you're ready?

164
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,390
Think so.

165
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,951
Yeah, I mean,
you can't just sit around
the house, you know?

166
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,354
Good. Okay.

167
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,750
You want to do
some filing or...

168
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,355
I was gonna run
out to see Gina Hess.

169
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,477
Who's that?
The widow Hess.

170
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,916
Got some papers
for her to sign.

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,036
Yeah.

172
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,351
On account of Sam,
her husband.
He got murdered.

173
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,635
Bo!

174
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,473
Sorry,
was that insensitive?

175
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,870
Anyways, did you want
to take that over to her?

176
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,360
Which'd actually
help me out a lot,

177
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,591
'cause I got a dentist
thing, you know, so...

178
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,670
Um...

179
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,678
But, I mean,
if you're not ready...
No, I'll...

180
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,592
It's the 6-14 C, right?

181
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,080
And D, yeah.

182
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,279
Did you get
the soup I sent ya?

183
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,113
Oh, yes, thank you.

184
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,878
Well, I better
grab those forms.

185
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,076
Mmm-hmm.

186
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,356
Here we go. Come on.
Got it.

187
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,634
Oh!
Hey.

188
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,355
Whatcha doing
here, loser?

189
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,796
Yeah, loser.
Whatcha doing here?

190
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,758
Come on, boys.
I'm just here
to see your mom.

191
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,990
Yeah?
Why, you want
to do her?

192
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,230
Yeah, loser,
you gonna--

193
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,676
Wait, he's not
really gonna have sex
with our ma, is he?

194
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,035
He better not.
Nobody's--

195
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,235
God damn it,
get off the guy.

196
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,751
And quit shooting
up the lawn sign.

197
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,516
Never gonna sell
this place, you keep
filling it with arrows.

198
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,120
Yeah, they've sure
got a lot of energy, huh?

199
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,115
They're wolves.

200
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,556
What do you want?

201
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,790
Well, ma'am. I'm--

202
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,197
My name is Lester Nygaard
and I'm from Munk Insurance.

203
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,800
Oh.

204
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,634
Well, why didn't
you say so? Uh...

205
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,638
Yeah, come on in.
Thank you.

206
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,518
Do you want a whiskey?

207
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,670
Oh, uh...

208
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,033
Have a seat.
Oh, thank you.

209
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,760
Sorry about the boys.
They're animals.

210
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,830
Really.

211
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,550
They fart on everything.
The walls, each other.

212
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,792
When do I get my money?

213
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,390
Uh...

214
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,119
Can I... can I?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

215
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,435
Well, um...

216
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,752
First of all, I would
just like to say

217
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,714
how sorry I am
about your husband.
Mmm.

218
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,876
We went to high
school together and...

219
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,036
Yeah, that's sweet.

220
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,157
But about the money...

221
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,639
Yeah. Uh...

222
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,474
Well, I have
some forms.

223
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,511
Now in cases
where the deceased

224
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,313
was killed--
Murdered, I mean...

225
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,800
Mmm-hmm.

226
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,679
...the process is
a little different.

227
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,716
What do you mean?

228
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,836
Well, and I'm going
through this myself.

229
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,274
We have to wait
for the coroner--

230
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,154
Wait a minute.

231
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,833
You're that guy.

232
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,149
I saw you at the cemetery.

233
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,350
Oh, yeah, that's...

234
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,831
Your wife was killed, right?
And the Chief of Police.

235
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,875
He was murdered at
your house, right?

236
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,155
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

237
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,430
I think you better
have that whiskey.

238
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,920
You should
get back out there.
You know... date.

239
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,354
You're not
a bad looking guy.

240
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,511
A little small, maybe.

241
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,835
Did you like her?

242
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,154
Your wife.

243
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,311
My husband was...

244
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,875
Well, you knew
him, right?

245
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,474
Didn't get better.

246
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,916
Yeah, how did you...

247
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,434
In Vegas.
Oh.

248
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,399
I was a dancer.

249
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,759
Well, a stripper,
if we're being honest.

250
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,038
You ever been
to a strip club?

251
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,032
No. No.

252
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,077
Seriously?
No, I mean,

253
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,311
you know, I always
wanted to, but...

254
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,198
Well, I was good.

255
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,350
Yeah.

256
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,713
I got great tits...

257
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,316
and I'm super flexible.
Oh, wow.

258
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,197
Hi.

259
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,912
And that is how I met Sam.

260
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,071
And he started flashing
all this money around,

261
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,034
telling me how he was gonna
take me away from it all.

262
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,310
Blah, blah, blah.

263
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,230
I was 19... so stupid.
Hmm.

264
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,715
And now here I am
stuck in the Yukon with
my two mongoloid sons.

265
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,439
Oh, they're
not so bad.

266
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,035
I've taken shits
I wanna live with
more than them.

267
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,190
Yeah.

268
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,316
Now...

269
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,750
So, tell me,
handsome--

270
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,870
Oh...

271
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,593
What's a girl got to do
to get that money...

272
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,232
quick?

273
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,192
'Cause I will
do anything.

274
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,830
Oh, God.

275
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,639
Sorry, man.

276
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,439
Not again.

277
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,591
Jesus.

278
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,400
What'll it be, stretch?

279
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,199
I need some Adderall.

280
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,634
You got a test,
is that it?

281
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,632
Big final, need to
pull an all-nighter?

282
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,518
Exactly. High dosage, too.

283
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,594
Just pretend
I'm a 300-pound 9-year-old
who can't finish a sentence.

284
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,399
Here we go.
30 milligrams.

285
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,233
Don't take two of these
and think you're gonna nap.

286
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,515
It's basically speed.

287
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,354
So why don't we say--
That'll work.

288
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,190
How about
a zombie kit?

289
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,195
What's that now?

290
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,516
Zombie kit.
Shotgun, machete,
some Bactine.

291
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,716
It's a side business.

292
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,634
I make up these knapsacks
for the zombie apocalypse.

293
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,837
You know,
in case the undead
come back to life

294
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,957
and the world
gets all dog-eat-dog.

295
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,517
It's already
dog-eat-dog, friend.

296
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,952
Not sure what
worse a bunch of
zombies could do.

297
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,877
Oh, my gosh!

298
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,189
Look at you.

299
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,840
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you.

300
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,435
So that's your
uniform, then?

301
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,273
Yeah, yeah, this is it.

302
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,790
And you got a gun
and everything.

303
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
Nah, it's made
out of wood.

304
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,160
Seriously?

305
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,272
No, no, it's
a real gun.

306
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,317
Oh.

307
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,551
So, how's your
dad, then?
Great.

308
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,279
Yeah, still got
the restaurant so...

309
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,430
Fun.
Yeah.

310
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,675
So, I heard about
what happened.

311
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,790
The murders.

312
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,439
Jeez.

313
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,830
Yeah, yeah.
It's a muddy road so...

314
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,320
I bet.

315
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,434
You dating anyone?

316
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,318
Me? No.

317
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,516
No, you know me.

318
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,831
I'm just an old
ship captain.

319
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,432
You know, I'm
married to the sea.

320
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,470
So, you live in
St. Paul, then?

321
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,596
Yeah.

322
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,876
Moved, like, right
after high school.

323
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,316
Nothing ever happens
in Bemidji, ya know?

324
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,959
And Ted got the job.

325
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,833
Oh, yeah, yeah.
How's Ted?

326
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,639
Good.

327
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,200
We're divorced now.

328
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,160
On account of...
he had intercourse with
his physical therapist.

329
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,793
Oh, jeez.
But I'm doing good.

330
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,200
Great, really.

331
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,671
Been meeting men
on the Internet.

332
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,830
Online dating?

333
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,990
Oh, yeah.

334
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,878
So, that's been fun.
Really?

335
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,236
'Cause sometimes,
you know, you hear
stories, so...

336
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,758
Well, from time to time,
you get a bad egg.

337
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,357
Like, there was a fella...
had a harelip.

338
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,832
And another stole
all my panties.

339
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,876
But then I met Roger...
Mmm.

340
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,351
...and we've been dating
about six months now.

341
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,433
He took me to Acapulco.

342
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,279
Ooh.
Yeah.

343
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,640
Except he got
a spider bite,

344
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,240
like, on his neck.

345
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,595
And at first we thought
it was a mosquito,

346
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,760
but it turns out
the spider laid eggs
in there or something,

347
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,435
'cause we were in
the middle of doing it

348
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,473
and all these
baby spiders popped
out of his neck.

349
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,196
Jeez.

350
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,317
Yeah, lesson learned,
you know?

351
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,314
From now on, I am staying
right here in Minnesota.

352
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,198
Sounds right.

353
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,034
So... you girls ready
to order some food?

354
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,670
King!

355
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,233
Here, King!

356
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,276
King!

357
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,474
Here, King!

358
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,518
Kingie-the-King!

359
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,874
King!

360
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,793
Here, boy! Here, King!

361
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,110
King!

362
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,353
Come to daddy!

363
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,154
Kingie-the-King!

364
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,719
Where's my
little monster?

365
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,760
Here, boy.

366
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,714
Come on, King.

367
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,350
King!

368
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,350
What the hell?

369
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,480
King!

370
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,594
<i>...before the worst happens,</i>

371
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,956
<i>call the best,
Bo Munk Insurance.</i>

372
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,316
<i>So come on down to
Bo Munk Insurance</i>

373
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,313
<i>and see me, Bo Munk,
before it's too late.</i>

374
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,994
Jesus.

375
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,233
Oh, God.

376
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,960
Is that...

377
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,190
Oh...

378
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,830
Lester?

379
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,673
We're all of us
going for Arby's.

380
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,559
Do ya... Can I
bring ya anything?

381
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,680
No. No, thank you.

382
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,798
Okay, well, see you
in a bit, then.

383
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,193
Oh!

384
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,559
You scared me there.
I thought the place was...

385
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,512
I was...

386
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,920
Oh, uh...

387
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,356
Well, that's...
excuse me.

388
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,954
Hello.
<i>Uh, Mr. Nygaard, please.</i>

389
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,679
This is Lester.
<i>Yeah, Mr. Nygaard,</i>

390
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,876
<i>this is Duluth Impound.</i>

391
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,872
<i>Just want to let you know
we got your car.</i>

392
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,189
Uh, pardon?

393
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,439
<i>Your car, license 628633QI.</i>

394
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,115
<i>Got towed yesterday from
Phoenix Farms on Elm.</i>

395
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,236
In Duluth?

396
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,356
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

397
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,591
Oh, just take
anything you like.

398
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,716
So what have I got to--

399
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,871
<i>Just need proof of current
registration and $150</i>

400
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,474
<i>and we'll
release the car to you.</i>
Okay, well, well--

401
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,994
<i>We'll take cash only.</i>
Uh...

402
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,153
Thanks for calling.
<i>Yeah, remember. Cash only.</i>

403
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,879
Yeah.

404
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,477
So...
what can I do for
you fellas, then?

405
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,116
'Cause we're...
kind of busy right now.

406
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,950
Hmm?

407
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,916
What's that?

408
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,755
No, sorry, I...

409
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,274
Sam Hess.

410
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,911
Are you fellas, uh,
family of his?

411
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,115
Lester, we saw you
with the widow.

412
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,270
Looked like you
were having a party.

413
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,919
You celebrating, maybe?

414
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,718
No, come on.

415
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,150
God.

416
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,112
I got a deaf cousin.

417
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,994
Oh, uh...

418
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,358
Hi.

419
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,838
Uh, excuse me.

420
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,350
Uh...

421
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,197
Sorry about the door.
Not sure how that happened.

422
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,600
Not interrupting
anything?

423
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,036
No, no, no.
Just giving
these guys a quote.

424
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:50,230
So, like I said, you know,
it's 300 a year,
plus 200 up front.

425
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,113
Okay.
Look through that
and give me a call.

426
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,716
Sounds good.
Talk soon, Lester. Deputy?

427
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,793
Who were those
fellas, then?

428
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,994
What's that?

429
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,434
Not from around here,
I'm guessing.

430
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,150
Yeah, yeah.
From the city, I think.

431
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,755
Said they were going to...
Where was it again?

432
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,911
Mexico? Yeah.

433
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,351
Had some questions
about vacation insurance.

434
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,557
So, uh, speaking
of insurance...

435
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,474
Now, look, I talked
to Bill, so if this is
about the case...

436
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,200
Oh, no, just looking
for a little advice.

437
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,476
With Vern dead,
and I know we're
not talking specifics,

438
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,199
but with him dying,
I got to thinking.

439
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,071
You know,
I'm a single person,
but I got my dad and stuff.

440
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,753
So I got to thinking,
what would happen
to him, then.

441
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,956
Yeah?
Yeah.

442
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,398
No, yeah. Very...

443
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,437
Because a lot of
girls your age,

444
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,352
they don't think
about these things.

445
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,194
You know the...
posthumous and so on.

446
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,556
So, I thought
I'd come see you,
you know.

447
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,960
Maybe buy a policy.
Oh!

448
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,673
And I got all my
info here, you know.

449
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,752
Social Security
and the likes.

450
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,513
Oh, jeez. So sorry.

451
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,829
You need some
help with that?

452
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,030
No, I got it.

453
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,717
Okay. Well... Uh...

454
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,636
Okay, well... Uh...

455
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,792
I got a lot--
You know there
are lots of choices,

456
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,030
policy-wise.

457
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,397
And of course
I could give you the
whole... long speech.

458
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,550
Please, I got time.

459
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,040
Well, I could give you
the whole long speech,

460
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,113
but, you know,
it's
all in here.

461
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,833
All the details,
really.

462
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,751
Oh, and I gotta
close up real soon.

463
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,674
Okay.

464
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,634
Thank you for your time.
That's okay.

465
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,310
Uh...

466
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,719
Look over all that stuff
and give me a call.

467
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,636
Bye.

468
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,838
He killed my goddamn dog.

469
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,958
You said you
were gonna find him.

470
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,474
He raised his price.

471
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,835
$1 million?

472
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,389
He killed my
damn dog and now
he wants $1 million?

473
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,631
Eat a turd
is my response!

474
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,393
And if it's your ex-wife?

475
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,676
Son, you think
my ex-wife killed
the damn dog?

476
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,956
It wasn't the wife,
ass-hat!

477
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,918
She's mean, but she's got
a human heart in her chest.

478
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,992
Hell, she loved
the damn animal
more than me.

479
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,230
No, this is different.

480
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,870
Some sick bastard gets off
on hurting little things.

481
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,719
Who else knows
about the money?

482
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,317
Nobody. Nothing to know.

483
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,160
Must be something...

484
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,799
or he wouldn't be
blackmailing you.

485
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,112
No, nobody knows.

486
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,357
Nobody can know.
It's impossible.

487
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,794
Meaning?

488
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,158
You like that?

489
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,633
St. Lawrence.

490
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,594
Patron saint of hard-asses.
Burned alive by the Romans.

491
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,518
You know what he said?

492
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,156
"Turn me over.
I'm done on this side."

493
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,311
That's a goddamn saint.

494
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,278
You Greek Orthodox?

495
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,477
Why, 'cause I'm Greek?

496
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,475
Let's just say
God and I have a...

497
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,718
You ever make a New
Year's resolution?

498
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,191
Stop smoking?
Lose weight?

499
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,760
And then...

500
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,474
Hell, I don't know.
You're the expert.

501
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,912
I want the damn
dog killer found.

502
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,958
I'd like to move
onto the property
till this thing's over.

503
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,434
He came to the house once.
He might do it again.

504
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,958
There's an in-law
next to the garage.
Semenko will show you.

505
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,679
But I am losing patience.

506
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,876
Get it done.

507
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,071
It's goddamn hot in here.

508
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,711
You looked
through all those?

509
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,674
What?

510
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,630
It's just...

511
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,438
your dad made
a mistake.

512
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,115
I let a guy go
that I shouldn't have.

513
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,551
And now I got to call
this other jurisdiction

514
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,519
and tell them that, uh...

515
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,958
'cause of me their
suspect got away.

516
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,670
Hmm.

517
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,438
Probably better to do it
in person, don't you think?

518
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,355
What's this, then?

519
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,669
Our suspect.

520
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,876
Oh, yeah?

521
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,111
Security camera caught him
kidnapping the naked fella.

522
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,190
Kidnapped him naked?

523
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,316
No, dressed.

524
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,436
Phil McCormick.

525
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,152
Our perp cut his clothes off
in the parking garage.

526
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,469
No kiddin'?

527
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,710
Yeah.

528
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,793
So, here's the thing.

529
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,031
I took the photo and
I showed it to Lester.

530
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,554
Did what?
Not officially.

531
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,915
No, I told him
I was interested

532
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
in some insurance,
which is true.

533
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,914
And then I just happened
to let him see the photo

534
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,071
and you should've
seen his face.

535
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,310
I mean, it's like
he saw a ghost.

536
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,153
Lester knows
this fella all right

537
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,436
and not from
some casual chat.

538
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,318
Got to say,
I'm super ticked here.

539
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,834
Yeah, okay,
but before you--

540
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,314
I told you
don't pester the guy.

541
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,073
I said, he's not a--

542
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,514
And then, what do you--
I never said he was--

543
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,637
And then what do you do?

544
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,120
The next day even?
Yeah, but...

545
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,238
What if he
is involved, you know?
I mean, think about it.

546
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,515
No!

547
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,035
The guy just lost his wife
and you're boxing his ears.

548
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,236
Yeah, I know, but...

549
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,436
Solve the naked guy.

550
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,590
That's the case
I gave you.

551
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,071
If this is your suspect,
put out an APB and
we'll get him in.

552
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,800
Sure, but, you know,
what if he and Lester...

553
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,192
You know what?
Just tell them the truth
and say you're sorry.

554
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,634
That's what you
always tell me.

555
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,790
You're a good girl.

556
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,916
As far as you know.

557
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,959
Just sit there, I'll be...
I'll be back.

558
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,919
Yeah, hi, I'm, uh...

559
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,037
I just drove over
from Duluth PD.

560
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,397
I need to speak with someone
about Lester Nygaard.

561
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,796
Hey, yeah, hi.

562
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,078
I'm Deputy Solverson.
What can I do for you?

563
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,429
Well, um...

564
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,793
Maybe we should
talk at my desk?

565
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,950
Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,076
Yeah? All right.

567
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,192
Have a seat.

568
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,796
You want some coffee?
The guys just brewed
a pot, so...

569
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,870
Uh...

570
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,111
No, I... I just
got to...

571
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,080
I'm good.
Okay.

572
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,597
So, uh... three days back
I'm on patrol, you know,

573
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,312
and I pull this guy over,
silver Taurus...

574
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,517
ran a stop sign.

575
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,910
And I...

576
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,074
I gave him
a warning, see.

577
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,712
But then, I don't know,
I just-- I had a feeling.

578
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,193
What kind of feeling?

579
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,794
A bad feeling.

580
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,633
Real suspicious, like.

581
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,037
So, I ran his plates
and it turns out

582
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,160
that the car was registered
to one of your victims.

583
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,560
What?

584
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,790
Yeah.

585
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,712
Lester Nygaard.

586
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,393
Son of a--

587
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,032
He told me his car
was in the shop so...

588
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,156
Oh, yeah?

589
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,316
Yeah.

590
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,591
Well, here's the thing. Um...

591
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,074
Lester wasn't driving.

592
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,234
Now, I know that now
because I checked the
plate but at the time...

593
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,437
This fella, maybe?

594
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,595
Holy cow.

595
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,033
Yeah.

596
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,477
That's...
I think that's him.

597
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,911
How did you?
Security camera...

598
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,356
caught him over in St. Paul
kidnapping an accountant.

599
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,635
No kidding?
Yeah.

600
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,632
So, listen, one thing
I'm not quite clear on.

601
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,598
You said you
only found out later

602
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,115
that it wasn't
Lester driving.

603
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,793
But, I mean...

604
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,270
you checked the fella's
license and registration,
didn't you?

605
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,199
Well...

606
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,432
You see, I asked...

607
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,278
but he... threatened me.

608
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,558
And I...

609
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,114
It's... it's--

610
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,920
I know,
it's no excuse but--

611
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,832
I...

612
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,957
He's a really
dangerous looking fella

613
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,238
and he had these
really scary, uh, eyes.

614
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,276
And I just--

615
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,390
Dad?

616
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,550
Yeah?

617
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,474
Could I get a dollar
for the vending machine?

618
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,199
Yeah.

619
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,633
Hold on. Yeah.

620
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,191
Actually they...
they give us these tokens.

621
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,996
Just put that
in the coin slot.

622
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,560
Great. Thanks.

623
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,956
How old?

624
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,759
Greta? Yeah, 12.

625
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,392
She's a real good kid.

626
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,074
Her mom at home?

627
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,434
No.

628
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,991
It's just us, 10 years now.

629
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,837
They're outta M&M's.
Ah.

630
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,234
So, you two
drove all the way
from Duluth, huh?

631
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,553
Yeah.

632
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,871
Well, uh...

633
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,674
I was gonna grab dinner.
There's a good
burger place nearby.

634
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,276
So, you two want to join me
before you head back?

635
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,597
Oh, no, no, no,
we don't want
to be a bother.

636
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,200
It's no bother.

637
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,352
We'll talk about
the guy, you know.
See what you remember.

638
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,193
Maybe a clue drops out.

639
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,556
It's Lou's.
Just a couple of blocks
up the street.

640
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,758
Let me just put
an APB out on this guy
and I'll be right there.

641
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,790
She seemed nice, huh?

642
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,234
What?

643
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,800
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

644
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,119
Just you two?
No.

645
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,114
A very pretty lady
will be joining us.

646
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,320
Duluth PD?

647
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,073
Yes, sir.

648
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,392
You associated
with Ben Schmidt?
Think he's a lieutenant now.

649
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,551
Yes, sir. He's my boss.

650
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,034
Kind of a prick.

651
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,076
That's the one.

652
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,196
Yeah.

653
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,038
Yeah, we had a deal
together once
in Sioux Falls...

654
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,554
joint task force situation.

655
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,950
Boy, that was a rodeo.

656
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,680
Hey, Dad.
Hey, sweetie.

657
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,275
I think I'm gonna need
a milkshake tonight.

658
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,079
Better make it a double.

659
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,595
Me, too?

660
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,275
Uh, yeah, okay.
You gotta eat
something green.

661
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,432
Same here and some
burgers all around.

662
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,590
Sounds good.

663
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,154
So... it's a bit
strange, huh?

664
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,672
This Lester
fella never reporting
his car was stolen?

665
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,674
It is, yeah.
Pretty sure he's mixed up
in some nasty business.

666
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,476
So, you got
a boyfriend, then?

667
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,190
No.

668
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,116
Pretty girl like you?

669
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,396
Too young
for a boyfriend.

670
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,314
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

671
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,392
Hey, you ever
heard of a spider

672
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,437
laying eggs in
a person's neck?

673
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,476
What's that now?

674
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,597
Friend of mine
said it happened
to a friend of hers.

675
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,433
Gross.
Yeah.

676
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,079
Said they were...

677
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,120
He was sleeping
and all these baby
spiders just ran right out.

678
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,516
Not sure if I want
to live in a world

679
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,069
where something like that
can happen to a person.

680
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,396
I put bourbon
in one of 'em.

681
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,555
Whoever finds it
wins a prize.

682
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,199
He's only kidding.

683
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,073
Ooh, wait. No, I win.

684
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,993
Burgers will
be right up.

685
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,275
Thank you.

686
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,150
Hey there, Lester.

687
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,674
Hey.

688
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,834
So, which one
makes the biggest hole?

689
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,677
<i>And behold
the daughter of Pharaoh</i>

690
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,355
<i>came down to wash
herself in the river.</i>

691
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,875
<i>And her maids walked
by the river's brink.</i>

692
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,316
<i>And when she saw
the basket in the sedges,</i>

693
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,312
<i>she sent one of
her maids for it.</i>

694
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,150
<i>And when it was brought,
she opened it</i>

695
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,517
<i>and saw within
an infant crying.</i>

696
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,274
<i>And having compassion
on it, she said,</i>

697
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,353
<i>"This is one of the babes
of the Hebrews."</i>

698
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,315
<i>And she adopted him for
a son and called him Moses,</i>

699
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,917
<i>saying, "Because I took
him out of the water."</i>

700
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,431
<i>One day, after Moses
had grown up,</i>

701
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,355
<i>he went out among his people
and saw their affliction.</i>

702
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,560
<i>He saw an Egyptian beating
a Hebrew, his brethren.</i>

703
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,278
<i>Looking this way and that way,
and seeing no people,</i>

704
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,156
<i>Moses slew the Egyptian
and hid him in the sand.</i>
