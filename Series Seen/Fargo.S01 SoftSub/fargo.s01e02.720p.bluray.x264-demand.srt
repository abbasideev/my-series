1
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,474
We're here about Hess.

2
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,711
Oh, yeah,
you want Gold...

3
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,917
Uh, Max Gold.
He's on his way.

4
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,233
You Gold?

5
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,879
Yeah.
And you're...

6
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,600
We're from Fargo.

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,593
Good. They, uh,
said they were
sending someone.

8
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,273
They were right.

9
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,996
There's no library
in this town.

10
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,037
Why is there no
library in this town?

11
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,830
Uh, cutbacks?

12
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,711
He thinks every town
should have a library.

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,553
I agree.

14
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,313
Tell him I agree.

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,439
Fargo sent us to find out
what happened to Hess.

16
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,040
He got stabbed in
the back of the head

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,318
at a strip club is
what happened to him.

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,396
Okay.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,278
Okay. Okay,
all right.

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,351
Do you believe
this was connected
to the business?

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,193
I...

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,953
Things have been quiet.

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,557
No labor BS,
no skirmishes with
other trucking concerns.

24
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,676
So?

25
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,558
There was a guy.

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,472
I told this to Fargo.

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,155
He came by the garage
the day it happened.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,200
Brown hair,
just under 6 feet,
not young, not old,

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,199
had a cut on
his forehead here.

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,513
Said he just wanted
to take a look at Sam,
which he did, then he left.

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,236
Look...

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,436
Hold on a second.

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,110
He was my
friend, okay?

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,996
Sam.

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,076
Sure, he was a jerk,
but deep down...

36
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,712
All I'm saying is,
you're gonna
find him, right?

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,790
The guy who did it.

38
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,479
We'll find him.

39
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,190
How's your
head, then?

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,078
Oh, yeah, it's okay.

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,800
Aches still, but...

42
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,877
You try that
hot dish?
Oh, yeah.

43
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,599
Real good.
Yeah.

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,591
So, you know...
Kitty and I were talking

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,990
and we think you should
move in here for a while.

46
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,156
Just stay with us,
you know,

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,631
until you get the house
cleaned up or sold.

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,235
Why the heck
would I sell the house?

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,436
Oh.

50
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,400
Not saying you
have to go that way.

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,120
Just, you know,
stay a few days,

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,078
until we get
it cleaned up.

53
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,514
Cops left a real mess.

54
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,790
Oh, yeah? Mmm-hmm.

55
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,758
Yeah, the crime
scene and all.

56
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,196
Really turned
the place upside down.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,555
Looking for clues,
I suppose.

58
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,635
How you doing?
You all right? Okay.

59
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,709
You don't have
to do that.

60
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,156
They were piling up.

61
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,756
Vern told me
this story once.

62
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,035
When he was a rookie,

63
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,591
he had a boss who
couldn't tell his shoe
from his foot.

64
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,956
Got killed by
a hail stone.

65
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,760
Just standing
in the parking lot
at the Dairy Queen,

66
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,433
having a milkshake.

67
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,309
Hail stone comes down,
size of a softball,
crushes his skull.

68
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,998
What flavor?

69
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,878
Strawberry, I think.

70
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,798
I was thinking about
when my dad got shot.

71
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,798
Traffic stop, yeah?
Mmm.
Yeah.

72
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,676
He pulled over
the fellas

73
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,117
that robbed Callahan's
and stole the snow plow.

74
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,510
They came to
tell me at school.

75
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,160
I was in algebra.

76
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,435
And he's okay,
you know?

77
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,070
Got the limp, of course,
but, uh, they caught
the guys, so...

78
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,796
The little one
he even got probation.

79
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,430
Convinced the jury
it was a Stockholm
syndrome deal.

80
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,309
Okay, we got now
a list of who will come
by when and do what.

81
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,993
This is on
the due date,
you know?

82
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,869
Get you to the hospital,
bring you home, so,
you're covered.

83
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,155
Say, Bill,
I was thinking.

84
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,836
We should talk
to Lester Nygaard
first thing.

85
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,070
Lester? Ugh.

86
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,516
He already made
a statement back
at the hospital.

87
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,710
Yeah, I know.
I read it.

88
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,154
But, see, thing is,

89
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
Vern was on his way
to Lester's house

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,075
to talk to him
about Hess' murder,

91
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,197
you know, how possibly
Lester was involved.

92
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,396
Lester?

93
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,355
Ah.

94
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,716
Went to high school
with Lester. Uh...

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,520
Had to dissect a mouse
in Mrs. Knutson's class

96
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,239
and poor Lester fainted.

97
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,189
Well, yeah,
okay, but...

98
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,351
Girl had her monthly
once in gym class.

99
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,397
There goes Lester
fainting again.

100
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,472
Right, so he...
he doesn't like blood,
but still...

101
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,074
Plus,
this Hess murder,

102
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,154
got to believe that's
about the cutthroat world
of regional trucking.

103
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,118
Yeah.

104
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,194
So it's, uh,
just coincidence,
you're saying?

105
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,873
Hess gets killed
and then,

106
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,679
the massacre at Lester's
house the next day.

107
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,194
Exactly.

108
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,079
See, I'm thinking
this is home invasion.

109
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,356
You know,
it's a drifter
or some such.

110
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,997
Drug related, maybe,
but not, you know,
Lester Nygaard.

111
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,070
Am I right, Ida?

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,560
You're not not right.

113
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,235
But, on these
high-profile deals, Bill,

114
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,200
it never hurts
to talk to the
eyewitnesses yourself.

115
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,396
"Take control
of the facts."

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,676
That's what Vern
always used to say.

117
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,039
Okay. Okay, good.

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,600
We go see Lester,

119
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,514
but, I do the talking.

120
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
Heya, Lester.
Bill.

121
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,719
Mr. Nygaard, uh,
we got some questions
we'd like...

122
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,309
This is Molly.
Deputy Solverson.

123
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,232
Sure. Nice to meet you.

124
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,710
Like I was saying, uh,
we got some questions,
so...

125
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,996
How you
holding up, Lester?
How's the head?

126
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,478
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, it hurts.

127
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,911
Uh, I got a little,
double vision still.

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,118
Jeez, well, you know,
if now's not a good time...

129
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,874
No, no,
I was just about to...

130
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,351
I want to help, you know?
It's just there's
so much work to do.

131
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,954
Yeah, sure.
It'll only take
a second.

132
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,710
Oh.

133
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,480
All I got is grape juice.
Hope that's okay. Ugh.

134
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,031
Pearl says it reminds her
of being a kid.

135
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,157
Said.

136
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,039
Uh, remember that gum.

137
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,033
That grape gum
that they had
when we were kids?

138
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,316
Heck, what was
that called?

139
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,590
Uh, so we got
your statement
from the hospital.

140
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,796
Oh, yeah.

141
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
Yeah, I...
I was real thorough
with those fellas.

142
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,674
I... I mean,
what I could remember.

143
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,433
Doctor says
I got a concussion.

144
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,794
Says if I was hit
any harder,

145
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,951
my brain could've swoll up
and leaked right out my ears.

146
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,560
Oh!

147
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,791
Thank gosh
that didn't happen.

148
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,190
Uh, in your statement,
you said that, um,

149
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,351
you came home
and found your wife,
that...

150
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,635
that she was
already dead.

151
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,393
Uh, downstairs, yeah.

152
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,631
I heard the washer going...

153
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,755
spin cycle...
and I...

154
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,071
Well, you know, she...
she was on the floor,

155
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,355
you know,
and there was
a lot of...

156
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
I never even
heard the guy.

157
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,075
Uh, just one minute
I'm, uh,
looking at her...

158
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,197
and the next...

159
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,115
So, uh, you don't
remember Chief Thurman
coming to the house then?

160
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
Oh, no, no.
I feel sick
about that, really.

161
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,792
I guess he saw
the guy breaking in.

162
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,872
Uh, no, Mr. Nygaard.
Uh...

163
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,073
Chief Thurman
came to talk to you

164
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,313
about a man you may
have met in the emergency
room the day previous.

165
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,274
Hmm, you don't say.

166
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,919
Look, Lester,

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,992
if this is too
hard for you,

168
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,116
you can just give us
the bare bones...

169
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,237
We got a witness
says that, uh...

170
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,792
she saw you and
this other fella arguing
about Sam Hess.

171
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,676
Who?

172
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,274
Sam Hess.

173
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,033
You remember Sam.
He used to beat you
up in high school.

174
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,110
What?

175
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,318
Oh, yeah, Sam had a thing
for ol' Lester here.

176
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,312
Used to chase him
around the schoolyard

177
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,278
till one or the other
ran out of gas.

178
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,477
You remember...
big kid. Uh...

179
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,075
What was that
name he called you?
Lester Nig...

180
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,152
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, Sam.

181
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,833
Yeah.

182
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,359
That... that was
a long time ago.
Oh...

183
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,432
But,

184
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,477
you were talking about him
in the emergency room,

185
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,710
so what's the story there?

186
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,600
Well, I, uh...

187
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,391
Hmm, it's real fuzzy,
but I might have said,
uh,

188
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,074
"My face is a mess."

189
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,954
Mess sounds like Hess,
so probably your, uh,

190
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,520
the witness just misheard.

191
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,478
Yeah, that's possible.

192
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,519
Can you describe
the fella?

193
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,676
Height, eye color,
that kind of thing?

194
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,355
You know,
the last few days,
they're real fuzzy.

195
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,400
Reason we asks is,
we got an operating
theory, okay?

196
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,077
This being the work
of a drifter...
or drifters...

197
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,913
possibly drug-related.

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,198
See...
I'm thinking this fella
you met at the hospital...

199
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,198
maybe he followed
you home...
That's not...

200
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,350
We don't both...
share that theory. So...

201
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,278
No, but... Yeah.

202
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,720
I... I'm a little scrambled
right now.

203
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,315
Uh, I... I got a concussion.
I'm not sure if I said that.

204
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,756
So, uh,
yeah, things...

205
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,360
things are
kind of fuzzy.

206
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,196
Well,
you know what?

207
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,475
I'm satisfied.

208
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,720
I've actually...
I got a few
more questions...

209
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,554
Yeah. Thanks for
the grape juice, Lester.
Uh...

210
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,233
Takes me back,
I tell you.

211
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,515
And, uh,
I'm gonna

212
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,080
look up the name
of that gum
when I get home.

213
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,311
Hubba Bubba.

214
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,751
Hubba Bubba, yeah,
yeah, Hubba Bubba.

215
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,513
We used to
crack up about that.

216
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,636
Do you remember
Hubba Bubba?

217
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,439
No.

218
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,433
If you need
anything, Lester,
you give us a call.

219
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,797
'Cause I'll tell you what,
this is a tragedy.

220
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,351
Straight-up,
dyed-in-the-wool
tragedy.

221
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,919
She was a good woman,
you know.

222
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,911
Good wife.

223
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,999
I...
I just keep
asking myself...

224
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,675
"Who could've done
a thing like this?"

225
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,232
Good morning,
young fella.

226
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,515
You have a package
for me?

227
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,034
All righty,
what's your name?

228
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,270
Why?

229
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,552
So I can find
the package.

230
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,510
Duluth.

231
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,080
I'm sorry?

232
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,436
The package is
addressed to "Duluth."

233
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,274
Eh, that's a city.
I need your name.

234
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,033
I told you my name.

235
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,873
Your name's Duluth?

236
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,076
Well, I'll need
to see some ID.

237
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,070
No.

238
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,230
What?

239
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,760
You heard me.

240
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,153
Well, I can't
give you your mail
if you don't show ID.

241
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,277
Sure you can.

242
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,397
All you gotta do
is look through those
packages over there,

243
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,915
find the one
addressed to "Duluth"
and then hand it to me.

244
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,516
Look, son,
we're in Duluth,

245
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,277
so technically,
all the mail is
addressed to "Duluth."

246
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,440
Am I gonna need
to come back there
and find it myself?

247
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,277
Sir?

248
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,434
Okay.

249
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,676
This is highly irregular.

250
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,433
No, highly irregular
is the time

251
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,115
I found a human foot
in a toaster oven.

252
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,237
This is just odd.

253
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,470
Uh.

254
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,632
I'm a minister, apparently.

255
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,790
Sir?

256
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,312
You have
a blessed day.
Mmm.

257
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,874
Missed a spot.

258
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,278
<i>You're looking at the 
Supermarket King of Minnesota,</i>

259
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,476
La Mercado Rey.

260
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,791
<i>Twenty-nine markets
in 15 counties...</i>

261
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,551
and it all
started right here,
in this office.

262
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,151
Next quarter, we're
expanding into Wisconsin
and the Dakotas.

263
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,040
By this time
next year,

264
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,073
I'll rule the whole
goddamn Midwest.

265
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,038
You see my mangoes?

266
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,839
Straight from Ecuador.
Kiwis, too.

267
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,470
That's what makes my stores
so goddamn superior.

268
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,155
I got mangoes in
goddamn January...

269
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,193
and the back of
a 90-year-old woman.

270
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,953
God damn it.

271
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,434
Who's the fire hydrant?

272
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,036
Semenko,

273
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,679
head of security.

274
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,433
You an Oilers fan?

275
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,797
Wally here is 1992
Farm League MVP.

276
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,872
Knocked 138 heads
career-wise.

277
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,350
Ain't that right, Wally?

278
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,990
Our mutual friend
said something about
a blackmail letter?

279
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,995
Found this on my
windshield last week.

280
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,312
What does this mean,
"I know about the money"?

281
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,710
What it means
don't matter.

282
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,870
It's blackmail.

283
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,713
I didn't bring you here
for what it means.

284
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,076
I brought you here
to make it stop.

285
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,150
Semenko said, "Don't do it."
He said...

286
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,720
he said, "Let me handle it."

287
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,837
But you don't get
to be <i>La Mercado Rey</i>

288
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,990
without knowing
when to delegate.

289
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,757
That's a pretty
specific number,
$43,613.

290
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,196
Hell, maybe
he wants to pay off
his student loans.

291
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,476
I don't know.
What matters is,
can you find the guy?

292
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,910
Hey, Dad,
got a good one
for you.

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,956
Oh, sorry.

294
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,272
Don't you know
closed door means
"keep out," boy,

295
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,437
or at least knock,
for shit's sake?

296
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,079
You'll like this.

297
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,356
What's a karate expert's
favorite beverage?

298
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,917
Kara-tea.

299
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,151
Get it?

300
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,278
Kara-tea.

301
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,273
It's... it's tea.

302
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,477
Son, get the hell out.

303
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,035
Nice to meet you.

304
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,433
Look, I can find the guy.

305
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,159
The question is,

306
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,391
what do you
want done with him
once he's found?

307
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,598
Send him packing.
Isn't that what they say?

308
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,955
Who says that?

309
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,235
In the movies.

310
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,714
I don't watch movies.

311
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,951
You don't watch movies?

312
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,635
Look...
this ain't complicated.

313
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,030
You don't get to be
the Supermarket
King of Minnesota

314
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,316
without making
a few enemies,
all right?

315
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,232
Start with my damn wife.

316
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,030
You think your wife's
blackmailing you?

317
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,713
You ever nail
a Greek woman?

318
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,077
After 40,
their pussies grow teeth.

319
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,150
And she ain't my wife.

320
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,993
She's my
soon-to-be ex-wife,

321
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,072
and she is suing
me for 50%.

322
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,309
Except now,
I'm starting to think

323
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,550
maybe 50% ain't
enough for her.

324
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,677
This is kind
of embarrassing,
but, uh,

325
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,116
would you sign
a copy of my book?

326
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,189
I'd be delighted.

327
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,677
You, uh, you want
something personal?

328
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,831
Yeah, could you put,
"To Frank Peterson,

329
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,957
"thanks for nailing
my blackmailer."

330
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,353
I'm just kidding.
Anything you want.
You're the writer.

331
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,829
In addition to the victims
in the basement,

332
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,480
that's Nygaard,
Mr. and Mrs.,

333
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,835
we're hearing
the chief of police

334
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,879
was shot-gunned
in the foyer.

335
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,790
That means entryway.

336
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,637
No description
yet of the suspect
or suspects,

337
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,632
but I told the new chief
over in Bemidji

338
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,509
we'd be on high alert
for anything that connects.

339
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,000
That means
suspicious persons

340
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,514
or jailhouse snitches
saying they know a thing.

341
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,039
Okay, let's get to it.

342
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,830
Grimly.

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,356
Animal Control guy called in sick again.
You're on duty.

344
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,669
Yes, sir.

345
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,112
I got "aurora borealis."
What about you? Over.

346
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,960
<i>I just put "northern lights." Over.</i>

347
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,191
Um, my dad's home
with dinner. Over.

348
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,158
<i>What's it tonight? Over.</i>

349
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,311
It looks like
burgers. Over.

350
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,119
And chicken nuggets.

351
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,237
And chicken nuggets.
Over and out.

352
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,669
You get
the dipping sauces?

353
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,393
Extra, even.

354
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,470
Oh.

355
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,869
Good day?

356
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,314
Yeah.

357
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,199
We, um,
we had an assembly...

358
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,398
and the principal
talked about bullying
and how bullying was wrong

359
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,392
and if we saw
somebody getting bullied,

360
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,392
we should
say something
or stop it.

361
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,030
And I raised my hand,

362
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,433
and I asked
what you're supposed
to do

363
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,716
if the bully is, like,
a lot bigger than you

364
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,316
or has a knife
or something.

365
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,480
And what did he say?

366
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,995
He said if the bully
has a knife, then,

367
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,390
you should tell
a grown-up.

368
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,278
Well, that's good advice.

369
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,920
Yeah, but,
what if there's no time?

370
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,117
I mean,
you're the police.

371
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,637
If you saw somebody
doing something,
you'd stop 'em, right?

372
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,677
Well, you know,

373
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,877
sometimes there's more
than one right thing.

374
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,830
What does that mean?

375
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,634
It means,

376
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,198
I got you, and I am
responsible for you...

377
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,192
and sometimes,

378
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,240
I might be in
a situation where,

379
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,834
and this hasn't happened
and it won't,

380
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,637
but a situation where...

381
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,270
if I try to stop a guy
from doing a bad thing,

382
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,000
I could get hurt,

383
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,640
or worse.

384
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,996
And then, who would
take care of you?

385
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,030
But it's your job.

386
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,112
Well, I got two jobs,

387
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,920
and the first,
the most important,
is being your dad.

388
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,556
Well,
if I saw somebody
doing something...

389
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,869
I would stop 'em.

390
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,713
I believe you would.

391
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,559
Every cooperation,
obviously.

392
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,277
If you want the girl,
if you want drug,
just ask.

393
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,589
You know who we are.

394
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,273
I told the police,

395
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,512
I couldn't see the guy
on account of the blood
being in my eyes.

396
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
We got a description
of a man.

397
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,630
5'10", brown hair,
big bruise on
the forehead.

398
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,837
Does it ring
a bell at all?

399
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,513
Could be Lenny.
Who's Lenny?

400
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,398
Comes in here a lot.

401
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,800
Drinks pretty heavy.

402
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,952
I heard him say
a few things over the years
about guys like Hess.

403
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,993
Money in the pocket,
think they're tough shit.

404
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,074
That's him at the bar
with the Band-Aid
on his head.

405
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,398
Well, the Russians,
they used to send
dogs up into space

406
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,917
which is stupid
because what's a dog
gonna do in space?

407
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,036
At least with a monkey,

408
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,237
they can operate
the, uh,

409
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,959
the equipment
and something.

410
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,554
Hey, my friend would
like an orange soda

411
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,553
and I'll have, uh,
just a cup of hot
water with lemon.

412
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,792
What are you
supposed to be, some
kind of, uh, circus act?

413
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,915
Oh, my friend was
wondering, how'd you, uh,
hurt your head?

414
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,151
Oh, is your friend
looking for a date?

415
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,436
'Cause you know
this is a place for dicks
who like pussies,

416
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,113
not pussies
who like dick.

417
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,590
No, seriously,
how'd you hurt
your head?

418
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,909
Screw.

419
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,195
I ain't afraid of
a dink and a lepton.

420
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,277
You like playing
with knives?

421
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,592
Oh, you keep
talking, big boy,
you're gonna find out.

422
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,713
That the guy?

423
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,029
Can you take off
the tape maybe?

424
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,590
God damn
you little bastards!
I'll kill the lot of you!

425
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,751
Hey, now,
look, okay?

426
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,559
I'm sorry for what
I said to you before

427
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,233
about the dink
and the lepton.

428
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,635
I don't think
it's him.

429
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,994
Delicious.
Just a few more.

430
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,436
What'd you say
your name was again,
handsome?

431
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,592
Frank Peterson, ma'am.
I work for Mike,
your divorce attorney.

432
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,150
Ah, charmed,
I'm sure.

433
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,437
Oh, sorry,
I just bronzed.

434
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,353
He's a pig.

435
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,840
You smelled his hands?

436
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,479
Have I smelled
your husband's hands?

437
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,120
They smell like feet.

438
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,272
Your ass looks
amazing, darling.
Keep it up.

439
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,117
So anyway, uh,
I've been tasked

440
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,477
to put together
a complete record
of your husband's assets.

441
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,837
We want to get you
the biggest divorce
settlement possible.

442
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,631
Now, I've got your
husband's net worth
estimated at $10 million?

443
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,677
More.

444
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,750
Fifteen?

445
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,160
Okay, sweetie, uh,
let's do a cool down,
yeah? Five minutes.

446
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,959
There you go.

447
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,239
Ma'am, can you
confirm that

448
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,717
your husband started
his first grocery with
a loan from his uncle

449
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,792
like it says
in the book?

450
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,590
That's the story.

451
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,239
But you don't believe it?

452
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,913
Stavros
had two uncles.

453
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,754
One was a drunk
who lived in a barn...

454
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,560
and the other died
in a fishing accident
when he was 10.

455
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,155
So where did
the money come from?

456
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,469
Hey, Ma.

457
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,034
Frank Peterson.

458
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,918
Oh, yeah,
from the store.

459
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,036
Hey, I got one
for you.

460
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,476
What kind of bone
will a dog never eat?

461
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,235
Huh.

462
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,320
Chicken?

463
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,072
A trombone.

464
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,952
Oh, yeah.

465
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,078
That's a good one.
A trombone.

466
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,072
Oh, my dad'll
like that one.

467
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,152
Your dad,
your dad.

468
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,469
Your dad's
screwing us, mister.

469
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,596
Mommy.

470
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,433
What? I'm just
being honest.

471
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,752
He's a hard-on,
your father,
and you're too trusting.

472
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,071
But he's my dad
and you're my mom

473
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,755
and everything's
gonna work out, okay?

474
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,270
Mmm.
Oh.

475
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,116
Aren't they just
the sweetest pair?
Mmm?

476
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,479
<i>Yeah, it's... it's... it's me.
It's Lester.</i>

477
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,039
<i>Uh, she's, um... My wife...
 my wife, she's, uh...</i>

478
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,349
<i>Oh, hell!</i>

479
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,470
<i>Um...</i>

480
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,477
<i>I think I, uh...</i>

481
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,280
<i>She's in the basement
dead and, uh...</i>

482
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,875
<i>Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

483
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,553
<i>Yeah, it's... it's... 
it's me. It's Lester.</i>

484
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,993
<i>Uh, she's, um... My wife... 
my wife, she's, uh...</i>

485
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,309
<i>Oh, hell!</i>

486
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,390
<i>Um...</i>

487
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,230
<i>I think I, uh...</i>

488
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,196
<i>She's in the basement
dead and, uh...</i>

489
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,556
<i>Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

490
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,831
<i>Lester, have you
been a bad boy?</i>

491
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,151
<i>Jeez. Yeah...</i>

492
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,833
Oh, sorry,
I just bronzed.

493
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,037
<i>...I took the hammer
and, uh...</i>

494
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,717
<i>Look, can you come over?
I'm on Willow Creek Drive, number 613.</i>

495
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,713
<i>Please! Please?</i>

496
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,559
<i>Sure, Lester.
I'll be right there.</i>

497
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,152
This place is a shithole.

498
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,952
Okay, nutsack, here's the drill.

499
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,951
You're gonna pack up
your shit and blow.

500
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,999
I'll tell Stavros you 
couldn't find the guy,

501
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,278
and in return,
I won't bust your head.

502
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,510
You hearing me, asswipe?

503
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,998
I did some digging on you, made 
some calls, you get me?

504
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,074
And we don't need you and your 
big city connections

505
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,516
coming here and showing us
what time it is.

506
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,237
I'm the guy.

507
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,073
You understand? Me.

508
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,595
Twenty years I work
for the King.

509
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,909
You know what that makes me?

510
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,311
The goddamn
prime minister.

511
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,393
So give me the letter,
pack up your shit and...

512
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,749
What the hell you doing?

513
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,960
That's disgusting.

514
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,194
Okay, slick.

515
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,876
I got your number.
I'm on to you.

516
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,520
Just remember,
you were warned.

517
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,796
Semenko warned you.

518
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,918
Uh, hey, Molly?

519
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,870
Yeah, Chief?

520
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,311
So, just want to make sure
we're on the same page
about everything.

521
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,629
I want you to center it.

522
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,916
Same page
about what?

523
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,676
Just about Lester
and the case, you know.

524
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,673
Just want to make sure
you know to focus on
the break-in angle.

525
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,753
Maybe call some other
towns, see if they had
a similar problem.

526
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,433
No, higher.

527
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,756
Similar to three murders,
including the police chief?

528
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,878
Not, you know,
literally.

529
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,395
Just ruffians
and the like.

530
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,800
Right there. Perfect.

531
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,752
Look, Chief, I know
you don't think Lester...

532
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,513
Maybe call the Staties,
you know?

533
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,592
See if they effected
any car stops,

534
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,194
suspicious types...

535
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,112
where the driver
had a head wound
and the like.

536
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,475
Yeah.

537
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,358
Yeah, but I think, uh,
Just...

538
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,194
leave poor Lester
alone, will you?

539
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,113
You'll be
in Gordo's room.

540
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,238
He's on the sofa
which is... Ha!

541
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,552
Don't worry.
His dad built him a fort.
He loves it.

542
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,195
Ugh.

543
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,278
<i>Baby, it's cold outside! Brr.</i>

544
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,797
<i>But here at Phoenix Farms,
it's always summer.</i>

545
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,149
Real good peas, hon.

546
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,038
Yeah, Mom, real good.

547
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,835
How's your dinner
there, Lester?

548
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,958
Oh, yeah. Real good.

549
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,440
I was thinking of going hunting
this weekend.

550
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,520
Mmm-hmm.
Told Gordo I would
take him shooting.

551
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,114
You interested?

552
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,040
Ah...
Now, hon,
I don't think

553
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,675
your brother wants
to be around all
that guns and violence,

554
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,319
not... not after
what happened.

555
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,680
Oh, shoot, I'm sorry.
No, no, it's fine.

556
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,638
I can be a real
ass sometimes.
Language.

557
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,191
No, no, no, I...
It sounds, um...

558
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,479
You know, you know,
bag a deer or something.

559
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,913
So, I... I've been thinking,
maybe I should sell
the place, you know?

560
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,471
Get a...
What do you call it,
a fresh start?

561
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,678
Yeah? That's
great. Mmm.

562
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,877
I'll call Jimmy.

563
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,192
It's a fine market
right now he says.
Real good.

564
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,676
It is the right choice,
sweetie.

565
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,269
Too many bad memories
in that old house.
Mmm-hmm.

566
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,192
Both Chaz
and me think so.
Oh!

567
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,680
Oh, jeez!
Mmm.

568
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,876
Oh, I am...
I am so sorry.

569
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,030
It's okay.

570
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,998
I'm sorry.
It's fine.

571
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,676
Hi.

572
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,233
What can I
do for you, son?

573
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,438
Well, uh, I got a...

574
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,796
I need something for
a wound,
I guess you'd call it.

575
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,520
Are we talking pain pill
or something more topical?

576
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,239
Well, it's...

577
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,360
I guess, um,
something to keep it
from getting infected.

578
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay, that'd be
an anti-bacterial.
All right.

579
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,958
I got some in the back.

580
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,555
Mr. Nygaard?

581
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,756
Yeah? Ooh!

582
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,399
Hiya.
Hi.

583
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,470
Deputy Solverson again.

584
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,871
I just have
a few more questions.
Is now a good time?

585
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,275
Not really.
I'm kind of in
the middle of...

586
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,589
Sure. Yeah, no,
I understand.

587
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,399
Yeah, it won't
take a second.

588
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,437
Um, so listen,
going back to
the emergency room,

589
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,399
that... that first visit,
that was for a broken
nose, is that right?

590
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,439
Shoot, I...
I just remembered.

591
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,840
Um, sir...

592
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,434
You know, I...
I got to be honest.

593
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,474
I'm starting to feel
a little harassed here.

594
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,710
Now, that's not...

595
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Sir, your unguent!

596
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,190
Sir!

597
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,675
I think he means you.

598
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,591
You know,
you're asking
about a fella,

599
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,956
that I might've talked
to at the hospital,

600
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,110
when you should
be out there

601
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,159
looking for the animal
that killed my wife.

602
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,312
With all respect, sir,
your wife's not
the only victim here.

603
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,198
A friend of mine
was killed,

604
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,033
plus, you know,
Sam Hess.

605
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,999
Yeah, I told you,
I haven't seen Sam
since high school.

606
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,160
I'm not sure
this is your car,
Mr. Nygaard.

607
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,117
What? Oh, no, it's...

608
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,998
It's my wife's.

609
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,719
Mine's in the shop.

610
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,679
Well, sir, it's just...
it's hard to believe
is all, you know?

611
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,116
I mean, you're saying
this is all some...
some big coincidence,

612
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,192
you know,
you knowing Sam and all.

613
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,310
And it's a quiet town

614
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,596
and suddenly we got
four victims in 24 hours,

615
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,670
yourself included.

616
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,513
And then there's
this witness

617
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,399
saying that you were
talking about Sam Hess
the day he died

618
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,755
and, you know,
then it turns out

619
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,514
you and he
had differences
in the past, so...

620
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,069
You know,
all I'm saying is,
just...

621
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,391
help me understand
what happened.

622
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,554
Look,
I answered all your...
Just ask Bill, huh?

623
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,831
Your boss, he said
he was satisfied.

624
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,434
And I... I got...
Look at me.

625
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,549
My wife

626
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,154
is dead,

627
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,196
and you're harassing me.

628
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,999
I'm not harassing
you, sir. I...

629
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,560
Talk to Bill!

630
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,032
He'll tell you this...
this was a break-in.

631
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,112
You're wasting time
talking to me.

632
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,800
I'm...
I can't help you.

633
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,280
Watch your feet now.

634
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,640
So, how's it going?

635
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,594
Uh, well, it turns out
Lester and Hess went
to high school together

636
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,876
and Hess used
to beat him up.

637
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,837
A learned detective
might consider that a clue.

638
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,355
Yeah, that's what
I said.

639
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,114
But Bill's a big believer
in coincidence, apparently.

640
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,557
Well, what he lacks
in common sense
he makes up in self-esteem.

641
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,710
Yeah.

642
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,074
Bill have a theory?

643
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,949
Oh, yeah, he says
that it was a spree,
you know?

644
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,511
A drifter or, quote,
gang of drifters.

645
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,193
You know, like it's 1942.

646
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,478
Like, uh, drifters
are a national threat.
Hobos.

647
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,358
Well, he's chief now,
so he sets the agenda,
same as always.

648
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,233
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

649
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,550
I mean, you know,
here we get
this car crash

650
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,519
with this dead man
in frozen panties nearby,

651
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,954
and the driver
has a head injury

652
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,394
and maybe went to
the emergency room

653
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,836
where he talked to Lester
about Sam Hess,

654
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,640
and then within 24 hours,
Hess is dead

655
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,873
and then there's
the fracas with, you know,
Lester's wife and Vern.

656
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,675
Not sure
if you remember,

657
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,750
but when you were five,

658
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,510
they had to put
you under anesthesia
to fix your teeth.

659
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,752
Gave you that mask
and gas that smelled
like tutti-frutti.

660
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,830
Yeah.

661
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,914
My soft, little girl
in a hard world of
drills and needles.

662
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,838
I'm 31, Dad.
I carry a gun.

663
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,957
I know,

664
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,191
but it's relative,
you know?

665
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,192
There's the kind of things
a school teacher
gets exposed to,

666
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,511
truancy and the like,

667
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,320
and then there's
the stuff a cop sees,

668
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,757
murder and violence,
and general scofflawery,

669
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,956
and then there's
the kind of deal
you're looking at now.

670
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,758
Which is?

671
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,035
Which is

672
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,634
if I'm right...

673
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,113
savagery, pure and simple.

674
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,396
Slaughter, hatred,

675
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,115
devils with dead eyes
and shark smiles.

676
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,396
One day, you're gonna
get married and have kids...

677
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,880
and when you
look at them,

678
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,600
their faces,

679
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,639
you need to see
what's good in the world.

680
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,473
'Cause if you don't,

681
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,153
how you gonna live?

682
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,714
You talk a lot,
you know that?

683
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,597
It's always been
a problem.

684
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,756
Lou.
Chief.

685
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,797
Molly,
could I have a word?

686
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,916
Yeah, sure.

687
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,480
Pull up a chair.
You want some coffee or...

688
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,319
Yeah, no, uh...

689
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,232
Lester Nygaard
called me, yeah,
and he's super upset.

690
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,993
Well, yeah, you know,
I thought
he might do that.

691
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,799
Yeah, we talked
about this and all...

692
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,314
and I thought we were...

693
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,757
I thought I was clear
that we were gonna focus
on the drifter angle

694
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,593
and not, you know,
harass the victim.

695
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,990
Well, I'm not,
you know...

696
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,112
I didn't harass him.
I just... I got questions,
you know.

697
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,760
Yeah, well,
I'm the chief now,
and I got to...

698
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,720
Everyone's gotta
line up behind me,
you know, toe the line.

699
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,995
Sure, yeah,
yeah, I know...

700
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,835
Yeah, we talked about this,
and now I gotta
take you off the case.

701
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,080
Well, we all know
how you felt about Vern.

702
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,116
I mean, heck,
who didn't?

703
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,840
But, uh, maybe
it's best if you just...

704
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,319
And this could
be good for you,
career-wise, because, uh...

705
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,959
I'm gonna make
you head of inquiry

706
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,430
on that, uh, frozen fella,
the naked one, yeah.

707
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,636
I'll make you
lead on that.

708
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,756
Bill, listen, I...

709
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,877
Yeah, so
that's my decision.

710
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,120
Take care.
What...

711
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,236
Well, okay, then.

712
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,794
See you for dinner.
Yep.

713
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,280
Drills and needles.

714
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,032
<i>To live in an old shack
by the sea</i>

715
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,953
<i>To live with the dawn
and the dusk</i>

716
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,194
<i>The new moon
and the full moon</i>

717
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,277
<i>The tides
the wind and the rain</i>

718
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,036
<i>To surf
and comb the beach</i>

719
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,920
<i>And gather sea shells
and driftwood</i>

720
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,510
<i>And know the thrill
of loneliness</i>

721
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,635
<i>And lose all sense of time</i>

722
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,113
<i>And be free</i>

723
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,509
<i>To hike over the island
to the village</i>

724
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,638
<i>And visit the market place</i>

725
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,599
<i>And enjoy the music
and the food
and the people</i>

726
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,720
<i>And do a little trading</i>

727
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,032
<i>And see the great ships
come and go</i>

728
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,430
No, wait.

729
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,318
<i>And man, have me a ball</i>

730
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,515
<i>And in the evening
when the sky is on fire</i>

731
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,116
<i>Heaven and earth
become my great
open cathedral</i>

732
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,996
<i>Where all men are brothers</i>

733
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,992
<i>Where all things
are bound by law</i>

734
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,511
<i>And crowned with love</i>
