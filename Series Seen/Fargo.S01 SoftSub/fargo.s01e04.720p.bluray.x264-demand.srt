1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,436
<i>Erstwhile on</i> Fargo...

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,915
So you think this
is the one who killed

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,150
all those people
over in Bemidji?

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,390
Could be.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,196
I mean,
you're saying this is all
some... some big coincidence,

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,237
that suddenly we got
four victims in 24 hours,

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,720
yourself included.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,156
My wife is dead
and you're harassing me.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,516
Just... leave poor
Lester alone, will you?

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,831
Found this on my
windshield last week.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,998
You got bronzer on
your blackmail note.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,070
I'm taking over.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,792
<i>I ran his plates
and it turns out</i>

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,191
that the car was registered
to one of your victims.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,555
30 milligrams.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,717
<i>Don't take two of these
and think you're gonna nap.</i>

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,314
<i>It's basically speed.</i>

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,715
It's like
a nightmare.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,952
I told you,
I know a guy.

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,080
You know a guy.
A guy.

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,640
Better be some
guy, Stavros.

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,759
For this...

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,477
we gave up everything.

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,153
Gave up?
What did we have?

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,519
Debts, screaming phone calls,
bill collectors at the door.

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,557
At least it was warm.

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,199
Shit.

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
What?

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
Out of gas.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,355
You bought gas.

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,159
Five dollars.
It was all I had.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
Idiot, the boy's
gonna freeze.

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,149
We can't stay here.

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,356
I know.

35
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,920
I'll think of something.
Think of what?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,674
Gasoline?
Yeah, from your
brain into the--

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,400
Will you shut up?
I gotta think.

38
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,630
Oh, hey!

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,039
Here! Here!

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,838
Hey! Here! Here!

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,673
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

42
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,558
Hey! No, stop.

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,869
Stop, wait!

44
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,150
Come on! Come on! Stop!

45
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,150
All right.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,390
Lord, let me
get through this.

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,032
Let us find gas and...
a warm bed.

48
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,759
Let us prosper
even in the
smallest of ways...

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,276
and I will be
your humble servant
for the rest of my days.

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,110
Yeah.

51
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,910
Oh, God.

52
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,712
Oh, my God.

53
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,359
Oh, God, my God.

54
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,354
Thank you, God.

55
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,991
I can't believe
he wouldn't stop.

56
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,318
A family vehicle.
A baby in a car.

57
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,676
Who doesn't stop
for a baby in a car?

58
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,836
God is real.

59
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,474
We're gonna freeze to death

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,359
because a man that hasn't
showered since the '70s

61
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,238
couldn't be bothered
to apply the brakes.

62
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,754
God is real.

63
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,995
God... is real.

64
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,510
You know...

65
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,280
there's nothing here.

66
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,674
No wildlife in your pipes.
Water heater's clean.

67
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,594
Not sure how you got
blood in your shower.

68
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,993
Are you sure it wasn't
rust? 'Cause--

69
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Listen to me.

70
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,711
It's not like
a Band-Aid fell out.

71
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,992
It was buckets...
literally buckets
of blood.

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,794
Whoa. Like in
a horror film, huh?

73
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,634
And with the dead dog
you mentioned, too... Uffda.

74
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,791
Sounds like a bad day.

75
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,997
Did you see any
signs of tampering?

76
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,872
Tampering?

77
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,440
Yeah.

78
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,436
Screws loosened recently
or... holes where blood
could've been injected.

79
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,313
Injected?

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,119
What the heck
are you thinkin'
happened here?

81
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,920
Nothing.
Thanks for your time.

82
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,279
You know...

83
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,240
You know, I, uh...
I seen your
commercials on TV.

84
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,551
"July in January."

85
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,155
You got any,
like, gift certificates?
The wife, she, uh...

86
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,356
Get the hell
outta here.

87
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,874
Sure. Okay.

88
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,072
Uh, say...
you ever read
the Bible?

89
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,436
What?

90
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,549
The Bible...

91
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,711
you know,
the big book?

92
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,075
All that blood
made me think of it.

93
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,920
You know,
Moses and the like.

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,391
"And God sent
a plague of blood
upon the land."

95
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,755
Better get
right with the Lord.

96
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,598
You know what I'm...
What did you say?

97
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,750
Nothing.

98
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,233
Say it again.

99
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,198
No...
What did you say to me?

100
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,192
Say it again!
Boss, let him go.

101
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,270
What did you say?

102
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,353
Boss, he's just
a damn plumber.
Let him go!

103
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,954
He's crazy.

104
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,759
You're crazy!

105
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,070
<i>Car 39, this is dispatch.
Come in.</i>

106
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,152
Yeah. Hold your horses.

107
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,991
<i>Car 39, this is dispatch.
Come in.</i>

108
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,317
Yeah, this
is 3-9, over.

109
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,631
<i>Car 39, you need to
follow up on a report,</i>

110
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,919
<i>murdered canine
at 1301 Bird Lane.
Over.</i>

111
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,112
Is that a...
Can you call it a
murder if it's a...

112
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,954
Anyhoo, that's
animal control's
purview.

113
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,635
<i>Yeah, Joe's sick.
Was supposed to
respond yesterday.</i>

114
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,110
<i>Claimant is super PO'd.
Over.</i>

115
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,510
Jeez. Come on,
that guy is always sick.

116
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,637
What's he got,
the cancer? Over.

117
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,552
<i>Yeah, leukemia. Over.</i>

118
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,393
Jeez. That is...
That's awful. Okay.

119
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,994
Well, uh...

120
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,352
3-9, car 3-9 responding.
Over and out.

121
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,390
One-two-five.

122
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,753
One-two-seven.

123
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,592
Okay.

124
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,115
Oh, jeez.

125
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,714
It's him.

126
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,835
It's him.

127
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,713
Freeze! Don't...

128
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,511
Put your hands
where I can see...
where I can see 'em.

129
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,479
I'm just on a call.

130
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,476
Drop it.

131
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,115
Yeah, just as
soon as I finish.

132
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,316
This is Duluth.

133
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,791
Package requested,
Frank Peterson.

134
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,189
Okay, all good. See?

135
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,509
Put it down.

136
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,512
It's a new phone.
Now!

137
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,710
Okay.

138
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,516
Okay, um...

139
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,515
turn around and put
your hands on your head.

140
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,559
What's this all
about, Officer?

141
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,757
You know what
this is about.

142
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,798
Okay...

143
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,159
put your left
hand around your, uh...
the back of your...

144
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,150
Yeah.

145
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,915
Okay...
now the other one...
slowly.

146
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,673
Am I under arrest?

147
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,919
You're handcuffed.
Of course
you're under arrest.

148
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,559
On what charge?

149
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,433
It, uh...

150
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,830
We'll figure that
out at the station.

151
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,876
Okay.

152
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,037
All right.

153
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,077
Back...
back to the car.

154
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,116
All right.

155
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,715
Butt first.
Watch your head.

156
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,877
You're making
a mistake.

157
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,469
Be quiet.

158
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,440
You're making
a mistake.

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,994
I said quiet.

160
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,994
That's what you're gonna
say a couple hours from now.

161
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,311
"You're making a mistake."

162
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,199
Got one.

163
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,397
What was he,
mean to a cat?

164
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,559
Murder and car
thievery, all right.

165
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,280
This fella's wanted
for the triple
homicide in Bemidji.

166
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,919
Oh, now
hold on a sec.

167
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,276
It's like I told
this young fella,

168
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,716
this is a boondoggle,
plain and simple.

169
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,439
Save it, Cochise.

170
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,871
Now, I'm gonna
ink your right hand.

171
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,680
Press each finger
individually
against the book.

172
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,672
If you try anything...

173
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,956
I can't promise you
fingers won't get broke.

174
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,957
Okay, message
received, young fella.

175
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,032
You won't get no
pushback from me.

176
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,439
What the heck?

177
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,429
Son of a...

178
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,477
<i>Molly, call on two.</i>

179
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,710
Yeah, Solverson.

180
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,871
<i>Yeah, hey, it's Gus.</i>

181
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,191
<i>I got him.</i>
Who's this then?

182
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,434
Yeah, Gus Grimly.
From over Duluth.

183
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,035
You know, we...
we had the milkshakes
the other...

184
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,952
Oh, yeah, hey.
How's it goin'?

185
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,440
<i>Yeah, real good.</i>

186
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,590
Uh...

187
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,074
So, I was on patrol earlier.
Responding to a 613 and--

188
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,514
<i>What's that then?</i>

189
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,633
Dead dog,
foul play suspected.

190
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,033
And I see this fella and
he's standing by a van.

191
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,156
And it was him.

192
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,230
Him who?

193
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,630
<i>The fella from
Mr. Nygaard's car.</i>

194
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,836
The driver?

195
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,357
Yeah, yeah, the, uh...
the one I let go.

196
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,432
But there he was.
I mean, just, you know,

197
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,637
just standin' there,
makin' a call on his...

198
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,915
So what did you--

199
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,832
I stopped and
arrested him,
of course.

200
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,115
Arrested him?

201
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,193
Yeah, for the murders.

202
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,670
I'm looking at
the guy right now.

203
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,189
The Lieutenant's gonna
have a chat with him.

204
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,475
I thought you might wanna...

205
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,200
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'm gettin'
in my car.

206
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,397
<i>Great.</i>

207
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,392
I'll be there
just as soon as I--
<i>Okay, then.</i>

208
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,836
Yeah, I'll tell
the Lieutenant
to wait for you.

209
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,115
Thanks.

210
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,190
<i>Yeah.</i>

211
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,475
<i>You're welcome.</i>

212
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,120
Yeah, okay.
So we've been putting in
a lot of hours on the Chief,

213
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,795
but the weather
service is trackin'
a big storm.

214
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,032
They're looking
at Wednesday night,
Thursday, early a.m.

215
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,396
High winds, blizzard,
the whole shebang.

216
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,951
So if you wanna make
extra money plowing,
see Cindy.

217
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,157
Same goes
for traffic duty,
etcetera.

218
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,232
But I don't want this
impacting everyday doings,

219
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,631
so don't sign up unless
your workload is cleared.

220
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,712
Chief, they got him.

221
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,438
Who?
Duluth PD.

222
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,634
No, who'd they get?

223
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,192
Oh. Yeah.

224
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,272
Fella driving
Lester's stolen car.

225
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,080
Deputy pulled
him in an hour ago.

226
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,311
How come
they called you?

227
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,356
Pardon?

228
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,751
You're not even on the case.
How come they called you?

229
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,830
I just...

230
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,799
Well, the other day,
a deputy drove
down from Duluth.

231
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,476
And... you know,
he and I talked is all.

232
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,029
Well, that's irregular.

233
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,913
They should talk to
the officer in charge.

234
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,990
Yeah.

235
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,600
Yeah, so I was thinking
I'd drive up there.

236
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,240
You know, talk to the
suspect. On account of,
you know--

237
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,630
I think he's the fella
who put the naked
guy in the trunk.

238
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,632
No, should be me.

239
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,235
You said he was
driving Lester's car.
That's my case.

240
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,800
Plus, Vern
takes precedence.

241
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,870
Okay, but Chief--

242
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,599
Knutson, you're in
charge till I get back.

243
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,677
Okie-dokie, Chief. 10-4.

244
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,714
Gotta
pick up a few things.

245
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,314
You could've
waited in the car.

246
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,754
No, Kitty said
I should--

247
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,957
I mean, I wanna be
here for you, so--

248
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,838
Oh, jeez.

249
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,872
They just...
they leave it
like that?

250
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,029
All the blood.

251
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,191
Yeah, it's, uh...

252
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,796
You know, they gave me
a number to call, a service.

253
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,795
Lester--

254
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,916
I gotta...

255
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,553
Oh, yeah...
oh, my...

256
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,679
No, no, no. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

257
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,230
What?

258
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,073
God... damn it.

259
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,754
Oh, my God.

260
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,960
Oh, my God.

261
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,274
Hello?

262
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,959
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

263
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,314
Who is this?

264
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,312
<i>The widow Hess.</i>

265
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,000
<i>Her husband nice and
cozy in the ground.</i>

266
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,037
<i>Insurance money
on the way.</i>

267
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,636
<i>And every night she puts
her kitty in your face.</i>

268
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,919
<i>A guy like you, Lester...
small town, small time...</i>

269
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,515
<i>might think you
won the lottery.</i>

270
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,389
<i>But I think that
you need to ask yourself...</i>

271
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,073
<i>was it worth it?</i>

272
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,990
Worth what?

273
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,196
<i>Your life.</i>

274
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,950
Freshen you up?
No, we're good.

275
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,190
Just the check
please. Thanks.

276
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,830
Everything okay?

277
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,957
He's just not
very hungry. Thanks.

278
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,030
Thanks.

279
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,195
For Christ's
sakes, man!

280
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,760
Seriously?

281
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,637
I'm not looking at you.
I'm not looking at you.

282
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
You got
two minutes.

283
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,392
Okie-dokie.
Thanks a lot, sir.

284
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,793
Sir...

285
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,480
are you Don Chumph?

286
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,840
Uh...

287
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,910
Yeah.

288
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,434
There's a phone
call for you.

289
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,874
A what now?

290
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,950
Telephone.

291
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,151
You can take it right
here at the counter.

292
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,358
Hello?
<i>Do they have 'em?</i>

293
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,190
Who is this?

294
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,434
Well, let's figure
this out together.

295
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,273
Who knows you're
at the pet store
right now?

296
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,999
My mom?

297
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,991
Do I sound
like your mom?
<i>Uh...</i>

298
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,070
No.

299
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,116
<i>Hold on.</i>

300
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,556
Does your mom know
why you're at the
pet store right now?

301
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,280
She thinks
I'm getting a cat.

302
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,551
Okay,
I don't have
time for this.

303
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,791
Do they have 'em?
Yes or no.

304
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,951
Yeah, but only 100.

305
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,030
<i>Okay.</i>

306
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,676
Well, there are
three other pet stores
in the city, so hit 'em all.

307
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,752
I'm in jail.
I'll be out
in a few hours.

308
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,160
Wait-- What?

309
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,560
Time is up.

310
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,397
In two hours.
Come get me.

311
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,474
And this is the deputy
who effected the arrest.

312
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,279
Yeah, nice
work there.

313
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,635
He give you
much of a fight?

314
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,279
Uh... No, sir.

315
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,750
Bill Oswalt's
the Chief over
at Bemidji.

316
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,830
Oh.

317
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,359
Molly come?

318
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,470
Who?

319
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,597
Deputy over
at my office.

320
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,673
Sounds like your man's
got a thing for her.

321
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,470
Lock that shit down, Grimly.
This is a murder case.

322
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,789
Yes, sir.

323
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,836
So we got a name
on the guy?

324
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,910
Yes, sir.

325
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,552
Driver's license says
Frank Peterson and
an address up in Baudette.

326
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,714
Peterson, eh?

327
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,391
I knew a
Jay Peterson once...
had a dwarf arm.

328
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,236
What about evidence?

329
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,390
Sir?

330
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,392
Proof of his
connection to the crime.

331
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,870
You say you stopped him
driving Lester's car?

332
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,111
Yes, sir, but I didn't
know that it was stolen.

333
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,192
Why I let him go.

334
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,954
Yeah, but you
pulled prints from
the impounded vehicle?

335
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,430
No, sir.
Techs said it
was wiped clean.

336
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,719
Yeah.

337
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,314
Well,
we got a photo
though, right?

338
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,312
I mean, dashboard camera
from the car stop?

339
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,880
You know, proof
he's our guy.

340
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,714
No, sir.
My camera hasn't
worked for weeks.

341
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,235
But Molly's
got a picture.
It's in the file.

342
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,720
She showed me.
Yeah.

343
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,519
She did?
Yeah.

344
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,990
Yeah.

345
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,713
Yeah, this fella.

346
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,190
It's kind of
hard to see though.

347
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,680
It's grainy.

348
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,755
You sure this
is our guy?

349
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,880
Yeah, yeah, no--
That's our guy.
I'm positive.

350
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,998
Yeah, I'm Lieutenant Schmidt.

351
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,431
This is Bill Oswalt,
Chief over at Bemidji.

352
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,433
Yeah, Frank Peterson.
I'm the minister
up in Baudette.

353
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,318
Go Bears.

354
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,716
A minister?

355
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,276
Yeah, Baudette Lutheran.
Six years now.
Frank Peterson.

356
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,113
Before that Aberdeen.

357
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,671
So, you know, I'm not
used to having a firearm
stuck in my face,

358
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,479
which I know
the Lord tests you
in all kinds of ways,

359
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,160
but... ooh, partner,
that's a heart-stopper.

360
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,310
Cut the shit.

361
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,791
You were pulled
over Tuesday night
driving a stolen car.

362
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,952
No, sir. I think
I'd remember that.

363
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,475
Plus, Tuesday is bingo
night at the church.

364
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,074
We had a full house.

365
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,394
Florence Nightgarden
won the entire pot...
if I'm not mistaken.

366
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,631
And we can
check on that?

367
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,997
Oh, sure, yes, sir.
You could call
Florence herself.

368
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,311
Or Jim Avery,
he's our alderman.

369
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,150
Deputy Grimly--

370
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,039
Oh, that's the fella.
Deputy Grimly...

371
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,316
Pulled his pistol,
pointed it right at me.

372
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,154
Thought I was gonna
have a heart attack.

373
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,594
But, you know,
after he told me

374
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,319
about those homicides
over at Bemidji,

375
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,397
I thought, "Frank,
I mean, you can't blame

376
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,039
"the guy for
being a little jumpy.

377
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,395
"A horror show like that."

378
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,999
That son
of a bitch!

379
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,195
<i>So you're saying you weren't
in Bemidji last week?</i>

380
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,512
<i>If I show your picture around,
no one would recognize you?</i>

381
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,670
<i>Me? No, sir.</i>

382
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,319
I have a cousin
who lived in Bemidji

383
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,392
back in the '90s,
out near Leech Lake.

384
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,279
But he moved to
Anchorage in '03.

385
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,513
I said, "What, Minnesota's
not cold enough for you?"

386
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,876
We had a good
laugh about that.

387
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,351
Also, you're saying
you weren't pulled
over for speeding?

388
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,430
No, sir.

389
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,876
I'm a cautious
driver by nature...

390
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,713
on account
of my eyesight.

391
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,634
Glaucoma they say it is,
only in the one eye.

392
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,870
But you can't
be too careful.

393
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,475
That's what I tell
my parishioners.

394
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,040
Deputy Grimly--
Forgiveness,

395
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,873
that's the heart
of the good book.

396
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,078
Turn the other cheek,
second chances. Amen.

397
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,874
So, no, I don't
hold a grudge
against the deputy.

398
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,634
Though I'm lucky
I had my nitroglycerin
pills with me,

399
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,791
I'll tell you. Uffda.

400
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,833
Okay. Well, sit tight.

401
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,230
We're gonna
make some calls,
check your story.

402
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,074
You just...
just pick a name
out of the phone book.

403
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,310
Everybody up there
knows me.

404
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,550
Yeah.

405
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,389
So, uh...
looks like a call
was placed

406
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,073
to your motel from
the victim's house

407
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,277
the night Pearl
Nygaard was killed.

408
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,397
You said that
on the phone.

409
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,755
Right.

410
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,954
So... you remember
any seedy types
checking in last week?

411
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,872
Possible...
with a head injury?

412
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,440
I thought on it
on the way over.

413
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,480
There was a fella
checked in around then,
had a bump on his head.

414
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,432
Gave me guff
when I asked him
if he had any pets.

415
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,960
Oh, yeah?

416
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,997
Is it... this fella maybe?

417
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,116
Yeah.

418
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,192
That's him.

419
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,594
You don't sound
too happy about it.

420
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,559
Well, he just
wasn't very
nice is all.

421
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,871
I brought my book,
like you asked.

422
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,360
Fella paid cash,
I think.

423
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,239
But I make everyone
put their name
in the ledger.

424
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,276
There you go.

425
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,670
Okay, yeah.

426
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,479
Say... you remember
finding anything odd
when you cleaned his room?

427
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,074
What do you
mean "odd"?

428
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,471
Like...
out of the ordinary.
Memorable, I guess.

429
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,593
Well, he had
some tokens from
over the Lucky Penny.

430
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,149
You don't say.

431
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,799
Okay.

432
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,076
All right. Thank you.

433
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,354
All right, then.
Well, it looks like

434
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,558
he's a pretty
well-respected member
of the community up there.

435
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,519
We just had to
call and verify.
Thanks for your time.

436
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,716
<i>Yeah.</i>

437
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,150
Grimly.

438
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,197
<i>Where have
you been? I've been trying
to call you all day.</i>

439
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,270
Thought you were comin'.

440
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,239
Tried.
Are you in the room?

441
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Yeah, they just
talked to him.

442
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
<i>Why not you?</i>

443
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,794
Me? No,
I do animal control
mostly.

444
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,271
<i>Listen, I got a name
for the suspect.</i>

445
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,478
Lorne Malvo.
He used it to
check into a motel.

446
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,713
Lorne Malvo, huh?

447
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,474
They're.. they're comin'
out. I'll call you back.

448
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,392
Sorry again for the
confusion, Pastor.

449
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,597
Just glad
nobody got hurt.

450
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,796
You're lettin' him go?

451
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,234
Desk duty, two weeks.

452
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,073
Now, just a--
Three weeks.

453
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,719
For Pete--

454
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,473
You're making a mistake.

455
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,320
Grimly, with me now.

456
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,197
You pointed
your service weapon
at a civilian.

457
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,511
No, a damn minister
on a public street.

458
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,432
No evidence,
no fingerprints, nothin'.

459
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,874
What about
the picture?

460
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,633
What, that Zapruder
film in the file?

461
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,757
Hell, son, that could
be a photo of my
momma for all I know.

462
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,910
No, no, it's him.

463
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,514
I know it's him.
Negatory.

464
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,273
We checked his story.
It tracks.

465
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,158
He's lying!

466
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,960
You have
a blessed day.

467
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,520
How can you do that?

468
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,359
What's that, son?

469
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,390
Just... just lie
like that.

470
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,194
I sure hope you
catch that fella

471
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,760
who killed all
those people.

472
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,230
I'll be praying on it.

473
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,598
Lorne Malvo.

474
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,993
Did you know
the human eye can see

475
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,118
more shades of green
than any other color?

476
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,914
What?

477
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,832
I said did you know
that the human eye can see

478
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,719
more shades of green
than any other color?

479
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,358
My question
for you is why?

480
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,194
Now just hold on.

481
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,273
When you figure out
the answer to my question...

482
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,877
then you'll have
the answer to yours.

483
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
Where are they?

484
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,590
In the back.

485
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,798
Can't you hear?
It's driving me crazy.

486
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,473
Yeah?
<i>Yeah, Mr. Nygaard?</i>

487
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,710
<i>This is Dave
from Duluth impound.</i>

488
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,156
Yeah, I'm gonna pick
her up probably Friday.

489
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,914
<i>No, sir, I'm supposed
to tell you your
car's not ready yet.</i>

490
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,956
What do you mean?

491
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,077
<i>It's... Forensic
team's lookin' at it.</i>

492
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,879
Forensic?
<i>Yes, sir. Just routine,</i>

493
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,917
<i>but I can't
release the car to you
till they release it to me.</i>

494
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,640
<i>So, I'll call you
when it's done, okay?
Bye, now.</i>

495
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,790
Hey, Lester.

496
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,160
I'm in a meeting.

497
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,356
<i>Chaz?</i>

498
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,794
I said I'm in a meeting.

499
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,200
Chaz, it's...
it's Lester.

500
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,954
Look, I think I might be
in a bit of trouble here.

501
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,793
When are you not in...

502
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,234
What kind of trouble?

503
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,635
<i>Well, I'm...</i>

504
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,949
<i>I'm in the trunk of a car.</i>

505
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,030
What?

506
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,954
A car. In...
in the trunk.

507
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,149
<i>You're in
the trunk of your car?</i>

508
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,880
No, not my car. It's...
it's these two fellas.

509
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,316
You see, the thing...

510
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,438
I think I may
have been kidnapped
is the thing.

511
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,318
<i>What?</i>
Yeah.

512
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,551
They got me...
in the trunk.

513
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,756
Uh-huh.

514
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,514
I... I don't really
know where we're goin'.

515
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,398
Did you say
you got kidnapped?

516
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,440
<i>Lester, where are you?</i>

517
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,516
I'll call the cops.

518
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,752
No, no, no. Don't...
don't call the...

519
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,117
Yeah, it's just a...

520
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,350
I'm prankin' you.

521
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,159
What?
<i>Yeah.</i>

522
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,320
<i>Remember, how we
used to... You know,
practical jokes and all.</i>

523
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,631
<i>Well... you're it!</i>

524
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,393
You're an asshole.

525
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,840
Come on. Come on.

526
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,199
There you go.

527
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,119
Come on.

528
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,475
Let's go.

529
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,597
You're gonna say it.

530
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,072
"I, Lester Nygaard..."
You're gonna say it.

531
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,470
"I, Lester Nygaard..."

532
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,280
I, Lester Nygaard...

533
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,270
Louder.

534
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,799
Louder!
I, Lester Nygaard...

535
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,037
"Killed..."
No. No, you see,
I did not kill--

536
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,318
Lester, you're gonna say it.
One way or the other.

537
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,914
Okay, all right?
Mmm-hmm.

538
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,990
"Killed Sam Hess."

539
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,070
That's not true.

540
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,116
I didn't kill him.

541
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,190
Yes, you did.

542
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,034
No, I didn't.
Okay, then who was it?

543
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,998
It was a man.
Who's the man?

544
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,116
The man...

545
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,876
Who? Who's him?
Who... who is him?

546
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
It was the guy--

547
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,472
What? Who? What guy?

548
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,640
The guy...

549
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,035
I need... I need...

550
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,998
Is this your car, sir?
What?

551
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,594
Is this your car?

552
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,154
No, no.

553
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,392
I need... a ride back to town.

554
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,551
Not a taxi
service, sir.
What?

555
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,235
I said we're not a taxi...
Please, I just...
I just need...

556
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,032
Just give me a damn ride!

557
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,630
Oh!

558
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,073
Heck, sir.

559
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,312
Now I gotta arrest you.
Good, good. Let's go.

560
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,631
Oh, jeez! Thanks.

561
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,310
Okay.

562
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,830
Jeez.

563
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,713
Yeah, this is car 3108.

564
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,234
Coming in with a 313.

565
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,470
<i>Copy, 3108.</i>

566
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,870
Yeah, guy punched me.

567
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,231
Knock, for Christ's sake.

568
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,754
How many times?

569
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,080
Not now.

570
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,435
Not now!

571
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,077
Look, I wanna
talk about Mom.

572
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,475
I said not now.

573
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,358
You're not
being very nice.

574
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,715
"Nice"?

575
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,916
You think you
go down to the
car dealership

576
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,793
and buy
a car with "nice"?

577
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,112
You think the girls
at the titty bar
care about "nice"?

578
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,317
It's kill or
be killed, son.

579
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,795
Are you crying?

580
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,034
No.

581
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,396
Don't.

582
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,273
Kill or be killed.

583
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,357
Help, get it off!
Get it off of me!

584
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,840
Dad, what's happening?

585
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,670
God!

586
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,159
<i>We demand one million
in unmarked bills.</i>

587
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,438
<i>We'll call
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
with the drop instructions.</i>

588
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,880
<i>Do you understand?</i>

589
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,070
Yeah.

590
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,073
<i>Remember,
God is watching.</i>

591
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,719
Was that him?

592
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,673
God is real.

593
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,400
Bartender...

594
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,073
I tend... to have a beer
and then a little tequila guy.

595
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,669
Looks like you
already had a few.

596
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,991
Well, then, they're
working. Right?

597
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,869
What are you lookin' at?

598
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,632
You know,
I'll tell you something.

599
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,517
I will put... your eye out!

600
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,154
What?

601
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,037
I was about to
send a search party.

602
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,918
Yeah, sorry.

603
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,118
Cindy said Bill's
on his way back.
What happened?

604
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,592
Well... they let
him go. Malvo.

605
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,717
Yeah, he had an alibi.
It checked out.

606
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,076
But... it's him.

607
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,833
How do you know?

608
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,559
'Cause I said the name,
Lorne Malvo,

609
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,872
and he stopped
and he looked
at me real funny.

610
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,031
And then he said,
like, a riddle.

611
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,799
What's that
about a riddle?

612
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,272
Like... how come
the human eye can see

613
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,431
more shades of green
than any other color?

614
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,156
'Cause of predators.

615
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,191
Used to be we
were monkeys, right?

616
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,476
And in the woods,
in the jungle,
everything's green.

617
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,439
So, in order to not
get eaten by panthers
and bears and the like,

618
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,997
we had to be able
to see them, you know,
grass and trees and such.

619
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,390
Predators.

620
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,439
So what do we do now?

621
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,194
Lester.

622
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,235
Can I get, like,
a phone call?
And a...

623
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,313
and a chicken pot pie?

624
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,158
Sleep it off,
rummies.
