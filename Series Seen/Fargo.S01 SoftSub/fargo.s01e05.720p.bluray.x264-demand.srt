1
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,911
Uh... Why irregular?

2
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,993
They put a ladies' sock
in there with the gents'.

3
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,750
Which one's which?

4
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,512
It's unclear.
Ah.

5
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,560
Eh. I'll roll the dice.

6
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,320
Uh, how much?

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,160
You tell me.

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,590
Say again?

9
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,957
The sign says, "best offer."
What're you offering?

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,030
Well, I mean...

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,353
I don't know.
What's fair?

12
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,193
Well, that's not
for me to say.

13
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,717
It's three pairs of socks.
Half of them ladies'.

14
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,156
Probably not
a million dollars.

15
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,077
Uh...

16
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,036
Well, I... I mean,
I don't wanna take advantage.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,794
2 bucks?

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,394
Or if that's...

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,356
3 bucks?

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,596
5.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,030
Tell you what,
you give me $55,
I'll give you the socks...

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,191
and throw in this 12 gauge.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,315
I thought you
were getting socks.

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,390
In the bag.

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,671
What the heck are
you gonna do with that?

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,911
It's for protection.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,992
Just be careful
you don't blow
your own face off.

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,514
Not loaded, is it?

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,273
Well, if anyone
could shoot theirselves

30
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,999
in the face with
an unloaded firearm,

31
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,355
it's you.

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,630
Lester?

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,995
Yeah!

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,270
Ah...

35
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,550
<i>Yeah?</i>

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,040
<i>My wife...</i>

37
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,117
<i>she's in the basement
dead and...</i>

38
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,635
<i>I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

39
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,394
<i>Lester, have you
been a bad boy?</i>

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,640
<i>Jeez. Yeah.</i>

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,393
<i>Can you come over?</i>

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,153
What did you do?

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,159
You killed her!

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,238
Okay. Okay.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,753
Evening, Lester.

46
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,593
What...
what do you want?

47
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,957
Well, I suppose first
I'd like to come in.

48
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,952
Is Pearl home?
No.

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,032
No, she's at my brother's.

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,953
Lester, listen
to me very carefully.

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,554
I need you to get
down on the ground.

52
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,273
Now, wait...
wait just a second.

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,919
Lester, on the ground!

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,275
This is not
what it looks like.

55
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,953
Look, I'm sorry...

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
about...

57
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
about electrocuting you.

58
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,155
I was just...

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,237
I mean,
this is obviously...

60
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,193
a misunderstanding.

61
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,715
'Cause, like...
like I said...

62
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,476
I'm just...
an insurance salesman.

63
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,671
Now that is not...
I... I got nothing...

64
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,753
The stuff that
you're mixed up in...
Not that you're...

65
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,752
I'm just saying... Well...

66
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,154
So, you see?

67
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,073
You said, "him."

68
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,276
What?

69
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,558
On the ice,
you said... "him."

70
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,994
You said it was "him."

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,320
Not you...

72
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,595
"him."

73
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,990
Yeah.

74
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,313
Well... well, I'm just
guessing here, but...

75
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,671
Well, that Hess was not
head stabbed by a girl.

76
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,514
No, no.

77
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,717
No, you said it
like you had a face in mind.

78
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,316
Uh-uh.

79
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,920
No, wait...

80
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,354
Stay with me.
Lester, stay with me.

81
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,954
God. Please, please...

82
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,360
I need a name.

83
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,078
I need a name.

84
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,270
Go ahead.

85
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,390
Wait! Please!

86
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,630
Wait.

87
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,950
God.

88
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,995
Lester...
No! Malvo. Malvo.

89
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,956
Malvo? Is that a first name?

90
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,070
Lester,

91
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,476
eventually, you just
swallow your tongue

92
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,630
and you die like a fish.

93
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,632
Lorne... I think.

94
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,155
Lorne like
the fella from <i>Bonanza.</i>

95
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
Lorne Malvo?

96
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,550
Where is he?

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,676
I'm gonna throw up.

98
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,790
No.

99
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,950
No, you're not.

100
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,474
If you puke in here,
I'll kill you.

101
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,914
I mean,
I'll actually kill you.

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,719
Okay.
Okay?

103
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,910
Lester, we need a location.

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,990
Location...

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,910
He took... he took my car.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,516
They called me and told me
it was impounded in Duluth.

107
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,159
So he's probably...

108
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,316
I think...
They got a picture...

109
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,437
There's a picture of him...
a picture of him up here.

110
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,477
Yeah, it's from
the law enforcement...
He had it. It's from a...

111
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,280
What do you call it?
An APB. So...

112
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,160
What?

113
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,353
Lorne Malvo? Yeah?

114
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,636
He killed him.
He killed Hess.

115
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,279
I mean...

116
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,270
Okay.

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,675
You two are free to go.
Bail's been paid.

118
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,029
Oh, God.

119
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,713
What if we wanna stay?

120
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,075
Pardon?

121
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,440
I don't know.
I mean, what if
we like it here?

122
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,638
Yeah... that's a good one.
On your feet.

123
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,712
You have any doubt
we can find you?

124
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,836
No.

125
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,793
Hey, buddy, you might
wanna have a doctor look
at that hand though.

126
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,678
Looks like it smarts.

127
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,240
<i>...some of
the largest snakes
found in the world.</i>

128
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,392
<i>Many members of
the python family
are ambush predators.</i>

129
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,592
<i>They remain motionless
before they strike.</i>

130
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,399
<i>It's not common
for them to attack humans,</i>

131
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,073
<i>unless, of course,
they're startled.</i>

132
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,949
<i>Now, advancements
in the technological
arena allow us</i>

133
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
<i>to examine their existence
in the Everglades.</i>

134
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,830
<i>Now look ahead, they're...</i>

135
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,559
No way around it.

136
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,274
I said more sand.

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,430
Back then?

138
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,954
Yeah, wild goose chase.

139
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,440
Salt's okay.

140
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,193
Hang on. Frank calling.

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,034
Well, Chief,
there've been some
interesting developments

142
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
while you were...
Chief, Frank on the line.

143
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,113
New storm data.

144
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,078
Yeah, Frank.
What you got then?

145
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,391
This case is really...
It's heating up.

146
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,756
That much, huh? Jeez.

147
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,639
They're saying 2 feet
new accumulation.

148
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,110
So...
we got the phone dump back

149
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,839
from Lester's from
the night of the murders.

150
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,594
Okay, thanks much.
You, too.

151
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,195
Call Hoenecker with State,
see if we can get
some more plows,

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,637
and, uh, make sure they're
plowing the Chief's drive
every few hours.

153
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,554
Can't have Ida
going into labor under
a snowbound scenario.

154
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,710
Okay, yeah.

155
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,314
Now, what's all this?

156
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,198
I was saying,
we got the phone dump back,

157
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,033
and right around
the time Pearl died,

158
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,158
an outgoing call was
placed from Lester's
to Leroy's Motor Inn.

159
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,277
So I made a call.
No one asked you to.

160
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,158
I know, but you were
in Duluth, so I figured...

161
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,311
Left Knutson in charge.
Right.

162
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,679
So I made a call...
and get this, Lorraine,
the manager--

163
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,513
Lorraine Abbey?

164
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,195
No, sir, Lorraine Babbit.

165
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,035
Curly hair... looks like
she draws her eyebrows
on with a Sharpie?

166
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,397
No, sir,
this is a severe
woman with hard hair.

167
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,437
Anyway, she IDs
the photo of the suspect

168
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,398
from the naked
fella kidnapping.

169
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,837
Says he stayed
one night, that being
the night Hess was killed.

170
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,719
She got a name for
him, too. Lorne Malvo.

171
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,636
And you found this how?

172
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,830
Like I said...

173
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,189
a call was placed
from Lester's house

174
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,317
to the motel where
the suspect was staying.

175
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,232
So, I talked to housekeeping

176
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,039
and they say this
Malvo fella left behind

177
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,190
some tokens from
the Lucky Penny.

178
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,636
They wanna know
how many plows.

179
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,353
At least three,
don't you think?

180
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,999
At least three.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,834
He says he can
give you two good ones
and a pickup with baby plow.

182
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,991
Sir.
Yeah, I'm listening.

183
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,070
Okay, good.

184
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,437
So I go and talk to
the lady that Hess
was with, the dancer,

185
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,591
and she says that
before he was stabbed,

186
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,911
Hess was laughing
about this fella
that he bullied.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,480
Broke the poor
guy's nose, she said.

188
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,994
The same day.

189
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,753
Chief?
Is that a yes
on the baby plow?

190
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,513
So right away,
I'm thinking,

191
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,435
"Who do we know
who got his nose broke
the day Hess died?"

192
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,000
Lester.
Wait.

193
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,191
Chief?
So you see?

194
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,511
Hess breaks Lester's nose.

195
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,957
Lester goes to
the emergency room
where he meets our suspect.

196
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,191
That night
Hess gets killed.

197
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,236
The next day,

198
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,358
Lester places a call
to the motel where
our suspect is staying,

199
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,079
and shortly
thereafter or abouts,

200
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,873
Mrs. Nygaard and
the Chief are murdered.

201
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,235
Chief?

202
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,118
Yeah, tell him
I'll call him back.

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,953
He's gotta call you back.

204
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,554
Son of a bitch.

205
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,960
Yes, sir.

206
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,112
So I'm thinking maybe
this is a murder-for-hire
type deal, right?

207
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,472
Where Lester hires this
Malvo fella to kill Hess.

208
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,711
Only maybe Lester
don't got the money to pay

209
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,871
so things get sour.

210
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,794
Listen, I know
it's not my case...

211
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,870
but I'd like your permission

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,879
to go back to Lester's house
and see what he has to say.

213
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,993
Not at his house.

214
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,992
Okay, his work then.

215
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,790
No... I'm saying,
he's not at his house.
He's in a holding cell.

216
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,395
Knutson says Lester
took a swing at him.

217
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,800
Not sure if he
was drunk or what.

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,870
He's in custody?

219
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,599
I told Dougie to
keep him overnight,

220
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,359
you know,
let him sleep it off.

221
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,917
Well... I mean,
we gotta talk to him,
don't you think?

222
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,038
I guess we'd better.

223
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,592
I need to use your computer.

224
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,080
Yeah.

225
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,956
It's on the front.

226
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,917
Computers at the precinct...
have it on the back.

227
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,594
Here, let me.

228
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,558
What do you need?

229
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,634
There's a pastor
up in Baudette.
Name of Frank Peterson.

230
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,150
A few hits.

231
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,038
A church website...

232
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,679
some stuff from
the local paper.

233
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,638
There anything
with a picture?

234
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,075
Uffda.

235
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,509
What's this for?

236
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,875
A case.

237
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,395
You said there were
other news stories.

238
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,034
Nothing with a picture.

239
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,873
Church fundraiser...

240
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,116
new roof...
that kind of thing.

241
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,790
Check for, uh, Lorne Malvo.
Could you check...

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,480
Nothing.
Okay.

243
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,471
He steals a car.
I pull him over.

244
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,758
He drives away.
The car is impounded.

245
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,633
He stays in Duluth.

246
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,197
He stays in Duluth.
I stop him on the street.

247
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,839
On that street.

248
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,475
On foot.

249
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,476
He was on
that street on foot.

250
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,517
<i>Come in, Greta. Over.</i>

251
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,434
Why was he on
that street on foot?

252
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,636
Dad.

253
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,313
<i>Greta, come in, Greta.</i>
Do you wanna...

254
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,470
Oh, right.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,231
Okay. It's almost bedtime.

256
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,710
And, hey...
I may go out for a bit.

257
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,916
Okay.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,070
Come in. Over.

259
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,515
Back for more, huh?

260
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
I need a police scanner.

261
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,197
Got a special on
remote control helicopters.

262
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,830
Can you monitor
police activity on it?

263
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,036
Doubt it.

264
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,280
I'll just stick
with the scanner.

265
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,680
Okay.

266
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,800
I got handheld or
dashboard mountable.
Oh. Also...

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,196
got this one in pink.

268
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,515
Do I look like I want
a pink police scanner?

269
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,509
I don't know.

270
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,910
Could be a gift for a lady.

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,559
And in your experience...

272
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,400
police scanners,
is that a gift
ladies get wet for?

273
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
Had an aunt once,

274
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,315
owned a riot shield...
made her own jerky...

275
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,880
I'll just stick
with the black.

276
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,870
Okay.

277
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,795
Anything else?

278
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,200
Yeah,
I need a walkie-talkie.

279
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,873
Yeah...

280
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,160
afraid I can't just
sell you one, stretch.

281
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,234
You see, they come in pairs...
you know, so you can
chat with a friend.

282
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,033
I don't have any friends.

283
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,473
It's a sad story.

284
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,354
I still gotta
sell you two. Hey...

285
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,831
maybe you could make
a friend and give it to him.

286
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,151
Maybe I could
give it to you...

287
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,757
call you up late at night
and you can listen
to me shit on people.

288
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,037
Oh.
Where's your phone?

289
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,680
What are you...
Are you supposed to be here?

290
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,989
The phone?

291
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,595
Yeah, in the...
in the kitchen.

292
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,950
Uh...

293
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,271
What's going on?

294
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,190
What's that?

295
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,599
Don't talk.

296
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,430
Are you calling him?

297
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,636
I said don't talk.

298
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,790
This is exciting.

299
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,197
Yeah.
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

300
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,950
Where were you?

301
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,076
<i>I was hunting.</i>

302
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,516
<i>I heard about the bugs.
Do you need me to swing by?</i>

303
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,556
It's too late now.

304
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,149
I'm gonna pay.

305
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,640
The blackmail,
I'm gonna pay it.

306
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,439
<i>Tell me what he said.</i>

307
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,199
It doesn't matter now.

308
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,192
I broke a promise.

309
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,749
Me. So I gotta pay.

310
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,753
Look, I can find the guy.
I just need a few more days.

311
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,676
I couldn't sleep last night.
I kept going over
and over it in my head.

312
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,151
And God brought 10 plagues
upon the house of Pharaoh.

313
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,518
<i>Blood and locusts...
flies and boils.</i>

314
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,716
And the last is the death
of the firstborn son.

315
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,477
What exactly do you
think is happening?

316
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,597
The firstborn son.

317
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,353
<i>The Book of Exodus.</i>

318
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,079
<i>God is watching
and He knows.</i>

319
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,196
Knows what?

320
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,950
I told Semenko

321
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,838
to take Dmitri someplace safe
until this all blows over.

322
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,513
He thinks I'm crazy.
Do you think I'm crazy?

323
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,196
We're only as good
as the promises we keep.

324
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,919
Pick me up in an hour.

325
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,759
We'll get
the money.
<i>All right.</i>

326
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,710
So?

327
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,675
He's gonna pay?

328
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,360
Mmm-hmm.
I can't...

329
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,072
A million dollars?

330
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,477
A million... Oh!

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,036
Are you kidding me?

332
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,314
Do you have
a closet that locks?
Yeah.

333
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,869
The...
the pantry locks, I think.

334
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,634
Oh, my God. A million...

335
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,680
Hey... how big is that...
a million dollars?

336
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,400
Does it... does it fit
into a suitcase or, like,
a sack or something?

337
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,477
It's gonna be...
it's gotta be
pretty heavy, right?

338
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,075
Hey, can I...
can I lay in it?

339
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,799
You know,
I always liked
that part of movies

340
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,519
where the characters,
they just lay
in a big pile...

341
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,636
You got a drill?

342
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,796
Yeah.

343
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,832
And then they always...
they always take the money,

344
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,832
and they just, like,
throw it up in the air,

345
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,116
and the money just...

346
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,795
just, like, flutters down
on top of them, you know?

347
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,076
God damn.
We're doing this.
We're really...

348
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,150
I got goose bumps.

349
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,310
Wood screws.

350
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,510
Yeah.

351
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,514
I'm gonna buy real
marble for the spa.
6 inches thick.

352
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,751
I got these...
I got these
French lotions on hold.

353
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,559
They smell like sunflowers.

354
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,710
Uh, these?

355
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,715
Longer.
Okay.

356
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,995
So what do we...
what do we do?

357
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,196
Just, like,
call him in the morning,

358
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,397
you know,
tell him where to meet us?

359
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,550
I don't know, these?

360
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,796
Yeah, give me a few.

361
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,553
Look at me.
I'm sweating.

362
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,075
Here. Oh, man.

363
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,070
Hey... do I get to
use that voice thing again?

364
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,834
You know, the...
the Darth Vader,
super sinister, like,

365
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,832
"Luke, I am your father."

366
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,950
Please step in.

367
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,030
Sure.

368
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,113
Hey, you know, I...
I never even asked you,

369
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,317
what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

370
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,995
I mean,
I told you about my...

371
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,430
Uh...

372
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,952
Yeah, am I...
Did you mean to
lock me in here?

373
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,759
We got a big day tomorrow.
Get some rest.

374
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,880
I don't want you
getting cold feet.
I'll see you in the morning.

375
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,795
No, no, wait.
Hold on now. Heck, I'm...

376
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,080
What am I supposed to...

377
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,629
What... what if I
gotta go to the toilet?

378
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,474
You're a smart guy.
You'll figure something out.

379
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,510
Poop.

380
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,272
I have news.

381
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,556
It's just slowing
down at the shop.

382
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,990
Lester?

383
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,952
It's not my fault.

384
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,834
You bought me...
you bought me the tie.

385
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,074
You... You...

386
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,240
Is it a cut or what is it?

387
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,835
Puncture, maybe.
Hard to tell
with all the gore.

388
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,393
Mr. Nygaard,
can you hear me?

389
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,199
It's the towel sound.
She's washing towels.

390
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,794
Mr. Nygaard,
we're getting you
to the hospital.

391
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,075
What happened to your hand?

392
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,196
Socks.

393
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,396
What about socks?

394
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,871
For $55 he threw
in the shotgun.

395
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,276
I don't understand.
Were you shot?

396
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,990
Mr. Nygaard.

397
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,036
Did you pay Lorne Malvo
to kill Sam Hess?

398
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,872
I never paid him.

399
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,797
Okay, offered to pay then.

400
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,793
Made a deal.
And then... when he
came for the money...

401
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,793
I never paid.
I didn't pay.

402
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,869
Yeah, okay, but...

403
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,113
arrangements were made...
and then...

404
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,873
I don't know,
you tell me,
things went south--

405
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,916
Excuse us, miss.

406
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,673
There...

407
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,796
There.

408
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,036
All right,
we'll get you inside.

409
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,919
Of course.
Left right there.

410
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,554
Is that what
you're looking for then?

411
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,955
Two kids.

412
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,915
I'm sorry?

413
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,110
I got two kids and a wife
who thinks out loud.

414
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,234
This is the time I get.

415
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,951
Accidental for me.

416
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,160
Troubled mind.

417
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,754
I'll come to you.

418
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,278
The winters are cold...
but I can't complain.

419
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,309
My socks have holes...
but again, do I complain?

420
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,390
I do not.

421
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,194
The oldest needs braces...

422
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,796
the youngest once sneezed
for three days straight...

423
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,278
but who could complain?

424
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,635
They're gifts.

425
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,396
Children?

426
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,556
All of it.

427
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,272
The cold, the holes.

428
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,193
Hey, so...
I have a question.

429
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,471
Spiritually, I mean.
Um...

430
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,313
Or not spiritually, but...

431
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,235
I don't know, of...
like, an ethical nature.

432
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,950
Please.

433
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,189
Well...

434
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,516
let's say I know
a person is guilty.

435
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,072
He's committed a crime,
only... you know...
I can't prove it.

436
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,357
Like, he has
everyone else fooled,
but... but I know.

437
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,950
What am I--

438
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,235
Find the proof.

439
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,711
Yeah... okay,
but here's the thing...

440
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,837
I'm no detective.

441
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,240
I mean, Molly, she's...

442
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,589
amazing.

443
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,160
But I just...

444
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,599
And then there's Greta,
you know, and... and...

445
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,991
Am I supposed to
put myself in danger
or do I just...

446
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,671
I don't know,
just... let it go?

447
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,195
A rich man opens
the paper one day.

448
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,277
He sees the world
is full of misery.

449
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,555
Is this a...

450
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,915
It's a parable.

451
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,750
A rich man opens
the paper one day.

452
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,355
He sees the world
is full of misery.

453
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,552
<i>He says...</i>

454
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,996
<i>"I have money.
I can help."</i>

455
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,750
<i>So, he gives away
all of his money...</i>

456
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,271
<i>but it's not enough.</i>

457
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,636
<i>The people are
still suffering.</i>

458
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,558
<i>One day the man
sees another article.</i>

459
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,595
<i>He decides he was
foolish to think just
giving money was enough.</i>

460
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,518
<i>So, he goes to
the doctor and says,</i>

461
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,512
<i>"Doctor, I want to
donate a kidney."</i>

462
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,076
<i>The doctors do the surgery.</i>

463
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,717
<i>It's a complete success.</i>

464
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,517
<i>After, he knows
he should feel good,
but he doesn't...</i>

465
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,956
<i>for people are
still suffering.</i>

466
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,399
<i>So he goes back
to the doctor.</i>

467
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,599
<i>He says, "Doctor,
this time, I want
to give it all."</i>

468
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,195
<i>The doctor says,
"What does that mean,
give it all?"</i>

469
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,398
<i>He says, "This time,
I want to donate my liver...</i>

470
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,119
but not just my liver.

471
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,715
I want to donate my heart,
but not just my heart.

472
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,793
I want to donate my corneas,
but not just my corneas.

473
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,111
<i>I want to
give it all away...</i>

474
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,719
<i>everything I am...</i>

475
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,473
<i>all that I have."</i>

476
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,074
<i>The doctor says,</i>

477
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,674
<i>"A kidney is one thing,</i>

478
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,639
<i>but you can't give away
your whole body,
piece by piece.</i>

479
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,915
<i>That's suicide."</i>

480
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,473
<i>And he sends the man home.</i>

481
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,400
<i>But the man cannot live...</i>

482
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,111
<i>knowing that
the people are suffering
and he could help.</i>

483
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,600
<i>So he gives the one
thing he has left...</i>

484
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,550
<i>his life.</i>

485
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,519
<i>And does it work?
Does it stop the suffering?</i>

486
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,720
You live in the world.
What do you think?

487
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,599
So, he killed
himself for nothing?

488
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,830
Did he?

489
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,319
Well, I mean...

490
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,519
You're saying...

491
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,519
What are you saying?

492
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,591
Only a fool thinks
he can solve
the world's problems.

493
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,195
Yeah, but you gotta
try, don't you?

494
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,270
Nope.

495
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,995
Keep it running.

496
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,556
Say, Dad...

497
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,553
I was talking
to the, uh, bug guy.

498
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,711
He's saying this
is all real odd.

499
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,079
The crickets...
he's saying they're
not local, you know...

500
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,634
not from around here.

501
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,710
He's saying
they're the kind

502
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,996
you buy at a pet store
to feed your lizard or...

503
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,076
God sent them.

504
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,073
Yeah... but, well...

505
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,232
So... I called around
to all the pet stores,

506
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,470
and wouldn't you know--

507
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,313
Look, kid,
I don't have
time for this now.

508
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,357
Just clean it up.
Then pack your shit.

509
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,272
Wally is coming
to take you to the cabin.

510
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,555
Yeah, but, Dad...
No buts!

511
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,871
Just do it.

512
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,720
Excuse me.

513
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,920
Hey there, Molly.

514
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,190
Hey.

515
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,430
Uh, Lester okay?

516
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,989
He's had a bad week,
that's for sure.
Yeah.

517
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,878
What's this?
His third time in?
Yeah.

518
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,913
On the plus side,
the nose is healing nicely.

519
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,673
Well, that's a start.
Yeah.

520
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,635
So... Uh, listen,
about that hand...

521
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,114
Oh, real mess there.

522
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,669
Super infected, nasty stuff.

523
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,434
I drained the wound,
removed the foreign object,

524
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,634
cut away the necrotic tissue,
and filled him full
of IV antibiotics.

525
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,632
He won't lose the hand,
but it came close.

526
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,519
Yeah. Now, when you say...
foreign object...

527
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,193
Shotgun pellet,
looked like.

528
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,800
Had some fabric
attached to it.

529
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,315
So, it's possible the pellet
passed through something

530
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,199
before getting
into Lester's hand.

531
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah, or someone.

532
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,593
Pardon?

533
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,670
Can I talk to him?

534
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,750
Well, he's sedated now,

535
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,674
on account of
he was septic when
you brought him in, so...

536
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,194
Like I said,
real nasty stuff.

537
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,720
Right, yeah, yeah.

538
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,712
Be a while before
he can answer any questions.

539
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,240
Hey, you seen Ida?

540
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,310
Wait, is she here?

541
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,472
Yeah... upstairs.
Just had the baby.

542
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,313
Holy smokes.
Yeah.

543
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,390
Girl or boy?

544
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,349
Bernadette,
I heard, so... girl.

545
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,873
Yeah.
Yeah.

546
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,236
<i>Dr. Esbit, call 1 18.</i>

547
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,317
Excuse me.
All right.

548
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,951
It was the Romans,
wasn't it?

549
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,753
What are you saying?

550
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,550
Saint Lawrence, your window...
the Romans burned him alive.

551
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,077
They did?

552
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,150
You know why?

553
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,236
'Cause he was Christian.

554
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,993
Maybe.

555
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,680
But I think it was
because the Romans
were raised by wolves.

556
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,676
Greatest empire
in human history,
founded by wolves.

557
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,357
You know what wolves do.

558
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,712
They hunt.

559
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,840
They kill.

560
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,435
That's why I never bought
into <i>The Jungle Book.</i>

561
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,795
A boy is raised by wolves,

562
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,634
he becomes friends
with a bear and a panther.

563
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,279
I don't think so.

564
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,440
I knew a guy once.
Had a 110-pound Rottweiler...

565
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,432
and one night,
this girl thought
it'd be funny

566
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,718
to get down on all fours
and let the dog hump her.

567
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,917
The dog still
had its balls.

568
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,430
Well, the dog gets up there,
but he's not in on the joke.

569
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,032
This is just a bitch in heat
as far as he's concerned...

570
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,397
and he's not leaving till
he gets what he came for.

571
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,470
Well, the girl, too late,
realizes the kind of
mistake she's made.

572
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,313
She wants to get up.

573
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,197
But the dog had other ideas.

574
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,554
Had to shoot it
behind the ear to
get it off of her.

575
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,992
I don't... I don't...

576
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,072
Well, I'm saying that...

577
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,277
the Romans,
raised by wolves,

578
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,671
they see a guy
turning water into wine...

579
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,830
what do they do?

580
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,400
They eat him.

581
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,356
'Cause there are no saints
in the animal kingdom.

582
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,432
Only breakfast and dinner.

583
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,590
So what time do
you want me to pick
you up in the morning?

584
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,440
No... we're done.

585
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,671
You can stay the night,
but you gotta hit
the road come dawn.

586
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,678
Here's what I owe you.

587
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,472
Sorry it didn't work out.

588
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,875
Grimly.

589
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,680
<i>Heya... it's Molly.</i>

590
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,399
Oh, yeah,
how you doin' there?

591
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,159
Pretty good.

592
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,799
How's things
going with you?

593
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,477
Not bad. Just...
trying to figure
this thing out.

594
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,677
Yeah, so,
I was wondering...

595
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,353
with this fella
I arrested...

596
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,150
how come he was there,
you know, on the street...

597
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,310
on that street?

598
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,392
I mean,
if he is our guy and not,

599
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,551
you know,
some pastor actually.

600
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,029
<i>So what'd
you come up with?</i>

601
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,918
Well, see...

602
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,072
I'm not sure
what I'm looking
for is the problem.

603
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,632
Plus, you know,
it's dark out, so...
maybe go back out tomorrow.

604
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,036
Oh. I was thinking
I might drive
out in the morning,

605
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,395
take a look at Lester's car.

606
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,836
Thought maybe...
after we could get together.

607
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,149
You know,
compare notes on this thing.

608
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,119
Sure. That'd be...

609
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,475
I'd like that.

610
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,355
Okay, so tomorrow then.

611
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,230
Okay.

612
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,356
<i>What'd you get
for number three?</i>

613
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,114
<i>X squared.
What'd you get for four?</i>

614
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,839
<i>A rhombus?</i>

615
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,596
Help you?

616
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,478
You're not
supposed to be here.

617
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,797
Oh, no, I'm pretty sure
I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

618
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,960
Hi.

619
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,360
Neighborhood watch.

620
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,397
If you don't move,
I'm gonna have
to call the cops.

621
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,591
Well, friend,
there's no need for that.

622
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,876
This is a nice neighborhood.

623
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,839
Children play in
the streets, my children.

624
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,152
We have block parties...
fruit punch.

625
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,956
We don't need a man
in a dark car doing things.

626
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,280
You mean like sitting?

627
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,714
Don't be a <i>nudnik.</i>

628
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,917
This is a community.

629
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,236
People watch
each other's backs.

630
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,074
Someone gets sick,
someone dies,
you bring a casserole...

631
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,150
help.

632
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,439
Maybe I'm here to help.

633
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,318
No, you have black eyes.

634
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,436
You're trouble.

635
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,955
I'm going inside
and I'm calling the cops.

636
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,076
Which building?

637
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,031
The one with
the Jew bus outside?

638
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,112
There it is.

639
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,714
Now the truth comes out.

640
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,036
You know...
some people think

641
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,796
you don't need alarms
on second story windows.

642
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,430
They think they
can save a few bucks,
you know, and still be safe.

643
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,789
Another way they save money

644
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,556
is they don't
hook up the alarm
to the phone line,

645
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,633
so the bell rings,
but the cops don't come...

646
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,712
or they come,
but only after
the neighbors call...

647
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,039
which... if this community
is tight as you say,

648
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,520
you know...

649
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,517
just might be quick enough
to save your life...

650
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,235
or your children's lives...

651
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,595
maybe.

652
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,240
Se'irim.

653
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,198
You have a nice night.

654
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,714
How come we're all
in the hall then?

655
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,634
Ida kicked us out...
said we were being too loud.

656
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,030
Ah. You know,
she did just
have a baby, so...

657
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,474
Ah. We all agreed it
was a good point.

658
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,960
Yeah.

659
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,599
So you're... being loud
in the hall instead.

660
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,236
All right, boys,
let's... pack it up.

661
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,549
Call her a night.

662
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,677
You really wanna go out there?
No.

663
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,910
Goin' away.
From me.

664
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,559
I gotta protect
the baby here.

665
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,438
Come on...
Bill's got a job to do.

666
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,989
Hey, you're making
too much noise.

667
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,237
Sorry, you sleeping?

668
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,435
Well,
that's a baby, all right.

669
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,840
Smell her.

670
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,310
Okay.

671
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,034
That's what a new
one smells like then.

672
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,190
Yeah.

673
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,160
How you holding up?

674
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,276
Me?

675
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,272
You're the one
just had a baby.

676
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,874
Yeah, but I get
to lie down now.

677
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,520
Yeah.

678
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,272
I just look tired.

679
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,113
Inside, I'm raring to go.

680
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,679
So...

681
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,793
How much do you wanna--
I don't need details.

682
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,872
Just tell me
you're taking care of it.

683
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,873
I'm trying, yeah.

684
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,711
Do you want me
to stay the night?
I could sleep in the chair.

685
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,120
No, I got people coming...

686
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,113
my sister and her daughter.

687
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,192
Be here around
11:00, she said.

688
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,993
They said... Bernadette.

689
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,515
Vern's idea...
his mother's name.

690
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,471
I wanted Allie.

691
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,234
And now he's dead.

692
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,232
That man always knew
how to win an argument.

693
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,314
I think it's pretty, so...

694
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,909
Good 'cause
you're the babysitter.

695
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,676
Now go home.
Let me sleep.

696
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,877
And you do the same.
You look like a raccoon.

697
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,191
Yeah.

698
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,239
I gotta go to
Duluth in the a.m.,
but I'll stop by after, yeah.
