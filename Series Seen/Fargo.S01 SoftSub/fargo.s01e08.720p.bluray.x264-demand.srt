1
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,470
Mr. Nygaard?

2
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,870
Oh, you betcha.

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,354
Yeah.
She's a beaut.

4
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,757
Got the low-water feature,
but don't skimp on torque.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,314
Am I taking the old one?

6
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,393
Yeah, if that's...
They said on the phone
it'd be no problem.

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,358
Oh, sure.
It's no problem.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,560
The T-160? Hmm, yeah.

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,710
Geez. I see why
you're trading her in.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,917
She's a real lemon.
Motor mount.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,755
Chinese used plastic screws.
Bet she bucked like a bronco.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,036
You do not know
the half of it.

13
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,710
Stopped making
'em pretty quick.
Recalled, I think.

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,990
Surprised to see her,
truth be told.

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,316
You'd be better off washing
your clothes
between two rocks.

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,516
You know what I mean?

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,711
They got Chaz up
at Faribault till
the trial.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,559
Gordo's at Red Wing.

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,433
Which is...

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,997
Well, you know...
At least they're close.

21
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,232
His lawyer thinks
we can plea it
down to probation.

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,033
Time served.

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,110
For murder?

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,793
No, Gordo...

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,037
On the gun charge.
Oh, yeah.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,319
Chaz? Well, good riddance.
Don't care what that man gets.

27
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,909
No, sir,
not after what he did.

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,880
Killing my wife,
you mean?

29
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,317
Oh, well, yeah.
Yeah, of course, that.

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
But also...

31
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,239
Well, I mean,
look at me.

32
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,236
I was Miss Hubbard County,
for Pete's sake.

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,591
You don't cheat on
Miss Hubbard County.

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,638
I just don't
believe it,
you know.

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,275
I mean,
just three weeks ago,

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,792
we were sitting
around the table
eating ham.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,596
And now Gordo's having
his night terrors again.

38
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,195
Plus,
we have to sell everything
to pay the legal bills.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,672
Did you know...
Chaz bought
a time share in a boat?

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,110
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah, it's a thing.

42
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,638
So if there's anything
from the house you want...

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,436
You know, like
I was thinking maybe
Chaz's hunting gear?

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,719
I boxed it up for you.
Not sure
it's anything you want.

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,156
Oh, sure.
That'd be fine,
thank you.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,233
Well...
listen, if there's
anything I can do.

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,630
Oh, no...
Lester,
you are so sweet.

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,439
I am the one who
should be saying that

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,319
after what he did
to you, my husband.

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,234
Oh, what'd you get?

51
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,070
New washer.
The old one...

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,432
Well, I had to get rid of
everything from the basement.

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,239
On account of all the...

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,509
You deserve it, Lester.

55
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,034
All good things.

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,474
You deserve.

57
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Back to it then?

58
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,277
Looks like. Doc
cleared me for duty, so...

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,951
More flowers came
for you from Duluth.

60
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,951
A smarter man
would think you
were being wooed.

61
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,192
I don't know what
you're talking about.

62
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,194
Put 'em up where we
can see 'em at least.

63
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,796
So, you got a strategy
on this Lester thing?

64
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,634
Well, I'm just gonna walk in
and say, "Bill..."

65
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,433
If you think it's best...

66
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,469
Direct approach.

67
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,110
Your point being?

68
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,230
Got no point.

69
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,917
Okay. Bye, Dad.

70
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,879
Chief, are you busy?

71
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,235
What's that?

72
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,712
Said, "Are you busy?"
Got a request for
your attendance.

73
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,079
Can it wait?
I just ate an omelet...
Waiting for it to digest.

74
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,675
Oh, yeah?
What kind?

75
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,036
It was mushrooms
and cheese.

76
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,192
Sally make it?
Yeah.

77
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,840
She wrapped it
in tin foil to
keep it warm.

78
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,471
Molly needs you
is the thing.

79
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,671
Asked me to see
if you'd come down
to the staff room.

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,160
She's back already?

81
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,833
Yeah.
Hmm.

82
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,354
Thought I had another day.

83
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,070
All right.

84
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,629
Let's go see what
we're gonna do today.

85
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,954
There she is,
the gunfighter.

86
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,434
Hey, Chief.

87
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
Nice collage, you take up
basket weaving too
in your downtime?

88
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,273
Yeah, it's just
some loose ends
I wanted to...

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,671
Molly, before you...
I want you to know...

90
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,156
I'm not too proud
to say I was wrong

91
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,278
on the Lester case.
I had the wrong idea.

92
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,113
I thought it was
a drifter thing.

93
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,079
Which was the wrong
way to go, clearly.

94
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,517
But, you know,
some good police work,
and we caught the guy, so...

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,429
That's the problem,

96
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,273
actually, um...

97
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,350
Is that you're still...

98
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,272
Still what?

99
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,990
Wrong.

100
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,710
I mean, no disrespect.
It's just...

101
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,476
It doesn't make any sense.
I mean, the brother?

102
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,631
With all
the things
we know are true.

103
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,394
And I've been lying in bed
just thinking about this.

104
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,517
For example,
okay, if it was
the brother,

105
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,831
then how do we explain
the phone call from
Lester's to the motel...

106
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,040
Molly! Darn it! Now just...
You can't keep going over...

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,834
It's time.
You gotta let it go.

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,756
We did our job.
The brother Nygaard
killed the wife.

109
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,638
And he cornered
and shot the Chief.

110
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,995
And Lester was
covering for him

111
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,309
on account of
the brother thing.

112
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,720
Which explains...

113
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,758
We had drinks
to celebrate.

114
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,752
I had a greyhound.

115
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,514
And Knutson had...
What was it with the cherry?

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,193
Rob Roy.
Rob Roy. Yeah.

117
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,710
You had a few of them
if I'm not... Mistaken.

118
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,712
What about the Hess case?
What about it?

119
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,790
Still open. Yeah?

120
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,230
Yeah. No. See...

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,232
We're checking to see
if the hooker had
a boyfriend,

122
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,310
jealous type...

123
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,631
You know, didn't
like her getting tooled
by every Tom, Dick and Jane.

124
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,955
But otherwise...
Who's working that now?

125
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,110
Terry.

126
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,751
Well, that's good.
Yeah.

127
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,431
Except Terry doesn't know
which end of the mop to use

128
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,358
to wash the floor.

129
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,559
He's not the brightest bulb.
I'll give you that.

130
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,960
But he's soldiering through.

131
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,360
Well, good for him.

132
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,036
Except I'm back now.

133
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,395
No.
Chief, please...

134
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,678
Now, Molly...
Deputy, now
I would give it to you.

135
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
I would.

136
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,879
Except we both
know in two days,

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,595
I'd be back in this room
with you pointing at
names on that whiteboard,

138
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,194
and me chewing my tie.

139
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,034
Chief, for Pete's sake,
I've got evidence

140
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,157
that puts
Lester Nygaard
in a room

141
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,436
with a known killer
on the day of
the Hess murder,

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,591
and then the next night,
Lester called the guy.

143
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,076
He called him at the motel...
Look!

144
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,915
You can't...
That's just how
it is sometimes.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,153
Life.
You go to bed
unsatisfied.

146
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,596
They're calling
the lottery numbers
on the TV

147
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,194
and you get
the first few.

148
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,879
And already
in your mind,

149
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,917
you're buying a jet or
a fjord or whatever.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,559
But it's just
not meant to be.

151
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,677
It's just not
meant to be.

152
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,756
Hey. Look, we're all
real glad to have you back.

153
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,991
Okay? You're a heck
of a police officer.

154
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,671
Tell her about the cake.
Yeah.

155
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,793
The guys are gonna have
a cake for you later.

156
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,556
Try to look surprised.
It's really something.

157
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,879
It's got an assault rifle
on top, made of frosting.

158
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,480
Which I don't know
how they do that.
But...

159
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,797
Heya, Lester.
I like your tie.

160
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,994
Thank you.
I got it online.
Oh, yeah?

161
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,230
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

162
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,198
Jacket, too.

163
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,590
I was a bit nervous
about it at first.

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,996
Had to send
the jacket back
once actually.

165
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,879
It was...
Too big in the arms.

166
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,236
Well, I think
you look terrific.

167
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,754
Oh.

168
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,119
And...
I was thinking of making
some chili on Saturday night.

169
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,271
If you maybe
wanted to join me?

170
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,079
Where is he?

171
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,595
You son of a bitch.

172
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,911
I'm gonna bust your balls.

173
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,514
You want me to do it, Ma?
Yeah, Ma, want us to?

174
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,590
Shut up!

175
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,196
I am gonna
bust your balls.

176
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,078
Now, Mrs. Hess,
what can I do for...

177
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,674
Don't you
"Mrs. Hess" me.

178
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,991
I was picking your pubes
out of my teeth 12 hours ago.

179
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,275
And then I get this?

180
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,592
That is...
This is highly irregular.

181
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,839
I'll make some calls.

182
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,480
Liar!
Mrs. Hess.

183
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,473
Liar. You knew
the whole time...

184
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,914
No, Mrs...

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,151
Gina, this is...

186
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,674
Listen, I'm gonna
make some calls.

187
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,558
Like I said, I was
speaking to the guy

188
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,074
from Mid Claims
just yesterday.

189
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,719
He didn't mention
a single thing.

190
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,271
I let you come
inside of me.

191
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,874
That's really gross.
Yeah, Ma,
don't talk like that.

192
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,111
We don't need to bring
that into the conversation.

193
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,796
You are gonna
get me my money,
you little shit.

194
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,600
$2 million,
you've got until
the end of the day.

195
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,076
Or show him
what we'll do.

196
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,237
Jesus! All right.
All right.

197
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,396
Sorry, loser.

198
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,470
Me, too.

199
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,119
Ow.
Ow.

200
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,718
Yeah!

201
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,760
So are we calm?
Are we calm?

202
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,474
Now here's
what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna make some calls.

203
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,472
Like I said.

204
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,598
Because this is
the first that I've...

205
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,593
But if it's true,
if Sam did miss
some payments,

206
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,831
then, well, they're
within their rights to...

207
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,037
I think we might
have a problem here.

208
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,670
That was...

209
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,796
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

210
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,156
No, I'm... That was...

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,912
You're amazing.

212
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,995
He'll be right out.

213
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,915
Follow.

214
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,353
Sir? We...

215
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,079
What Agent Pepper
is trying to say,
the Syndicate spree killing,

216
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,758
yes, technically,
we were there outside...
In our car... While it was...

217
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,194
But you have to...

218
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,351
You have to see
it as a positive

219
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,111
because it leaves us,
myself and Agent Budge,

220
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,759
it leaves us...
Poised.

221
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,196
That's the word we like.
Poised to catch this guy.

222
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,160
Because, sir,
first of all,
we got this photo

223
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,754
from an ATM
across the street.

224
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,593
It captures our...
A single individual

225
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,592
who's clearly
armed and about to...

226
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,399
Now, the photo is
not great, but...

227
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,200
I... We were thinking
definitely white male.

228
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,513
Sir?

229
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,959
Listen. Sir...

230
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,316
This is where you work now.

231
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,119
We are highly effective,
highly trained...

232
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,754
I have a commendation.

233
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,516
A commendation?

234
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,916
That's your...

235
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,796
Okay.

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,992
Okay. It's...

237
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,997
We're still good.
We're still alive.
He could have...

238
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,634
It could be worse, right?
Much, much worse.

239
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,072
This right here?
Two weeks... Tops.

240
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,558
Just wants to see
us sweat a little...
Feel the...

241
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,872
I mean, it's only fair.

242
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,190
I can see that.

243
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,316
We did...

244
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,792
I mean,
22 people did get killed,

245
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,156
and we're sitting
in the car like a couple of...

246
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,995
Yeah, we're okay.
We're all right.

247
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,196
I've never heard
of a deaf hit man.

248
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,080
Carolina Murphy
had his tongue

249
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,914
cut out by an Indian
back in the '80s.

250
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,238
He worked a little after that,
but never quite the same.

251
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,835
Buzz Mead.
You know Buzz?

252
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,355
He was born
with just a socket.

253
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,192
He used to take
his glass eye out

254
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,272
at parties and
drop it in his drink.

255
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,115
He was a shit shot though.

256
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,592
Now the other fella,
your partner.

257
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,392
He can hear just fine.

258
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,840
We had a kind of chat
before I cut his throat.

259
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,237
You're unemployed now,
by the way

260
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,393
in case you don't
read the papers.

261
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,994
I'll kill you!

262
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,309
I watched a bear once.
Its leg was in a steel trap.

263
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,949
It chewed through
bloody bone to get free.

264
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,720
That was in Alaska.

265
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,672
It died about an hour later,
face down in a stream.

266
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,758
Well, it was on his
own terms, you know?

267
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,070
You got close...

268
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,519
Closer than anybody else.

269
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,117
I don't know if it was you
or your partner, but look...

270
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,637
If you still feel raw about
things when you heal up,
come see me.

271
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,838
Just me and Bill, right?

272
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,991
Slow night...
And the call comes in.

273
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,316
He don't like when
I tell this story.

274
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,757
Heard you
got some flowers.

275
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,076
Yeah, some people do love
to flap their lips.

276
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,674
More than once
is what I heard.

277
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,800
Well, there's a suitor...
Is all I'm prepared to say.

278
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,952
Vern was so bad
at courtship.

279
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,038
One time he gave me
a bouquet of poison ivy.

280
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,191
Picked it himself.

281
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,636
He's up in Duluth...

282
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,636
My gentleman.

283
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,277
Has a daughter.

284
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,874
What's his name?

285
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,355
They call him Sergio.

286
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,279
He's a pirate,
I think.

287
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,431
Very funny, you.
Well.

288
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,399
Yours is the one
with the icing clip.

289
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,473
And, Ida, your frosting
comes from the barrel.
I think.

290
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,400
Good to have everyone
together again,
don't you think?

291
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,914
It's like one big, happy...

292
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,391
Which is good, is all.

293
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,111
I wanted to thank you...
For catching the guy.

294
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,872
Not me.
I was in bed.

295
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,356
Stop. You were
in the hospital
with a bullet.

296
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,590
No.

297
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,512
Bill may have made the arrest,
but we both know
who did the real work.

298
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,358
He's not convicted yet.

299
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,870
I mean,
not all the evidence...

300
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,639
For me,
there are still...

301
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,191
But, yeah, no, I'm...
Glad it's behind us.

302
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,390
Ugh.

303
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,400
Deputy Solverson.

304
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,437
Yeah, hi. It's Gus...

305
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,789
<i>Grimly.</i>

306
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,195
Oh, yeah, hi.

307
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,996
So, what's happening then?

308
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,993
You know, on patrol.

309
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,719
<i>Oh, sure. Yeah.</i>

310
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,076
I helped a fella
who got his privates
stuck to a mailbox.

311
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,310
<i>Oh.</i>

312
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,034
Didn't like his mail?

313
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,270
<i>Something like that.</i>

314
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,120
There's the hearing tomorrow
on the shooting.

315
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,957
Oh, yeah.
That's...

316
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,875
That's tomorrow.

317
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,798
Well, just tell the truth.

318
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,599
<i>Don't you think?</i>

319
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,114
<i>It was a white out,</i>

320
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,195
<i>and you saw a shadow
and you shot at it.</i>

321
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,919
But leave out the part...

322
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,074
Leave out the part where
the person you shot was me.

323
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,640
I am really sorry
about that.

324
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,114
Yeah. I gathered from
the volume of flowers.

325
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,112
Too much?
<i>No.</i>

326
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,630
No, it's nice.

327
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,914
So...
I saw in the paper
this morning,

328
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,595
the logging festival's
coming up

329
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,797
<i>over in your neck of the...</i>

330
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,997
<i>And Greta, she really
likes going to that.</i>

331
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,673
Yeah, me too.

332
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,114
<i>Yeah? Good.</i>

333
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,760
Good. Well, maybe...

334
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,038
I mean,
maybe we'll see you there.

335
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,279
Yeah, a certainty
if we go together.

336
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,633
Yeah. Yeah, that's...

337
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,714
You're right about that.

338
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,919
And when you're right,
you're right.

339
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,519
On Friday,
there's chainsaw carving,
and... All you can eat.

340
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,274
<i>And on Saturday
they roast a
pig underground.</i>

341
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,472
<i>I've never had it,
but it's supposed
to be good.</i>

342
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,513
Oh, I didn't know that
you could do that.

343
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,994
<i>On Sundays,
they do a pie-eating
contest.</i>

344
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,438
Yeah, yeah. No...
I like to just
go for the food.

345
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,036
Greta likes all
the different contests
they have.

346
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,679
Have you ever
seen the guys,

347
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,436
they go all the way up
to the top of the tree...

348
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,593
They've got like bells
and the spikey shoes...

349
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,197
<i>Dad? Come in, Dad.
Over.</i>

350
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,718
Dad here, come back.

351
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,190
<i>What's the deal
with dinner? Over.</i>

352
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,916
Yeah, just finishing up.
Thought we'd do tacos tonight.
Over.

353
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,879
<i>Okay.
Don't forget the red sauce.
Over and out.</i>

354
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,517
I'm home!

355
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,592
You forgot the food,
didn't you?

356
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
Mom home?
Yeah.

357
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,000
That your dad?

358
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,878
Did he remember
the red sauce?

359
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,120
Oh, shoot.
I can go back.

360
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,270
No. It's okay.

361
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,113
I think we got some left
from last time.

362
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,680
Go get changed up,
you, and let's eat.

363
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
I'm starving.
Yeah.

364
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,039
Just put 'em on the table.
Okay.

365
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,110
Thanks, Greta.

366
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,150
Okay.

367
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,639
Dad wants to know
about the game Sunday.

368
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,120
Watch at his place or...

369
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,999
I thought we
could watch it here.
I could make that pasta thing.

370
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,196
Um.

371
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,760
The one with the peas?

372
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,557
Capers.
You liked it last time.

373
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,758
Oh, don't forget we got that
thing at Ida's on Saturday...
The anniversary.

374
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,312
No. I remember.
It was a week
before I met you.

375
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,914
Anniversary of what?

376
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,159
It's just your...

377
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,110
Molly had a friend of hers
that got killed last year.

378
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,159
So we'll go over there
and pay our respects.

379
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,039
It was...
Vern, right?

380
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,717
Yeah.
He was the Chief before Bill.
Hired me.

381
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,598
Ida, the lady with the baby...
Yeah?

382
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,637
Is his wife.

383
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,191
Which, speaking of,
she asked if we
could bring drinks.

384
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,318
Yeah, I still got some
of that Halloween beer
I made.

385
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,116
I seem to remember
you spitting
that on the floor.

386
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,114
Yeah, I'll go
to the store.
Mmm-hmm.

387
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,793
You okay?
Oh, sure.

388
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,520
Just hard to sit that long.
Legs go to sleep.

389
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,670
<i>FBI.</i>

390
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,955
Hi.

391
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,997
Deputy Solverson again,
Bemidji police.

392
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,753
<i>Yes?</i>

393
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,559
I called a couple times
now about

394
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,233
the Fargo
Syndicate massacre

395
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,636
how I might know
the fella responsible

396
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,518
meaning he's
a suspect in a case.

397
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,239
<i>Yeah, I see your
name on the computer.</i>

398
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
<i>Looks like those
suspicions were
investigated and dismissed.</i>

399
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,840
Yeah. They sent
a fella down, but I'm not
sure he really...

400
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,639
<i>Do you have any
new information?</i>

401
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,315
No. No, I just...

402
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,871
A lot of people are dead.
So...

403
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,873
<i>I'll put a note
on the file that
you called.</i>

404
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,030
Okay, but...

405
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,236
<i>I wouldn't expect
a call back though.</i>

406
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,030
<i>We're pretty busy these days,
with the Patriot Act and all.</i>

407
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,120
File room.

408
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,758
A room with files.

409
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
Say you took
one of 'em out.

410
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,510
Took it where?

411
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,636
Doesn't matter.

412
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,473
Say you took one
of the files out...

413
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,989
Is it still the file room?

414
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,354
Pizza today, right?

415
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,994
In the cafeteria.
Or is it meatloaf?

416
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,992
No, I'm saying that
you and I both agree

417
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,914
that the file room
minus one file

418
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,758
is still the file room.

419
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,430
Now, say you took
another one out.
And then another.

420
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,195
If the file
room minus one file
is still the file room,

421
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,715
and you keep
subtracting one
at a time,

422
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,269
you could end up
with zero files.

423
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,829
I'm saying, logically
or even negative files.

424
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,872
And it would still be the...
How do you have
negative files?

425
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,680
No. I'm just...
Logically, I'm saying.

426
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,359
Except no one's taking files.
They just bring more.

427
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,033
What about a cemetery,
I mean,

428
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,874
remove one body
from a cemetery,
it's still a cemetery.

429
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,440
But a cemetery
with no bodies,

430
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,630
what's that?

431
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,915
Condos.

432
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,471
Okay, and this is...
Well, these
are my officers, so...

433
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,230
Where is everybody?

434
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,437
Coffee run.
Who's this then?

435
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,079
This is Tahir. He's...

436
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,514
Hey.

437
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,159
Hello, I am Tahir.

438
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,920
I'm Molly,
Deputy Solverson.

439
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,754
Yeah. So remember I told you
me and Sally were
taking in a foster?

440
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,513
Yeah, from Africa.

441
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,274
Yeah, except...
I am from Sudan.

442
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,680
You know Lost Boy?

443
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,194
I sure do.

444
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,115
Welcome to America.
I thought there
was a problem though.

445
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,112
Oh, I'll say!
The kid disappeared.

446
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,120
Disappeared how?

447
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,795
Oh, tell her the story.
Oh. Ha.

448
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,437
This is the craziest thing.
All right?
Go on. You tell her.

449
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,672
In my village,
I tend goats.
You know goats?

450
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,796
Uh-huh.

451
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,112
One day,
men came
and kill everyone.

452
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,034
Mothers, fathers,
brothers, sisters.

453
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,719
Geez.

454
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,553
I alone am free.

455
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,390
Three days I walk,
then I meet nice people...

456
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,710
Americans.

457
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,519
These nice people put me
airplane to America.

458
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,309
Land of free.

459
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,994
Home of brave.

460
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,230
Yeah, to us.

461
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,398
He's coming
to live with us.
Go on.

462
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,070
At the airport,
man says,
"Take bag?"

463
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,229
He says, "Get in the car,"
but he doesn't come back.

464
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,880
Guy stole his bag.
Can you believe it?
A refugee.

465
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,071
One day and one night,
I wait at the airport,

466
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,760
but this man,
he does not come back.

467
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,236
I had no money
and no paper.

468
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,911
Nice woman says,
"Tell policeman,"

469
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,274
but I am afraid.
I told her I have
a family waiting...

470
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,592
Nice family...
American family.

471
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,599
But the name is in
the bag and the number.

472
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,953
Nice woman give me coat
and money to take the bus.

473
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,355
So not all bad.

474
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,273
I take the bus
to the city.

475
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,274
But I am very hungry,
four days I no eat.

476
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,434
Then I see a store.

477
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,795
You know...

478
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,359
"July in January"?

479
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,669
Phoenix Farms.

480
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,797
Yes, Phoenix Farms.

481
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,872
Should I tell her this?

482
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,715
So... He shoplifts...

483
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,950
Takes some food.

484
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,156
In fact he does
it every day for,
how long?

485
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,476
Three months.
Three months.

486
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,313
Meanwhile, we're frantic.

487
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,638
You remember?
All those phone calls?
Me raising my voice?

488
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,798
"How could you lose a kid
from Africa in
freaking Minnesota?"

489
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,997
Every day I steal food,
but... I am ashamed.

490
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,831
I don't want to steal.

491
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,317
I want to work,
but what work can I do?

492
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,636
Then a week ago,
Sally and I are

493
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,996
heading into
the city to the ballet.

494
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,759
You went to the ballet?

495
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,153
Sally likes the ballet,
yeah, so...
Go ahead, finish.

496
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,917
I am looking around the store.
Skittles and
peanut butter cups.

497
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,950
Then this man grabs me,
I think I am arrested.

498
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,920
It's me,
is the point
of the story.

499
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,679
All those weeks
looking for the kid...

500
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,952
Writing letters,
making phone calls.
We even put up flyers.

501
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,192
And then,
I stop by a supermarket
in a city I don't live,

502
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,791
all so Sally can have
Chex Mix at the ballet,
and there's the kid.

503
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,360
What are the odds?

504
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,636
I can't even imagine.

505
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,870
I am so worried...

506
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,390
And thinking I am arrested,

507
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,997
but Mr. Bill
is hugging me
and crying.

508
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,031
Well, you know...

509
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,158
And look where I am at.
Who I'm with.
My... American family.

510
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,711
Sally says it's a miracle.
I don't know. It might be.

511
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,759
But don't
question the universe,
that's my motto.

512
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,877
Sometimes
things just work out.

513
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,591
Yeah,
I like to think
that's true.

514
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,476
We found ya, buddy.
We found ya.

515
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,991
<i>- It causes you
to have hallucinations.
- What?</i>

516
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,753
<i>I'll be glad to
explain it to you.</i>

517
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,950
<i>It's a sort of a nightmare</i>

518
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,914
<i>where your
dreams go pell-mell,
helter-skelter and amok.</i>

519
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,110
<i>Oh, shut up!</i>

520
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,312
<i>Pell-mell!</i>

521
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,875
<i>Hello. Inspector Clancy
speaking. What?</i>

522
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,474
You need something?

523
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,672
No, I'm good.
Go back to sleep.

524
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,912
<i>Stand back, everybody.
I've got you covered,
stand back.</i>

525
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,995
<i>What's the meaning of this?
Police parading
all over the hotel.</i>

526
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,873
<i>Who sent for you?
Why are you here?</i>

527
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,519
<i>This is Mr. William's suite.</i>

528
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,080
<i>Mr. Williams
has been murdered.</i>

529
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,280
<i>Quiet, everybody.
You'll be quiet.</i>

530
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,436
<i>And that goes for all of you.</i>

531
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,877
<i>Yeah, the chief
is right. Noise, bed-ly-ham,
who can think?</i>

532
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,429
<i>Well, you can't. So shut up.
Where's the body?</i>

533
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,636
<i>In there.</i>

534
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,631
<i>Now what did
you do that for?</i>

535
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,479
<i>Isn't a girl
supposed to scream</i>

536
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,313
<i>when she knows she's
gonna see a dead body?</i>

537
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,352
<i>Quiet. Now come on
in here, all of you.</i>

538
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,155
We're doing good.

539
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,549
I'm up.

540
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,156
Sorry.

541
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,955
I was just saying
we're doing good.

542
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,830
Mmm-hmm.

543
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,957
We got everything we need.

544
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,836
Mmm-hmm.

545
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,320
Well, I'm going
to sleep.

546
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,830
Yeah, me, too.

547
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,273
<i>Oh, it's Jeff,
the night porter.</i>

548
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,353
<i>I left him here
to watch the body.</i>

549
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,880
<i>What happened?</i>

550
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,315
<i>What happened?</i>

551
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,717
<i>I was standing around,
scared stiff,</i>

552
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,792
<i>and all of a sudden,
the lights went out.</i>

553
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,314
<i>Then something
hit me on the head,</i>

554
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,800
<i>and then the lights
went out again.</i>

555
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,952
<i>That's all I know
and that's all I'm gonna wait
around to find out.</i>

556
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,719
<i>Stun Meadows,
everybody! Give it up.</i>

557
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,276
<i>How does he do it?</i>

558
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,079
<i>Check your wallets,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

559
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,720
<i>Make sure he didn't
make those vanish, too.</i>

560
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,078
<i>It's been a big
year for insurance...</i>

561
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,274
<i>A banner year.
Reserve trends are up.</i>

562
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,430
<i>And...</i>

563
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,353
<i>Loss ratios are down
a whopping 17%.</i>

564
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,915
<i>Those are just numbers.</i>

565
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,233
<i>We all know that behind
every insurance policy...</i>

566
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,677
<i>And the reinsurance policy
covering that policy,</i>

567
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,878
<i>there's a salesman.</i>

568
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,955
<i>A man or woman knocking
on doors, making calls,</i>

569
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,354
<i>matching people and businesses
with the right
plan for their needs.</i>

570
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,152
<i>And so without further delay,
I give you...</i>

571
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,315
<i>Insurance Salesman
of the Year 2007...
Lester Nygaard!</i>

572
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,674
Thank you.

573
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,672
Thank you so much.

574
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,035
<i>Thank you so much. That...</i>

575
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,794
<i>Oh, geez,
that's a real honor.</i>

576
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,870
<i>Um...</i>

577
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,830
<i>Now...</i>

578
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,758
<i>I knew I should
have memorized this.</i>

579
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,400
<i>It suddenly doesn't look...</i>

580
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,717
<i>Speak from the heart.
Speak from the heart. Okay.</i>

581
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,834
<i>Those of you that know me,</i>

582
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,118
<i>know it's been a tough year
for me personally.</i>

583
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,635
<i>And that I wouldn't
have gotten through it</i>

584
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,953
<i>without the love and support
of my beautiful wife, Linda.</i>

585
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,032
<i>Let's give her a hand.</i>

586
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,190
<i>I love you.</i>

587
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,796
<i>You can go through
your whole life...</i>

588
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,236
<i>Without a care.</i>

589
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,718
<i>And one day,
it all changes.</i>

590
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,635
<i>People die.
They lose their homes.</i>

591
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,920
<i>They go to prison.</i>

592
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,239
<i>It's calamity.
I know it,
'cause I lived it.</i>

593
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,115
<i>And if this year has
taught me anything...</i>

594
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,998
<i>Believe me,
I've seen it all.</i>

595
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,431
<i>It's that
the worst does happen...</i>

596
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,999
<i>And you need to be insured.
Thank you so much.
It's a great honor.</i>

597
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,873
So proud of ya, Lester.

598
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,156
Aw, thanks, hon.

599
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,913
You tired?

600
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,194
Oh, aren't you?

601
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,073
Well...

602
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,790
Um...

603
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,396
No. Actually,
I'm feeling
pretty keyed up.

604
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,917
I might grab
a nightcap at the bar.

605
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,593
You want me to go...
No, no, no.

606
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,837
You go up to bed.
I'll be up shortly.

607
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,832
Just... It's my night.

608
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,837
I'm sorry,
I'm such a downer.

609
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,240
You're a sunny day.

610
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,199
Go on.
I'll be up presently.

611
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,639
Hi.
Hey. Big night, huh?

612
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,632
Salesman of the Year.
Oh.

613
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,558
Drugs?

614
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,200
Insurance.
Ah.

615
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,033
They really give an award
to the guy who
sells the most drugs?

616
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,077
Pharmaceuticals.
That makes more sense.

617
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,800
So what are you drinking?

618
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,271
Something dangerous.
Let's have a look.

619
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,960
Ah, oh, a blood and sand,
what's that?

620
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,679
Scotch and blood orange.

621
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,830
That's the one.

622
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,036
All right.

623
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,558
And then I sit down
and every... Oh, Miss?

624
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,873
Can we have some more
sparkling water? Thanks.

625
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,119
Anyways... So, I say,

626
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,438
"Hi, I'm Dr. Michaelson.
Nice to meet you
and everything."

627
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,836
And I get ready to
give him the novocaine shot...

628
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,479
Stick it in my own finger.

629
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,877
And it hurt,
but I don't wanna
look stupid, so I...
