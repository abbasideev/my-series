1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,674
<i>Precedently on</i> Fargo...

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,356
Lester,
is this what you want?

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,670
Yes.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,159
See you later, Lester.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,799
Okay. Get dressed.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,599
Lester, are you okay?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,476
Oh!

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,517
Vegas PD is gonna
send over some pictures

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,478
from the hotel
security camera.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,631
So don't leave town
for a while.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,234
I may have some
more questions.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,470
Ready to go?

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,994
What? I thought
we weren't gonna go.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,434
Acapulco, here we come.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,273
Do you think
you could run in?

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,396
The passports
are in the safe.

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,914
There's some cash
in there too.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,593
It's cold out there.

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,316
You're sweet.

20
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,153
Is this what you want?

21
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,915
Anywhere you like.

22
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,679
Thanks.

23
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,160
Just you?
Uh, no.

24
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,074
There's, uh...
It'll be two of us.

25
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,671
Linda's just...
Grabbing something
over by the shop.

26
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,117
She dropped me off, said,
"Order the grilled cheese."

27
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,556
So I guess
two of those.

28
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,790
And to drink?

29
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,270
A beer'd change things
for the better.

30
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,837
Yeah, family place,
I'm afraid.

31
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,311
Oh, okay...
Two ginger ales then.

32
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,995
And I'll...
I'm gonna
use the bathroom.

33
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
Free with the meal.
Right.

34
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,393
That's the...
Hey, how you doing?

35
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,630
Oh, hi.

36
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,710
How are you?

37
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,550
Boy,
he sure looks different.

38
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,710
Yeah.

39
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,393
He's a successful guy.

40
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,720
Good for him.

41
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,150
<i>Bemidji Police.</i>

42
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,195
Yeah, I... I'd like
to report shots fired.

43
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,757
<i>Sir, this is a non-emergency number.
You should've dialed 911.</i>

44
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,797
Over on Elk and Third.

45
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,037
Gunshots. Real loud.
<i>Oh.</i>

46
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,278
Like about...
10 seconds ago.

47
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,750
Sounded like they'd come
from inside one of the shops.

48
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,274
<i>Okay. Sir?</i>

49
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,915
Grilled cheese
coming right up.

50
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,118
That's great, thanks.
Linda's just...

51
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,476
She dropped me off,
grabbed something
over at the shop.

52
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,239
Said she had to
pick something up.

53
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,431
Yeah, you said that.

54
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,398
Want me to keep hers warm
till she gets here?

55
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,790
Oh, yeah.
That's... Although...

56
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,752
Like I said,
she should be
any second now.

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,311
You know... There was
a fella in here earlier,
asking about you.

58
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,556
About me?

59
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,030
Yeah, uh...
Silver-hair,
little goatee.

60
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,470
Said he went
by your old house,
but you moved.

61
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,950
Yeah,
we got the
house up on...

62
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,554
What did he...
What did you tell him?

63
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,831
Said if he wanted
to leave a number,
I'd give it to you.

64
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,034
He couldn't see
his way clear to it,
so we left it at that.

65
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,111
Can't say I much
liked his demeanor.

66
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,556
Well...
Sorry for the bother.

67
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,710
No bother.

68
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,033
Thought you ought to know.

69
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,159
<i>We're going
to Acapulco.</i>

70
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,550
Oh, my God.

71
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
Nothing good's
gonna come outta that.

72
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,714
Right.

73
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,274
<i>I don't.
You want a million
dollars in your case.</i>

74
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,392
<i>I want a million.
It's all right.
Four more cases.</i>

75
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,472
<i>- Three.
- Three.</i>

76
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,392
Take the money, right?

77
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,795
Forget that.
I say go for it.

78
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,155
I'll get it.
I got it.

79
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,240
Solverson.

80
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,550
Wait. What?

81
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,759
The other one now?

82
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,840
Jeez.

83
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,956
Where's Lester?

84
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,917
Okay, put out an APB.
I'm getting my coat.

85
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,910
What's that now?

86
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,032
Someone killed
the second
Mrs. Nygaard.

87
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,237
Hey, you didn't
have to come.

88
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,913
Now we both know
that's not true.

89
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,794
Okay.

90
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,510
Poor thing.

91
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,911
A head shot, I think.
I didn't look too close.

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,320
Yeah.

93
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,440
She's wearing his coat.

94
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,636
Meaning?

95
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,552
Meaning maybe it's not
Linda who's supposed
to be lying here.

96
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,233
Let me through!

97
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,879
Oh, Lester.
Mr. Nygaard.

98
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,990
Oh, jeez!

99
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,077
Yeah, go over here.
Yeah, let's get him
to sit down.

100
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,311
Oh! Jeez! What?
Come on.

101
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,359
That's right. Sit down.
Okay.

102
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,834
Sit down.
Here we go. Sit.

103
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,600
This is not happening.
This is not possible.

104
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,878
Mr. Nygaard,
I have to ask you
where you're coming from.

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,320
I just...

106
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,676
I was over waiting
at the restaurant,
drinking ginger ale.

107
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,474
Your dad was keeping
her grilled cheese warm,

108
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,438
and I'm just waiting there.
I can't understand.

109
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,751
She said she had to
pick some papers up.

110
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,357
This is... Not possible.
This is impossible.

111
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,199
Lester,
is there any way that...

112
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,995
Do you think
that this is connected
to Las Vegas?

113
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,834
The murders
we talked
about earlier?

114
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,151
What are you saying?

115
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,709
A repercussion
for what you saw,
maybe?

116
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,790
Uh...

117
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,669
She's wearing
your coat, the wife.
Molly saw that, so...

118
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,400
What do you mean
she's wearing my coat?
What does that mean?

119
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,590
Well, she...

120
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,717
Her coat got a rip.
So I...

121
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,037
Oh, wait.
Uh, you think...

122
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,193
You're say...

123
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,314
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

124
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,312
No, Lester.
If you throw up,
then I'm gonna.

125
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,629
We gotta
get him outta here.

126
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,554
Okay, Mr. Nygaard,
we're gonna take you
down to the station now.

127
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,751
Yeah.
Ask you a lot of questions...

128
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,150
Timeline, et cetera. Okay?

129
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,913
Yeah,
whatever you
think is best.

130
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,070
Thank you.

131
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,397
Uh, wait, do you...

132
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,752
Do you think...
Can I just...
Say goodbye?

133
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,754
Well, this is
an active crime scene.
So...

134
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,830
Of course you can,
Lester.

135
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,912
You go ahead.
And take your time.

136
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,910
Mr. Nygaard.

137
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,039
Can't have you
touching the body, sir.

138
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,956
I know...

139
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,318
Of course not.
I'm sorry.
I'm just so...

140
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,713
I understand.
Come on.
Come away now.

141
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,712
Okay?
Yeah.

142
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,474
That's right.
Okay. Yeah.

143
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,430
Okay.

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,515
<i>6-12 to base.
Chief says send the bus.</i>

145
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,672
<i>Roger that, 6-12.
I'll let them know.</i>

146
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,356
<i>Base to Emergency One.
Chief says send
the bus to 1381 Elk.</i>

147
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,231
<i>6-13 to base. I'm inbound
with the husband.</i>

148
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,113
<i>We'll need Interview One.</i>

149
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,517
<i>Roger that, 6-13.</i>

150
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,639
<i>6-13 to base.</i>

151
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,279
<i>Yeah, go ahead, Molly.</i>

152
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,829
<i>Also, someone should
wake those FBI boys.</i>

153
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,834
<i>They're over at Leroy's.
Tell 'em we got developments.</i>

154
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,718
<i>They should meet me
at the station.</i>

155
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,874
<i>Roger that, 6-13.
We'll scoop 'em up.</i>

156
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,195
We're awake, right?

157
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,316
Who?

158
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,436
Us.

159
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,151
You're asking
if we're awake.
Me and you?

160
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,720
Yeah, I was just...

161
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
You know,
sometimes you're in
the middle of a dream...

162
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,751
Do you say everything
that comes to your head?

163
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,956
I got him in Interview One.
Also, they just
called from the scene.

164
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,231
Looks like the wife
had plane tickets
in her pocket.

165
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,277
Mexico.
Uh-oh.

166
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,680
This could be a dream.

167
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,318
What's he saying?

168
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,717
Coroner's saying
a single shot
from close up.

169
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,431
Said they found
feathers in her...
Head from her hood.

170
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,000
They were stuck in...

171
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,600
So... Execution style.

172
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,920
I should have said
something earlier.

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,957
You heard what happened?
More than heard.

174
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,520
Saw the prowlers scream by.

175
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,677
Lester was sitting
not 10 feet away,
eating a grilled cheese.

176
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,952
Any chance you can put an
exact time on his arrival?

177
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,713
Not down to
the minute, but...

178
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,553
That's not why I'm...

179
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,115
You remember you came by
with those FBI fellas earlier?

180
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,594
And I was looking
out the glass?

181
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,791
With a peculiar
look on your face?
Yeah.

182
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,590
Well, there was a fella in
just before you got there...

183
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,399
And he was
asking about Lester.

184
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,476
What?

185
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
Yeah,
I'm a fool for not saying...

186
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,034
He was maybe mid-50s...
Upscale looking.

187
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,555
Silver-hair,
brushed back...
With a goatee.

188
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,915
Drove a red BMW.

189
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,195
This fella?

190
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,673
Not unless he changed
his whole...

191
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,036
Although, maybe...

192
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,436
Drove a red BMW,
you said?

193
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,556
Yeah.

194
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,911
Molly? Uh, we're going in.

195
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,034
Dad, I gotta go.

196
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,037
Well, there's two ways
of looking at it.

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,354
The first is you gotta.

198
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,354
The second is you don't.

199
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,680
Will you...
Call home for me?

200
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,034
Let Gus know that...

201
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,591
Tell him it's gonna
be all night.

202
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,557
Oh, screw that.
I'm getting my gun,
is what I'm doing.

203
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,190
Go sit on the front porch...
Make sure
my granddaughter's safe.

204
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,549
You're a good man.

205
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,269
Lester,
is this what you want?

206
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,350
<i>Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!</i>

207
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,875
Is she... Bill...

208
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,519
Tell me she's not
still lying there

209
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,478
and everyone's just
stepping over her.

210
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,270
Mr. Nygaard,
these fellas
are from the FBI.

211
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,511
The... The what?
Is this...

212
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,598
Come on, I told you.
I didn't see nothing.

213
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,797
All I did was
get on an elevator.

214
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,473
We're not here
about Las Vegas, sir.

215
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,960
Well, we are
and we aren't.

216
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,077
Um, okay.

217
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,634
We're here...

218
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,550
About him.

219
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,236
Based on
the hustle of the deputy,
we have a name for him.

220
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,800
Lorne Malvo.

221
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,000
Uh, Bill?

222
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,319
Answer the question.

223
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,593
Um, yeah,
I'm now asking for a lawyer.
This is for the record.

224
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,153
He's changed his look,
hasn't he?

225
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,993
I'm done answering your...

226
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,117
You've obviously...

227
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,436
Made up your mind
that I'm some kind of...

228
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,193
And I'm... I'm not...

229
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,511
My wife is dead!

230
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,511
And... There are
arrangements to see to.

231
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,196
So...
You can either lock me up
or let me go.

232
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,510
He's not gonna stop.

233
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,034
You know that, right?

234
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,194
A man like that...

235
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,392
May be not even a man.

236
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,070
Hey there.

237
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,919
What's going on?

238
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,878
What do you mean?

239
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,155
I mean, it's...

240
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,072
7:00 in the morning
and you're sitting

241
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,913
on my front porch
with a shotgun.

242
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,310
There is some consensus
this Malvo fella may be back.

243
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,270
Where's Molly?

244
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,511
Left her at the precinct
last night.

245
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,593
Had Lester Nygaard
in custody...
About to talk to him.

246
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,319
I'm going after her.
Keep an eye on Greta.

247
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,640
Believe me,
I mean to.

248
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,193
Okay,
so the plan is,
we fan out.

249
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,636
Prowlers on
all the main roads
looking for Malvo.

250
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,039
Encircle the town,
in other words.
Uh, there's... Yeah?

251
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,112
Well, there are
three main roads.

252
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,591
So actually...
More of a triangle.

253
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,670
Hmm.

254
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,077
There's photos
of the suspect
in your packets.

255
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,799
We hear he might have
changed his look though.

256
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,715
So silver hair now,
brushed back,
possibly a goatee.

257
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,872
Uh, drives a red BMW,
possibly stolen.

258
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,155
The FBI is sending a team.

259
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,993
And in the meantime,
the two original agents

260
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,151
are staking
out Lester's house.

261
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,833
Molly, Gus on one.

262
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,397
Yeah,
I'll be out there with you
coordinating maneuvers. So...

263
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,392
Pass those
out for me?
Thanks.

264
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,518
Yeah, hon.
<i>Hey, I've been calling.</i>

265
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,871
<i>Yeah, I know, sorry.
It's been...</i>

266
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,957
Is it true?
Is he back?

267
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,795
Yeah, I just finished
briefing the guys. So...

268
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,997
We tried to crack Lester,
but he wouldn't flinch.

269
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,037
So the plan is,
now we're gonna
use him as bait...

270
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,196
<i>Molly.</i>

271
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,072
Yeah, so things are
real busy here, hon.

272
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,435
<i>Look, hon.</i>

273
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,400
Don't, okay?
I gotta ask you not to...

274
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,797
<i>Don't go out there.
You personally,
don't go looking for...</i>

275
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,394
It's my job.

276
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,116
Yeah, I know.
And you're amazing
and the best.

277
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,876
And I have no doubt
that if you wanted,
you could handcuff Al Capone.

278
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,239
<i>But some days, sometimes,
you get forces
you can't control.</i>

279
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,953
<i>Bad luck, you know?</i>

280
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,235
Bad luck.

281
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,192
<i>Yeah, and this is all...</i>

282
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,240
If it really is him,
Malvo, I just...

283
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,431
With everything
we've been working for,
you know...

284
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,239
<i>Our family and...</i>
Gus.

285
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,990
<i>And I know
it's not fair.
It's not.</i>

286
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,117
<i>It's your job,
and I'm just a mailman.</i>

287
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,193
<i>But you've
got a precinct
full of cops.</i>

288
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,312
And the FBI is there.
So I just...

289
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,870
Bottom line,
I can't make her go
to another funeral, you know?

290
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,879
Yeah.

291
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,550
Okay, don't worry.
I'll just...

292
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,958
Yeah, I'll run things
from here.

293
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>Okay. Good... Good.</i>

294
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,872
<i>I'm in the car.
I'm coming over.</i>

295
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,792
No, don't.
That's not...

296
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,111
No, just go home.
Be with our girl.

297
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,116
Hey, is my dad there?

298
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,438
Yeah, yeah...
On the porch
with a shotgun.

299
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,550
Gotta love a man
who keeps his word, right?

300
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,630
<i>So you promise?</i>

301
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,275
Yeah, I won't
leave the building

302
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,317
until they call
and tell me he's surrounded.

303
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,037
No... Until he's dead.

304
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,839
<i>I'll call you in
a little bit, okay?</i>

305
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,072
So it's decided.
FBI fellas are
gonna call for backup.

306
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,913
We're gonna take Lester home,
sit on the house,

307
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,037
see if we can't draw
this Malvo fella out.

308
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,194
You okay, Chief?

309
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,200
Hanging it up after this.

310
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,716
What's that?

311
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,273
I quit...
Is what I'm saying.

312
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,511
Don't got
the stomach for it.

313
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,590
Not like some.

314
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,471
Wearing the badge,
seeing the lengths
people are capable of.

315
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,914
The inhumanity.

316
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,352
Whatever happened to...
Saying good morning
to your neighbors?

317
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,674
And shoveling
their walk and bringing
in each other's toters?

318
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,912
Well... Still goes on.

319
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,198
Yeah, but...
Not the same.

320
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,872
I used to have
positive opinions

321
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,395
about the world,
you know, about people.

322
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,791
Used to think the best.

323
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,998
Now I'm...
Looking over
my shoulder.

324
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,039
"An unquiet mind."
That's what
the wife calls it.

325
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,749
The job has got me
staring into the fireplace...
Drinking.

326
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,755
I never wanted
to be the type to think

327
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,277
big thoughts about
the nature of things and...

328
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,234
All I ever wanted was...
A stack of pancakes
and a V-8.

329
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,559
So I'm recommending
that you take over as Chief.

330
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,232
I...
I appreciate that, but I...
No, no.

331
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,873
You're the real deal.

332
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,270
You got the instincts
and the disposition.

333
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,631
I didn't see it before,
but now...

334
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,399
And Vern saw it.
I know that.

335
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,200
So I'm hoping that
after you have the baby,

336
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,796
you'll come back here and...
Take things over.

337
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,640
Well, I...
I will think about that.
I will.

338
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,753
I gotta talk to Gus, so...

339
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,436
So, uh... You're okay
with the plan then?

340
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,716
Call in the cavalry
and set a trap.

341
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,758
Yeah...
We're a small-time force.

342
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,595
We're not equipped for,
you know... Urban warfare.

343
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,320
Most of these guys
can't shoot
a can off a fence.

344
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,790
Okay.

345
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,554
Chin up, Chief.

346
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,512
Police?
<i>Uh, yes,</i>

347
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,115
this is FBI main.
I'm looking for my agents.

348
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,236
<i>Yeah...</i>

349
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,512
They're with a suspect.
I could interrupt.

350
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,080
You want Pepper or Budge?

351
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,240
Uh, negatory.
Don't interrupt.

352
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,353
Just tell them to call home
when they're done.

353
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,074
<i>FBI?</i>

354
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,270
Operations.

355
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,635
<i>Passcode?</i>

356
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,234
Uh, six-one-alpha-theta-nine.

357
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,396
<i>Transferring.</i>

358
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,554
<i>Operations.</i>

359
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,439
Uh, yes,
this is Agent Budge.

360
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,394
We've hit a dead end out here.
So we're gonna
be heading back.

361
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,596
<i>Say again?</i>

362
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,080
Dead end, heading back.

363
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,637
<i>Hold on.
Didn't you just call
looking for backup?</i>

364
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,155
Yeah, my partner,
he kind of jumped
the gun on that one.

365
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,232
But looks like
local PD has it
under control.

366
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,834
So we're gonna
just pack and blow.

367
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,276
<i>Whatever.
Get your shit straight.</i>

368
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,153
<i>Cancelling backup.</i>

369
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,432
Help you, sir?

370
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,160
I hope so.
I got my eye on this one.

371
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,272
Oh, she's a beaut,
that's for sure.

372
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,831
V-8 engine...
Only 22,000 miles on her.

373
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,320
I like it 'cause
it looks like
an undercover vehicle.

374
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,671
Like an FBI car.

375
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,956
Well, sir,
I guess she does.

376
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,435
Never thought about it.

377
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,996
Even got the long
antenna on the back.

378
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,473
Mind if we take
a test drive?

379
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,957
Well... Well,
we're not officially
open yet.

380
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,474
But I don't see why not.
Hold on, I'll grab the keys.

381
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,678
Shotgun.

382
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,754
Okay... So we're
letting you go.

383
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,990
About time.

384
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,038
Yeah, and so the FBI fellas,
they're gonna drive you home.

385
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,592
Not necessary.
I can call a cab.

386
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,309
Yeah.
Well, like I said,
we're letting you go,

387
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,359
but at the same time
a wanted fugitive has
been spotted in town.

388
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,353
And we think he's got
intentions towards you.
So...

389
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,000
The ride home's
not really optional.

390
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,720
Well, they're not
coming in the house.

391
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,599
Sure. Okay.
We can play it that way.

392
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,791
But they're still
gonna stick around
for a while,

393
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,190
keep an eye on things.

394
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,480
You know...
I'm not sure

395
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,917
what it is that
you've had against me
since day one, but, um...

396
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,037
I am not the person
you think I am, this...
This kind of monster.

397
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,677
There was a fellow once...
Running for a train.

398
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,116
And he's carrying
a pair of gloves,
this man.

399
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,120
He drops a glove
on the platform...
But he doesn't notice.

400
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,993
And then later on...
Uh, inside the train,
he's sitting by the window,

401
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,552
and he realizes
that he's just got
this one glove left.

402
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,077
But the train's
already started pulling
out of the station, right?

403
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,590
So what does he do?

404
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,074
He opens the window...

405
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,710
And he drops
the other glove
onto the platform.

406
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,272
That way...
Whoever finds
the first glove...

407
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,720
Can just have the pair.

408
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,636
So... What are you
telling me?

409
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,840
Goodbye, Mr. Nygaard.

410
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,594
Goodbye, Deputy.

411
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,680
I didn't do this,
you know...

412
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,159
Any of it.

413
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,230
That deputy... Boy...
She's got a thing for me.

414
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,352
So, Lester,
say you had a boat.
No.

415
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,630
Say you've got a boat

416
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,350
and you've got a fox,
a rabbit and a cabbage.

417
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,957
Now, you can only
row one of them across
the river at a time.

418
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,394
Now, you could
take the cabbage,

419
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,790
but then the fox
would eat the rabbit.

420
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,918
Or you can take the fox,
but the rabbit
would eat the cabbage.

421
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,759
What are you asking?
Same thing on the other side.

422
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,917
You could leave
the rabbit there alone,

423
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,869
but... What happens when
you bring the fox over

424
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,394
and go back
for the cabbage?

425
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,556
Forget it.

426
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,754
My partner doesn't know
what he's talking about.

427
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,116
I already told you,
just eat all three of them.

428
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,596
Can I only
row them across
in one direction?

429
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,910
No, no. Either way.

430
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,518
Well then...
You row
the rabbit across,

431
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,196
and the fox won't
eat the cabbage.

432
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,514
Then you go
back for the fox...
And when you drop him off,

433
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,240
you put
the rabbit back in the boat
and go get the cabbage.

434
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,916
Only this time,
you leave the rabbit behind

435
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,999
and then you row
the cabbage back across.

436
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,635
Again, the fox will
not eat the cabbage

437
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,953
and then you...
Go back for the rabbit.

438
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,956
That's it.

439
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,560
See? That wasn't so hard.

440
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,353
We feel we need
to say again

441
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,033
that your life
may be in danger.

442
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,799
Like a lot of danger.

443
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,352
So we're gonna sit
right here for a bit.
Keep an eye on things.

444
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,472
Free country, isn't it?

445
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,109
Thanks.
Yeah.

446
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,312
You were police once...
Molly says.

447
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,390
State cop...

448
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,920
18 years.

449
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,592
Took a bullet in the hip
on a traffic stop...

450
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,674
Retired full pension.

451
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,118
You ever do this before...
Stand guard?

452
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,079
One other time...
Winter of 1979...

453
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,715
Minus 4 degrees.

454
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,597
Sat on a dark porch
from dusk till dawn.

455
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,000
Your stepmom was
inside sleeping...

456
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,270
Four years old.

457
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,113
Who did you
think was coming?

458
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,679
Wasn't a question of "who,"
more like "what."

459
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,990
Did it come?

460
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,237
Not that night...
But soon after.

461
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,637
What are you
planning to do
with that?

462
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,957
If he comes...
I'll put his eye out.

463
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,157
You can finish him off.

464
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,319
That's my girl.

465
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,513
<i>Yeah, so car 18,
checking in...
Over on Bear Patch.</i>

466
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,960
<i>Pretty quiet, huh?</i>

467
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,358
Okay, 18, keep
your eyes peeled.
Over.

468
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,237
Hey, car 6,
anything?

469
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,239
<i>Hey, this is car 6
out on 71.</i>

470
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,232
<i>I had a pickup
with an unsecured load.</i>

471
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,078
<i>All quiet otherwise.</i>

472
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,234
Yeah, roger that, 6.

473
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,240
Keep me posted, okay?

474
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,190
I'm gonna run
over to Lester's.

475
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,158
Uh, but give a shout
when the other FBI rolls up.

476
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,515
You think it's safe?

477
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,236
For me, I'm saying...

478
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,115
Here...
With that fella out there.

479
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,550
I mean,
everyone else is gone.

480
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,673
Yeah, maybe lock the door.

481
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,591
You still think
this is a dream?

482
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,598
What?
This.

483
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,513
Today?
No.

484
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,717
What if my whole
life has been a dream?

485
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,119
Yeah, but whose
dream is it?

486
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,590
Heads up.

487
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,076
What do you think?

488
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,429
Could be our backup.

489
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,312
FBI, step out of the car!

490
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,073
Out of the car! Now!

491
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,714
Let me see your hands!

492
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,480
His hands are taped.

493
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,510
I'm sorry.

494
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,556
This is a dream.

495
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,990
Ah!

496
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,230
Please...

497
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,914
I got a little girl.

498
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,430
Gosh.

499
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,274
What?

500
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,918
Police?
Yeah, I need
the police please.

501
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,479
Yes, it's an emergency.

502
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,318
This is Lester Nygaard,
you gotta...

503
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,591
I think the...

504
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,637
You need to send somebody.

505
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,470
I need help now.
I need you to come.

506
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,115
Please!

507
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,680
My...
Lester Nygaard.

508
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,672
Please...
Just hurry up!

509
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,637
I'm upstairs in the bathroom.
There's no lock on the door.

510
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,191
Oh, God!
You've gotta hurry.

511
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,679
Ow! Ow!

512
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,550
Oh, shit!

513
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,036
God damn it.

514
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,840
I figured it out.

515
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,033
Good for you.

516
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,278
Your riddle...
Shades of green...
I figured it out.

517
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,030
And?

518
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,230
Open it.

519
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,236
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

520
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,516
<i>Yeah, it's... It's...
It's me. It's Lester.</i>

521
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,113
<i>Uh, she's...
My wife...
My wife, she's...</i>

522
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,919
<i>Oh, hell!</i>

523
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,400
<i>Look, I think I...</i>

524
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,791
<i>She's in
the basement dead and...</i>

525
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,480
<i>Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

526
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,471
<i>Lester,
have you been
a bad boy?</i>

527
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,871
<i>Uh! Jeez.</i>

528
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,754
<i>Yeah, I took
the hammer and...</i>

529
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:22,198
<i>Look, can you come over?
I'm on Willow Creek Drive,
number 613.</i>

530
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,759
<i>Sure, Lester.
I'll be right there.</i>

531
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,753
I think that's him.

532
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,759
Oh, no.

533
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,229
Get after him!
Come on!

534
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,680
Stop! It's not safe!

535
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,392
Hey, come back!
It's too dangerous!

536
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,110
Stop!

537
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,110
Solverson.

538
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,310
Are you sure?

539
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,995
Okay, well...
Let me know what
the divers turn up.

540
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,312
Take the money, right?

541
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,312
No, I say go for it.

542
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,675
What'd I miss?

543
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,680
The lady brought a list...
And Dad's being a wuss again.

544
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,280
No, stop it!

545
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,272
Scooch over, you.

546
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,510
Hey, so I...
I got a call today.

547
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,798
They're gonna give me
a citation for bravery.

548
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,280
You?

549
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,477
Come on,
you're afraid
of spiders.

550
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,360
Buzz Aldrin was
afraid of spiders
and he went into space.

551
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,673
Proud of you, hon.

552
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,558
They really should
be giving it to you.

553
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,230
No.

554
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,674
No, this is your deal.

555
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,000
I get to be Chief.
