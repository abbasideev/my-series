00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,150
<i>Erstwhile on</i> Fargo...

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,833
The blackmail,
I'm gonna pay it.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,750
<i>Blood and locusts...</i>

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,240
<i>The Book of Exodus.</i>

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,276
God is watching
and He knows.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,556
Knows what?

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,912
Pick me up in an hour.
We'll get the money.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,196
He's gonna pay?
A million dollars?

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,749
Did you mean to
lock me in here?

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,433
We got a big day tomorrow.
Get some rest.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,510
That's Sam Hess.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,670
I mean,
you think this could be,

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,950
like, an organized
crime thing?

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,030
We're from Fargo.

15
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,873
You're gonna find him, right?
The guy who did it.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,189
<i>I need a name.</i>

17
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,953
Malvo. Malvo.

18
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,116
Lorne Malvo?

19
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,119
<i>He killed him.
He killed Hess.</i>

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,598
So, anyway,
this freakin' guy...

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,360
The women are
in the box, yeah?

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,636
Customs seal on.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,871
Eighteen cubic tons metric
at $110 an ounce...

24
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,110
And he decides--
Oi!

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,190
...stepped twice.

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,000
Soy sauce...
and another Mai Tai.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,032
Mai Tai? Mai Tai?
...minus labor,
minus packaging,

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,999
minus extra-governmental
operating costs.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,039
Anyhoo, he decides
he's in love
with one of 'em.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,033
...yield so far,
9,000 unique
credit card numbers,

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,039
with a credit limit of
approximately $1.1 million,

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,830
minus real estate,
minus labor, minus R&D.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,280
Sam Hess.

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,035
Assets deployed,
Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers.

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,760
Three days plus
lodging plus mileage.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,310
You want the...

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,952
Bottom line,
they don't think...

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,279
Our guys, they said...
doesn't look related
to the business.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
Could be extra-marital...
on the wife's side.

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,278
So... now, they're en route
to a second location

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,752
to apprehend who we...
think is responsible.

42
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,353
Dead.

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,270
What's that?

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,351
Not apprehend, dead.

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,036
Don't care extra-marital.
Don't care not related.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,272
Kill and be killed.
Head in a bag.

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,113
There's the message.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,990
Of course, boss. Yeah.

49
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,152
Nineteen-hundred
units shipped by rail
at a cost of $600 per

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,119
plus customs
plus extra
government expenses.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,280
Good evening,
ladies. Good...

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,279
Welcome, ladies,
to Turkish Delight...

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,193
to Turkish Delight...
where your wish...

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,910
your wish is our command.

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,840
Time to make the call.

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,517
No, I mean... you know...
Maybe I don't
wanna now, you know.

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,829
'Cause... That's...
maybe... maybe

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,155
something got broken
there in the night,

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,994
you know... something...
something
important like trust.

60
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,280
You know, maybe...
we need to revisit
who gets how much here.

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,829
What's in the bags?

62
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,038
Look... okay, here's
what I'm thinking. I'm
thinking 60-40, all right?

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,270
You know,
with me getting, you know...

64
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,239
Because, you know,
am I or am I not
doing all the...

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,438
What about
the voice thingy there?

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,273
<i>"Luke... I am your father--"</i>

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,589
Ow!

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,354
Stop screwing around.

69
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,669
What...

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,750
"Luke."

71
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,638
I think you broke it.

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,677
So about that
60-40 split there,
you know, I'm...

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,753
Hey, why is there
paper on the windows?

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,680
Word for word.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,280
You really want me
to say all this?

76
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,035
Yeah.

77
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,636
<i>"Once upon a time,
there was a little boy.</i>

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,792
He was born in a field
and raised in the woods...

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,360
and he had nothing.

80
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,915
In the winter,
the boy would freeze...

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,475
and in the summer,
he would boil.

82
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,280
He knew the name
of every stinging insect.

83
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,273
At night, he would
look at the lights
in the houses

84
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,555
and he would want.

85
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,520
<i>Why was he outside
and they in?</i>

86
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,230
<i>Why was he so hungry
and they fed?</i>

87
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,437
<i>'It should be me, ' he said.</i>

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,514
<i>And out of the darkness,
the wolves came, whispering.</i>

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,469
<i>Do you understand
what I'm saying?"</i>

90
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,718
Yeah.

91
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,634
<i>"Gustafson Parking Garage,
high noon."</i>

92
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,670
Well... did it sound like
he was gonna pay?

93
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,240
I don't know what
that sounds like.

94
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,472
So is the Greek the boy or...

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,479
Give me that duffel over
there and I'll tell you.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,150
Hey...

97
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,035
what's with
all the duct tape?

98
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,029
<i>Tellin' you, folks, things
are shaping up to make this</i>

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,635
<i>one of the worst blizzards
in Minnesota history.</i>

100
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,677
<i>A perfect storm
or what have you.</i>

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,672
<i>This is definitely
one for the record books.</i>

102
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,750
<i>That's right, Norm.</i>

103
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,435
<i>And expect white outs
and blizzard-like conditions</i>

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,080
<i>as this system moves
quickly down from Canada.</i>

105
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,392
<i>Also,
expect poor road conditions
and even closures.</i>

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,633
<i>So, folks,
please avoid driving today
unless you absolutely have to.</i>

107
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,279
<i>Gosh, I...
avoid going out...</i>

108
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,792
Starting to come
down out there.

109
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,315
"Storm of the century,"
they're sayin'.

110
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,357
Is Greta here?

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,400
No, she's at a friend's.
Thought it would be safer.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
Um...

113
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,116
You didn't have to come.

114
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,840
I was coming anyway.
Told you last night.

115
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,952
Just left
a little earlier is all.

116
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,556
So... you really think
this Malvo fella
was at your apartment?

117
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,199
Not at the apartment,
outside.

118
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,795
My neighbor,
he does the watch.

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,351
He said he saw this fella
sitting in his car
outside the apartment.

120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,274
May even have
followed me here,
I'm thinking.

121
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,079
So the neighbor, Jewish fella,

122
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,437
he gives the guy a warning,
you know,
a kind of, "Move along."

123
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,592
Said the fella was
real menacing in return.

124
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,956
Had a police scanner, he said.

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,951
Talked about how
maybe he was gonna...

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,316
come back and kill
the neighbor and his family.

127
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,390
Oh, jeez.

128
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,549
Did you call it in?

129
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,840
Well, see... I don't think
they'd believe me
is the thing.

130
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,314
I mean, not after, you know,

131
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,120
I arrest the wrong fella,
being what they think.

132
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
So there's that.

133
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,478
He get a plate number,
your neighbor?

134
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,880
Yeah, yeah. He...

135
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,280
I called it in.

136
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,671
SUV of some type...
company car.

137
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,035
Which company?

138
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,555
The grocery chain, you know,
"July in January."

139
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,710
Phoenix Farms.

140
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,910
Right.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,639
Which...

142
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,033
This Malvo fella
saying he's a pastor...

143
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,397
so not sure
the connection there.

144
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,757
Well, maybe
we should drive over,
see what they say.

145
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,116
Yeah. Let me get changed.

146
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,113
Morning, Mr. Creech.

147
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,193
And how're
we feeling there,
Mr. Nygaard?

148
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,113
Oh, yeah.

149
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,795
Real good.
Ready to go home.

150
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,678
Well, now,
that's up to him, I suppose.

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,871
So how's your pain level
on a scale of one to 10?

152
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,713
Yeah, not bad.

153
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,393
So maybe a three?

154
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,756
Hmm?

155
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,993
What... What's with...
Why's there
a police officer outside?

156
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,197
Not for me to say, is it?

157
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,673
Okay, Mr. Creech, I'll be
back to take you to
Radiology in 10 minutes.

158
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,594
I'm... I'm his brother Chaz.
Chaz Nygaard.

159
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,270
Lester... it's me.

160
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,750
Hey.

161
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,635
What did you do?

162
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,279
When?
Come on, Lester.

163
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,960
There's a deputy
outside the door,
for Pete's sake.

164
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,115
I just... cut my hand
on a... some rusty nail.

165
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,795
Not sure how that involves
local law enforcement.

166
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,237
They said you were there
when the Police Chief
got murdered.

167
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,959
Well, heck.

168
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,589
I think I'd remember that.

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,631
Unless... I don't know,
with the head injury,
maybe...

170
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,710
'Cause lying...

171
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,309
You're lying.

172
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,390
Says who?

173
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,551
That cop, the female,
says you are a suspect.

174
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,313
Suspect of what?
Murder...

175
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,837
for Pearl, the Chief...
even Sam Hess.

176
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,077
That is crazy
is what that is.

177
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,231
I'm the victim! Me!

178
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,597
He came to my house. They...

179
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,670
I almost died.

180
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,075
Did you tell her that?

181
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,520
Don't lie to me!

182
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,274
I took you in. My house...

183
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,272
This is...
Around my kid...

184
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,589
Oh, boy.

185
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,433
Oh, boy. Classic.

186
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,795
Cops can't
figure out who did it,

187
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,195
so they start
throwing blame around.

188
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,356
You said
you were kidnapped.

189
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,512
You called me in a meeting,
said you were
mixed up in something.

190
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,279
That was-- I told you
I was just pranking you.

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,874
No, you said you were
in the trunk of a car.

192
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,111
Said a couple of
fellas grabbed you.

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,715
What are you
mixed up in, Lester?
What the heck is goin' on?

194
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,996
Chaz, I swear to you,
this is all just a...

195
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,798
Heck, you're my brother.
You should be on my side.

196
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,712
People are dead, Lester.

197
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,110
Your own wife.

198
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,556
A... a conspiracy,
they're sayin'.

199
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,520
Like... like... like... maybe
you hired a fella to... to...

200
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,391
To...

201
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,079
what?

202
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,873
Come on.

203
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,712
Chaz, I swear to God...
I did not do this... anything.

204
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,230
Well, they think you did...
or know who did,

205
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,400
so... so... you gotta
give 'em something...
someone.

206
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,598
If you want this to go away,
you gotta give 'em someone.

207
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,710
Chaz... buddy, come on.

208
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,360
This is...

209
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,909
You have got to
stand by me here.

210
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,953
You've been a burden
my whole life.

211
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,434
I'm done.

212
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,277
There's something
wrong with you, Lester.
There's something missing.

213
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,554
You're not right
in the world.

214
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,960
Chaz.

215
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,917
Okay, here's
Mr. Creech's charts.

216
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,756
Are we ready, Mr. Creech?

217
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,876
Okay, Mr. Creech,
someone will be out
for you in a minute.

218
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,839
So he had a shotgun pellet
in his hand this whole time?

219
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,719
Lester? Yeah.

220
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,837
Which means he wasn't
knocked out in the basement

221
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,877
like he said he was.

222
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,872
So maybe...

223
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,516
maybe he and Malvo
weren't foes there
at the end.

224
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,276
Maybe... they colluded
on this whole thing.

225
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,315
Hmm.

226
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,031
Welcome to Phoenix Farms!

227
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,918
Hiya. We're
police officers.

228
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,878
You sure are.
This about the bugs?

229
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,076
Sorry?

230
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,310
The bugs. The...
What do you...

231
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,193
Locust?

232
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,954
Or wait. Maybe we're not
supposed to tell people.

233
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,680
Dave, are we telling people
about the bugs?

234
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,912
Is there a manager
or someone we can talk to?

235
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,639
Not sure anybody's in yet.

236
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,279
Dave, anybody in
the offices yet?

237
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
Let me check.

238
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,598
<i>Mr. Cosmopolis to
Customer Service.</i>

239
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,632
Okay, then...
I'm gonna leave my card.

240
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,234
Deputy Solverson.

241
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,159
We're here
about a company car,
who's driving it.

242
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,033
The license number
there on the back.

243
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,873
When a manager gets in,
just have him call.

244
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,679
Okay, sure. Thanks
for stopping by.

245
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,519
Thanks.

246
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,478
So what do
we do now then?

247
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,518
I could use
another cup of coffee.

248
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,796
<i>Please take your ticket.</i>

249
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,834
<i>Oh, God.</i>

250
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,235
<i>Oh, God, my God.</i>

251
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,110
What?

252
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,112
Kid's
getting restless.

253
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,031
<i>How's he doing?</i>

254
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,954
He's baffled...
just like me.

255
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,713
Did you make the drop?

256
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,835
No.

257
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,960
<i>It's not too late
to get off the pot.
It's a lot of damn money.</i>

258
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,590
It's not about the money.
It's bigger than the...

259
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,559
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

260
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>Than what?</i>

261
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,515
I know what I gotta do now.

262
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,752
Give me an hour
and head back.

263
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,480
Tell the damn kid...

264
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,994
I love him.

265
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,595
<i>Yeah, I'm...
I'm not gonna say that.</i>

266
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,799
Pack your shit.
We're heading home.

267
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,479
Was that my dad?

268
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,794
Ticket, please.

269
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,594
I changed my mind.

270
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,273
I decided...

271
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,034
God, He told me.

272
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,157
He has different plans.

273
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,717
God told you not to park here?

274
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,400
No, no, no.

275
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,597
I know what I have to
do now. I didn't before.

276
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,837
Well, sir, I gotta...

277
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,031
It's $2 for
the first 30 minutes, so...

278
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,873
Son, do you go to church?
Yes, sir.

279
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,839
Then open the goddamn gate.
Your Lord demands it.

280
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,077
Two-faced.

281
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,350
What's that?

282
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,470
Oh...

283
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,477
When someone's a liar,
that's what you... you say.

284
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,519
"He's two-faced."

285
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,632
Like, he's got one face
for telling the truth

286
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,319
and another for...

287
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,438
I guess that's what...
bothers me the most,
you know.

288
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,149
Not the violence and
the murders and all?

289
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,354
Well... of course that...
but, I mean...

290
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,677
When a dog goes rabid,
right, there's no mistaking
it for a normal dog.

291
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,476
And here we are.

292
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,349
We're supposed to be...
you know, us people...

293
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,472
we're supposed
to know better...

294
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,314
to be better, you know?

295
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,956
It must be hard to
live in this world
if you believe that.

296
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,997
You have no idea.

297
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,034
<i>620, be aware. Possible
313 in progress,</i>

298
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,476
<i>Bishop and Main.</i>

299
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,672
<i>Roger from

300
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,560
<i>8434, base.
I'm gonna go ahead
and cancel this thing.</i>

301
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,479
Thought about it.
The 60-40 thing
doesn't work for me.

302
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,319
<i>All right,</i>

303
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,397
<i>I'm gonna take it to north,
in case he shows up
down the block.</i>

304
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,675
<i>Dispatch

305
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,240
<i>121 1 Mint. Roger.</i>

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,000
<i>A 172. Tenth

307
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,434
Hey. Hey!

308
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,875
In case Stavros
does call the cops...

309
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,270
we wanna make sure
they're too busy to respond.

310
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,436
That's part one.

311
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,270
Mmm-mmm.

312
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,310
Part two is...

313
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,233
have you ever had
Turkish Delight?

314
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,640
It's disgusting.

315
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,838
That's okay.
I'd be insulted
if you didn't try.

316
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,038
<i>Roger that.</i>

317
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,635

<i>All units,

322
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,114
Ow!

323
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,029
Mr. Creech?

324
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,230
Hello?

325
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,069
Anyone there?

326
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,029
No TV until
you do your homework.

327
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,873
Just don't go there.
You know that.

328
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,634
Wash your hands first.
Did.

329
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,554
Yeah? When?
Between the car
and the house?

330
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,871
So this fella gives away
all his money and a kidney

331
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,394
and then he kills himself?

332
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,836
That's what he said,
my neighbor.

333
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,911
Why didn't the fella
just go work for a charity?

334
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,070
Got me.

335
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,438
Probably close the roads
soon, if you're
gonna head back.

336
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,318
Still gotta take
a look at Lester's car.

337
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,189
Maybe take another run
at Phoenix Farms,
I'm thinking.

338
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,671
Try to get an ID
on that company car.

339
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,037
Don't much like this fella
threatening people.

340
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,390
Never wanted to
be a cop, you know.

341
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,473
I mean...
some kids grow up
thinking about it,

342
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,233
but not me.

343
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,553
And your dream was what then?

344
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,189
You're gonna think
it's funny, but...

345
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,431
I always wanted to
work for the Post Office...

346
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,953
and be a mailman.

347
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,271
I like that you get to see
the same people every day...

348
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,273
bring 'em that check
they've been waiting for...

349
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,032
and presents for Christmas...
be part of the community.

350
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,036
But... when I applied,
they were on
a hiring freeze.

351
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,113
Then this pal from
high school tells me
the local PD is hiring,

352
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,311
so I took the bus downtown.

353
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,472
Never thought they'd,
you know... they'd take me.

354
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,153
So why try?

355
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,194
Well, you know...

356
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,555
Greta's mom passed

357
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,350
and she was the one
with the paycheck, so...

358
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,198
Oh, jeez.

359
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,749
I wonder what that's about.

360
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,720
<i>All Tac units arrived after
me. Repeat, Tac team...</i>

361
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,750
I don't want to
die in this way.

362
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,438
How bad?

363
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,911
Sir, multiple shots fired,
property damage.

364
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,390
No injury reports
at this time...

365
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,790
and perps are still
thought to be inside.

366
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,075
Multiple?

367
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,469
Unclear at this time.

368
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,073
<i>To the individual
or individuals
inside the house.</i>

369
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,597
<i>This is Lieutenant Schmidt,
Duluth Police Department.</i>

370
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,916
<i>I'm ordering you to
throw out your weapon</i>

371
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,430
<i>and come out with
your hands up...</i>

372
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,716
<i>or we'll start blasting.</i>

373
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,993
Move!

374
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,800
<i>Roger that.
Tac team 2 is on the move.</i>

375
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,594
<i>On the move.
Divide and conquer on three.</i>

376
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,115
<i>Divide and conquer on three.
Over.</i>

377
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,670
No!

378
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,240
Shots fired!

379
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,874
Go, go, go!

380
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,838
They're shooting!
Shot's fired!

381
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,231
<i>Shots fired!
Engage! Engage!</i>

382
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,154
No!

383
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,474
<i>Shots fired.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

384
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,750
<i>Cease fire!</i>

385
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,240
Cease fire, damn it!

386
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,317
I think we got him.

387
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,437
Based on what? ESP?

388
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,910
Breach!

389
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,038
Wait!

390
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,390
Gun!

391
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,672
<i>Suspect is down.
Repeat, suspect is down.</i>

392
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,070
<i>Oddest suicide
by cop I ever...</i>

393
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,277
They're shooting up
the block. It's goddamn
World War III.

394
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,396
Call 911.

395
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,150
No, wait!

396
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,674
This is Grimly.

397
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,310
Shots fired,
Fourth and Hunter.
Requesting backup.

398
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,476
What do you think?

399
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,592
Accident, I guess.

400
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,911
Words exchanged,
differences.

401
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,356
Heck of a lot of bullets
for a fender bender.

402
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,955
No, wait!
We should wait for...

403
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,116
Who?

404
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,234
Who?
God!

405
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,079
Damn it!

406
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,880
Fargo!

407
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,360
Here!

408
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,354
One down!

409
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,439
He's dead, I think!

410
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,111
Freeze! Police officer!

411
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,639
Halt!

412
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,796
<i>Just
a horrible time to be
on the roads, guys.</i>

413
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,712
<i>And I don't
recall any time, Kim...</i>

414
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,238
<i>Unless you get
a serious blizzard
like '96 or even into '93.</i>

415
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,313
<i>...where we have had so many
interstates shut down...</i>

416
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,153
Let there be light, huh?

417
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,834
What the heck was that?

418
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,429
What... Jeez.

419
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,874
God! Fish!

420
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,440
Jeez!

421
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,152
Buddy?

422
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,110
Buddy?

423
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,954
Dmitri?

424
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,399
I gave it back.

425
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,600
I gave it back!

426
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,189
Mr. Creech.

427
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,920
Mr. Creech.

428
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,118
Oh, thank gosh.

429
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,999
There you are, Mr. Creech.

430
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,799
Thought we'd lost you.
