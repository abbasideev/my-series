1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:03,337
<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,964
- I didn't kill that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,050
I was set up.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,636
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,472
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison cell.

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,351
- I'm looking for Lincoln Burrows.
- Man killed the vice president's brother.

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,978
- Why do you want to see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,231
- I'm getting you out.
- It's impossible.

9
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,817
- Not if you designed the place.
- You've seen the blueprints.

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,321
Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>- There's a lawyer poking around.
- Ms Donovan? I didn't mean to scare you.</i>

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,285
- It's gone.
- Does anyone else have a key to this place?

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,665
You were here.
I walked over to the cabinet and I...

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,591
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

15
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:54,179
Yeah. Maybe it's time
I lit up that leather once and for all, huh?

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,265
- What happened?
- Don't make me lie to you.

17
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,851
- You heard the news?
- No. What?

18
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,687
- They're brothers.
- Who?

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,855
Burrows and Scofield.

20
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,982
Michael Scofield?

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,193
I'm going into the walls,
see if I can access the roof.

22
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,404
Take the only thing Burrows has left.

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,991
The chair isn't the only way
to take a man's life in prison.

24
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,554
Just a few more rides.
Then you have to wrap it up.

25
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,184
Wow. Adam's getting bigger. Ten.

26
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,019
Not here.

27
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,439
We need a favour.

28
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,899
- I've been out of the life for years.
- I know.

29
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,903
Problem is, no one's gonna believe that
if I take the heroin in my pocket

30
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:56,408
and put it in the glove box of the reasonably
priced minivan you got over there.

31
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:01,913
I will cuff you. I will drag you
out of here in front of everyone.

32
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,544
What do you need?

33
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,594
<i>What America needs
is an environmentally friendly,</i>

34
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,054
<i>logistically feasible</i>

35
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,850
<i>and economically responsible
alternative fuel source.</i>

36
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,732
<i>Leave a message
and I'll call you back. Thanks.</i>

37
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,903
<i>It's Wendy. I know you wanted to work
with no distractions, so don't pick up.</i>

38
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,574
<i>I just wanted to let you know that
Nick Savrinn left six messages for you...</i>

39
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,745
<i>- What did you tell him?
- What you said to say that you were in a meeting.</i>

40
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,372
If he comes by tomorrow,
tell him I'm not there.

41
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>- OK. Goodnight, Veronica.
- Thanks, Wendy.</i>

44
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:31,498
Look, I appreciate everything you've done,
but I don't want your help any more.

45
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,960
Don't want my help. Do you really think I had
something to do with that missing tape?

46
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,380
No. I'm just gonna go grab
a cup of coffee and get back to work.

47
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,592
I don't have time for this right now.

48
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:49,724
Veronica, just wait a second.
Will you hold on a second?

49
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,602
- Listen, what are you avoid...
- Don't touch me!

50
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,021
Everything OK, Miss Donovan?

51
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,650
Lucasz, do you mind
walking me back inside?

52
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,613
Take a walk, pal.

53
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,990
You're being paranoid.

54
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,828
- You're being paranoid.
- Go away, Nick.

55
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,219
Show some skin, Scofield.

56
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,478
Hey, Scofield!

57
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,825
I'm trying to sleep, boss.

58
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,755
- I can't get through the wall.
- What do you mean you can't get through?

59
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,176
I know how to do it.
I just don't have the time to do it.

60
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,013
We're locked up. All we got is time.

61
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,475
You don't understand.
I planned this break on a schedule.

62
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:19,022
Constantly coming up here for count won't
let me do what I need to do to get through.

63
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:24,319
<i>If I'm not back on schedule, which means
we're through by the end of the day mañana,</i>

64
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,612
we're not getting out of here.

65
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:33,286
There's three things for certain in life -
death, taxes and count.

66
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,664
The only way to stop count is...

67
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,085
- What?
- Never mind. It's a bad idea.

68
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,672
Worse than the idea of losing Maricruz?

69
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:54,682
A lockdown. We get Gen Pop locked down
for a day, you'll have all the time you need.

70
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,561
- And no count?
- Bulls don't even come by.

71
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,772
Only one problem.

72
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,940
How do we get a lockdown?

73
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,450
- Can you get to the prison AC unit?
- Maybe.

74
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,581
You want a lockdown?
You'd better get the inmates riled up.

75
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,793
And if you wanna piss off
the meat in concrete,

76
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,253
turn up the heat.

77
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:32,308

Drills and the Devil (Part 1)

78
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,857
<i>- I thought you were retired.
- Never mind me.</i>

79
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,111
Heavy hitters want this done,
so that means I want it done.

80
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,821
No screw-ups.

81
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:37,410
For you, Diamond, it's not a problem.
Burrows is as good as dead.

82
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,464
- Hottest April on record.
- Global warming.

83
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,426
Probably. You got a minute?

84
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,720
About five years' worth.

85
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,888
Sorry. Right.

86
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,351
- You never told me Burrows is your brother.
- Never came up.

87
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:08,024
Right. I'm curious if that
isn't because of my father, the governor.

88
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,322
He may not be the one pulling the switch, but
he has power to grant clemency and he won't.

89
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,866
And he never does.

90
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,162
My old man was an abusive drunk
who abandoned his family.

91
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,998
I don'tjudge anyone by their father's actions,

92
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,167
or inactions,

93
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,377
if that was your concern.

94
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,591
Just so you know,
I don't agree with his politics.

95
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,346
And I'm sorry about your brother.

96
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,973
I appreciate that.

97
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,110
Hey, this isn't much...

98
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,113
Um...

99
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,243
I have to give Lincoln a weekly checkup.
If you want, I could schedule the visits

100
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,371
to end right before
you come in for your shots.

101
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:10,377
That way you could at least see each other,
even if it's just in passing.

102
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,964
Thank you.

103
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,136
Yeah.

104
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,696
Greetings from the kitchen, fish. 100 bucks.

105
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,165
Theodore Bagwell,
a transfer back from the infirmary.

106
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,334
<i>Check. Open 14.</i>

107
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,516
We got you a little "get well" gift.

108
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,815
It's just the right size.

109
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,360
Thank you, boys.

110
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:19,154
I'll catch up with you later.

111
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,662
What's your name?

112
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,164
Seth.

113
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,792
Are you new, Seth?

114
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,587
Scared? Look at me, boy.

115
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,054
You probably heard stories about me.

116
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,892
They're not all true.

117
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,066
What do you say we go for a walk, huh?

118
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,736
- Your co-counsel's already here.
- Excuse me?

119
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,201
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Talking to my client.

120
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:32,996
Don't talk to him.
We don't know anything about this guy.

121
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,542
He found somebody that could help us out.

122
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,418
You have one minute.

123
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:43,340
I've been going over the incident report.
Somebody made an anonymous call

124
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:47,469
claiming to see Lincoln running away
from the garage with bloody pants.

125
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,014
You can't cross-examine a witness
if you don't know who it is.

126
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,768
- We don't need to. We know where he is.
- What do you mean?

127
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:59,606
A PI friend of mine was able to backtrack
the phone call to the police department.

128
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,277
Whoever made that call
couldn't have seen Lincoln that night.

129
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,571
How do you know?

130
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,825
Because the phone call
came from Washington DC.

131
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,682
You were supposed to turn off the AC,
not turn on the furnace.

132
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,672
- It's getting so hot in here.
- Did I say you could talk, Cherry?

133
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,217
You'll know when
I want you to open your mouth.

134
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,681
Geary!

135
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:19,353
- Do something about the heat.
- Doing the best we can.

136
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,897
Your best is garbage.
It's 100 degrees in here.

137
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,108
<i>- Look like I got frostbite to you?</i>

138
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,277
Line it up!

139
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,965
Why don't you transfer us all
someplace cooler, like Africa?

140
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:53,720
Get your ass on the line, convict.

141
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:05,190
We'll move when
the temperature situation is rectified.

142
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:11,822
Bellick, this is Mack in cell block.
We got some cons popping off.

143
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,408
Smack 'em, throw 'em on the line
and write 'em up.

144
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:19,204
If you can't handle it,
don't cash your paycheck this week.

145
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,331
This is not a good time, Doc.

146
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,750
I got a call a prisoner has heat exhaustion.

147
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,586
- He's faking it.
- Is that your medical opinion?

148
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,173
We got a bunch of overheated cons
getting loud in A-Wing.

149
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,092
I don't blame 'em. It's an oven.

150
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,804
Everything's under control.
You should go back to the infirmary.

151
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:40,058
When things calm down, I'll have
your patients transferred from Sick Bay.

152
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,354
- Just looking out for your best interests.
- And I appreciate that.

153
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:48,525
But Officer Bellick, we both know
it's illegal to deny a prisoner medical care

154
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:54,865
and you could lose yourjob over it.
I'm just looking out for your best interests.

155
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,326
Go right on in.

156
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,289
Thank you, sir.

157
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,502
Don't be a baby, T-Bag. It ain't that hot.

158
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,882
Not that hot?!

159
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,468
When this guy woke up this morning,
he was white!

160
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,855
You wanna cool off?

161
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:30,567
Step back.

162
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,783
We'll step back
when we get some wind blowing in here.

163
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:47,375
All right! That's it! Lockdown!
Everyone back to your cells!

164
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,212
I said everyone back to your cells.
Now, convicts!

165
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,800
<i>- Lockdown!</i>

166
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,762
- You got your lockdown. Do your thing.
- You're coming.

167
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:02,140
What? No, no, no, no.
I'm the lookout man, that's it.

168
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:06,603
I need you down there. It's a two-man job.
Let's hang a sheet.

169
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:10,357
You only hang a sheet when you
and your cellmate wanna get friendly.

170
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,029
You wanna protect your prison rep?
Or you wanna get out of here?

171
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:22,303
- What the hell's going on in here?
- They got belligerent and refused to rack in.

172
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,140
You locked it down
with inmates out of their cells?

173
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:30,478
Figured we could handle
20 out-of-control inmates easier than 300.

174
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,440
Listen up, bros. Bellick.

175
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,110
I got one for you.
What do you call a piece of white trash

176
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:40,947
who couldn't pass the cops exam
and now makes less than a mailman?

177
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,450
A CO.

178
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,456
- Get your hands off the fence.
- Suck it, pig!

179
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,797
You really let me down.
And that's hard to do,

180
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:03,219
because I don't expect much
from the inbred child of a retard.

181
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,184
That's right, Teddy.

182
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,352
I read your psych records.

183
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,398
About how your daddy
raped his mongoloid sister

184
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:20,403
and then nine months later
little Teddy pops out.

185
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,826
I'm gonna kill you!

186
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,003
Hot as hell.

187
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:41,007
They'll wear themselves out eventually.

188
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,222
The call was a fake.
What about a stay of execution?

189
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:52,810
- It's legally insufficient.
- What the hell does that mean?

190
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:57,190
It means the prosecution could point out
the evidence from your criminal trial.

191
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:59,984
The blood, the video, the gun.

192
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,739
A questionable phone call
is not gonna stack up to that.

193
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:08,326
- It's something, right?
- Absolutely. We got an area code.

194
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:13,081
My contact will track it to someplace more
specific... a building, neighbourhood, a block...

195
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:16,334
- to the person who made this call.
- OK. What happens next?

196
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,087
We need to catch the next flight to DC.

197
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,465
That is, of course, if you trust me now.

198
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,511
<i>It's coming.</i>

199
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:29,722
It's coming! It's coming!

200
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,060
Get on the train! Whoo!

201
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:46,406
Get on the train! Get on the train!

202
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,158
Let's get to my office.

203
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:53,079
Oh, just what I thought.
Piglets are scared of the big bad wolf.

204
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:54,997
Big bad wolf!

205
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:59,335
Oh, just what I thought.

206
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,797
Get on the train!

207
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,603
Come on.

208
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,892
Marilyn, no!

209
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:21,083
Whose keys are those?

210
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,544
I guess in the commotion...

211
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:32,845
How many rounds you think you're going to
get off before they get their hands on you?

212
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:37,725
This is Bellick. Our wing has been breached.

213
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:43,940
I want A-Wing evacuated and shut down.
All access to B-Wing cut off now.

214
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:53,866
I'm gonna get some fluids into you,
you'll be good as new.

215
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,786
Nod your head if you believe me.

216
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:58,955
Good man.

217
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:01,707
Theo.

218
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,210
What can we do for you today?

219
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:10,508
- Hmm. This where it hurts?
- A little higher and to the left.

220
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:12,927
You're three weeks post-op.

221
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:18,182
Your knee's held together by a rod and three
screws. Tenderness is normal. No more meds.

222
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,727
OK. Kwame, why are you back?

223
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:26,273
<i>Inmates have compromised
lockdown and breached A-Wing.</i>

224
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,401
<i>A- Wing is shutting down.</i>

225
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,404
It's popping off up in G Pop!

226
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:54,677
Somewhere on the other side of this wall is
a drainage pipe to the prison's sewer system.

227
00:25:56,512 --> 00:26:01,058
If we can get through this wall,
we can get into the pipe.

228
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:05,688
If we can get into the pipe,
we can get into the infirmary.

229
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:11,527
If we can get to the infirmary,
then we can get out of here.

230
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:17,491
Sorry, all visitors have to leave.
You have to leave.

231
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,954
A minor disturbance in cell block. A-Wing
is being shut down for safety purposes.

232
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:24,957
<i>- A-Wing?
- Veronica, Michael's in there.</i>

233
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,293
- Will he be OK?
- You have to leave now.

234
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:31,046
Go to DC. It's all we've got.
I'll take care of Michael. All right?

235
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,215
Please.

236
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:38,387
- Sorry about cutting you short.
- I told you not to apologise.

237
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,141
- It makes you look weak. What's going on?
- It's a minor disturbance.

238
00:26:42,224 --> 00:26:46,812
Minor disturbance? My brother is in Gen Pop.
Give it to me straight.

239
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,274
Some clowns breached cell block.
But they won't get anywhere.

240
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:55,029
They always have locked doors at either end.
There's nothing to worry about.

241
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:57,198
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

242
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,997
<i>Additional sectors of A-Wing
have been compromised.</i>

243
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:21,972
I'll be damned!

244
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:26,143
A rookie CO - and it ain't even Christmas!

245
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:33,692
Take the cuffs off. Give me the key.

246
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:36,237
Get out of here, T-Bag.

247
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,156
Oh, I see. You found him first.
Finders keepers.

248
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,408
You know, I respect that. I do.

249
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:46,497
- But I think we can work something out.
- What you got?

250
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,043
Oh, I can make your last few weeks
on Earth quite, quite enjoyable.

251
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:53,712
Get you some Demerol, some X.

252
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:57,258
Make you forget about that big bad chair.

253
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:59,468
No deal.

254
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,680
You gotta learn the art of negotiating.

255
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:06,141
Lesson one - bargaining position.

256
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:11,105
- Rules just changed.
- Get the pig!

257
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:16,986
What are you doing?
You're not gonna make it.

258
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:20,739
Chill, Sink. No blood needs to spill, Sink.

259
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:22,825
Then walk away.

260
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:25,119
We both know that ain't gonna happen.

261
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,079
Yeah?

262
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:46,306
That's one big pile of concrete.

263
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,601
How do you know where the pipe is?

264
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:55,149
- We've got someone to show us where it is.
- Oh, really? Who?

265
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,747
The infection's not bad.
I'll give you penicillin just to make sure.

266
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,915
Thanks, Doc.

267
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:23,635
This is Rizzo.
Does A-Wing need backup? Over.

268
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:30,017
<i>Negative. A-Wing is evacuating
and locked down. Remain in B-Wing.</i>

269
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:42,529
What's up, Doc?

270
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:03,884
Come on, Doc.

271
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:06,512
You don't wanna do this.

272
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:26,949
We're sorry. This line
is experiencing technical difficulties.

273
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:39,336
You ever see one of them safari shows where
a bunch of cheetahs jump up on an antelope?

274
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:43,173
<i>Guess which one you are.</i>

275
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,785
Tough little girl, ain't he?

276
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,836
I believe the devil's got some crazy power,

277
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,339
but I don't think shining him on this wall
is gonna bring it down.

278
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:30,345
- Not unless he's got a sledgehammer.
- We don't need a sledgehammer.

279
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:37,477
What the hell am I supposed to do with this?

280
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:44,901
<i>- Sick Bay, report.
- Sick Bay, please report.</i>

281
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:48,322
<i>Sick Bay, come in. Is everything OK?</i>

282
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:51,658
You know what to say.

283
00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:59,124
All clear in Sick Bay. Over.

284
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:01,293
<i>Roger that.</i>

285
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:08,759
Let them worry about the noise.
You worry about how to drill

286
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:12,304
through a concrete wall
with what used to be an egg beater.

287
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:16,224
- We just need a few small holes.
- How can we fit through small holes?

288
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,060
Ever hear of tensile strength?

289
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:21,354
- Hooke's Law of elasticity?
- What do you think?

290
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:26,735
If we drill holes in strategic locations, we
compromise the wall's load-carrying capacity.

291
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:31,448
- How about speaking English?
- We'll be able to break through the wall.

292
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:33,658
Give me that.

293
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:38,038
We go in through the tip of each horn,
the eyes, the end of the nose,

294
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:40,957
the bottom of the fangs, end of the braids.

295
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,376
It makes a kind of X.

296
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:46,296
Let's get to it.

297
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:59,643
If I can get DIRT in there
with some of the newer firepower...

298
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:02,020
End the riot today
and start funerals tomorrow?

299
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:04,856
- I can contain this.
- Warden, I got a call for you.

300
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,236
- Not now.
- I think you should take it. It's the governor.

301
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,321
<i>- Governor.
- Where's my daughter?</i>

302
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:14,825
Not to worry, sir. She's fine.
She's in Sick Bay in B-Wing.

303
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:18,703
It's a different part of the facility,
locked off from the disturbance.

304
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:23,333
That's what you're calling a riot nowadays?
Can these animals get to her?

305
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:27,379
Sir, it's impossible for anyone
from A-Wing to get into Sick Bay.

306
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:31,091
A guard assures us everything is fine.
We have everything under control.

307
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:34,427
For your sake, you'd better hope you do.

308
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,483
I'm gonna dance with you, Doc!

309
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,903
I'm gonna dance till the sun come up!

310
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:55,740
- Come on, Doc!
- Open the door!

311
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,833
<i>- All right. It's your turn.
- No. I ain't messing with no diablo.</i>

312
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,919
We can't afford downtime.
We have to switch off with the drilling.

313
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:13,592
It's bad mojo. You kidding? I mess with him,
you drill into him, he gets pissed. Then what?

314
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:17,262
I got enough enemies already, papi. OK?

315
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:20,265
- You believe in God, right?
- You know I do.

316
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:24,477
So you're protected. He'll protect you.

317
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:27,022
From him.

318
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:58,011
Gentlemen!

319
00:34:58,094 --> 00:35:00,430
Oh, gentlemen!

320
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:05,518
I assure you, once Bob and I
are done getting acquainted...

321
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:07,354
We blaze him!

322
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:11,024
Everyone else will get their turn.

323
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:22,243
We're gonna have a little fun, Bobby.

324
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:27,207
Don't worry.
I don't got the blickey. My pipes are clean.

325
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,587
Where are you going, rookie?

326
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,675
No, no, no, no.

327
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:39,761
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

328
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:43,932
They always think they can run away.

329
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:02,575
Got a question for you, fish.

330
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:08,123
What if we do all this work
and the pipe is ten feet that way?

331
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:10,959
- It won't be.
- Have you got X-ray vision?

332
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:16,381
I calculated the drill point coordinates, hid
them in my tattoo and projected it on the wall.

333
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:20,802
Everything's been worked out so the image
hits the right spot. It's just math.

334
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:23,304
What if your math is wrong?

335
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:26,307
You'll drill into
one of a dozen gas lines behind the wall.

336
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:31,187
There'll be an explosion
and we'll be burned alive.

337
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,734
But you're good at math, right?

338
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,311
They're breaking out.

339
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,945
They're breaking...

340
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,948
Shh.

341
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,925
Come on! Come on!

342
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:45,345
Open up!

343
00:37:46,387 --> 00:37:49,182
Open it up! Come on!

344
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:53,102
Yo, Stroke.
You got longer arms than me, man.

345
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:59,192
Agh! Son of a...

346
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:07,450
That bitch stuck me.

347
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:25,718
You think it's hot now?
I want all the water shut off.

348
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:30,098
- I'll call Maintenance.
- Mack, you take care of it.

349
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:32,266
Yes, sir.

350
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:44,695
Yeah, we... we have a problem.

351
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:50,493
That's right. Yeah, Bob here's seen the hole.
He's gotta go away.

352
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:56,833
- No one's going anywhere.
- He's seen the hole.

353
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:59,460
So have you.

354
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:03,506
Looks like your lockdown idea
didn't work out too good, huh?

355
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:06,384
I have a daughter. Please.

356
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:12,515
- We gotta kill him.
- The cops are right outside.

357
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:16,811
And they'll stay outside.
As long as they know we're keeping him alive.

358
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:23,109
- But he's a guard. He's gonna squeal.
- What the hell does this have to do with you?

359
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:26,028
This is not any of your concern.

360
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:29,198
Hm.

361
00:39:31,117 --> 00:39:35,371
See, Bob here knows about our secret.

362
00:39:35,454 --> 00:39:38,166
<i>He knows about our escape.</i>

363
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:43,504
So it's all of our concern now, isn't it?

364
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,858
Easy, big fella. It's just me.

365
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:07,153
Looks like you took a pretty good hit.

366
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,744
Cons got that rook guard in Gen Pop. Kid's
probably dead already, or wishing he was.

367
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:17,872
- Where's Scofield?
- Haven't seen him.

368
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:21,292
- I gotta find him.
- You looking for Scofield?

369
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,461
- Yeah, Turk.
- Come on.

370
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:38,017
Now you listen, pervert. You're in
as much trouble as he is. You understand?

371
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,270
Go ahead. Go ahead. Stick me, stick me.

372
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:45,566
Let's see how many times I can shout out
about your little hole before I bleed out.

373
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:51,656
Every con's gonna know about your escape
before one drip of my blood hits the floor.

374
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:55,493
So you see, friends,
either I'm through that hole with you

375
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:57,995
or I'm gonna sing like Johnny Cash.

376
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:19,100
Open the door!

377
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,276
Hey, yo! Check it!
Stroke is about to get the doc.

378
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:47,002
- Finish what we started.
- Where are you going?

379
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:50,464
- Sick Bay.
- There's no way to B-Wing. We're locked out.

380
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:52,883
I'm not. No one touches the CO.

381
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:56,053
No one.

382
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,896
You gonna clue me in, paisano?

383
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:13,737
Be faster if we cut through here.

384
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:17,616
Burrows is as good as dead.

385
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,578
Yeah! We're coming to get you!

386
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:13,964
Open it up!
