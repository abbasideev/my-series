<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,690
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'll hit that pipe.

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:07,982
We'll be there by Friday.

4
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:16,567
Now, we got a hell of a lot
to talk about, don't we?

5
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:22,651
- This guy says he's on the job in here.
- Concrete is my speciality.

6
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:24,694
OK, boss. Sign him up.

7
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:29,820
Whites don't want you, blacks don't want you.
You're just caught in the middle, aren't you?

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,696
A regular tweener.

9
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,363
- Hello?
- It's me. It's time.

10
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:35,280
Yes.

11
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:37,071
Why are you so cynical?

12
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:39,697
I think there's cynicism
and then there's realism.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,240
And there's optimism. Hope. Faith.

14
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,657
Thank you for trying to make me smile.
Not today.

15
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,491
<i>You never know.</i>

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,159
You want the Cooper story?
I can't give it to you.

17
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:53,492
Cos I'm not him.

18
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:56,243
The lawyers, they're still running around.

19
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:59,994
Same thing goes for the kid.
You gotta hand the reins over to me. Now.

20
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:01,578
First of all...

21
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,745
You and your partner
are off the job until further notice.

22
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:53,133
<i>- That one.
- Nice choice.</i>

23
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:55,883
Platinum. Brushed.

24
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,717
- 6.25?
- 6.25.

25
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:02,135
She's a lucky woman.

26
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,885
Yes.

27
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,260
She is.

28
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,262
- You kept it.
- Kept what?

29
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:19,139
- The flower.
- I'm a pack rat. I never throw anything out.

30
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,723
Yeah. All this clutter, it's overwhelming.

31
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:25,891
- You should see my apartment.
- Whoa.

32
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:30,350
Haven't even had our first date yet,
and you're already inviting me in.

33
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:36,392
- I thought you were a nice girl.
- Michael, we all know nice girls finish last.

34
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,644
So where do you finish?

35
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:41,603
That depends on where I start.
Deep breath.

36
00:02:43,353 --> 00:02:45,437
Exhale.

37
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:48,812
Inhale.

38
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:58,898
Sara, we're backing up out here.

39
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:01,732
Right. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:06,317
I'm gonna get your shot.

41
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:45,326
This is not what I signed on for.

44
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:56,079
Vice President Reynolds funnelled millions
of dollars into her brother's company.

45
00:03:56,162 --> 00:04:01,205
That money was filtered into small accounts
that made small donations to her campaign,

46
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,830
setting her up to be
the leader of the Free World.

47
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:06,623
This doesn't end
with us stopping an execution.

48
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>For me it does.</i>

49
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:33,128
OK. Let's rotate.

50
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:35,879
Sergeant Sodomy, you're up next.

51
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,380
Yo.

52
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:43,547
- Come on.
- I don't know about y'all, but...

53
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,924
This room is getting
a little too dark for me to dig.

54
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:54,926
Are you telling me that there's a hole
in Fox River that you don't want to get into?

55
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,593
Hey. No one gets hurt.

56
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:02,052
Hey, you know, I got a question.

57
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,261
Now, how come Fusilli over here
ain't grabbing a shovel?

58
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,428
I handle arrangements on the outside.

59
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:10,012
Really? What is that?
Transport, paper, what?

60
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,222
Exactly. Makes me manager.

61
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:17,390
- And that makes us just labour, right?
- Mm-hm. Now you're getting it.

62
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:22,807
You know, management better keep
a close eye on the conditions up in here.

63
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,974
Or the labour's liable to go on strike.

64
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,975
- Get back to work.
- Whoa, CO coming.

65
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,476
<i>Hurry, you guys.</i>

66
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,936
Come on, cover it up.

67
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:43,104
Put that back up there.

68
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:48,188
Scofield. Move it.

69
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,522
It's time for your conjugal.

70
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,606
Your wife is here.

71
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:02,021


72
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:38,277
So you're Mrs Scofield?

73
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,944
Ever done this before?

74
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:43,278
Had a conjugal, I mean.

75
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,444
<i>No.</i>

76
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:48,988
Don't worry,
I'm just trying to make conversation.

77
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:52,780
Clear.

78
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:59,240
She look familiar to you?

79
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,407
No, Captain.

80
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:06,491
I know her from somewhere.

81
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:13,493
You came.

82
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,743
Of course.

83
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:20,661
- How've you been?
- Fine. I found ajob.

84
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:23,037
Good. I'm glad.

85
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,579
Is it awful, being here?

86
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:32,706
Remember the first place you stayed?
That hotel, by the airport?

87
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,206
Only difference is $69 and the free shampoo.

88
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,332
Always the brave face.

89
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,250
You're still wearing it.

90
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,834
Every day.

91
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,876
I worry about you.

92
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,710
Don't.

93
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:53,044
Is there anything else that I can do?

94
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:56,211
Just what we agreed on.

95
00:07:56,294 --> 00:08:00,295
I was so nervous when they were checking.

96
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,963
One question.

97
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:06,505
Why would you need a credit card in prison?

98
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:10,923
The riot didn't change anything.
Have you seen the budget cuts?

99
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:14,382
- Another 10% from healthcare.
- And 35 from prevention.

100
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:16,633
He's the governor, but also your father.

101
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:21,551
Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough,
they can't afford you.

102
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,802
<i>Thank you.</i>

103
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:37,138
You understand this is standard procedure
following a conjugal, right?

104
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,304
Never can be too careful.

105
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,680
All right. Bend over.

106
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:47,140
You have a good time
in the romper room with that Euro?

107
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,807
Whatever you say, boss.

108
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,307
- She come around here before?
- First time.

109
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:57,684
You sure? Cos damn
if I don't recognise her from somewhere.

110
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:02,144
Maybe she visits some other con.
Killing two birds with one bone.

111
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:05,727
- Catching my drift?
- I wouldn't know.

112
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,061
All right. He's clear, Captain.

113
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:14,438
Make sure you take a shower, Scofield. You
never know what some women can give you.

You know, your parents
must be so proud of you, man.

122
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:45,903
Hitting the trailer park trifecta.

123
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:50,405
You're a racist, a paedophile, and stupid.

124
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:56,823
You know, it vexes me that I'm made out
to be the bad guy in the room.

125
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:59,782
Y'all ain't here
for stealing Girl Scout cookies.

126
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,950
None of us murdered
any Girl Scouts in the process.

127
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,242
Michael's coming back from the boneyard.

128
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,909
Alone, alone.

129
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,661
I tell you all about me,
you don't tell me you're married?

130
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:19,370
Later.

131
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,538
<i>Rough day, huh, Scofield?</i>

132
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:27,163
While the rest of us
are in here slinging concrete,

133
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:31,956
you got some little girl in
to play on your rusty trombone, huh?

134
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,582
Man's got a point.
Itjust doesn't seem equitable, like.

135
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:41,166
<i>- Shut up and dig, T-Bag.
- What the idiots want to know is,</i>

136
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,710
while we're digging this hole,
what are you doing?

137
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:52,295
I'm going shopping.

138
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,461
<i>We're good.</i>

139
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:58,671
All clear.

140
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:05,089
Credit card? The bulls catch you with that,
they'll be so far up your doggy door...

141
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:09,007
Don't worry.
They won't be catching me with one.

142
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,674
- How you so sure?
- Because...

143
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,633
I don't have a credit card.

144
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:00,700
<i>- Nick?</i>

145
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,700
<i>Help! Please...</i>

146
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,826
<i>- Please, I had an accident, my car is totalled.</i>

147
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:11,910
Is there anybody there?

148
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:14,911
- We can'tjust ignore him.
- The hell we can't.

149
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,537
<i>Help me. Please!</i>

150
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:21,204
Help me, please.

151
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:22,496
Ow! God!

152
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,957
<i>- What happened?
- I must've dozed off.</i>

153
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,291
I've been driving for 12 hours.

154
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:37,958
- Should I get some water from the well?
- No, the well's dried up.

155
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,834
I think there's a medical kit over here.

156
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,502
No one's going anywhere.

157
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:13,842
<i>- All right. Say goodbye to Junior.</i>

158
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:30,304
You know how many pints of blood
the human body has?

159
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:33,929
The answer is ten. Ten pints.

160
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:38,514
How many you think Prince Charming
over there on the floor has left?

161
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:41,015
Eight, going on seven?

162
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,641
I'm gonna take him out to the woodshed,
have a little talk.

163
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:49,434
In the meantime,
I want you to chew on this.

164
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:55,059
You tell me everything about the Burrows
case, and who else you've told about it,

165
00:14:55,143 --> 00:15:01,686
and there's a chance that I might let you go
in time to get Mr Savrinn to a doctor.

166
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:06,812
You decide whose life is more valuable.

167
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:12,689
The guy waiting to die on death row, or the
guy wishing he'd die out in the woodshed.

168
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:28,359
<i>One suit, black.</i>

169
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:32,985
<i>One pair of socks, black.</i>

170
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:37,111
<i>One pair of shoes. Shoelaces.</i>

171
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:42,571
<i>One small tape recorder.</i>

172
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,031
<i>One gold watch.</i>

173
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:12,037
You ever stayed at a fancy hotel, LJ?

174
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,746
You leave your room in the morning,
it's a mess.

175
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:19,955
Wet dirty towels on the bathroom floor, last
night's room service stinking to high heaven.

176
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:25,247
Then, you come back at night, it's all gone.

177
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:27,832
Fresh towels, sheets,
candy on the pillow.

178
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:31,041
It's just the best feeling in the whole world.

179
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:36,542
Cos someone else cleaned up your mess.
All you had to do was walk away.

180
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,668
- Don't you hurt them.
- OK.

181
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,419
But you gotta tell me exactly what they know
and who else they've told,

182
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:48,003
and nobody has to die tonight.

183
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:53,087
You just walk away.
Let me clean up your mess.

184
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:57,505
I don't know what's going on.
I swear to God.

185
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,797
Well, I wish I could believe that.

186
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:10,675
- Bellick assigned me a new cellmate.
- Who'd you get?

187
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,635
Some new fish.
Ran a bump and swipe on an off-duty cop.

188
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,718
Fast hands, faster mouth.

189
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,802
- Yo, what's cracking, my peoples?
- Speak of the devil.

190
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:24,386
- Michael Scofield, David Apolskis.
- S'up?

191
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,096
I seen you before, right?
You're part of that PI crew.

192
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:33,264
Maybe you can hook me up. Brother needs to
make some green, some cashish, you know?

193
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:38,223
- The pay is 19 cents an hour.
- 19 cents? That's slavery, yo.

194
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:43,350
That's prison, yo.
And besides, PI's all full up for now.

195
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:46,975
All right. I feel you.

196
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,226
But keep a brother in mind,
if something opens up, yo.

197
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:55,394
Hell, I'll pay 19 cents an hour
to get me some more time out of the block.

198
00:17:55,478 --> 00:18:00,853
Like having another kid.
Already raised one. I'm too old to do it again.

199
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:03,854
You ever hear of anything
being stolen from R&D?

200
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:07,438
Of course.
Bulls steal from personals all the time.

201
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:11,606
Problem is, you never know what's gone
until you're outside of the walls.

202
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:16,316
- At that point, you can't do anything about it.
- What if you knew now?

203
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:20,900
Look, I told you. Leave me out
of whatever it is you've got going.

204
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:24,525
I just need to know
if you've seen a guard with a gold watch.

205
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,902
There's a lot of people
can get you a gold watch in here.

206
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:31,986
<i>- Yeah, but I need this specific gold watch.
- Westmoreland.</i>

207
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,653
Pope wants to see you. Let's go.

208
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:39,821
Look, I haven't seen nothing.

209
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:45,281
But there is this one CO.
Word is he's the worst thief in here.

210
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:51,324
My wife faxed this over
from County Records.

211
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:55,408
Copy of Scofield's marriage licence.
She says you owe her, big time.

212
00:18:55,492 --> 00:18:58,950
Looks legit. He wasn't trying
to sneak in some whore for a conjugal.

213
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:02,618
Says here they got married
the day before Scofield robbed that bank.

214
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,911
Why the hell would he do that?

215
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:15,205
- Heard from Veronica?
- No.

216
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:20,331
<i>Just a note from LJ
saying he was with her, he's safe.</i>

217
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:25,957
But it's been a while.
Doesn't feel right. Feels wrong.

218
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,458
- I gotta go.
- Really wrong.

219
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,083
<i>I'll see you.</i>

220
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:42,252
<i>I, uh... I've come to a realisation.</i>

221
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:45,504
Either Ms Donovan and that boy
don't like you very much,

222
00:19:45,587 --> 00:19:50,546
or they have an unreasonable amount of faith
in your cardiovascular system.

223
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,880
So tell me, Nick.

224
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:57,672
This all you got? This paper trail
of an indictment that never even happened?

225
00:19:57,756 --> 00:19:59,173
Is this it?

226
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:03,758
We know you don't have a surveillance tape
any more, you have nobody to testify.

227
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,758
So is this really all you've got?

228
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:12,802
Mr Savrinn, that bullet
went through your teres major,

229
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:17,886
ripped the lateral margin of your scapula,
leaving you no medial rotation of your arm.

230
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:21,178
So if you try to swing
that piece of lumber at me...

231
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,845
Argh!

232
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:27,930
It's gonna feel like
your arm is ripping out of its socket.

233
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:32,306
Come on, Nick. Mr Project Justice.

234
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:35,265
We both know why
you're really here, don't we?

235
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:39,058
And it ain't to save Lincoln Burrows' life.

236
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:45,267
<i>All prisoners, 15 minutes of walk time.</i>

237
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:49,727
 Inside these walls, I creep and
I crawl, looking for a way out ?

238
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:52,144
♪ But I know there's
gonna be no easy route ♪

239
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:55,686
♪ This is gonna be a 12-round...
12-round bout ♪

240
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:59,479
♪ Bellick and T-Bag on my mind ♪

241
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,063
♪ This grind in here... ♪

242
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:06,189
You still interested in getting in on PI?

243
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:09,023
- Does my momma got big breastices?
- I wouldn't know.

244
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:12,315
Hell, yeah, she does. And hell, yeah, I do.

245
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:17,691
All right, look. I need a favour. Word is
you made your trade as a snatch and grab.

246
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:18,733
That's right.

247
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:22,235
I need you to steal something back
that was stolen from me.

248
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:24,735
- What kind of something?
- Just a watch.

249
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:27,944
Uh-uh. There ain't no such thing
as just a watch.

250
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:31,778
Every design has a different clasp,
every clasp has a different swipe.

251
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:36,404
It's Italian. A Remedi.
Gold band, pearl face, all-weather.

252
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:38,279
- What year?
- 2003.

253
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,864
- That's a butterfly clasp on that bitch.
- Which means what?

254
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:47,949
Hidden deployment. There ain't no way
to snatch it without the mark feeling it.

255
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:53,991
Which just means I'm gonna
have to get whimsical on this ficky.

256
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:59,284
I get you this watch,
that means I get in on some PI?

257
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:02,410
It means I'll think about it. No promises.

258
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:05,578
Why you need this watch so bad, anyway?

259
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:09,371
Let's just say it means a lot
to someone in my family.

260
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,958
Come in, Charles. Sit down.

261
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:34,626
What's going on?

262
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:40,127
I've got some bad news, Charles.

263
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,087
Your daughter is very sick.

264
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,587
She's got oesophageal cancer.

265
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:49,505
Now, she's at Sacred Heart, in Indianapolis,

266
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:53,589
and she wants to see you
while there's still time.

267
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,465
How much time?

268
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,715
Doctors say a few weeks.

269
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,383
The problem is, the DOC isn't gonna
let you go. They think you're still a flight risk.

270
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:06,300
- She's my only child.
- I know that.

271
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,885
Believe me, Charles,
I've lobbied on your behalf.

272
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:12,635
It's state policy.

273
00:23:12,718 --> 00:23:16,719
They will only extend furloughs
in the case of funerals.

274
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:25,347
You're telling me I have to wait
until she dies before I see her?

275
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:38,475
Mr Scofield. Looks like
I'll be administering your shot today.

276
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,725
- Where's Dr Tancredi?
- We've got a busy schedule today.

277
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,226
<i>- She's with another patient.</i>

278
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:47,102
<i>Hold his legs! Hold his legs down!</i>

279
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:50,061
- Hey, we need a doctor here!
- What happened?

280
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:54,561
The kid was in chow, all of a sudden
he collapsed and started spitting up his food.

281
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:57,229
Looks like some kind of seizure.
Get him up here.

282
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,896
Get him up here,
make sure he doesn't hurt himself.

283
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,772
I'll need O2 and cardio from you.

284
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:09,649
Hold him. Hold him!

285
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:36,988
So, Ms Donovan.

286
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:41,365
How is that background in real estate law
going for you? Is it a big help?

287
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:42,490
Hm?

288
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:46,032
Well, frankly I think we caught a break.

289
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,533
If Lincoln had nailed a girl with half a brain,

290
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:52,617
she probably would have
brought this whole thing down already.

291
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,660
But you know what the worst part is?

292
00:24:56,743 --> 00:25:01,577
You dragged these people into this knowing
that you had no clue how to get them out.

293
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:06,079
I mean, if you had just minded your own
business, people like Leticia Barris,

294
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:08,746
she wouldn't have
a mouthful of maggots now.

295
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,497
Your fiancé would not
be lying in his apartment

296
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,164
waiting for the smell of his rotting corpse
to let the neighbours know

297
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,706
that something had gone horribly wrong.

298
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,957
That's right. Their deaths are on your head.

299
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,333
You made this mess. Nobody else. You.

300
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:30,960
But you are also the one person
that can end it all right here.

301
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:34,544
All I need to know
is who else you've involved.

302
00:25:34,627 --> 00:25:39,003
So you just nod,
and I'll know you're ready to talk.

303
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:46,046
Whew.

304
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:53,756
You know, Ms Donovan,
I think that you look a little cold.

305
00:25:54,507 --> 00:26:00,174
Maybe you'll find it easier to talk
after you've warmed up a little...

306
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,020
Where is he? What happened?

307
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:13,395
We gotta move.
Come on, we don't have time. Come on.

308
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,229
Come on. We're getting out of here.

309
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,188
- Where are the keys?
- Pocket. Left.

310
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:24,897
- Start the car.
- Is he gonna be all right?

311
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:28,607
Go start the car, LJ.
Come on. We're gonna get you to a hospital.

312
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:36,734
Come on!

313
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:02,574
A gift from my cellmate.

314
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:05,366
Thank you. And thank him.

315
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,158
The watch. What's it for, anyway?

316
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,658
Thought you didn't want to know about this.

317
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:13,826
Things have changed. I want in.

318
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:17,994
- Why the sudden change of heart?
- I have my reasons.

319
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:23,995
Don't take this the wrong way, but everyone
who's in is bringing something to the table.

320
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,204
- How about money?
- How much?

321
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,871
I think you know.

322
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:31,788
I remember several conversations
that ended with "I am not DB Cooper".

323
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:33,414
- I lied.
- You lied.

324
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:35,914
We're cons. We tend to do that.

325
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:38,082
I checked your alibi.

326
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:42,624
<i>According to records, you were incarcerated
at the time of the Cooper hijacking.</i>

327
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:47,751
My father and I share more
than just a weakness for easy money.

328
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,418
We also share a name.

329
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:54,586
Charles Westmoreland Senior
was the one locked up that day.

330
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:59,295
- Now, do you want the money or not?
- No offence, but it's a little convenient.

331
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:03,463
You want in, and suddenly you're the guy.
How do I know you're not lying now?

332
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:06,088
<i>Hey, Old Man River. Keep it moving.</i>

333
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,389
Hey, Sucre.

334
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:50,223
I got a question about you
and the rest of the Mexicans.

335
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:54,058
I don't think I'll be able to help.
Seeing as I'm Puerto Rican.

336
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:59,101
Geographical semantics, amigo. I'm speaking
about the general Latino population.

337
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:03,268
How is it that a people so historically lazy

338
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:07,061
ended up being such a big part
of the nation's workforce?

339
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:11,270
The way I see things,
it's everyone else that's lazy.

340
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:14,229
Otherwise, there wouldn't be jobs
for the immigrants.

341
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:18,814
The ones sitting at home,
collecting unemployment, the lazy ones...

342
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:21,565
it's not us.

343
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:25,899
You gonna let him talk
about your people like that?

344
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,232
Whatever, Deliverance.

345
00:29:29,275 --> 00:29:33,650
You know what? We may be a team in here,
butjust so that you know:

346
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:37,902
The minute we get over that wall,
it's every man for himself.

347
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,777
Or sooner.

348
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,697
LJ?

349
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:59,240
LJ?

350
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,240
<i>LJ?</i>

351
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:10,618
You know how the Russians do things?

352
00:30:10,701 --> 00:30:18,119
They let you live, and they kill everyone else
in your family and anyone you've ever loved.

353
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,995
- How's that sound?
- Go to hell.

354
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:23,996
Oh, come on.
Is that any way for a lady to talk?

355
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:34,956
What, you think I'm an idiot?
I'm just gonna walk into a well?

356
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,999
Seriously, Ms Donovan...

357
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,960
You all right?

358
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:00,212
<i>Attention, inmates. Weight pile
is out of bounds until further notice.</i>

359
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:03,796
<i>Weight pile is out of bounds
until further notice.</i>

360
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:40,889
Scofield! No sitting down on the job. I want
you out here working where I can see you.

361
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:43,264
I'm on it, boss.

362
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,641
Move it, Scofield, move it!

363
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:57,865
- Hey, Brad. Good to see you.
- Hey, baby.

364
00:32:57,948 --> 00:33:01,824
<i>All right, put your hands
together for our next lovely young lady.</i>

365
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:04,825
<i>Up on the main stage it's Jasmine.</i>

366
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:33,340
Would you like a private dance?

367
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:39,134
Why don't you sit down and chat for a while?
See if we hit it off?

368
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,092
So, what's your name?

369
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,747
Brad. Yours?

370
00:33:43,831 --> 00:33:47,665
- Jasmine.
- Come on, your real name.

371
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:53,208
- It's Nika.
- Nika.

372
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:56,042
That's a pretty name.

373
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,251
Tell me, Nika...

374
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:02,001
How's your husband feel
about you working here?

375
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:04,002
I'm not married.

376
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:06,962
I hope you're lying for the sake of titillation.

377
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:13,296
Otherwise, your little visit to Fox River this
morning would have been breaking the law.

378
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:16,421
Mrs Scofield.

379
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:23,465
We are married, but they tell all the girls to lie.
It's better for making business.

380
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:26,758
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

381
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:31,008
I just want to know
a little more about your husband.

382
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,676
- Well, he's a very good man.
- I'm sure he is.

383
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:37,301
But even good men do bad things.

384
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:43,136
Your accent. You're from, don't tell me...

385
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,428
- Budapest, right?
- Prague.

386
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:49,846
Prague. How recently did you come over?

387
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,889
Only a couple months, I bet.
You like it here in America?

388
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:57,515
I have to move. They don't like us
to spend too much time in one spot.

389
00:34:57,598 --> 00:35:02,724
Now, I don't want to have to check into
your immigration status.

390
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:06,725
I just need to know
what Michael Scofield wanted from you

391
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:09,351
in exchange for the green card.

392
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:13,686
Nothing.
We met while he was studying overseas.

393
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:16,852
I don't want to know
what you memorised for the INS.

394
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:19,478
Now, you answer
my questions about Scofield,

395
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:22,563
or I call my guy in the Chicago PD.

396
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:26,355
And maybe he starts
asking some questions about you.

397
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:32,523
Credit card.

398
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:36,399
He asked me to bring him a credit card.
That's it.

399
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:03,281
Yeah. Trace this call.

400
00:36:03,364 --> 00:36:05,823
Come and get me now.

401
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:08,865
New Glarus. I'm in New Glarus.

402
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:27,661
No, thanks. I brought my own.

403
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:35,162
<i>Dorothy Andrews Elston Kabis.</i>

404
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:41,039
United States treasurer, 1971.
The year of the DB Cooper hijacking.

405
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:47,916
Dl192589.

406
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,251
The first number in the series of bills
used in the ransom drop.

407
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:59,085
<i>- Thanks for the history lesson.
- All it proves is you did the research.</i>

408
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:01,253
Same as me.

409
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:43,387
So you're married?

410
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,638
Uh, well...
Not in the traditional sense of the word.

411
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:51,931
Michael, we're both adults.
Put your cards on the table.

412
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:55,890
OK. I'll go first.

413
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:58,391
Um...

414
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:04,101
As one of the very few women around here,
I'm used to a certain amount...

415
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:08,726
of innuendo and flirtation
being thrown my way.

416
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:13,270
- I'm not used to enjoying it.
- Look, Sara...

417
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:17,520
It's Dr Tancredi.
And please let me finish.

418
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:22,896
I'm not ajealous woman.
But I'm a careful one.

419
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,981
And for some reason,
when I'm around you I'm not careful.

420
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:29,189
- You don't have to be.
- Yes, I do.

421
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:35,066
There's so many questions surrounding you,
Michael. There are way too many.

422
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,942
So here's the deal. Um...

423
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:43,651
From now on, your shots, medical concerns,
they're all fine, as long as it's doctorlpatient.

424
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:49,611
But personal questions and favours of any
kind are no longer a part of our relationship.

425
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,737
The questions you have about me...

426
00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:58,989
There are answers.

427
00:39:08,116 --> 00:39:09,699
Quinn.

428
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:12,908
Hey, I was getting worried.
You guys get lost?

429
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:16,701
We called you again to pinpoint your signal,
but you never picked up.

430
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,493
Battery went dead on the damn cellphone.

431
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:22,536
So, uh... How'd it go?

432
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:25,036
Well, I got a broken leg down here.

433
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,453
Listen, you know,
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

434
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:33,080
You got bosses, I got bosses, but at the end
of the day we're all on the same team.

435
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,497
Right? Just trying to tie up loose ends.

436
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:39,081
- I could not agree more.
- Yeah. So can you guys get a rope,

437
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:41,456
or a ladder, or something?

438
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,792
What the hell's that?

439
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:51,126
Hey, hey! Hey!

440
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:55,002
- Just tying up some loose ends.
- You son of a... Hey!

441
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:57,836
Don't do this. Don't do this!

442
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:02,753
<i>- Come on, please.
- My leg is broken. I can't stand.</i>

443
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,337
You can'tjust leave him down there.
He'll die.

444
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:09,297
He's the only one who knows
we don't have the Burrows kid.

445
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,172
<i>- The only one.
- I got a family!</i>

446
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:20,258
There's room for you down there too, Danny.

447
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:25,758
<i>- Don't leave me like this.
- Don't leave me. Please!</i>

448
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:27,926
Please!

449
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:36,886
Coming back to PI today?
It's getting kind of testy in there, you know.

450
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,053
<i>Yeah.</i>

451
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:43,305
I just needed to find something out.

452
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:46,014
- What the hell's that?
- Listen.

453
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:55,182
- Am I supposed to be hearing something?
- Shh.

454
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:57,474
Just hold on.

455
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:14,270
There.

456
00:41:14,353 --> 00:41:17,771
What? We sat around here
for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?

457
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:20,188
18 minutes, actually.

458
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,105
And yes.

459
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,815
- What was it?
- Keys.

460
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:28,107
The guards' keys.

461
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,316
18 minutes between each time

462
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:33,774
the guards pass the infirmary windows
on their rounds at night.

463
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,817
Cons aren't allowed out after hours.
Only way I could find out the timing.

464
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,901
- What does that mean?
- It means...

465
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:44,444
Four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

466
00:41:44,527 --> 00:41:47,403
we'll have 18 minutes
to get the bars off the window

467
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:51,237
and for all seven of us
to get across the wire and over the wall.

468
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:53,821
- Is that doable?
- Of course.

469
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:11,492
- What's up?
- Nothing.

470
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:14,325
<i>- Hey, I know that look. What's up?</i>

471
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:17,160
I hit it. I hit it!

472
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,703
<i>The pipe!</i>

473
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:24,412
<i>Guys, guys.</i>

474
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:26,412
All right, all right.

475
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:33,289
- Come on, Michael. Talk to me.
- You want the good news or the bad news?

476
00:42:33,372 --> 00:42:36,664
- The good.
- Westmoreland and his money are in.

477
00:42:37,498 --> 00:42:40,249
- What's the bad?
- I've done the math.

478
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:44,833
It'll take at least five minutes for us to get
the bars off the window in the infirmary,

479
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,876
two minutes each
to get across the wire and over the wall.

480
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:50,626
- So?
- We've only got 18 minutes.

481
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,753
We've got too many people.

482
00:42:57,128 --> 00:43:00,211
One of 'em has to go.
