2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:05,769
Hey, John, you know,
actually about Jesus,

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,042
say hi to him for me, will you?

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,576
It's him.

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,819
- Did you see him?
- Who?

6
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:17,116
- The guy in the viewing room.
- No.

7
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,247
It was Dad.

8
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,053
- Where's your girl?
- She'll be at my place in about an hour.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,651
Pretty soon, we're gonna call in our favor.

10
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,027
Have at it.

11
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,030
Boss!

12
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:40,272
<i>The Department of Corrections
is allowing you a one-hour visit</i>

13
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:41,467
<i>with your son.</i>

14
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:45,103
<i>I'll make the travel arrangements,
but I don't want any problems.</i>

15
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,128
You know,

16
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:59,272
I used to have a Great Dane, big and loyal.

17
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:03,037
But when she was 12, she got cancer,
so we had to put her down.

18
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:07,275
And you'd think it would be this
big, dramatic event, but,

19
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:10,479
it was very peaceful.

20
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:15,153
One minute she was breathing,
the next she wasn't.

21
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,722
Hey!

22
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:30,258
Everything okay? Need me to call 911?

23
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:31,699
No, no, I got it.

24
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:35,736
That engine's smoking pretty bad,
looks like it could go up any second.

25
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:38,331
We'll be okay, actually.

26
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,534
- You think?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:43,101
- All right, if you say so.
- Fine. I think it's going to be fine.

28
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:03,255
<i>Fernando Sucre
released from Ad Seg.</i>

29
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,398
Cuz!

30
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,203
You're out.

31
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:23,370
It's good to see you, buddy.

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,107
You all can sign each other's
yearbooks later. Where are we at?

33
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,810
The map is complete. I got what I needed.

34
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,613
- Then we're ready.
- Almost.

35
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,989
I know which pipes we need to take
beneath Psych Ward now.

36
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,753
Which means our way
to the Infirmary is clear.

37
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:43,857
With our new route, we're gonna come
up on the far end of that building.

38
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:44,987
Which means we gotta walk down

39
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:49,124
30 feet of hallway to get to
the doctor's office, our exit point.

40
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:53,401
<i>Which means there's only one piece left
to this whole thing.</i>

41
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,663
The key to that room.

44
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,077
It's not that easy.
Only the medical staff have those keys.

45
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,310
How're you fixing
on getting it then, pretty?

46
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,545
Carefully.

47
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:14,614
No more surprises this time, right?

48
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,248
Right.

49
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,019
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

50
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:48,681


51
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,155
- Hello, John.
- Michael.

52
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,126
How are you?

53
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:45,805
Any day above ground is a blessing.
Thanks be to God.

54
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,205
Do you mind? Please.

55
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,070
Thank you.

56
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:57,313
Lot of rumors going around.

57
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,042
Yeah.

58
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,013
I'm glad you're back.

59
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,881
I'm surprised you're still here.
I thought you'd be gone by now.

60
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,383
Well, we had a few setbacks.

61
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,721
Still planning on it?

62
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,366
That depends.

63
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,927
How does the idea of escaping
sit with the new you?

64
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:25,899
Oh, the old sinner
who was confined to these walls,

65
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,498
he's dead.

66
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:31,535
The new soul deserves to be free.

67
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:35,111
Well, the old sinner was gonna have
a jet ready for us.

68
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:38,049
Is the new soul gonna be able
to pull that off?

69
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:43,518
Noah had his Ark, did he not?

70
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:51,354
Let's pray.

71
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:01,226
I'm gonna need a blade.

72
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,197
Pronto.

73
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07,202
- Hit and run?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,770
- And Burrows is gone?
- That's right.

75
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,812
- The officers?
- Two are dead, one is in critical.

76
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:17,782
Do you realize what the media's gonna
say when they get ahold of this?

77
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:18,943
We'll get him back, sir.

78
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,886
40 years in corrections, and this is
how they're gonna remember me.

79
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,582
This is Kane County.
Sheriff Ballard's a good friend of mine.

80
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,920
- He hasn't said a word to anyone yet.
- Yeah, well...

81
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:29,359
Give us four, five hours, we'll find him.

82
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:32,191
If I don't report this
to the D.O.C. Right now...

83
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,095
They don't have to know.

84
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:41,569
You've always been
a by-the-book guy, boss,

85
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:44,436
but this time,
the book's gonna get us all fired.

86
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,134
Find him.

87
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:29,639
The records of every phone call
made to and from every contact

88
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:30,803
in Quinn's cell phone.

89
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:33,575
Well, we have our haystack.
Any idea what the needle might look like?

90
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:36,047
There must be thousands of calls here.

91
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,085
But to who? To where?

92
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:42,354
You know, it's gonna take us forever
to go through all of these.

93
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,891
And what if these have nothing to do
with Lincoln and Steadman, huh?

94
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,754
What if we're just burning time?

95
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,618
We're just that
much closer to the execution.

96
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,930
What's going on with you, Nick?
I mean, it's almost like you want to quit.

97
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,391
I don't want to quit.

98
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:00,894
Then let's get to it.

99
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:08,476
Dr. Tancredi will be right in.

100
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:20,987
- Morning.
- Morning.

101
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,986
How're you feeling today?

102
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,758
- Better.
- Good.

103
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,689
We got checkpoints up at 171 by Lemont,

104
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,633
at Sage Bridge and at the river going
towards Romeoville.

105
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,335
According to our witness over there,
this new perp was driving an '06 Mustang,

106
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,100
black, dark blue, maybe.

107
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,502
We're not gonna be able
to sit on this thing very long, Brad.

108
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,636
This is me, Nate. I need this.

109
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:53,272
All right. You go back to Fox River.
I'll be in constant contact.

110
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:54,645
You mind if I...

111
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:06,627
How're you doing, Mr...

112
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,788
- Roy Hawkings.
- Hi.

113
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,899
Where are you going?

114
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:20,467
I'd like to get going if I could.
I'm late for a meeting in Aurora.

115
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:23,473
- Where you coming from?
- Chicago.

116
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:26,544
Kind of an indirect route to get to Aurora.

117
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:28,706
I'm not from around here.

118
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:35,110
2006 Mustang, black. No ID on the plates.

119
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:42,318
If any of you get so much as a whiff
of anything,

120
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,585
I want to know about it immediately.

121
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,926
Makes two of us, pal.

122
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,867
What do you want from me, Michael?

123
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,172
Sara...

124
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:04,751
I need you to do something for me.

125
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:08,352
What?

126
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,696
Wait for me.

127
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,439
It won't always be like this.

128
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,210
In this room, in this place.

129
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,043
Until then, I can't.

130
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,015
We can't.

131
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:43,583
Damn it.

132
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:46,185
I can't.

133
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:51,029
And I gotta go.

134
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:07,836
<i>Doors closing!</i>

135
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,049
Hey, squirt.

136
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:15,743
Avocado.

137
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:21,914
How many times I gotta say it?
You address me formal-like.

138
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,716
- Mr. Balls-Johnson.
- That's better.

139
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:28,964
I think maybe you and I
can work something out.

140
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:31,931
- Really?
- Check it, I got this homie on the outside

141
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:35,560
and he can put a hundie into your
commissary account each month.

142
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,765
It was nice of you to think of me like that,

143
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,966
but you only got one thing I need.

144
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,831
I need you to get something for me.
Do your bump and swipe thing.

145
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,299
- Like I did with the watch?
- Exactly.

146
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:18,268
Yeah, that did me a lot of good.

147
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:20,873
Guards found out and they stuck me into
a cell with Avocado.

148
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:23,035
Guards found out and they stuck me into
a cell with Avocado.

149
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,204
So if you want something glommed,

150
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,305
you need to do something for me.

151
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,747
Kill that son of a bitch.

152
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:45,027
That's not something I can do.

153
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,230
Screw Honus Wagner.

154
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,362
What was that?

155
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,259
This kid in my neighborhood,

156
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,772
his dad had a baseball card collection.

157
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:04,667
So I figured, you know, I'd swipe it.

158
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,742
I could get some party cash, you know?

159
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:12,484
And there was one card in there.

160
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,017
A 1910 Honus Wagner.

161
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,022
Doesn't mean nothing to me, you know.
Hoops is my sport.

162
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,893
This card, it was worth $300,000.

163
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,660
So they slapped me with grand larceny.

164
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,006
That's why I'm here.

165
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,334
That's why I'm sitting on a nickel
getting turned out like a little bitch.

166
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,748
A baseball card.

167
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,008
Dad?

168
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,783
What are you doing here?

169
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:46,091
As soon as I heard they granted you
a visit with your son,

170
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,221
I knew they'd make a move on you.

171
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,299
I mean what are you doing here?

172
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:53,931
I've got a car about 20 miles from here.

173
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:56,526
We'll switch out. After that,

174
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:59,366
gonna make sure you disappear.

175
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:05,876
Then this business will just be
between me and them.

176
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,004
Can you move?

177
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:10,105
What are you talking about?
They're after me, not you.

178
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,841
It's not as simple as that, trust me.

179
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,846
I worked for them.

180
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:19,822
You worked for them?
You're an alcoholic...

181
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:23,052
Is that what you remember
or is that what you were told?

182
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:27,159
Why'd you leave?

183
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:31,564
I took a position with a group
of multinationals we call The Company.

184
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:34,601
They call every shot this country takes,

185
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,533
what laws to pass, what judges
to appoint, what wars to fight.

186
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,407
Thing is, if you wanted to rise in the ranks
like I did,

187
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:46,412
you had to commit to leaving
everything you know behind.

188
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:49,608
Because then you start to get access
to the real information.

189
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:53,879
Information people would do
a lot of things to get their hands on,

190
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:57,680
- like harm your family.
- You expect me to believe that?

191
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:01,593
Why didn't you reach out to us?

192
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,457
Why didn't you call us?

193
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,792
I regretted it every day,
but I didn't have a choice.

194
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:09,994
Lincoln, the day I left The Company,

195
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:15,996
I took all that information with me.
That's why they're doing this to you.

196
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,902
All of it, to stop me.

197
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:21,877
You have to trust me.

198
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,367
You have to trust me.

199
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,945
<i>Then you'll have to tell me
what's going on.</i>

200
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:28,605
<i>I can't do that.</i>

201
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:31,010
Then I can't help.

202
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:36,019
Look, I did what you ask. Green card
for credit card, that was the deal.

203
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:38,521
Then, we'll make a new deal.

204
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:41,115
<i>- Michael, if somebody find out...
- Believe me,</i>

205
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:44,127
<i>- I'll be in more trouble than you will.
- I know,</i>

206
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,164
and this is why I won't help you.

207
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:49,995
Look, Nika, I promise you...

208
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:53,558
Look, I don't know what's going on.
I don't know why you're in there,

209
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,264
but if there's one thing those guys
that brought me here taught me,

210
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:02,003
is that if you fight, if you struggle,
you only make things worse.

211
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:04,606
Stop fighting, Michael.

212
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:10,147
- Just think about it, okay?
- I'm sorry.

213
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,622
There it is again, the 406 number.
It's on every listing.

214
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,727
406.

215
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:29,891
Yeah, there's

216
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,199
over 200 businesses, another 100
residences in 17 different countries.

217
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,705
- And they're all calling the same number.
- 406.

218
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:37,898
Montana.

219
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:41,734
- Can you check the prefixes?
- This doesn't make sense.

220
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,369
All these people from all over the
world are calling this place

221
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,345
in the middle of nowhere with a
population of 42.

222
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,176
Blackfoot, Montana.

223
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,799
I thought you understood, Terrence.

224
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:12,665
If you wanna talk, we set up a meeting,
at home, in person.

225
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,035
I saw the latest tracking.
Your polls are headed south.

226
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,574
<i>Maybe the Burrows thing is finally starting</i>

227
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,543
to gain some traction with the swings.
It could hurt.

228
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:25,011
- Goodbye, Terrence.
- You said it was almost over.

229
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,444
It is.

230
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:29,312
Are we talking about Lincoln Burrows

231
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:31,982
or your candidacy?

232
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:35,613
The only reason that you are still alive

233
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:39,625
<i>- is because I won't let them kill you.
- Yeah.</i>

234
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:45,221
I'm pretty clear on that.
But the thing I can't quite figure is,

235
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:48,357
with the crap storm this thing's become,

236
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,730
why they haven't killed you.

237
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:41,133
Figure out how you're gonna
get the key to the Infirmary yet?

238
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:43,572
Not quite.

239
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:46,541
You working a game on her, or what?

240
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,816
I don't know.

241
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:56,819
Hey man! Get out of my way!

242
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:02,420
I've had time to think.

243
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:06,432
Not that you tried to kill me,

244
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,899
but about how Jesus saved me.

245
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:18,105
I didn't come here, Theodore,
to inflict any more pain.

246
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,442
Take my hand

247
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:26,011
so we can put this behind us. Please.

248
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,452
Show me the palm of your other hand.

249
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,489
Don't insult me. After all that you've done,

250
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:48,490
the least I ask is that you don't insult me.

251
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:13,314
Does not a warm hand

252
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:17,224
feel better than a cold shank?

253
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,922
You got a point there, John. Yeah.

254
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:29,393
Truce?

255
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:32,829
You got it. Truce.

256
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:51,919
Son of a bitch.
It's been two and a half hours

257
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,012
and you're telling me that
sheriff has got nothing?

258
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,749
I'm telling you the roads are blocked off.

259
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:58,725
That Mustang's got to be somewhere
within those 10 square miles.

260
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:02,422
All right, listen,
you got two hours to find him.

261
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:04,862
After that, I have got to talk to the press.

262
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,399
Hey, but there's an escaped killer
outside our walls

263
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:09,936
and there are some things
that are more important than career.

264
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:11,367
Now you find him!

265
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,238
Hey, Captain.

266
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:18,541
I don't have time.

267
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:21,810
He says he really needs to talk.

268
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:23,881
You have something for me
or do you need something?

269
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:26,074
'Cause if it's the latter,
you just wasted my time.

270
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:28,652
That cellie you stuck me with, Avocado...

271
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:32,051
Do you have something or do you need
something? Last time I'm gonna ask.

272
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:35,352
I'm asking you
to just, please, get me out of that cell.

273
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,187
Boss, please. Boss!

274
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,889
Let's go.

275
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,441
You need to start relaxing.
It'll hurt a lot less.

276
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:01,308
- Can we go on your bunk?
- Sure, squirt.

277
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:06,249
Let me make it
a wee bit more comfortable.

278
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:17,191
Now we're talking.

279
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:34,729
- Are you the doctor from the prison?
- Yeah. Can, I...

280
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:37,435
Do you know a prisoner
named Michael Scofield?

281
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:39,435
I do.

282
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:45,044
- You're his wife, right?
- I need to talk to you.

283
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,684
I think Michael has got himself
in some trouble.

284
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:51,687
And I think he's planning on doing
something dangerous to get out of it.

285
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:01,651
Thanks.

286
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,693
- So what is it that you...
- Michael has a deep need to help people.

287
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,594
So I've come to understand.

288
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,130
That's actually how we met.

289
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,001
There were these men
that brought me here.

290
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:18,898
Told me I'd have good job,
but that was just a lie.

291
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:21,239
They were going to sell me.

292
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:23,872
And until they did, I...

293
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:28,642
Michael paid them off for my freedom.

294
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,776
And not to keep me for himself,
like I've heard from other girls,

295
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:35,014
but to give me an opportunity.

296
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:39,422
He's a good man.

297
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:41,486
Yes, he is.

298
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:46,897
Nika, I wanna do
whatever I can to help Michael.

299
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:51,233
To do that, I need you to tell me
what it is you think he's mixed up in.

300
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:55,730
- I think this is a mistake.
- No, no, it's not at all.

301
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,569
- Lf you can just tell me what it is...
- Please, just keep an eye on him.

302
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:01,701
God, I'm sorry. Thanks.

303
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,972
Listen, could I just have a contact number
for you in case I see something wrong.

304
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,275
I don't think that's a good idea.
Please don't tell him that we met.

305
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:08,372
I... I...

306
00:27:17,624 --> 00:27:19,149
Something I don't get.

307
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:21,525
How could killing me stop you?

308
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:26,459
'Cause I'm the one who leaked
the information about Ecofield.

309
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:30,193
They could've covered up the scandal
a thousand different ways,

310
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:33,066
but they chose to fake
Terrence Steadman's death.

311
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:38,509
And they chose you
'cause they knew it would flush me out.

312
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,901
They knew that any man with a son
on death row who was innocent

313
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,042
would have to come forward.

314
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,311
But you didn't.

315
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:51,309
We had a cause, Linc.

316
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,354
We have a cause.

317
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,783
Their wars can be averted

318
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,260
and millions of lives can be saved.

319
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:04,125
So you were willing to sacrifice one.

320
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:07,423
Yeah.

321
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,702
At least I thought.

322
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,305
But I couldn't watch you die.

323
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:20,470
You know what you've done?

324
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:23,680
The mother of my child is dead.

325
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:26,211
- I know.
- Do you?

326
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:30,876
Then I'm guessing you know
Michael's in Fox River

327
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:34,079
- and LJ's rotting in some jail.
- I know all of it.

328
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,716
- Lf you think for a second...
- You don't have a choice right now.

329
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,190
This is all on you. All of it.

330
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:46,620
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here.

331
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:50,401
'Cause there's still a chance
we can make it right.

332
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:25,690
That man in there
is our transportation out of here,

333
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,098
which means that, you go after him,

334
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,096
and that messes with my chances
of me seeing my family.

335
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:34,263
So I ain't gonna let that happen.

336
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,574
So why don't you just hand me
that shank you're holding, huh?

337
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,806
Good.

338
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,994
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey, Rick.

339
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:06,661
You all right?

340
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:09,432
Yeah. I can't find my keys.
Would you let me in?

341
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:10,595
Oh, sure.

342
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:21,071
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- That makes both of us.

343
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,005
Look.

344
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:29,580
You were right and I'm sorry.

345
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,985
I should never have gotten you
involved in this.

346
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:34,021
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

347
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:36,390
If anyone knew what I asked...

348
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,930
I'm not even sure why I did it.

349
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:46,123
Thank you.

350
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,232
Now we're even.

351
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,302
- You didn't owe me anything.
- Yes, I did.

352
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:56,568
I owed you everything,
but that's over now.

353
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:00,438
Goodbye.

354
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:07,485
The lady doctor, she cares for you.

355
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,463
Bellick. It's the sheriff.
I think he's got something.

356
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:23,689
Go, for Bellick.

357
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,632
We just got a call from Steve
Schimek up at the junkyard.

358
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,635
<i>- Our Mustang is on the premises.
- He seen Burrows?</i>

359
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:32,638
<i>Yep, I got a couple of units
five, 10 minutes away, tops.</i>

360
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,502
Good, I'm right behind you.

361
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:39,573
Here. You ready to travel?

362
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:43,043
Place is gonna be crawling with cops.
You know that, right?

363
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:45,013
There's an unimproved road
down by the river.

364
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:47,880
There's a chance
they haven't blocked it off yet.

365
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:51,750
We got trouble.

366
00:31:54,758 --> 00:31:57,283
Come on. Through here.

367
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,884
Come on.

368
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,049
Hey!

369
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,130
Get out of here.

370
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:26,826
Go.

371
00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:29,863
Turn around.

372
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:40,370
Bellick!

373
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,907
Bellick, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

374
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:58,758
- All right on your knees!
- Right there! Right there!

375
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:01,390
On your knees! Hands up! Let's see them!

376
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,464
Take him down!

377
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,591
Get down! Get down!

378
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:11,131
You thought you'd go
for a little stroll, did you?

379
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:32,308
Did you hear about Avocado?

380
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,913
<i>Got his salchicha sliced.</i>

381
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:39,114
- How?
- Tweener.

382
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,982
But Avocado's saying
it got caught on the frame

383
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,612
while he was hopping
down off his bunk, yeah.

384
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,152
Why did he lie?

385
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:49,217
He doesn't want Tweener to go to
the SHU 'cause he can't get him in there.

386
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:53,729
All I have to say is, as soon as
Avocado gets out of the infirmary,

387
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,356
Tweener is a dead man.

388
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,225
How's that key coming?

389
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:01,632
What about your car?
You know, sometimes...

390
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:02,739
I just checked.

391
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:05,368
Your apartment?

392
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:09,536
No, 'cause I had them this morning.

393
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,876
Well, then, they gotta be here.

394
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:15,711
Just retrace your steps.
When did you first notice they were gone?

395
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,717
When I came back from lunch...

396
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,928
Hey, Kev, I need to take a look
at that visitation log.

397
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:56,040
Thanks.

398
00:35:58,587 --> 00:35:59,848
Michael?

399
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:03,446
I need to know where he is.

400
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,920
- Who?
- Fibonacci.

401
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:11,861
You see, my conversion requires
that I not only seek forgiveness,

402
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:15,831
but provide forgiveness,
even to my greatest transgressors.

403
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:19,129
Don't look at me like that,

404
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:23,003
like I'm the same old man I used to be.
I'm not.

405
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:25,768
Trust me,

406
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:29,972
I need to reach out to
Fibonacci, so we can heal.

407
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,411
That's a good story, but the answer is no.

408
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:37,745
I understand.

409
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:41,652
I'll be patient.

410
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:03,004
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, you're officially now on standby.</i>

411
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:07,103
And you'll have her there.
Do you understand?

412
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:12,143
- Yeah. I'll do my best.
- Hey, I said, do you understand?

413
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:20,316
<i>- Yeah. Loud and clear.
- Good.</i>

414
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:22,116
Goose Park airstrip.

415
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:25,316
<i>You can find it on a map. As soon as I call,</i>

416
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:28,258
you have that bitch there
ready and waiting.

417
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:39,330
Hey.

418
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:45,137
You still want me to swipe the thing
you were asking about?

419
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,337
'Cause I'm having
a going-out-of-business sale.

420
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:50,674
Why don't you get yourself to Ad Seg?

421
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:55,779
For that to happen, I'd have to admit
what I did to Avocado.

422
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:58,420
That'd get me what, 20 years?

423
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:01,382
I'm dead no matter what.

424
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,054
There may be another way out of here.

425
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:10,392
Yeah, in a body bag.

426
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,434
I need to know if I can trust you.

427
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,774
I'm as straight up as they come,
you know?

428
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:26,134
No, I mean really trust you.

429
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:37,253
- Hey.
- Hi.

430
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,990
- How are you?
- I'm fine. You?

431
00:38:48,095 --> 00:38:49,222
Fine.

432
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:53,563
Can I have your hand, please?

433
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,208
- Here they are.
- Here what are?

434
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,841
Your keys,
they were right over there by your inbox.

435
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,079
Well, you got a maintenance guy
waiting outside here,

436
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:17,085
says you wanted him to change the locks.
Want me to call him off?

437
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:23,656
No, send him in.

438
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:30,763
Is it okay if I...

439
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:35,093
Yeah. We're about done here.

440
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:44,936
Is there something wrong?

441
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:48,002
No.

442
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:54,516
Unless you want to talk about
what happened this morning.

443
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:58,452
I think I have a pretty good idea.
We're done here.

444
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:39,751
I want him under 24-hour surveillance.

445
00:40:40,424 --> 00:40:44,450
- He doesn't sneeze without my knowing it.
- What the hell for? What did I do?

446
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:48,423
Someone tried to kill me.

447
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:53,256
Finding you in a junkyard eight miles
from here makes me think different.

448
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:56,130
Who was your accomplice?

449
00:40:57,004 --> 00:41:00,939
- What accomplice?
- 24-hour surveillance.

450
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:36,425
Boss.

451
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:41,200
I heard Avocado
cut his hose on your bunk.

452
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:43,799
Must have been some serious gymnastics
going on.

453
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,638
I got something for you this time, Boss,

454
00:41:45,744 --> 00:41:48,304
but I want guaranteed protection
from Avocado,

455
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:51,143
- and I want time cut off my bid.
- Anything else?

456
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:54,980
Couple of big-canned whores
available to you 24/7?

457
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:57,383
Believe me, what I got is worth it.

458
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,582
So, are you gonna step up or what?

459
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:05,961
This is your last chance, Tweener.

460
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:09,429
You blow smoke again, they'll be
scraping you off the heel of my boot.

461
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:11,500
Scofield and his whole PI crew,

462
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:15,700
they're escaping.
