1
00:00:01,504 --> 00:00:06,604


2
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,903
That's it.

3
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,367
Can I just, you know,
look at it for a minute?

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,744
You're an artist, Sid.

5
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,458
You're telling me you're gonna walk
outta here and I'm never gonna see it again?

6
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,419
There's a good chance of that, yes.

7
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,006
Most guys, for the first one,
they start with something small.

8
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,009
"Mom", girlfriend's initials,
something like that.

9
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,470
Not you.

10
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,848
You get a full set of sleeves
all in a couple of months.

11
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,310
It takes guys a few years
to get the ink you got.

12
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,771
I don't have a few years.

13
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,108
Wish to hell I did.

14
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:05,542
- The vault. Open it.
- We can't. The branch manager's not here.

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,670
- Where is he?
- It's lunchtime. He's at White Castle.

16
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,881
- White Castle?
- A fast-food restaurant.

17
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,717
They serve those little square burgers.

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,886
I know what it is.

19
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,348
I'm not playing games. Open it.

20
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:26,313
Sir, you have half a million dollars cash
in your bag. Don't you think it'd be better if?

21
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,826
This is the police.
You are completely surrounded.

22
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,498
Put down your weapon.

23
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,460
Put down your weapons now!

24
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,301
Rarely in the case of armed robbery
do we hear a plea of no contest.

25
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,596
- Are you sure about this, Mr Scofield?
- I'm sure, Your Honour.

26
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,059
Your Honour, we'd like to recess if we could.
My client's a bit confused.

27
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,269
- I'm not.
- He is, Your Honour.

28
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:11,650
Perhaps you should heed her advice. Take
additional time to consider your response.

29
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,945
I've already done that, Your Honour.

30
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:25,538
I'll retire to my chambers to determine
sentencing. Court's recessed until 1:30.

31
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,210
- Hey, come on. Let's go.
- Uncle Mike?

32
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,631
I didn't want you to come.
Go home, LJ.

33
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,300
I didn't want you to see this.

34
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,394
- He won't take this well.
- Can you blame him? He's your nephew.

35
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,940
He's beginning to think anybody he attaches
himself to is gonna end up in prison.

36
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:56,236
And he's not the only one
who's starting to feel that way, Michael.

37
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,406
- Will you give us a minute?
- One minute.

38
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,283
Don't you understand?

39
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,036
You put the book in that woman's hand.
She'll lob it at you like a grenade.

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,580
Justice and punishment
are the same thing to her.

41
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,873
I know.

44
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,175
- And I know you didn't need the money.
- Veronica...

45
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,223
- Why won't you let me help you?
- You've been good to me my whole life.

46
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,935
But you gotta let me deal with this. OK?

47
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,815
Given your lack of prior criminal conduct,
I am inclined toward probation.

48
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:39,487
But the fact you discharged a weapon while
committing the crime suggests malice to me.

49
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:45,785
For that reason, I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison cell, Mr Scofield.

50
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:50,415
You've requested to be incarcerated
near your home here in Chicago.

51
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,167
I'm willing to honour that.

52
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,588
- The closest level one facility...
- Level one? That's maximum security.

53
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,008
I would ask counsel
to refrain from interrupting me.

54
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,804
As I was saying, the closest level one facility
would be Fox River State Penitentiary.

55
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,932
As for your sentence,
I'm setting it at five years.

56
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:13,062
You'll be eligible for parole in half that time.
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

57
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:30,872
<i>OK, people, step inside the door. Check
yourself for bugs. Keep the line moving.</i>

58
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,833
We ain't got all day to get this done.

59
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,169
No talking in line.

60
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,089
Keep that line moving.
Keep it moving. Next.

61
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,931
- Name and bank number.
- Scofield, Michael. 94941.

62
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,600
- You a religious man?
- Never thought about it.

63
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,437
Good, cos the Ten Commandments
don't mean piss in here. We got two only.

64
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,065
The first commandment is,
you got nothin' comin'.

65
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,652
- What's the second commandment?
- See commandment number one.

66
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,239
- Gotcha.
- You talking out the side of your neck?

67
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,159
- Come again?
- I said, are you bein' a smartass?

68
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:13,331
Just trying to fly low, avoid the radar, boss.
Do my time and get out.

69
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,294
- There isn't any flyin' under my radar.
- Good to know.

70
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,653
Can't a brother get some air conditioning
up here? It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth.

71
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:48,199
To hell with the AC, man.
Gimme the crack ho.

72
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,078
Come on!

73
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,752
Yo, fish. What you lookin' at?
You look kinda pretty to be up in here, man.

74
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,462
Fish!

75
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:08,136
I suggest you take a seat, fish.
Ain't nothing to do up in here but serve time.

76
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,054
Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you.

77
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,182
Argh!

78
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,156
Welcome to Prisneyland, fish.

79
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:35,747
<i>Attention, all prisoners...</i>

80
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,602
- You wanna talk about it?
- It's not worth talking about.

81
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,939
- If it's keeping you up it is.
- No, it's just...

82
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,776
It's nothing, you know.

83
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,696
- Michael's case.
- You did the best you could.

84
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,531
But he didn't.

85
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:16,704
He just rolled over, he didn't put up a fight.
It's not like him. I...

86
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,462
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about him.
- Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind.

87
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,631
Good night.

88
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:40,728
<i>- All lanes, start coming out.
- All lanes, start coming out.</i>

89
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:48,069
Trey Street Deuces got the hoops,
Norteños got the bleachers,

90
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,947
Woods got the weight pile.

91
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,577
The COs got the rest. I tell you, the guards
have the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

92
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,164
The only difference between us and them
is the badge.

93
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,251
- Who's the pet lover?
- He'll deny it, but he's DB Cooper.

94
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,296
Parachuted out of a plane 30 years ago
with a million and a half in cash.

95
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,966
- Doesn't look like the type.
- Who does?

96
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,760
Hey! Whaddup, Wholesale? You OK?

97
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,514
Gonna be greater later.
What you doin' with this fish, man?

98
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:21,185
He's my new cellie. Wholesale's
got it wired up at the commissary.

99
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,187
Anything you want, he can get it.

100
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,982
You keep handin' out my jacket,
I'll bust your grape.

101
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:32,947
You couldn't bust a grape in Napa with a set
of cleats on. What are you talkin' about?

102
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,851
I'm looking for someone.

103
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,147
- Guy named Lincoln Burrows.
- Linc the Sink?

104
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,482
- That what they're calling him now?
- Yeah.

105
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,445
As in, he'll come at you
with everything but the kitchen, snowflake.

106
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,238
Where can I find him?

107
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:18,993
Man killed the VP's brother.
In a month he's getting the chair.

108
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:23,331
Which means no one here's more dangerous
than him, cos he's got nothing to lose now.

109
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:27,001
- What are they gonna do, kill him twice?
- Any way I can get to him?

110
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,087
The only time those boys get out
is for chapel and PI.

111
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,299
- PI? What's that?
- Prison industry.

112
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:39,597
The guys that get along get to work - painting,
scrubbing, making mattresses, you name it.

113
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,392
I wouldn't get excited if I were you, fish.
You ain't sniffin' none of PI.

114
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,188
- Why's that?
- Cos John Abruzzi runs it.

115
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,108
- "John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi?
- "John Abruzzi" John Abruzzi.

116
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,029
Why do you want to see Burrows
so bad, anyhow?

117
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,450
Because he's my brother.

118
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,474
- They denied the motion.
- Do it again.

119
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:28,938
I can't. May 11th. That's the date, man.
That's the date they, uh, you know...

120
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,732
- execute me.
- I know.

121
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,242
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- The evidence says you did.

122
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,662
I don't care what the evidence says.
I didn't kill him.

123
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,039
Swear to me.

124
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,584
I swear to you, Michael.

125
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,385
But how did they get it wrong, then?
The courts, the appeals...

126
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,054
Don't know. Don't know.

127
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,433
All I keep thinking, looking back on it,
is I was set up.

128
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:11,146
And whoever it was that set me up wants me
in the ground as quickly as possible.

129
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,279
- What's another word for "love"?
- What's the context?

130
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:23,909
The "I love you so much I ain't never
knockin' over a liquor store again" context.

131
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,370
- Except, you know, classy.
- Mm.

132
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,374
- I'm proposing to my girl, if you gotta know.
- In a letter?

133
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:33,085
- You got a better way?
- Face to face is good.

134
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:39,133
This ain't exactly the romantic spot. I'm
gonna have her get on the Staten Island Ferry,

135
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,137
then once she can see the Empire
State Building, she opens the letter...

136
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,558
It's like almost being there.
Except for the fact that I won't be there.

137
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,476
Try "passion".

138
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,771
"Passion". "Passion". That's dope.

139
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,485
How do you spell that? Is it P-A-S-H?

140
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,613
No H?

141
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,955
- LJ, hold up.
- Hold up?

142
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:15,544
- I don't think I can go through with this.
- Everything's gonna be fine. Trust me.

143
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,476
We understand each other, then?
Friday. Not Saturday, not Sunday. Friday.

144
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,104
- Totally understood.
- I don't want 100s, fives or ones.

145
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,149
I know, I know. Tens and 20s only.

146
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,036
It's on.

147
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,674
Police!

148
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,741
Abruzzi. I need you to hire me at PI.

149
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,080
- Beat it.
- Maybe you oughta hear what I gotta say.

150
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,457
You got nothing I need.

151
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,130
- Wouldn't be too sure of that.
- My mistake.

152
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,175
Just what I need. A duck.

153
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:51,723
PI, Abruzzi. You might find
I can be of more assistance than you think.

154
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:58,438
Mull it over.
Come find me when you're ready to talk.

155
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:08,448
All right, guys. Pick it up.
I wanna get home tonight.

156
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,617
Maggio?

157
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,919
- Yeah. So?
- That son of a bitch fingered Abruzzi.

158
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,005
That's Fibonacci?

159
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:27,676
- I thought that punk was gone forever.
- Evidently somebody found him.

160
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:33,015
- Is somebody messin' with us?
- This you're not gonna believe.

161
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,768
What is it?

162
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,901
Tattoo looks fresh.
Hold that.

163
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,322
I guess being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.

164
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,534
- I'm Michael, by the way.
- Scofield. I read your report.

165
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,787
- And you are?
- Dr Tancredi will do.

166
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,582
"Tancredi" like the governor?

167
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,668
You're not related, are you?

168
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:08,467
Hm. Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter
of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.

169
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,429
- As a doctor, no less.
- I believe in being part of the solution,

170
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:15,307
- not the problem.
- Hm.

171
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,019
"Be the change you want to see in the world."

172
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,232
What?

173
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,944
- Nothing. That was just my senior quote.
- That was you?

174
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,739
This whole time I was thinking it was Gandhi.

175
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:37,704
You're very funny. Sit tight. Put direct
pressure on that. I'll be back in a sec.

176
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:54,221
So, how do we play this?
You hook me up with a few weeks' supply?

177
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,932
Nice try. No hypos on the floor.

178
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,893
I'm the farthest thing from ajunkie.
Trust me.

179
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:03,897
I got news for you. "Trust me"
means absolutely zero inside these walls.

180
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,734
The only way you're getting that insulin
is if I'm administering it.

181
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,487
Guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other, then.

182
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,864
I guess so.

183
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,588
We're all clear on the Burrows execution,
except for one thing.

184
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,924
Bishop McMorrow is not in the fold.

185
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:39,099
He's got a lot of influence with the governor.
They went to prep school together apparently.

186
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:41,435
Look, the closer it gets,

187
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:47,858
the more I'm worried that the bottom
is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

188
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,738
Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop, then.

189
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:58,034
Look, in one month, it'll all be over.

190
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:02,455
"The Son of Man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men

191
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,418
and be crucified,
and the third day rise again."

192
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:10,046
"And they remembered his words."
And so should you.

193
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,675
Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.

194
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:26,396
Michael?

195
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,276
Let's go. Come on, keep moving.

196
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:36,531
- Why?
- I'm getting you out of here.

197
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,659
Burrows! Roll it up. Happy hour's over.

198
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,664
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place it isn't.

199
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:54,049
<i>Too formal.</i>

200
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,510
Too greeting-card.

201
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,513
We gotta make a decision
sooner or later, you know.

202
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:04,559
<i>- We have time.
- We don't, actually.</i>

203
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,146
At some point
we gotta pull the trigger on this thing.

204
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:14,694
I don't wanna rush this. We're only
gonna do it once. We have to get it right.

205
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:22,077
- Honey, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

206
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,455
- Are you putting this off?
- What do you mean?

207
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:29,376
- I mean, are you having second thoughts?
- No.

208
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,087
Honey, no. I'm not.

209
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,590
I just can't help thinking this is about...

210
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,134
It's not.

211
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:42,263
I love you. And I wanna be your wife.

212
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,854
- "Passion"? What were you thinking?
- Hey, you went for it.

213
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,233
She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here. "Passion".

214
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:56,027
Got more than one syllable,
too much talking.

215
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,613
That's me from now on. One-Syllable Sucre.

216
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,534
"Yes", "no", "love", "hate"..."love".

217
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,953
- Give it time.
- Are you kidding?

218
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:12,043
<i>I proposed to her. That doesn't take time.
"Sí' or "no". One syllable, man.</i>

219
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,964
She's supposed to come
for a conjugal on Tuesday.

220
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:19,008
She always calls me beforehand
to let me know she's coming.

221
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,220
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

222
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,390
You spooked her.

223
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:29,727
Scofield. Get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

224
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:36,776
No good, fish.
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

225
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,321
Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.

226
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:46,286
Top of your class at Loyola.
Magna cum laude, in fact.

227
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:52,167
I can't help wondering what someone with
your credentials is doing in a place like this.

228
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,044
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

229
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:59,924
You make it sound like a traffic infraction,
like going the wrong way up a one-way street.

230
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,470
Everyone turns up one sooner or later.

231
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:08,391
The reason I called you here,

232
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:14,230
I noticed in your l-file, under "Occupation",
you put down "unemployed".

233
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,108
That's not true, now, is it?

234
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,114
I know you're a structural engineer, Scofield.

235
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:27,952
Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal

236
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,581
as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.

237
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:34,542
My wife is quite fond of the story.

238
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,545
It appeals to the romantic in her.

239
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:44,510
Being married to someone in corrections,
terrible job. Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

240
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:49,098
And yet, in 39 years,
my wife has never complained.

241
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,352
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

242
00:21:54,395 --> 00:22:00,526
So, because I couldn't say it,
I thought, you know, I could build it.

243
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,947
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

244
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,325
But here, look...

245
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:09,494
You see, the problem is,

246
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:14,290
I build any more, it's all gonna
come down like a house of cards.

247
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,251
That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.

248
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:21,255
And for the favour, I can offer you
three days of work a week in here,

249
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,050
and it'll keep you off the yard.

250
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:32,850
I can't do it.

251
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,481
Son, it's better for me to owe you one in here
than it is for you to owe me one,

252
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:40,733
I can promise you that.

253
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,111
I'll take my chances.

254
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,949
Then we're through here.

255
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:49,158
Guard!

256
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:56,541
Two pounds of pot?
What were you trying to do, set a record?

257
00:22:56,624 --> 00:23:00,586
It's not funny, LJ.
You could be going to jail.

258
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:05,967
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

259
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,927
Hey.

260
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,096
Thanks.

261
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:14,392
- From who? Old Daddy Warbucks?
- He's a good man.

262
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:16,644
We got nothing in common.

263
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:24,694
Where's this coming from, LJ? Last semester
you were getting almost all As, and now...

264
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:28,614
- It's your father, isn't it?
- I don't have a father.

265
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,910
It wasn't an immaculate conception, honey.
Trust me.

266
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,165
<i>Maybe it's time
you went and saw him.</i>

267
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:39,208
Mom.

268
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,752
Mom! Don't.

269
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:45,298
I'm about as excited by that as you are,
but something's gotta give.

270
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:51,721
You have got too much potential
to be screwing up your life like this.

271
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,809
What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

272
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:01,689
I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing
in here - eating Jell-O, drinking Kool-Aid.

273
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:07,111
I know what you're doing. It's not the luck
of the draw that you're in here with Lincoln.

274
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,530
You forget I know you. Both of you.

275
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,242
You two have the most dysfunctional
idea of love I've ever seen.

276
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,578
He beats you up to keep you off the street,

277
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:18,456
so you get yourself
tossed into Fox River with him?

278
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,042
To what? Save him?

279
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:26,297
I deserve to know.
I loved him as much as you did.

280
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,841
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

281
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,970
I gave him a shot
when I got back from college. I did.

282
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:37,683
Even with all the stuff going on, I did all
I could to make it work, and he threw it away.

283
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,687
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left in the first place?

284
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:45,691
Don't do this. Whatever it is you're doing,
there's a better way.

285
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,319
- I'm appealing your case.
- I told you not to.

286
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:51,239
I got in touch with the diocese about Linc.
The bishop...

287
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:54,742
That won't stop it. It'll only delay it.

288
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:03,626
You wanna do something?
You find out who's trying to bury him.

289
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,256
Nobody's trying to bury him.
The evidence was there.

290
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,132
The evidence was cooked.

291
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,429
<i>Visiting hours are now over.</i>

292
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:22,269
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

293
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:28,693
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.
Something more is going on here.

294
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:31,821
This is desperation, Michael.
You're in denial.

295
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,824
Maybe. But I can't watch him die.

296
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:37,368
I won't do that.

297
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,189
Gentlemen.

298
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:10,901
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?

299
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:14,864
It's our understanding that you have
great influence with the governor.

300
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:18,993
I wouldn't say it's great, or influence.
We're friends.

301
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:22,455
It's also our understanding
that you oppose the death penalty.

302
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:25,291
- I'm a man of God. How could I not?
- In this case,

303
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:29,545
we're hoping you'll suspend that position,
at least temporarily.

304
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:34,925
If the inmate appeals to me for intervention,
how can I turn my back on him?

305
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:37,928
You have a habit of answering a question
with a question.

306
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:43,517
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

307
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:49,356
- Are you saying you won't do it?
- I'm not a man to equivocate.

308
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:57,114
- You're, what, 62 now, Your Excellency?
- That's right.

309
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,534
So you should be well versed
in how the tax system works.

310
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:04,830
Taking personal capital gains
under the church's tax shelter,

311
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,042
that would be fraud,
wouldn't it, Your Excellency?

312
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:12,546
I will not be cowed
into forsaking my beliefs.

313
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,632
Not by you, or anyone else.

314
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,593
Admirable.

315
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:20,221
Good day, Excellency.

316
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:26,602
Mr Kellerman, what is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

317
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:31,023
The man killed the Vice-President's brother.

318
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:39,406
<i>- What did you say?
- You heard me.</i>

319
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,077
Someone found Fibonacci.
I'm looking at the photos right now.

320
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,957
<i>Son of a bitch has got a beard, sunglasses.
Witness protection if I ever saw it.</i>

321
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,500
Who was this someone?

322
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:54,588
Don't know. There's no return address
on the envelope. Just...

323
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,341
this folded-up bird, made of paper.

324
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,388
- Like origami?
- Yeah, like that.

325
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:04,765
<i>Like origami.</i>

326
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:41,802
- You're Charles Westmoreland, right?
- Do I know you?

327
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:45,431
- I knew your wife, before she passed.
- You knew Marla?

328
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:48,851
- You mean Ann?
- How'd you know her?

329
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,812
- We taught together in Boston.
- East Farmington.

330
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:54,398
You mean West Wilmington?

331
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:57,067
No more tests, I promise.

332
00:28:58,777 --> 00:29:01,905
Seems you know everything about me.
Who are you?

333
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:05,492
Michael Scofield.
How'd you get it in here?

334
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,745
First off, she's not an it.

335
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:11,415
She's Marilyn,
and she's grandfathered back from the days

336
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:15,252
when prisoners were allowed
a creature comfort or two.

337
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:17,629
Heard you were DB Cooper.

338
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:24,428
Every new fish that comes in, first thing they
hear is Charles Westmoreland's DB Cooper.

339
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:27,097
I'll tell you like I tell them.

340
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,020
You want the Cooper story?
I can't give it to you, cos I'm not him.

341
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:37,191
That's too bad. I sort of wish it was true.
The man's a legend.

342
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:40,527
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

343
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:45,073
I'd have a million five
waiting for me on the outside.

344
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:50,287
I'd put some grass under 'em if I were you.

345
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,624
This thing'd go a whole lot easier
if you'd just hire me.

346
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:56,126
What is this all about?

347
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,254
Say you were able to get outside those walls.

348
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:02,257
Are there people in place
to make you disappear forever?

349
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:05,219
- What do you care?
- I'm just curious.

350
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:09,681
- Where's Fibonacci?
- That's not the way it works.

351
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:17,231
They come at me, John, I'm coming after you.

352
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,775
I doubt it.

353
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,220
All right.

354
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,644
Get on the ground.

355
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,400
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.
I didn't think you were the agitating type.

356
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:04,361
Behaviour like that
will not be tolerated in my prison.

357
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:07,739
90 days in the SHU oughta be
enough time to convince you of that.

358
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:10,325
- 90 days?
- That's right.

359
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:21,295
- Something you wanna say?
- It's just...

360
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:25,882
- I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.
- Value?

361
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:29,970
The Taj. It'd be a shame for the eighth wonder
of the modern world to collapse

362
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,389
because the stress isn't properly propagated.

363
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:35,517
- Properly propagated?
- Properly propagated.

364
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,519
The joints are overloaded.

365
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:42,774
They won't provide anywhere near the sheer
strength the completed structure will need.

366
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:46,236
- How much work are we talking?
- You want it by when, June?

367
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,114
- Yes.
- Then we'd better get started,

368
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:51,033
wouldn't you say?

369
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:19,478
Who's there?

370
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,750
Bishop McMorrow was killed last night.
Someone shot him while he was sleeping.

371
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,920
- I thought you'd wanna know.
- Thanks.

372
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:55,138
Michael was right.

373
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,627
Sink! You got a visitor.

374
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:39,724
He was arrested.

375
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:44,563
- For what?
- Possession of marijuana.

376
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:51,695
I figured he could use
some fatherly advice before it's...

377
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:53,697
- Gone forever?
- I didn't mean that.

378
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,575
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

379
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:00,078
So...

380
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:07,210
Dope, huh? Using or dealing?

381
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:11,423
- What's the difference?
- Then what?

382
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:15,552
You think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

383
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:19,139
You've got a piece of the good life.
Take advantage.

384
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:22,267
Look, I get it. The whole thing.

385
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,731
She drags me in here, you give me
a big speech, I walk away a changed man.

386
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:32,027
Straight As, Harvard,
grow up and be a dentist.

387
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,821
It's better than being here.

388
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:39,117
You gotta realise who gets punished
when you do what you do.

389
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,620
You think it's me. It's you.
I did the same thing.

390
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:48,043
Punished the old man cos he was gone.
Look where it got me.

391
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:54,758
I'm not asking you to love me.
I already screwed up that chance long ago.

392
00:34:54,841 --> 00:35:01,306
I'm asking you to love yourself.
You can still put the brakes on this thing.

393
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:05,643
- So that's what fatherly advice is like.
- Where are you going?

394
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:10,899
- I got homework.
- They're putting me to death, LJ.

395
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:15,236
In a month's time, I'll be dead.
You get that?

396
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:19,657
You're already dead to me.

397
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,087
<i>Coño.</i>

398
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,391
Yes.

399
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:48,603
What, you mean "yes, yes"?

400
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:51,356
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah!

401
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:55,693
- Just one thing.
- Of course.

402
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,530
- My mom wants us to wait till you get out.
- Of course.

403
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:02,158
And we have to get married in a church.
A Catholic church.

404
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:06,412
Wouldn't want to mess
with the Catholic roots, would we?

405
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,878
- You went to Loyola.
- You've been checking up on me.

406
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:17,924
I like to get to know my patients.
I went to Northwestern.

407
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,676
Maybe we met before.

408
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:22,720
- Drunk, out at a bar somewhere.
- I would have remembered.

409
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:25,056
- That a compliment?
- No.

410
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,226
Hm.

411
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,855
- What?
- Your blood glucose is 50mg per decilitre.

412
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:34,107
- So?
- It's hypoglycaemic.

413
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,068
Your body is reacting
like you're not a diabetic.

414
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:42,323
- You sure it's type 1 diabetes you've got?
- Ever since I was a kid.

415
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:46,244
<i>- Any tingling, cold sweats?</i>

416
00:36:49,038 --> 00:36:50,540
Infirmary.

417
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:52,959
Yes.

418
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,128
Yeah, he did.

419
00:36:55,962 --> 00:36:58,548
No, I did one a week ago.

420
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,467
OK.

421
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:05,930
Great. Well, I'll call him after lunch, then.
Thanks. I'm with a patient. OK.

422
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,558
I'd like to run some tests
next time you're in.

423
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:11,686
I don't want to administer insulin
to a man who doesn't need it.

424
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,813
Yeah. Sure.

425
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,773
OK.

426
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:26,367
- How'd you get here, by the way?
- Oh, you know.

427
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:28,828
I don't. That's why I asked.

428
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:32,123
- You know... Hector.
- What?!

429
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:38,796
I didn't have any money for the bus,
so he offered me a ride. He was really sweet.

430
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,343
- Honey, he's just a friend.
- No, he's not. I know Hector. I know men.

431
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:48,848
Men and women can't be friends. A guy
doesn't drive a girl 500 miles to be friends.

432
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:52,143
<i>Casanova! Wrap it up.</i>

433
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:57,315
Hey. You got nothing to worry about, OK?
It's you I'm marrying.

434
00:37:57,398 --> 00:38:00,109
It's not you I'm worried about.

435
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:04,113
Sixteen more months.

436
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,665
I love you.

437
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:27,428
Be easy, son, all right?

438
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:37,063
Sucre tells me you're the local pharmacy.

439
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:41,943
- What do you need, man?
- PUGNAc.

440
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:45,488
- I only speak English, white boy.
- It's an insulin blocker.

441
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:48,241
Standard variety.
You can get it at any pharmacy.

442
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:51,077
- You can get that at Medical, then.
- I can't.

443
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,873
- Why not?
- Because they're giving me insulin shots.

444
00:38:56,916 --> 00:39:01,754
- You're one mixed-up cracker.
- Can you get it for me or not?

445
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,091
Only if you tell me
why you keep going back to Medical

446
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:09,262
- to get an insulin shot you don't need.
- I like the ambience.

447
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:11,848
- A-ha.
- Are we in business?

448
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:32,827
Scofield! I don't know what you did, but
Abruzzi wanted me to give you this PI card.

449
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:38,207
Congratulations.
You just joined the ranks of the employed.

450
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:56,017
Kudos, fish. You got spine.

451
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:04,817
All right, cons! Break it down.

452
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:08,738
Move, you guys.

453
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,336
Saw Veronica came by yesterday.
Still engaged to that guy?

454
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:25,922
- Yup.
- It could have been me.

455
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:28,799
If you hadn't self-destructed.

456
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:34,722
You think I meant to knock up Lisa Rix?
I was just being stupid. Hurt.

457
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:39,977
- Shouldn't have pushed her away, though.
- You pushed everyone away.

458
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:44,607
I'm an anchor.
All I'll do is drag 'em down with me.

459
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:51,947
- Why'd you hire him?
- Keep your friends close,

460
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:54,450
and your enemies closer.

461
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:03,376
- Did you mean what you said earlier?
- I'm not here on vacation. Trust me.

462
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:10,383
Getting outside these walls is just
the beginning. You're gonna need money.

463
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:14,011
I'll have it.

464
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:18,224
And people on the outside.
People that can help you disappear.

465
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:20,601
I've already got 'em.

466
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:23,396
They just don't know it yet.

467
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:32,530
Look, whatever you've got going on,
fill me in, cos I'm in the dark here.

468
00:41:32,613 --> 00:41:37,576
Chaparral Associates got the contract
to retrofit this place in '99 - $4 million.

469
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:43,374
Head partner couldn't crack it, so he
subcontracted out to a former associate.

470
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:47,294
That guy was one of the partners in my firm.

471
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:54,760
We ghost-wrote the whole plan - crossed
the t's, dotted the i's, grouted the tiles.

472
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:06,605
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

473
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:08,441
I've got 'em on me.

474
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:14,738
Are you kidding me?

475
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:21,704
- Am I supposed to see something here?
- Look closer.
