00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:02,639
<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:07,269
<i>Think of this place like a map of the
US. Our cell over there, that's New York City.</i>

3
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:09,729
The infirmary, our exit, that's California.

4
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:12,440
The pipes beneath us that connect the two...

5
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,484
- Route 66.
- Our ticket out of here.

6
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:19,656
Route 66 runs beneath that building. It's the
only building sitting on top of those tunnels.

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,327
All we gotta do is get in there,
on PI, and dig ourselves an onramp.

8
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:27,706
- Which one?
- Right there.

9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,709
This goes down four feet.
Connects to the main line below.

10
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:35,172
All we've gotta do is widen it and
we've got ourselves an onramp to Route 66.

11
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:38,008
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

12
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,469
You told me that
you had been up in the crawlspace for PI,

13
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:45,515
and PI was never assigned to go there.

14
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:48,852
We got you a little get well gift.

15
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,688
What's your name?

16
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:56,026
There was an explosion.
Gas line. Everyone inside was killed.

17
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,321
- These people won't stop until we're dead.
- We can't hide forever.

18
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:01,656
<i>- How about that kid?
- The one killed his parents?</i>

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,117
<i>Oh, they got him. He's in custody.</i>

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,411
I know what you look like, you son of a bitch.

21
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:07,537
Philly Falzone.

22
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:12,208
Word is someone knows where Fibonacci is
and you're not doing anything about it.

23
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:22,469
<i>Help me.</i>

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,222
Please.

25
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,359
You'll have to forgive my boy.

26
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:43,907
He has the propensity to be a bit gregarious
when he shouldn't be.

27
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,160
Fraternising in the prison shower. Come on.

28
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:49,871
Maybe you oughta cut the kid a break.

29
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:53,124
You wouldn't be meddling in my affairs,
now, would you?

30
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,543
You can't be that stupid.

31
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:59,756
Not while I'm so fully invested in your affairs.

32
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:08,306
What's between you and him
is between you and him.

33
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,142
That's what I thought you said.

34
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:25,281
You've gotta help me.

35
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:37,043
<i>- You gotta help me.
- This is a matter for the police.</i>

36
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:41,089
This is my son we're talking about.
He's missing. Do something!

37
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:44,676
You have got to understand,
I am the warden of a prison.

38
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,846
When it comes to the law,
there is nothing I can do.

39
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:52,267
Whatever happens is out of my jurisdiction
until it comes through those gates.

40
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,520
- Itjust did. Let me out.
- What?

41
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:59,274
Let me find him. I know how he thinks.
I know where he'd run.

44
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:13,079
That ain't true. In case of a family emergency,
you can grant an inmate supervised leave.

45
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:17,333
Your son is a prime suspect
in a double homicide.

46
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:34,726
Hey.

47
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:38,396
What do you think this is, a siesta?

48
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,401
You see that? You see my face up there?
Any idea how it got there?

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,864
Work ethic. Those two words
mean anything in your country?

50
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:52,869
You're on PI, so quit slow-walking me.
I'm not gonna warn you again.

51
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:55,330
What are you looking at?

52
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:29,447
The bulls find this stuff,
they'll know we're digging.

53
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,826
That's why we gotta get rid of it.
One piece at a time.

54
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,290
<i>- Attention in the yard.
- All prisoners remain 40ft away from gate A.</i>

55
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:41,918
<i>New prisoners arriving in five minutes.</i>

56
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:47,173
<i>I repeat, attention in the yard.
All prisoners remain 40ft away from gate A.</i>

57
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:50,176
<i>New prisoners arriving in five minutes.</i>

58
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,539
<i>Attention in the yard. All prisoners maintain
a 40ft perimeter around gate A.</i>

59
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:21,791
Freshmen.

60
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,343
Best put on ourjail face, BG.

61
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:36,264
These crabs see you puckering,
they bitchify you in a heartbeat.

62
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:04,917
- I gotta find something else to call you now.
- Why's that?

63
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:10,339
Cos you ain't a fish no more.
You ain't the newest con in the tank.

64
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:30,043


65
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,264
<i>I could've done something.</i>

66
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:02,183
<i>No.</i>

67
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:07,021
T-Bag had his hooks in that kid.
There was nothing you could have done.

68
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:11,734
I could've told the Pope.
He could've transferred the kid to ADSEG.

69
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:14,779
Go easy, Michael. You didn't even know him.

70
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:21,327
And that makes it OK? I turned my back
on him because I didn't wanna make waves.

71
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,872
It was just... easier

72
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,541
to look the other way,

73
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,585
keep the plan safe.

74
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:31,921
And you did.

75
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,006
But at what price?

76
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,051
That's not how she raised us.

77
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:40,137
A man's down, you give him your hand.

78
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:44,225
She'd roll over in her grave if she knew.

79
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:48,729
She wouldn't.
You've given me your hand, Michael.

80
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:53,359
My son's out there
with a bull's eye on his back.

81
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:58,114
Do whatever you gotta do
to get us out of here. Please.

82
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:42,408
<i>What are you doing?</i>

83
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:45,703
I was just looking for some coffee.

84
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,830
There isn't any.

85
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:52,084
They belonged to my father,
if you were wondering.

86
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:57,256
- How long have they been in there?
- I don't know. Five years?

87
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:05,890
You know, Veronica, we've been through a lot
and I'm freaking out here as much as you are,

88
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:10,227
but you get this look in your eye sometimes
like... like I'm the bad guy.

89
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:15,691
I don't know who you are. You just magically
show up like some knight in shining armour.

90
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,320
You know, I think
you seem to be forgetting something here.

91
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:24,575
I'm in the cross hairs the same way you are,
all for your ex, who is a scumbag criminal

92
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:28,412
who just happens to be in prison
for the one crime he didn't commit.

93
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:34,752
You know something? I got enough of my
own crap to deal with. You wanna go, you go.

94
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:54,188
- Mind if I lamp with you, cuzzo?
- Roll, snowflake.

95
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:59,860
Hey, man, I'm just... I'm just new, you know?
I'm looking for some homies.

96
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:04,031
- I said roll.
- Brother, I'm just launching.

97
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:08,160
Yeah? Well, launch somewhere else,
white boy.

98
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:12,623
All right, y'all.

99
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm fitting to bounce.

100
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:18,629
Peace.

101
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:26,929
Boy's a bit confused about his pigmentation,

102
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:30,307
but he sure does have spunk, doesn't he?

103
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:39,483
- Abruzzi!
- Yeah?

104
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,319
What are you doing?

105
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,490
What do you mean, what am I doing?

106
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:50,995
- First of the month's coming up, John.
- Yeah? So?

107
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:53,831
I haven't got my monthly.

108
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,420
- What?
- I checked my balance. It's looking deficient.

109
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,173
Uh...

110
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:07,678
It's gotta be some kind of a mistake,
like an accounting error.

111
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:11,682
Yeah. Tell Falzone
I don't stand for accounting errors.

112
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:16,437
I'm going back into my office at the end of
the day. Gonna check my balance again.

113
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,941
If it's not up to where it's supposed to be,
all these privileges you got,

114
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,485
like running PI,

115
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:25,696
they're gone.

116
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,992
Get it done, John.

117
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:32,369
<i>- Falzone Enterprises.
- Get Philly.</i>

118
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:36,749
<i>- Mr Falzone's not available.
- You tell him it's John Abruzzi calling.</i>

119
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:40,961
<i>- I'm sorry. I didn't realise.
- Well, now you do.</i>

120
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,130
<i>Um...</i>

121
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:48,886
<i>- I'm sorry. He's gonna have to call you back.
- What? Hey...</i>

122
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:05,903
I'm sorry. About before.

123
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,824
Pressure's getting to us, that's all.

124
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:14,661
Good news is nobody can reach us out here.
My old man made sure of that.

125
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:18,999
Never even hooked up the telephone.
Same with the well and the generator.

126
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:22,586
I used to think he was
some kind of conspiracy theory wacko.

127
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:26,089
- Turns out maybe he was right.
- I can't stay, Nick.

128
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:30,010
I gotta get back. He's got less than two weeks.

129
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:34,056
The old man called this his serious tie.

130
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,268
He only wore it
when he really, really meant business.

131
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:43,941
Be dangerous showing our faces again.

132
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:47,110
Not if they're not looking for us.
They think we're dead.

133
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:49,863
Yeah, but how long is that gonna last?

134
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:54,076
Gotta be quick, be smart about it.
We're just gonna be running in circles

135
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,539
if we think we can find exculpatory evidence
before the execution.

136
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:01,750
I've gone up against every prosecutor
in Cook County.

137
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:08,090
Man gets murdered, the first person they
talk to to see who his enemies were, the wife.

138
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:11,885
- You wanna go after the queen bee herself?
- Leslie Steadman.

139
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:17,099
Everyone in town knows the old bird
lunches at the Lexington every day

140
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:19,601
with the society set.

141
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,858
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

142
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,319
Slow down. Slow down!

143
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:33,198
Man, your brother's gonna give us away.

144
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,954
<i>- Bull's coming.
- Let's move.</i>

145
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:41,415
Hurry up, guys. Move it.

146
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:48,255
- All right.
- Everybody out.

147
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:51,133
- What?
- I said everybody out.

148
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,719
Now.

149
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,311
Move it!

150
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,815
- Where are we going?
- Around the corner.

151
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:11,278
And don't move a damn muscle
till I come get you. Go!

152
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:15,115
What the hell's going on?

153
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:25,834
- We're so bad, aren't we?
- You're damn skippy. Let's go.

154
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:35,093
- You gotta give us more of a warning.
- I'm sorry. He just showed up.

155
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,472
Mm. Mm. Mm.

156
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,058
Oh, we're gonna get caught
by the warden. Oh!

157
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:45,062
<i>Baby, right now,
in this room, at this moment,</i>

158
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:48,774
- I am the warden.
- Oh!

159
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:50,484
<i>- Then say it.
- No.</i>

160
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,944
<i>- Come on, baby, say it.
- Oh!</i>

161
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:55,655
<i>- Say it.
- You're the warden, Louis!</i>

162
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:57,824
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

163
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:16,038
The sneaky son of a bitch.

164
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,541
You think he found the hole?

165
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:29,760
Another inch and he'd have found it. We need
to find something to cover this hole ASAP.

166
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:34,473
<i>Broke. What do you mean, broke?</i>

167
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:37,601
The C-Corp, the investment accounts,

168
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:43,315
even the offshore stuff, Caymans, Bermuda...
Philly Falzone liquidated everything.

169
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:48,028
Hey, I told you from the beginning
what would happen if you screwed me.

170
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:53,450
I heeded it. That's why I warned you from the
get-go not to give Philly power of attorney.

171
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:56,370
We had that conversation, remember?

172
00:15:56,453 --> 00:16:01,875
Look, the only real funds you have left
are the 30,000 in your wife's pocket account.

173
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,253
- Now, I can...
- Don't. Don't touch that.

174
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:07,964
Nobody touches that but her.

175
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:10,717
What do I tell her? You know, about all this?

176
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,929
Don't tell her anything, OK?

177
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:17,015
The statements are going to come.
She's going to know.

178
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,393
Hey, I told you.

179
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:24,147
Don't tell her.

180
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:26,274
All right?

181
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:28,735
You got a problem with that?

182
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:35,617
OK, John. You know where to contact me
if you need anything else.

183
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,870
The same goes for you.

184
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,341
Hey.

185
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,510
Hey!

186
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,557
- Philly.
- You.

187
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:04,187
So good to see you.
For you, the answer's always yes, Philly.

188
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:06,565
Sit down.

189
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:12,070
<i>- Sit down.
- Come on, John.</i>

190
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:20,287
There's no record
of a Fox River medical practice

191
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,373
on our list of participating HMOs or PPOs.

192
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:28,587
That's because we're a state penitentiary,
and we're in kind of a unique situation here.

193
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,924
Mr Scofield's insurance policy
from his previous employer hasn't lapsed.

194
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:37,429
The state's demanding that you pay
for his treatment and not the taxpayers.

195
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:41,683
<i>OK. Well, it says here
he already met his deductible.</i>

196
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,685
OK.

197
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:47,397
Oh, no, wait. That's his psych deductible,
not his medical.

198
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,275
Sorry. Psych as in psychiatric?

199
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,995
Did I give you permission to call Philly?
Hey, I asked you a question, man.

200
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:05,957
Listen. There, uh...
there's been a restructuring.

201
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,835
This comes from Philly himself.

202
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,132
You couldn't deliver Fibonacci,
so I'm the man in here now.

203
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:19,304
Run to the commissary and get me a packet
of chips. We'll pretend this never happened.

204
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:25,518
No, I'm telling you, John. The sooner you face
these facts, the better off we will all be.

205
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:28,396
I can kill you in a heartbeat.

206
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,944
Somehow, I doubt that.

207
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:40,367
The sooner you face facts,
the better off we will all be.

208
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:45,455
You're yesterday's news, John.

209
00:18:56,007 --> 00:19:00,428
- What's the word? Y'all cooking brownies?
- Act your race, milk chicken.

210
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:03,932
What's the deal, yo?
You got tough buckets or something?

211
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:07,644
You're a disgrace to your skin,
you know that?

212
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:11,022
The boy just slipped.

213
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:13,316
The boy just slipped.

214
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,985
Ain't that right?

215
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:22,075
<i>- Come on. Stand up.
- Cons, let's get back to your cells.</i>

216
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:24,452
What's your name, boy?

217
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:37,841
- Who's that?
- Stolte.

218
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:40,593
Stolte. You've heard about my kid, right?

219
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:43,471
- Take the tray, Linc.
- I, uh...

220
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:48,143
I just need to call him.

221
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:54,524
Just take the tray, or I'm gonna shove it
in there and you can eat it off the ground.

222
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:01,865
You have a son. Josh.

223
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,326
Don't do anything stupid, Linc.

224
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:10,748
I'm not. I just wanna ask you a question,
then I'm gonna let go.

225
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:15,628
What if it were Josh?

226
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:18,006
What if it were your son?

227
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,344
Please.

228
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:10,099
- Dad?
- LJ. Thank God. Are you all right?

229
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,519
No. Nowhere near it.

230
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:18,608
- What do you mean? Where are you?
- What they're saying about me, it's not true.

231
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,861
<i>- I know it's not true.
- They killed her. They killed her.</i>

232
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,864
<i>Right in front of me.
Right in front of my eyes.</i>

233
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,492
- You gotta...
- Why are they doing this?

234
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:30,536
You gotta step up. You gotta be the man now.

235
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,039
<i>- You understand me, LJ?
- Yeah.</i>

236
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:38,002
- OK. I want you to call Veronica.
- Her number is disconnected. I already tried.

237
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:41,631
Nick Savrinn. You call Nick Savrinn.
Works for Project Justice.

238
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:44,467
You call him once we're done. You got it?

239
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,553
Nick Savrinn. OK.

240
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:51,057
- OK, I'll call. I'll call.
- All right, man.

241
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:54,352
<i>Hang in there, man. It's gonna be all right.</i>

242
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:56,396
<i>Hey...</i>

243
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:59,524
<i>- They're here.
- Who's here?</i>

244
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,609
<i>LJ?</i>

245
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:03,111
<i>LJ!</i>

246
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:11,429
You hear that?

247
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,641
Did you hear it?

248
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:18,019
You know what that means?

249
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:22,315
Why don't you ask your mom what it means?

250
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:28,446
Oh, I'm sorry. You might have trouble getting
an answer out of her right about now, huh?

251
00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:33,159
LJ?

252
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:17,995
- I saw that.
- Just getting connected, that's all.

253
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:20,748
There she is.

254
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:24,877
Mrs Steadman? I'm Dick Sisler.

255
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:29,048
This is Francette Kelly
of the National Victims' Rights Association.

256
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:34,136
We assist victims of violent crimes, gather
support for tough-on-crime politicians.

257
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,517
If your organisation's looking for a hand-out,
you can go through my business manager.

258
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,646
Ma'am, that is not why we're here, actually.
May we sit down?

259
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:48,776
We hoped you could help us with one of our
more public cases. The Lincoln Burrows case.

260
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:53,823
He's making claims that he's innocent, that
others had motive to murder your husband.

261
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:58,119
- I don't have time for a long conversation.
- It doesn't have to be long.

262
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:02,248
If we talked about who had motive
to kill Terrence, we'd be here all day.

263
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:04,000
- I'm sorry?
- Look around.

264
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:07,503
Half the people here
were shareholders in his company.

265
00:25:07,586 --> 00:25:10,214
Every one of them
sat at my husband's memorial

266
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:14,468
and every one of them was thinking
the same thing: "Thank God he's gone."

267
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:17,471
- Why would they think that?
- Money.

268
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:21,726
As soon as rumours of the indictment started,
they ran for the exits.

269
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:25,771
- I wasn't aware of any indictment.
- It never came down. He died first.

270
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:29,984
- Anything to do with Ecofield?
- Do the math. CEO gets indicted for fraud.

271
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:35,114
Investors start losing money. Lots of money.
If I didn't know Burrows pulled that trigger,

272
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:40,870
I'd say it was any one of these people in the
restaurant. We're talking half a billion dollars.

273
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:43,497
People have killed for a lot less.

274
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:50,463
Hey, what's up? 'Sup?

275
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,439
<i>Not a good position
you find yourself in, is it?</i>

276
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:12,985
Whites don't want you. Blacks don't want you.

277
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:16,447
You're just caught in the middle, aren't you?

278
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,616
A regular 'tweener.

279
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,454
We're different, you and me, lot of ways.

280
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:28,334
But, you know,
the funny thing is we're also a lot alike.

281
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:34,131
Couple of dogs with runny noses
that nobody loves.

282
00:26:37,468 --> 00:26:39,845
How's that knee, by the way?

283
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,766
- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't get me wrong. I'm just a friend.

284
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:46,644
- A fruity friend. I don't need none of that.
- Easy.

285
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:53,651
No. No. You think you're getting up in this,
you got another thing coming, you homo.

286
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:58,113
- You got a foul mouth, you know that?
- Yeah. I do.

287
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:02,284
And you come near me again,
I'm gonna kill you.

288
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:08,624
Well, then,
you're just gonna have to, little man.

289
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:15,923
<i>- You sleep with one eye open.
- Bring it on.</i>

290
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:20,552
<i>- Oh, I'm gonna bring it on in spades.
- You oughta leave that kid alone.</i>

291
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:25,724
Maybe you are in no position
to be telling me my business. Hm?

292
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:28,769
That's what I thought.

293
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:36,151
I'm sure you can understand
my reluctance to discuss past patients.

294
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:40,614
My understanding is that under HIPAA
we're allowed to share information

295
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:44,535
as long as it furthers the care of the patient.

296
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:49,665
I'm not accustomed to making
enquiries like this, but I...

297
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,543
I feel like I can get through to him.

298
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:55,087
I can help him.

299
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,591
- I imagine he needs it in there.
- What did you treat him for?

300
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,678
Michael suffered from a couple of things.

301
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,764
One was a condition
called low latent inhibition.

302
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:08,976
Sorry. I'm not familiar with the term.

303
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,812
People who suffer from low latent inhibition

304
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:14,815
see everyday things like you or I do,
like this lamp.

305
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:21,530
But where we just process the image
of a lamp, they process everything.

306
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:26,618
The stem, the bulb, the bolts,
even the washers inside.

307
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:32,416
<i>Their brains are more open to incoming
stimuli in the surrounding environment.</i>

308
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:37,504
Other people's brains - yours and mine -
shut out the same information.

309
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:40,799
We have to do it in order to keep our sanity.

310
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:44,386
If someone with a low IQ
has low latent inhibition,

311
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,140
it almost always results in mental illness.

312
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:53,896
But if someone has a high IQ,
it almost always results in creative genius.

313
00:28:57,107 --> 00:29:00,277
Do you think Michael's a genius?

314
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,531
Well, I think that word's been derogated
in the media these days.

315
00:29:04,615 --> 00:29:08,202
But in the classic sense of the word, yes, I do.

316
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:13,624
You... you said there was something else
you treated him for?

317
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:17,127
He came to me
with absolutely no sense of self-worth.

318
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:20,506
The loss of both parents
very often does that to a child.

319
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:26,011
But with the low latent inhibition,
something interesting happened to Michael.

320
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:30,140
He became very attuned
to all the suffering around him.

321
00:29:30,224 --> 00:29:32,559
He couldn't shut it out.

322
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:34,811
He became a rescuer,

323
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:40,442
one of those people who are more concerned
with other people's welfare than their own.

324
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:43,111
I didn't know all this about him.

325
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:47,032
Then maybe you don't know Michael Scofield.

326

341
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:09,408
I checked my voicemail at work.

342
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:15,289
Lincoln's son LJ just left me a message.
He's in trouble.

343
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:30,721
- Hello?
- LJ, it's Veronica. Where are you?

344
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,016
Oh, Veronica, I don't know.
You gotta come get me.

345
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,353
We can't, OK? We're not in Chicago.
You have to come to us.

346
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:40,773
Oh. All right. Where's that?

347
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,401
Oh.

348
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,404
Oh. How the hell do they know where I am?

349
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,782
<i>- What's going on?
- How do they know where I am?</i>

350
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,412
- LJ, LJ, I want you to listen to me.
- Everywhere I go, they're there.

351
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,916
I want you to listen to me, OK? I need you
to come to us. We're in Lake Mercer.

352
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,210
- Where's that?
- On the Iowa border.

353
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,088
There's a bus station. We'll meet you there.

354
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:08,718
- They're still alive.
- The bird in the hand just became three.

355
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,887
<i>- Keep your cellphone open.
- Let's go.</i>

356
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,931
- But the kid's right...
- Let's go.

357
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,975
<i>- OK.
- OK, what?</i>

358
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:20,396
OK, I'll keep it open.
They're leaving. They're leaving.

359
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:24,191
LJ, I need to know that you hear me, OK?
Lake Mercer.

360
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,694
Lake Mercer. OK.

361
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:28,863
All right, bye.

362
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:01,604
What the hell are you doing?

363
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,275
Delivering yesterday's news.

364
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:21,552
Your bus leaves from depot six
in just a few minutes.

365
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:23,721
Thanks.

366
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:46,494
- Yo, man, get off me, bitch.
- Let's pants him.

367
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:07,557
I... wanted you to know that if you're looking
for someone to talk to, you're not alone.

368
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,978
It's part of my job to counsel inmates
and help them with their problems.

369
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:14,689
I got things pretty well figured out.

370
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:20,611
I sort of backed into
some information about you.

371
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:25,408
I hope you don't mind,
but there's a reason I became a doctor.

372
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,286
It's in my nature to want to help.

373
00:34:29,412 --> 00:34:33,291
From what I understand,
it's in your nature too.

374
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:39,839
You did a lot of good things before you were
in here. Community work, charity work.

375
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:42,091
What happened?

376
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:51,851
The man you're talking about died
the moment I stepped inside these walls.

377
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:54,020
All right.

378
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:02,904
<i>Shuttle now arriving on platform one.</i>

379
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:05,782
<i>Shuttle departs in ten minutes.</i>

380
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:37,063
Ladies and gentlemen,
United States Secret Service.

381
00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:40,775
Please remain calm. Remain where you are.

382
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:31,659
<i>Watch your step, son.</i>

383
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:58,352
Hey.

384
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:00,521
Come here.

385
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:07,153
It's OK.

386
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,406
They're leaving.

387
00:37:24,295 --> 00:37:26,297
You're safe now, all right?

388
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,571
You received communication
from your attorney.

389
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:54,784
Please sign this document
certifying that I inspected it for contraband

390
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:58,537
without at any time
breaching attorney-client privilege

391
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:02,124
by reading the materials enclosed herein.

392
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:10,776
- What are you grinning about?
- I'm gonna be out in the real world in a bit.

393
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:16,490
The fact that I'm gonna get me one fine piece
of tail certainly don't hurt either.

394
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:19,868
Nothing like tail, eh, Scofield?

395
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:32,840
<i>- Son of a bitch!
- This ends right now.</i>

396
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:36,677
Oh, you just screwed
some major league pooch, pretty.

397
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,930
I'm gonna sing like a whole tree
full of birds now. Badge!

398
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:43,225
You wanna sing, then sing.

399
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:45,811
But you know what I think?

400
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:48,731
You don't have the guts.

401
00:39:48,814 --> 00:39:53,360
You want out of here
just as much as the rest of us.

402
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:56,071
We got a problem here?

403
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:02,369
No.

404
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:04,330
I, uh...

405
00:40:05,622 --> 00:40:09,460
I thought we was missing some tools here.

406
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:12,296
My bad.

407
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:15,883
Get back to work.

408
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,428
Now.

409
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:24,308
You and I may be stuck together
in this little dance, but I call the shots.

410
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:26,852
First shot, that kid out there,

411
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:29,563
you don't touch him ever.

412
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:35,194
Do we understand each other?

413
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,998
We do.

414
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,542
<i>Out of the way, Julio.</i>

415
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:52,503
Abruzzi.

416
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,052
You and me,
we're gonna have a conversation.

417
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,985
<i>How come he didn't fall through?</i>

418
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,711
- What?
- I warned you.

419
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:39,132
I'll get it together.
You gotta give me more time.

420
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:41,718
You've had your time, John.

421
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:00,445
You tripping on something, Alice?

422
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:14,501
Yeah. That's what I thought.

423
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,172
Lamp it up in here again,
I'll be fixing to break some shop.

424
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:28,390
Uh-oh. We got a problem.

425
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:37,274
Bellick.

426
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,823
Boss. Boss. What's happening?
What are they doing?

427
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:49,661
- Fixing the break room.
- What are you talking about? That's PI.

428
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:51,830
I run it.

429
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,835
Not any more, you don't.
