1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,920
<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,509
<i>What you're doing in the infirmary,
what's it gotta do with here?</i>

3
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:08,930
Four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

4
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:11,850
we'll have 18 minutes
to get the bars off the window

5
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:15,232
and for all seven of us
to get across the wire and over the wall.

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,317
- Is that doable?
- Of course.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,445
Maricruz, what the hell is going on?

8
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:22,491
Yeah, well, Hector says
you can serve your full sentence.

9
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,286
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,831
She's not gonna be
coming around here any more.

11
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:29,377
- It's ajoke, right?
- She's with me now.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,342
I just need to know
what Michael Scofield wanted from you

13
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,845
in exchange for the green card.

14
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:37,764
<i>Why would you need a credit card?</i>

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,107
If I'd known how this was gonna turn out,
I'd have gotten some crap job with the Feds.

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,069
Keep talking like that,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

17
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:49,657
I need to get out while I still got my life.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,160
Daddy! Daddy!

19
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:53,413
Things have changed. I want in.

20
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:57,502
- So?
- We've got too many people.

21
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:00,590
I've done the math. One of 'em has to go.

22
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:06,135
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it's not a problem.

23
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:07,470
Mm.

24
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:11,434
- Impressive résumé.
- Thank you.

25
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:14,564
Tell me why you chose to pursue
a career in engineering.

26
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,609
Well, um...

27
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:20,280
I've always been interested in structure.

28
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:22,659
Geometry.

29
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:26,123
How things fit together.

30
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:32,466
How an object that performs a function
can also be a work of art.

31
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,849
What about the future?
Where do you see yourself in five years?

32
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:51,953
One suit, black.

33
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,782
That baby boy all growed up yet?

34
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,940
Oh, he's gonna raise hell the next few years.

35
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:48,318
Take after his momma.

36
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:53,702
Yeah, you know. Same old same up here.

37
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,877
But, uh...

38
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,673
things are getting pretty tense.

39
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:07,806
Like they're fixing to, uh... collide.
You know what I mean, Jimmy?

40
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,854
There's a potential situation.

41
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,941
I found our access to the infirmary.

44
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:27,210
I'll probably need to skip PI tomorrow
if I wanna get this thing done.

45
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:32,509
You can'tjust skip it. It ain't class.
What if one of the bulls decides to drop in?

46
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:34,721
I don't have a choice, do I?

47
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:38,644
Once we get through the pipe
below the guards' room it'll be easier.

48
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:42,441
I can come and go without using the door,
and with Westmoreland as lookout,

49
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,821
we'll have one more man for digging.

50
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:49,034
He's a problem. All seven of us
can't break over that wall in 18 minutes.

51
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:51,413
You said it yourself. It's impossible.

52
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:56,170
<i>- Listen, man, one of us has gotta take a hike.
- I know.</i>

53
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,217
Mind if I share that with the rest of the class?

54
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:04,808
Apparently, college boy here did the math.

55
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:10,401
Figured out that we got too many clowns
in the car. So one of us is in here digging,

56
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:13,989
- but his seat ain't guaranteed.
- How's this your problem?

57
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:18,162
- He doesn't know what he's talking about.
- I won't dig if I'm not gonna go.

58
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:23,752
- We need to decide who gets cut.
- I think we all can agree who that should be.

59
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:30,471
Pardon me for interrupting,

60
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:32,933
but, uh...

61
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,898
what's that smell?

62
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:42,866
It smells a little like conspiracy.

63
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:46,413
- We need to get back to work.
- I have an announcement to make.

64
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:50,208
I've been growing leery of the way
you all talk like I'm a lesser man,

65
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,964
so I bought an insurance policy.

66
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:57,220
I called up my guy on the outside
and I told him about our plan,

67
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:00,643
and I told him in all likelihood
I'll be seeing him next week.

68
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,936
But...

69
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,152
if he don't hear from me five minutes
before the escape and 20 minutes after,

70
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:12,034
I told him to call up the warden,
blow the whistle on the whole thing.

71
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:15,580
So if y'all got ideas about getting rid of me,

72
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,879
I suggest you make other plans.

73
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:26,612


74
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:03,105
Son of a bitch has got
a countermove for everything.

75
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,274
Not for this.

76
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:10,909
Odd men out. Me and you.

77
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:15,331
- What do you mean?
- Look who you're walking with right now.

78
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:19,087
You should be up there,
calling the shots with the rest of the suits.

79
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,839
Yeah? So?

80
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,718
So.

81
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:25,638
Scofield is only here for one reason.

82
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,266
His brother.

83
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,274
And he only needs two things. The old man's
money, and the mob boss's plane.

84
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:38,950
He don't need you. You just happened
to be in the same cell when he got here.

85
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:42,121
- You and the toilet.
- I've done a lot of work on this thing.

86
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:44,542
Exactly. Me too.

87
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,963
We're just the labourers on this thing, man.

88
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:51,551
The night that fish goes into that hole,
you think he wants all that extra baggage?

89
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:53,765
Cos that's all we are.

90
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,935
I don't know about you, but I'm going.

91
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:03,112
How much does he tell you, anyways?

92
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:06,492
Or does he keep it all to himself?

93
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:10,581
Yeah, he probably tells you
the less you know the better, right?

94
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:13,961
You don't know what you're talking about.
He tells me everything.

95
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:18,051
If he tells you everything,
then you don't need him.

96
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:23,225
Now, we can go by ourselves. Me and you.

97
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:31,738
Or, you know, you can wait, and see if
Scofield really wants to carry a heavy weight.

98
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,072
<i>It's up to you, papi.</i>

99
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:44,906
Yo. I'm still waiting.

100
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,241
What for?

101
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,745
I swiped you that watch, man.
Where's my PI?

102
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,100
- That's not gonna happen.
- You promised.

103
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:55,025
I said I'd think about it.
Maybe somewhere down the road.

104
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:58,427
Yeah, I ain't gonna hold my breath.

105
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,445
<i>- What do you want me to do?
- Get somebody.</i>

106
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,449
No, no, they see a bullet,
they're gonna call the cops.

107
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,120
We don't have a choice!
I'm not gonna let you die.

108
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:17,371
- Find it.
- What?

109
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,542
The bullet. Just find it and dig it out.

110
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,504
- I can't.
- Do it!

111
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,757
<i>Where's Scofield?</i>

112
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,515
There you are.

113
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,522
Just looked for you in your cell.
Couldn't find you anyplace.

114
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:06,111
Couldn't find your credit card either.
You know the one I'm talking about.

115
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:08,948
The one your whore wife
trunked in the other day.

116
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,954
She told me all about it.

117
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,169
Maybe "whore" is too strong.
What do you call a girl

118
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:20,050
who married a felon
to get into the United States?

119
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:23,847
Why'd she have to come here, anyway?
No strip clubs in Whazitstan?

120
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,016
<i>- Officer Bellick...
- Captain.</i>

121
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,522
Fine. Do you mind conducting
your inquisitions on your own time?

122
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:32,234
- I've a schedule to maintain.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

123
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:36,032
I was just asking Mr Scofield
about the contraband

124
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:39,870
he had his stripper wife
trunk in the other day.

125
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:43,960
But you go ahead.
Yourjob's more important.

126
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,857
He's had it out for me since the day I got here.

127
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,569
- Hold still, please.
- Sorry.

128
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,676
I only married her
so she could get her green card.

129
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,307
I saw you coming out of the conjugal room.

130
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:24,438
That's just business.

131
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:27,025
You don't have to explain it to me, Michael.

132
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:29,111
I know.

133
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,200
But I want to.

134
00:11:40,337 --> 00:11:46,220
DB. Oh, is that who you is now?
I thought you was just a cowboy.

135
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:49,517
- Take a couple of steps back, boy.
- What I can't understand

136
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:52,063
is why somebody like you
wants to get out anyway.

137
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:56,360
How you gonna survive, huh?
The world's all different now. It's scary.

138
00:11:56,444 --> 00:12:00,867
They got computer phones, boobies made
of silicone. You wouldn't know what to do.

139
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,083
- I don't have to justify myself to you.
- Oh, you're gonna have to.

140
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:10,256
Them old bones is gonna be dragging us
down. Maybe I'll just snap a few right now...

141
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,929
- Take your best shot.
- Hey, break it up down there!

142
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:20,689
Bow out, cowboy.
I'm not gonna warn you no more.

143
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:49,172
<i>What's up?</i>

144
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:57,225
Records from the phone in the yard.
James Bagwell lives down in Gary.

145
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,771
- T-Bag's insurance policy?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:04,862
My guy's gonna lock him up in a moving van
for a couple of days until we're in the clear.

147
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:07,033
- Moving van?
- Yeah.

148
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:12,249
Don't worry. He can breathe, and all.
We do it all the time.

149
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,754
What about T-Bag?

150
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,674
He's no longer a threat. Trust me.

151
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,998
You James Bagwell? Got a delivery for you.

152
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:43,087
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

153
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,478
- You all right?
- Yeah.

154
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,650
<i>- Ma'am?
- Yes?</i>

155
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,195
- Can I speak with you, please?
- Of course.

156
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,117
You stay here, OK?
Is he gonna be OK?

157
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:09,458
<i>We don't know yet. I was gonna call
the police, I wanted to speak with you first.</i>

158
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,130
His wound is obviously
the product of a gunshot.

159
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:17,220
You need to be honest with me.
What was he doing when he got shot?

160
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,600
He was in the garage, underneath his car.

161
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,102
He's in surgery right now.

162
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:25,190
The blood loss has caused his muscle tissue
to suffer from a lack of oxygen.

163
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,652
He's sustained damage to his shoulder.

164
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,574
With a bullet there's
an increased risk of infection.

165
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:34,413
So he has to be admitted.
Is there anyone you should call? Family?

166
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:37,208
No. It's just me.

167
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,589
All right. Well, I'll let you know
as soon as he's in recovery.

168
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,593
Thank you.

169
00:14:58,492 --> 00:14:59,534
Yeah?

170
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:02,163
<i>- Are you there yet?
- Almost.</i>

171
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:09,758
Remember. Be patient, follow his lead.
We want the trifecta today.

172
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,306
Yeah, I'm on it.

173
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,871
<i>- It's me.
- Yeah, I got bad news.</i>

174
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:31,207
Yeah? Like what?

175
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,589
The job you ordered went bad.
The guy was paranoid, he had a gun.

176
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:40,303
<i>- One thing led to another.
- What? He's dead?</i>

177
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:43,224
Yeah. And unfortunately...

178
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:46,437
there was a kid there.

179
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:50,194
What are you... What are you talking about?
You killed a kid?

180
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:52,698
<i>It was unintentional.</i>

181
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:54,116
It's a kid, man.

182
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:56,202
<i>I know. I'm sorry.</i>

183
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,664
SOB used him as a shield.

184
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,504
- Boy or a girl?
- I don't know. A boy.

185
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,632
<i>How old?</i>

186
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:06,760
Four, maybe five.

187
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:20,655
- Who's here to see me?
- Hell if I know. Some lady.

188
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,705
Baby.

189
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,543
Hi.

190
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,590
You look so beautiful.

191
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,349
I came here cos I have to tell you something.

192
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,185
What?

193
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:42,647
I'm pregnant, Fernando.

194
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,072
Pregnant?

195
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:52,162
With your baby.

196
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:57,086
I'm gonna have your son.

197
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,469
You... You're gonna... We...

198
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:04,847
We're gonna have a baby?

199
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:07,309
<i>Oye, papi, you hear that?
I'm gonna be a dad!</i>

200
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,189
<i>- I'm not finished.
- What, mami? What?</i>

201
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:13,152
OK. Hector, he asked me to marry him.

202
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,906
- What?
- Look, it's crazy, I know.

203
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:19,285
Tell him no. Tell him you're having my son.
We'll be a family.

204
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,371
Fernando, look.

205
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:27,464
My mom, she says that having a baby
is the hardestjob in the whole world.

206
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,176
And it's even harder if I do this by myself.

207
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:37,730
And all I know is, I'm really scared.
I'm really scared to do this alone.

208
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:40,526
- You won't have to.
- Well, I haven't told him no yet.

209
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:44,948
Wait, wait.
You're not actually considering this?

210
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:49,165
Oh, baby. I don't know. I don't know.

211
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,085
My God, baby,
you gotta stop listening to these people.

212
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,464
They're poisoning your brain.

213
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:58,845
Your hormone things are out of whack.
You're not thinking straight.

214
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:02,225
This is our child we're talking about.

215
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:06,064
I want you to listen to me.

216
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:10,445
I want you to wait. I'm gonna be out.
Sooner than you think.

217
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:15,329
<i>- You keep on telling me that.</i>

218
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:19,876
All right. Visiting time is up. Let's go.

219
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:28,514
Tell me you're gonna wait.

220
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:30,391
Hands off, Sucre.

221
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:37,778
You're all I got left in the world, baby.
Please.

222
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:41,492
I love you.

223
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:45,831
But you'll learn to love again, right?

224
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,049
Tell me you're gonna tell him no, honey.

225
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,220
I don't know.

226
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,643
I don't know anything any more.

227
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,864
Sucre. Come on.

228
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:25,683
The kid's here.

229
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:29,897
<i>- Perfect.
- Follow him back to the lawyers, call me back.</i>

230
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,485
- Where you going?
- I'll be back in ten minutes.

231
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:32,827
- What do you have to do?
- It's complicated. I can't explain.

232
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:35,704
But if it works, you'll see soon enough.

233
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,418
I want to go with you. I want to see now.

234
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:43,217
Someone has to stay here. I need a lookout.

235
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:47,514
- I'm always on lookout.
- You're my cell mate.

236
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:50,395
Who else is gonna do it?

237
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,989
I'll be back in ten minutes. OK?

238
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,200
OK.

239
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:33,041
We're all lined up for tomorrow.
Where do you want him?

240
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:38,716
John. Tomorrow.
Where do you want T-Bag?

241
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,095
- In the shop or in the shed?
- Shh.

242
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,558
I don't care. You decide.

243
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:42,768
Thank God.

244
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:44,938
Are you OK?

245
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:49,863
Yeah. I'm OK.
She didn't do anything.

246
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,493
She didn't deserve it.

247
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:55,662
I know.

248
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:11,812
- Here you go, man.
- Yeah.

249
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:15,318
These were seriously hard to get.
What you need 'em for, anyway?

250
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:17,487
None of your business.

251
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:30,089
Thank you for waiting, Theodore.
I don't mean to deny your time in the yard.

252
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:32,509
What's this all about?

253
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:34,346
I, uh...

254
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:37,809
I'm afraid I have some terrible news.

255
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,901
Your cousin, James,
was shot and killed in his home yesterday.

256
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:46,615
His son, James Junior, was killed as well.

257
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,958
I'm very, very sorry.

258
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:04,432
What does it mean?

259
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:07,437
Am I chosen?

260
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:09,858
Or what?

261
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:14,698
Often, the Lord appears when
you're in particular need of forgiveness.

262
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:18,412
Maybe that's what's happening right now.

263
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,551
John, it's never too late.

264
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:31,597
If you agree to accept Christ into your heart,
and turn from your sin,

265
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:36,148
he will forgive you, and save you in eternity.

266
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:40,904
Do you agree?

267
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:50,460
Revelation, chapter three, verse 20.

268
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:55,676
"Jesus said,
'Behold, I stand at the door and knock."'

269
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,853
"'Lf any man hear my voice
and open the door, I will come in to him."'

270
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:24,427
He got to the infirmary building last night,
through the old sewer pipe.

271
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:27,850
It's the same pipe
that runs under the guards' room.

272
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,020
That's all I know.

273
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,195
<i>There's the little thumbsucker
that swiped my watch.</i>

274
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:39,116
<i>- Who? Tweener?
- Solid gold.</i>

275
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,120
Took it off my arm.
It was a half hour before I noticed.

276
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:46,502
Whose was it in the first place?
I don't care if you stole it. You can tell me.

277
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:49,130
Michael Scofield.

278
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:08,953
What are you looking at?

279
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:12,582
I'll be right around the corner.

280
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:30,282
<i>- Westmoreland.
- You scared me, boss.</i>

281
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:42,093
Get back to work.

282
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,200
All right, let's go.

283
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,017
Move it, Scofield.

284
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:31,751
"For me, I would call upon God,
and the Lord shall save me..."

285
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:35,297
"...cry aloud, and he shall hear my voice..."

286
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,638
"...he shall hear my voice... hear my voice..."

287
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,307
"...he shall hear my voice..."

288
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:45,938
"...hear my voice..."

289
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,861
He shall hear my voice.

290
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:24,328
<i>What are you doing?</i>

291
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:25,622
Nothing.

292
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,008
Well, keep an eye on the tier for me,
will you?

293
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,512
When are we getting out of here, exactly?

294
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:37,975
- I need to know the time.
- As soon as possible.

295
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:40,562
That's not a time.
You tell Abruzzi the time?

296
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:43,524
- He needs to know.
- Why does he need to know and I don't?

297
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:49,367
Because he's arranging the plane.
Why the sudden curiosity?

298
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:55,710
Why would you want to be responsible
for potentially dangerous information?

299
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:59,382
The less you know, the better.
It's for your own good.

300
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:08,311
I have to go. I'll meet you in PI.

301
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:22,374
Stealing from a guard.
You could get thrown in the SHU for that.

302
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:25,086
Maybe even add a few years to your bit.

303
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,385
- I don't know what...
- No, don't deny it. I already know it's true.

304
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:32,223
Lucky for you, I got some pull around here.

305
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:37,940
I can make this sort of thing go away,
like it never even happened.

306
00:31:41,945 --> 00:31:44,406
That's good.

307
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,411
Now...

308
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:53,754
I'm sure you've heard the word "rat".
I don't like it.

309
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:55,675
"Snitch", neither.

310
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:59,347
Those sort of words aren't appropriate
for what I need from you.

311
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,850
What I need is a little information.

312
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:05,856
Like when you're hanging out with Scofield...

313
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,277
Just come back and tell me what he said.

314
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,082
I got an extra burger.

315
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,175
But, man, I'm full.

316
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:28,389
So what do you say, kiddo?
Want a cheeseburger?

317
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:31,770
Or you want to go to the SHU?

318
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:41,617
That's my boy.

319
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:47,711
Hey, honey, what are you doing here?
I thought you left.

320
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,463
What's wrong?

321
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,091
I, um...

322
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:53,386
I been thinking.

323
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,267
- I think we need to make a change.
- What are you talking about?

324
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,271
When we got married,
we thought about moving out west.

325
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,483
Yeah, we were 22.

326
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:06,113
Well, maybe we should give it a shot.
It's not too late.

327
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:09,452
I don't understand. What brought this on?

328
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:11,915
It's just work.

329
00:33:11,998 --> 00:33:14,918
I'm tired of being on the road
working for somebody else

330
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:19,925
while you sit at home all alone night
after night. I want our lives to be about us.

331
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:25,350
I do too. But there's so much to think about,
with the kids and the house.

332
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:28,563
We gotta go.

333
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:31,151
You're in trouble, aren't you?

334
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,328
Oh.

335
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:40,457
Crowd has thinned out in here.

336
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,710
- How you doing, Sucre?
- Almost there. Switch me out.

337
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:45,880
You're up. Then Westmoreland.

338
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:49,971
We gotta get through,
Michael's gonna be coming back this way.

339
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:46,485
<i>Katie, go ahead and bring that up.</i>

340
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,718
<i>- Hello?
- Veronica Donovan?</i>

341
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:14,885
Who is this?

342
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,767
<i>I... It doesn't matter who I am.
Don't hang up.</i>

343
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:23,565
I have information
that you may be interested in.

344
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:27,154
Information that will lead
to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.

345
00:37:27,237 --> 00:37:30,785
<i>- What? What is it?
- I can't tell you that now.</i>

346
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:35,333
Meet me tomorrow
at the Highland Café on Kennedy Avenue.

347
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:39,171
<i>This isn't a trap.
I will tell you everything you need to know.</i>

348
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:41,343
Highland Café, eight pm.

349
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:53,443
All right. That's enough.

350
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,741
- Leave us alone.
- You sure?

351
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:59,244
Get out of here.

352
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:11,178
You don't have to do this.

353
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:13,390
You don't have to do this.

354
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:17,438
You don't have to do this.

355
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:21,735
You brought it on yourself.

356
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:26,075
I'm just an emissary
for all the pain and suffering you caused.

357
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:29,163
All the families you ruined. All the kids.

358
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:32,210
What about Jimmy?

359
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:35,757
He had nothing to do with this.
You didn't need to kill him.

360
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:38,510
And what about his beautiful son?

361
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:42,892
His whole life in front of him.
Why did you need to kill a beautiful child?

362
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:50,737
After all I've done, maybe I do deserve to die.
But you are no better than me.

363
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:54,534
But I can be. If I want.

364
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:59,542
God has given me the chance to choose.

365
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,713
What?

366
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:05,844
And maybe I should
give you a chance as well.

367
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,849
You should. Anything. Anything. Please.

368
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,186
Please.

369
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:15,274
Please.

370
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:17,569
Back out.

371
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:24,497
Of the escape?

372
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:26,166
Or die.

373
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:33,636
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't make it out there anyway.

374
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,600
Not with my proclivities.

375
00:39:37,683 --> 00:39:41,773
I want you to give me your word.

376
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,320
You hear me?
I want you to give me your word!

377
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:49,117
You got it. You got it, John. You got it.
Come on, you got it.

378
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:51,161
Swear.

379
00:39:51,244 --> 00:39:53,706
I'm out, I swear.

380
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,335
I swear to God.

381
00:39:57,964 --> 00:39:59,048
I swear...

382
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:01,219
I swear...

383
00:40:05,182 --> 00:40:07,353
All right. All right!

384
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:12,067
I have forgiven you. I have forgiven you.

385
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:21,164
You just have to pray
that the Lord Jesus Christ will do the same.

386
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,392
Hey, John.
You know, actually, about Jesus...

387
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:39,525
Say hi to him for me, will you?

388
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:52,503
- I'm through.
- Keep it up.

389
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:55,090
Come on. Stomp it.

390
00:41:05,857 --> 00:41:06,984
Bulls.

391
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:09,946
Oh... Hurry, hurry, hurry up.

392
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,285
Come on, come on, come on. Hurry, hurry.

393
00:41:13,368 --> 00:41:16,790
<i>- You gotta stall 'em.
- We're not ready.</i>

394
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:20,545
- Hey, boss.
- What you doing out here?

395
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:24,343
- Taking a break.
- I gotta check the status in there.

396
00:41:24,426 --> 00:41:27,347
- It's all good.
- Then you won't mind me checking it out.

397
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:30,519
Hey. Hey!

398
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:33,106
What the hell's your problem?

399
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:39,865
Hey, hey!
Step off or you're going to the SHU.

400
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,876
<i>Burrows! Get off him!</i>

401
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:48,712
Get off him.

402
00:41:48,796 --> 00:41:51,551
Get off! Get up.

403
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:10,036
Thanks.

404
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,958
Well, we leave tonight.

405
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:20,010
Where's my brother?

406
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:22,263
Michael, we got a big problem.
