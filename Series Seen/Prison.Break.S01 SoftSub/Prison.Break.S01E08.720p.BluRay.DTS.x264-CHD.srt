1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,878
<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:06,754
- I'm looking for Lincoln Burrows.
- Man killed the VP's brother.

3
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:09,378
- Why you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

4
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:10,713
I'll get you out.

5
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:13,340
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place.

6
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:17,674
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

7
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:22,301
<i>Nick Savrinn.
As of now, both of you are dead.</i>

8
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:25,885
This is Bellick.
Our wing has been breached.

9
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,428
Marilyn, no!

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:31,262
The chair isn't the only way
to take a man's life in prison.

11
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:34,681
- What?
- He's in trouble. There's nothing we can do.

12
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:35,349
Come on!

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,558
My first assignments on PI
were up here, cleaning out toxic mould.

14
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,684
PI didn't go there.
We'd never assign inmates to do that.

15
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:47,977
Tyler, Robert.
And this here must be your daughter.

16
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,186
- It's over. We don't need him.
- You're not gonna kill him.

17
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:58,732
One for the team.

18
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:09,605
<i>17 days from now,
they strap my brother to an electric chair.</i>

19
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,357
<i>Send 50,000 volts coursing through his body
for a crime he didn't commit.</i>

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,232
<i>I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen.</i>

21
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:25,319
<i>I've been in Fox River
nearly three weeks now.</i>

22
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:27,737
<i>In that time,
I've got out the back of my cell</i>

23
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:32,531
<i>and into the old steam pipes
that run beneath the prison.</i>

24
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,657
<i>Those pipes are our way out.</i>

25
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:41,200
Think of this place like it's a map of the US.

26
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,826
Our cell over there, that's New York City.

27
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,745
The infirmary, our exit, that's California.

28
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,746
- The pipes beneath us that connect the two...
- Route 66.

29
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,248
Route 66. Our ticket out of here.

30
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,707
- I assume we're doing this at night?
- That's right.

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,792
We're locked up, fish,
and your boy is in solitary.

32
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:07,043
How we just gonna fly out of our cages and
right into your cell, right into New York City?

33
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,670
You're not.

34
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,963
You're gonna meet me halfway.
In St Louis.

35
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:18,173
Route 66 runs beneath that building. It's the
only building sitting on top of those tunnels.

36
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:23,758
All we gotta do is get in there, on PI,
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.

37
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:27,760
Shortly after, we hit the infirmary.
Then we'll be outside those walls.

38
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:31,179
- What's in there?
- It's an old storage room.

39
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:34,972
<i>- John here can pull all the strings.
- It's not that easy, fish.</i>

40
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:39,765
That's a restricted area.
I gotta be able to justify it to the bulls.

41
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,850
There's gotta be some actual work
to be done in there for me to get in there.

44
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:57,189
New York, California, St Louis.
What are we discussing?

45
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:00,565
- We're talking baseball, actually.
- Oh.

46
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,314
Now, that's a subject I know quite a bit about.

47
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:06,276
What a shame. The conversation's over.

48
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:10,819
Really, now.
That any way to treat a team-mate?

49
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,531
I'm coming along on this endeavour
whether you like it or not.

50
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:22,615
Cos I got a hell of a singing voice otherwise.

51
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:27,742
I won't take that piece of crap along.
I won't do it.

52
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:29,326
Me neither.

53
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,203
We won't have to.
He'll be out of the picture soon enough.

54
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,705
The state provides $25,000 insurance,

55
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:42,038
plus donations from
the Corrections Officers' Foundation...

56
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:47,083
That's the last thing on my mind
right now, Warden.

57
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:51,167
- Do you know who killed him?
- We have some leads.

58
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:56,961
But I can promise you this. We are not
gonna rest until we find out what happened.

59
00:03:57,044 --> 00:04:02,046
His pictures are missing.
He had a photo of our daughter in here.

60
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:08,299
Not to worry. We'll find them.

61
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:13,718
I begged him not to take this job.

62
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:15,344
Shauna.

63
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:18,302
I am so sorry.

64
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:23,179
I'll walk you to your car.

65
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,224
Captain, I need to speak with you
for a second.

66
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:30,058
<i>I'll meet you in the hallway.</i>

67
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,601
I want the son of a bitch who did this.

68
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:38,227
Now, you do whatever
you need to do to find him.

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,396
You understand.

70
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:49,523
We got five boxes. Wanna give me a hand?

71
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:52,859
Veronica.

72
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:57,778
That call was scare tactics. They want to scare
us from doing what they know we can do.

73
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,194
- And what's that?
- Expose them.

74
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,028
Is this guy bothering you again?

75
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:06,072
No, Lukasz, the other night was my fault.
It was a misunderstanding.

76
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:08,240
OK. But if you need anything...

77
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:12,116
Trust me, you'll be the first person I call.

78
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,074
Here, let me.

79
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:21,994
Those boxes contain
seven years of criminal appellant work.

80
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:24,371
If there's a precedent in there somewhere

81
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:28,080
that can help us suspend Lincoln's execution,
we're gonna find it.

82
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,872
You can leave those by the door.
I'll bring them in.

83
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,125
Oh, that's OK. I've got your key right here.

84
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,416
If I didn't know better,
I'd say Lukasz was sweet on you.

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,919
Very funny.

86
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:53,262


87
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:30,241
- Fire.
- What?

88
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:34,158
- Fire. We burn the place down.
- How's that gonna help us?

89
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:39,994
A few years ago, the chapel burnt down and
the DOC realised they had some toxic issues.

90
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,622
You know, asbestos, lead paint, you name it.

91
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:46,956
They couldn't find a contractor
so they put the inmates on the job.

92
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,873
We spent, like, five, six hours
in there at a time.

93
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:55,084
But the good news is,
no guards came around almost at all.

94
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,960
Can you get us in there?

95
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:00,293
I've been doing a little, uh... thinking.

96
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:08,298
I'm gonna need a PI card, aren't I?

97
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:15,218
I mean, that's where
this whole thing is happening, isn't it?

98
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,551
It's on its way.

99
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:23,428
- You're slow-walking me, aren't you?
- Why would I do that?

100
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:28,097
You think Bellick's gonna pop me
for shanking that CO, Bob.

101
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:34,141
Maybe you'll take a little walk, tell him for
yourself? And I'll be out of here for good.

102
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:36,559
Well, I got news for you.

103
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:43,144
If I go down for killing Bob, believe me,
I'm gonna take a little walk of my own.

104
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:48,271
Tell 'em about that hole
you got behind your toilet.

105
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,607
So...

106
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:54,565
How about that PI card?

107
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:00,401
I don't know if you remember,
but that summer before fifth grade,

108
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:05,611
when I stayed with you a couple weeks, and
you thought I broke your glass coffee table?

109
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,072
<i>Mm?</i>

110
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,281
And when you came home, I denied it.

111
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:16,783
But you told me you could care less
about the coffee table,

112
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:19,532
you just didn't want me lying to you.

113
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:24,204
And you said I'd feel a lot better
if I just told you the truth.

114
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:28,121
- And you promised not to be angry.
- I remember.

115
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:32,205
Well, I broke it.

116
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,331
I know.

117
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:42,709
You know, if there's anything that you
want to get off your chest, you can tell me.

118
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:45,294
And I promise I won't get angry.

119
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:49,171
You want to know if I killed that guy.

120
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:56,798
I, uh, went there
planning to do something wrong.

121
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,468
But I didn't kill that guy.

122
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,552
Someone's working hard
to make it look like I did.

123
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:08,385
Anyway, there's a chance
the execution may not happen.

124
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:09,887
What?

125
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:16,349
Veronica's working on my case, and I got
a reporter coming who believes I'm innocent.

126
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,224
So I ain't dead yet.

127
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:22,017
LJ. Look at me.

128
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:26,101
You gotta have faith, kid.

129
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:29,436
Just have a little faith.

130
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:39,689
Kellerman.

131
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,733
<i>- Well?
- Taken care of.</i>

132
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:44,983
Good. Now move on to the second thing.

133
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:49,068
If you could see what we're looking at...
Burrows is gonna get the message.

134
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,611
Which is what you've assured me of before.

135
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:54,695
Yet that message
keeps getting returned to sender.

136
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,906
<i>Now move on the second thing
and report back.</i>

137
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,448
We're headed there now.

138
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:03,992
- You're thinking too much.
- Yeah. God forbid.

139
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:13,412
He'll toss every cell in this block
until he finds the killer.

140
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:17,038
He tosses this one, he'll find the hole
back there in a heartbeat.

141
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:19,456
I know.

142
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:22,540
<i>- We turn T-Bag in.
- That's the only way it'll stop.</i>

143
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,917
<i>We turn him in, he'll talk.</i>

144
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:33,044
So we're screwed either way, aren't we?

145
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,672
- Which one?
- Right there. St Louis.

146
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:11,017
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Cleanup detail. We thought this was storage.

147
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,311
This look like storage to you, idiot?
It's a restricted area, a CO break room.

148
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:17,270
Now back it up.

149
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:20,145
<i>- Back it up, now!
- Sorry, Officer.</i>

150
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:23,232
It won't happen again.

151
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,173
- A freakin' break room? Are you kidding me?
- They must have changed it since the retrofit.

152
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:44,631
- The bulls are camped out in there.
- Got a backup plan?

153
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:49,593
There isn't one. It's the only room
on top of that pipe. We gotta get back in there.

154
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,886
- Impossible, fish.
- Maybe not. Check it out.

155
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,513
<i>- I don't get it.
- How come they let him in?</i>

156
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:02,471
He's a trustee.
Ones with high security clearance.

157
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,307
- Why him?
- He can be trusted.

158
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,475
- How does one become a trustee?
- Have a spotless record for the last 30 years.

159
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,392
- Pretty much counts us out.
- Which means we've gotta get him on board.

160
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:15,478
Forget it. The guy's a boy scout.

161
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:23,814
Mr Westmoreland.

162
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:26,731
Hey, Michael.

163
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:29,065
You found your cat yet?

164
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,066
Still MIA.

165
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,902
- You could always get another.
- I don't want another.

166
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:39,153
Besides, it's a moot point.
She was grandfathered.

167
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,780
Once she's gone, no more pets.

168
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:45,406
Wouldn't be an issue
if you were on the outside.

169
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,031
Still tugging on that leash, eh?

170
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,199
Yup.

171
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:53,366
And this is the part
where I extend a formal invitation.

172
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,617
Cos you still think I'm DB Cooper?

173
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,745
I don't think. I know.

174
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:04,121
The way I see it, you're in here
doing 60 to life for vehicular manslaughter.

175
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:07,748
It would have been 20,
but the car you were in was stolen.

176
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:12,250
Felony murder rule cubes every sentence.
And here you are.

177
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:19,170
Hitting that woman was an accident.
But the car? No one accidentally steals a car.

178
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:23,921
So the question is, why would Charles
Westmoreland be in Arizona boosting a car

179
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:28,256
ten states away from where he lived,
and only ten miles from the Mexican border?

180
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:32,591
And why, two days before that, would
someone make a phone call to his wife

181
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:36,425
from a motel in Portland,
a stone's throw away from the airport

182
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:42,511
out of which, shortly after,
flight 305 was hijacked by one DB Cooper?

183
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:46,220
Seven hours after the hijacking,
records show Charles Westmoreland

184
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:49,556
was treated for a busted knee
at a free clinic in Brigham City.

185
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,599
Only way to get from Portland, Oregon
to Brigham City, Utah in seven hours

186
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:57,975
is in a car breaking every land speed record
known to man,

187
00:13:58,058 --> 00:13:59,685
or flying.

188
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:04,770
<i>It's public record DB Cooperjumped out
of that 727 about an hour after takeoff.</i>

189
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:10,773
Taking a dive at 10,000 feet with 1.5 million
in cash and a hastily packed parachute

190
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:13,273
might make for a pretty rough landing.

191
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:18,734
Rough enough to shatter some bones.
Maybe even a left knee.

192
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,610
DB Cooper would have
had a car waiting for him.

193
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,152
<i>According to DMV records, in 1971</i>

194
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:28,445
Charles Westmoreland was
the proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova.

195
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:33,074
As it happens, a '65 Chevy Nova
with the registration number scraped off

196
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:37,241
was found abandoned with a blown gasket
along the Arizona border,

197
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:40,575
a mile or two away from where
you accidentally hit that woman

198
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:43,578
with your stolen car.

199
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:48,997
- Interesting story.
- Interesting man.

200
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:52,873
But you didn't answer one thing.

201
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:54,746
What's that?

202
00:14:55,747 --> 00:15:00,166
Maybe I did hurt my knee,
I did steal that car,

203
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,710
and I did accidentally hit that poor lady.

204
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:08,336
But how could I have hijacked a plane
in Portland on November 24th

205
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,631
when I was in Folsom
finishing up a 30-day drunk and disorderly?

206
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:21,173
I hope you weren't hanging
this whole escape on that money,

207
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:24,385
cos I'm not the one in possession of it.

208
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,137
Thanks for the invite, though.

209
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:47,434
Veronica.

210
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:52,729
Veronica, come on.

211
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:59,314
We're OK.

212
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:02,483
How is this OK, Nick?
Somebody just tried to kill us.

213
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,608
- I know. I was there.
- Then act like it.

214
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:09,110
We just watched a man
burn to death right in front of us.

215
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:12,279
My God.

216
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,905
- Lukasz... My God.
- It's OK. It's OK.

217
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,864
We just left him there.

218
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:23,700
There was nothing we could do.
He was dead as soon as he opened the door.

219
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:28,201
I am trying so hard to understand all this.
Who these people are, what they want.

220
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:30,827
How we walked away
without calling the police.

221
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,245
We did it because these people we're
dealing with won't stop until we're dead.

222
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,539
If they think we're dead,
maybe we get a little breathing room.

223
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:42,623
- We should go to the police.
- I've been thinking the same.

224
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:47,208
But you know what?
They're bigger than the police.

225
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:53,043
We go to the authorities
we'll broadcast to them that we're still alive,

226
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:56,795
and then we got that target
right on our backs again.

227
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:59,463
We can't hide forever.

228
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:02,505
No, no. Maybe not forever. But...

229
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:07,382
I think I know a place we can,
at least for a little while.

230
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:12,467
We have to go in there ourselves then.

231
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:15,387
Like I said,
unless the old man's in it's not possible.

232
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:20,012
And even if it were, the guards in there
won'tjust sit back and watch us start a fire.

233
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:24,140
See, I already figured that part out.
I been thinking.

234
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,058
- And?
- That thing you're doing in the Pope's office.

235
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,974
- You using rubber cement?
- Yeah.

236
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:30,976
- Can you get some out?
- Maybe. Why?

237
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,351
Look, there's a coffee maker
in the guards' room, right?

238
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:37,396
I got a hook-up
with one of my boys in the kitchen.

239
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:43,604
If we can get rubber cement in the bottom
of that coffee pot, when the burner goes on...

240
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:50,400
It's a good idea. But without Westmoreland,
we're never getting in that room.

241
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,651
- He doesn't want any part of this?
- No.

242
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:57,194
Then what does he want?
He's gotta want something.

243
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:59,777
Everybody wants something.

244
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:11,303
<i>Come on, kitty. Come on.</i>

245
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,472
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

246
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:19,933
Yes. That's a good girl. Come on.

247
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,476
I don't believe it.

248
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:31,478
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

249
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:36,312
- Where'd you find her?
- In the yard, by the chapel.

250
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:40,190
Why do I get the feeling
there's a string attached to this?

251
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:42,940
Not a string. Just a favour.

252
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:50,569
- I'm not DB Cooper.
- That's all right.

253
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:54,403
Cos it's not gonna take DB Cooper
to do what I need done.

254
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:57,946
- What's that?
- All I want you to do

255
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:04,115
is take a certain coffee pot into the guard
room at a certain time, and turn the burner on.

256
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,449
Why?

257
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:10,035
Let's just say it'd be in everyone's
best interests if a fire were to start in there.

258
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:14,286
Marilyn, did you think
he was the arsonist type?

259
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,913
I'm not. I'm the cleanup crew type.

260
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:22,040
The type that gets access
to all kinds of tools.

261
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,417
Michael, I'm grateful for this, I really am,

262
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:31,626
but I've made it a point to keep my nose clean
ever since I walked into this place.

263
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:34,418
32 years without a blemish.

264
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:38,338
If that parole board date ever comes,
I want to be ready.

265
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:42,005
I can't jeopardise that. Sorry.

266
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,468
Michael.

267
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,592
Thanks, though. Really.

268
00:19:56,677 --> 00:20:00,305
After what you went through in the riot,
I thought you'd take a day off.

269
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,639
I'm fine.

270
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:07,015
I, uh... I couldn't find anybody
to cover for me, anyway.

271
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:11,349
I hope you don't feel
like you owe me anything.

272
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:13,100
I do.

273
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:15,269
I'm, uh...

274
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:20,313
I really appreciate what you did for me.

275
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,940
But?

276
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:34,275
But you told me that
you had been up in the crawlspace for PI,

277
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,276
and PI was never assigned to go there.

278
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,572
We're done here, right?

279
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:50,531
Michael, don't be like that.
I just... I just want some answers.

280
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,950
Thanks for the shot, Doc.

281
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,410
- Sue Parsons, Headline Press.
- Thanks for coming by.

282
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:04,620
- I appreciate you taking the time.
- I appreciate you looking at my case.

283
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:07,706
So what can you tell me?
From what I understand,

284
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,956
you have numerous people
working on your behalf as we speak.

285
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,875
Yeah. Um, well...

286
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:18,793
Veronica Donovan, she's my attorney, and
Nick Savrinn. He works at Project Justice.

287
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,252
Savrinn. OK.

288
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:27,379
- Have they gotten very far?
- Nothing to go to court with. Not yet, anyway.

289
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:32,256
You ever think it's just time to let go?
Accept what happened?

290
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,133
Let go, yeah.
Accept what happened? Never.

291
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:40,677
I mean, would you? If someone
had set you up, destroyed your life?

292
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:46,013
I guess I'm thinking in terms of the anguish
it's caused your friends and loved ones.

293
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:51,307
People who care about me believe me. That's
all that matters to me now. It's all I've got.

294
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:56,639
- You have a son. Lincoln Jr. LJ.
- Yeah. Why?

295
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:59,017
I have a source that tells me

296
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,393
if you accept what happened
and stop fighting your execution,

297
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,561
your son will be left out of this.

298
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:09,604
If not, I hope you said goodbye to him
when he left here this morning.

299
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:12,855
- Who are you?
- One Burrows is gonna die.

300
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:14,398
Up to you which one.

301
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:17,150
Who are you? Who are you?

302
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,733
Don't let her go! She threatened my son.

303
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:23,609
Please, no! Not my son!

304
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:36,907
- LJ Burrows?
- Yeah?

305
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,326
I'm Officer Hale, Juvenile Court.
We need to do a survey of the residence,

306
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:45,118
make sure your environment
reflects the terms of your probation.

307
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:49,368
- Your parents home?
- No, but they'll be home any minute.

308
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:53,247
Well then. I'll get started.

309
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:58,124
LJ and his dad.
You never said how it went.

310
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,082
Sounded fine. Everything a 15-year-old boy
tells his mother is fine.

311
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,044
No offence, but can I see
some kind of identification?

312
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:07,127
- Sure.
- LJ, we're home.

313
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:13,254
LJ, you here?

314
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:21,215
- Oh, my God.
- Drop the phone, lady.

315
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,426
This is the only warning I'm giving you.
Drop it.

316
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,217
Run!

317
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,343
No!

318
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:48,350
Pick up. Pick up, please.
Please answer, come on.

319
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,061
LJ? We're not here to hurt you.

320
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,773
Uh-uh.

321
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,982
911, send.

322
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:10,568
You really think you're gonna get
to four buttons before I get to one?

323
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:16,070
Come on.

324
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,405
LJ, get out of here!

325
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,369
Mom?

326
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:03,296
<i>- Where you going?
- What do you want?</i>

327
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,465
Cooperation. That's all.

328
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:09,758
You want cooperation?
I know what you look like, you son of a bitch.

329
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,132
- I'm going to the police.
- The police.

330
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:17,385
I don't think that's such a good idea, LJ, with
your prints on the murder weapon and all.

331
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:20,387
- I didn't touch the murder weapon.
- Of course not.

332
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,167
I know that, and you know that.

333
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:28,127
I don't think you'll have much luck
convincing Ballistics of that.

334
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,630
- Who the hell are you people?
- Just concerned neighbours.

335
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:34,292
Heard a bit of a ruckus at the Rixs' house.

336
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:37,002
Gosh, I guess we really
should have seen it coming.

337
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:41,003
All the signs were there -
drug use, decline in academic performance.

338
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:43,131
But we didn't think he'd do this.

339
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,840
<i>- No one's gonna believe that.
- Yes, they will.</i>

340
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:48,174
And when they catch you, and they will,

341
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:51,258
they'll try you as an adult.
You know what that means?

342
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,049
We can help you, LJ.
We're the only hope you got.

343
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,426
<i>No, you're not.</i>

344
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,847
She made that choice, not you.

345
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:11,015
Let's find the kid.

346
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,322
You got Marilyn back.

347
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,406
Sure did.

348
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,574
That's good.

349
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:31,033
- How long ago you quit smoking?
- Uh, a little over nine years now.

350
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:33,201
You don't mind, do you?

351
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:46,123
I feel a kinship with you, Charles.

352
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:53,084
More than any other con here.

353
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:56,753
And we've seen a lot. Haven't we?

354
00:26:56,836 --> 00:26:59,170
Sure have.

355
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:01,755
Then correct me if I'm wrong.

356
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:04,881
I've always treated you fair.

357
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:07,675
I've always appreciated that fact.

358
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:12,509
I'd known Bob since he was 18 years old.

359
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,761
I got him this job.

360
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,179
You can imagine how responsible I feel.

361
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:23,347
I can't help you with that, boss.

362
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,598
I think you can.
Word is he died in front of your cell.

363
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:31,767
<i>And you were right here when it happened.</i>

364
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:39,643
We've both been around
long enough to know

365
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:46,355
that when a con starts that snitching
business, he's not long for this world.

366
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:49,607
Don't put me in that position, boss.

367
00:27:55,858 --> 00:28:01,569
If you don't tell me who killed Bob
before I leave this cell,

368
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:05,820
our friendship goes with it.

369
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,658
That's a nice cat.

370
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:27,037
Westmoreland knows.
And his jaw ain't that strong.

371
00:29:13,723 --> 00:29:16,516
What's this?

372
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,850
Nothing.

373
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:21,975
- You stalker.
- I am not a stalker.

374
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:25,893
I just... I don't get it.

375
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:28,062
What is there to get?

376
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:30,437
He doesn't fit the profile.

377
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:34,856
Right? The man's got a graduate degree.
He lives in my neighbourhood.

378
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,564
Guys that like hang out in Streeterville,

379
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:40,609
they pay $200 for Cubs tickets.
They don't rob banks.

380
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:45,528
Maybe he couldn't afford season tickets.
Maybe that's why he robbed the bank.

381
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:48,444
Thank you. I'm actually being serious.

382
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:50,987
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

383
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:55,823
- Why do you care so much?
- Cos he lied to me.

384
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:58,448
They all lie to you.

385
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:07,952
Maybe because he's the one guy in here
I can actually get to.

386
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:11,996
The one guy I can make a difference with.

387
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:18,622
Go home, girl.
You keep burning it at both ends like this,

388
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:21,750
you're gonna drive yourself crazy.

389
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,916
Good night.

390
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:33,795
I'm sorry, Burrows. Both of them were dead
by the time the paramedics got there.

391
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:36,963
- What about my son?
- He's missing.

392
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:40,422
Police are treating him as a fugitive.

393
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:41,882
Fugitive?

394
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,549
They found his prints on the murder weapon.

395
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:48,719
That's impossible. I... I, uh...

396
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,636
- I need to call him.
- No, I can't do that.

397
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:55,303
- What do you mean? His life's in danger!
- Look, Burrows.

398
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,764
The police instructed me
that this is an ongoing investigation.

399
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:02,307
And as such, any contact
you make with your son

400
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,891
could potentially
aid and abet him as a fugitive.

401
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm sorry.

402
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:12,894
Warden, please!

403
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:19,814
<i>Front gate open.</i>

404
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:34,486
Let's go.

405
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:36,654
That's messed up, man.

406
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:39,821
- Jeez. Does he even know?
- I don't think so.

407
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:41,990
Man, here he is.

408
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:04,664
<i>Go ahead, toss 'em.</i>

409
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:17,211
What's up, T?

410
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,421
We're family, right?

411
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:24,838
Hell, yeah. We are.

412
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:28,382
Well, I'm in a quandary and I need your help.

413
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:30,799
Name it.

414
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,676
Bellick's squeezing
tighter and tighter round here.

415
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,385
Eventually somebody's mouth
is gonna start moving.

416
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,678
Thing is, Trokey, if I get popped for this,

417
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:46,263
what with my priors
and predisposition to violent behaviour...

418
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:50,558
I'll spend the rest of my life in the SHU.

419
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,558
But if you come forward,

420
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,727
with only a drug conviction
and a whole lotta remorse...

421
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,646
- I can't.
- I ain't finished.

422
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:06,356
No need. I ain't going down for murdering no
hack. I mean, you understand that, don't you?

423
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:08,272
You ain't mad, are you?

424
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:15,192
No, Trokey. I'm not mad.

425
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,640
I need out. I gotta find him.

426
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:40,429
You will. Both of us. Soon.

427
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:44,222
- They're coming after my family.
- You gotta trust me. We're gonna...

428
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,724
"We're gonna get this done." How?

429
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:49,974
Tell me, Michael. Tell me.
You can't, can you?

430
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:52,724
I gotta get outta here now. LJ's in trouble.

431
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:55,476
Scofield. How about it?

432
00:34:56,685 --> 00:34:58,852
Just stick with me.

433
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,691
Yo, Bruce. Hey.

434
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:14,983
<i>What's up, Ray?</i>

435
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:42,419
- If you go out there they will gun you down.
- I don't care any more.

436
00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:46,253
You better start thinking.
Cos you can't help LJ if you're dead.

437
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:50,088
What the hell's going on in here?
Huh? We got a problem?

438
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:53,216
- No.
- Well, then get on your feet. Let's go!

439
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:56,007
<i>- Fire!</i>

440
00:35:56,091 --> 00:36:00,301
Son of a... What the hell's
going on at building two? Come in.

441
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:03,344
<i>Fire in the CO break room.</i>

442
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:27,051
- Thanks.
- I didn't do it for you.

443
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:39,515
We found the source.
Someone in here smoke these?

444
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:42,059
Bilsons?

445
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:45,101
Bellick.

446
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:49,310
<i>- Captain Bellick?
- I've got someone to see you.</i>

447
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:52,854
What the hell do you want?

448
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:55,521
I know who killed Bob, sir.

449
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,608
Uh-oh.

450
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,325
I don't know how that got there.

451
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:28,035
It's a mock. It's a mock!
You set me up.

452
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:32,160
Bad enough that you killed a guard.
Don't try to lay it off on somebody else.

453
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:35,411
You set me up! He set me up...

454
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,293
- Wow.
- Your father lived here?

455
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:55,128
Yeah. He wanted some place
that was completely off the grid,

456
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:57,629
a place the government
didn't know existed.

457
00:37:57,712 --> 00:38:01,630
Tapped into the power lines.
A well supplies the place with water.

458
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,924
Last few years of his life
he barely left the property.

459
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:07,299
- It's...
- Yeah.

460
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:10,593
You spend so many years fighting
cops, prosecutors, judges

461
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:13,218
trying to take your freedom,

462
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:18,970
you use every cent you had in attorney's fees,
you wind up losing anyway...

463
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,846
15 years of his life.

464
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:27,183
Almost all of his son's childhood.

465
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:34,268
I guess I can forgive him
for wanting to hide away. Be left alone.

466
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:38,810
We'll be safe here
until we figure out our next move.

467
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,857
Hey, hold up here a minute. Hold up, here.

468
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,358
Seems to be a bit of confusion.
I'm supposed to be on this detail.

469
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:53,526
I don't think so.

470
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,777
Oh, John.

471
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,028
You can't be serious.

472
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:02,571
Not after our long, illustrious history
we shared together.

473
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:07,448
All those nights in New York City.

474
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,617
In California.

475
00:39:11,157 --> 00:39:13,701
In St Louis.

476
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:17,910
They were good times, weren't they, John?

477
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:22,871
Tell the badge here about 'em.
Cos if you don't want to...

478
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:25,247
I certainly could.

479
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:41,170
I want this place gutted. The dry wall's
gotta be torn out. Studs gotta be removed.

480
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,630
Boss, we've got some toxic issues here.
Asbestos to start with.

481
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:50,257
Take it up with the union. All I'm saying
is this room's your only priority now.

482
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,174
It better be brand spanking new
when you're done.

483
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:58,091
If anybody's thinking about getting cute,
trying to trunk one of these tools out of here,

484
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:01,470
Brady's got the outline
of every piece of hardware in here.

485
00:40:01,553 --> 00:40:04,887
And at the end of every day,
every single piece better match up,

486
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,180
or you're all going to the hole.

487
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:22,895
Let's go.

488
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:33,482
This goes down four feet.
Connects to the main line below.

489
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:38,859
All we've gotta do is widen it and
we've got ourselves an on-ramp to Route 66.

490
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:47,111
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
They're gonna hear this, man.

491
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,614
They won't.

492
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:02,451
Come on, pretty. We're a team now.

493
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:15,624
- Best get crackin', eh?
- You. Shut up.

494
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:38,256
<i>You really think you're gonna
get to four buttons before I get to one?</i>

495
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,933
<i>- I don't have my glasses.
- How about you read this for me?</i>

496
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:05,267
Tell me the news,
the latest developments.

497
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:10,226
Evidently there was an explosion in
a Gold Coast apartment in Chicago yesterday.

498
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,854
Gas line. Everyone inside was killed.

499
00:42:12,937 --> 00:42:14,979
<i>Shame. Anything else?</i>

500
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:18,814
How about that kid up in Oak Park,
the one who killed his parents?

501
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:20,981
- Oh, they got him.
- They did?

502
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:23,274
- He's in custody.
- Good.

503
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:27,443
I imagine heads would have rolled
if he hadn't been caught.

504
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:32,486
Lives would have been lost.
How about you hand that back to me?

505
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:37,988
Now that it's yesterday's news,
we can put it behind us, can't we?

506
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:42,198
Move on to the next chapter of our lives.

507
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:48,284
You're not just doing this for me, you know.
Or my brother.

508
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:50,492
<i>Yes?</i>

509
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:54,287
They're ready for you, Madam Vice President.

510
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,454
You're doing it for your country.

511
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:08,958
<i>- Madam Vice President...
- Madam Vice President, a question...</i>
