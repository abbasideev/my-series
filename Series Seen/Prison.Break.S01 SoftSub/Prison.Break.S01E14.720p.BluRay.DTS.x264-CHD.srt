1
00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:03,453
<i>My name is Michael Scofield.</i>

2
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:07,586
<i>My brother is facing the electric chair,
framed for a crime he didn't commit.</i>

3
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:11,222
What is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

4
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:13,026
The man killed
the Vice President's brother.

5
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:16,869
<i>After his appeals
were exhausted,</i>

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,336
<i>there was only one way to get him out.</i>

7
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:22,241
<i>This is the police.</i>

8
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:24,105
<i>Put down your weapon.</i>

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,204
Michael?

10
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:29,404
I'm getting you out of here.

11
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:32,576
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

12
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:35,018
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

13
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:36,349
I've got them on me.

14
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:39,857
<i>I've been at Fox River
nearly a month now.</i>

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,394
<i>In that time, I've assembled
a group that has all the resources</i>

16
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:45,089
<i>we need to not only break out,
but to stay out.</i>

17
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,323
I'm Michael, by the way.

18
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,333
- Dr. Tancredi...
- Tancredi like the Governor?

19
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,492
<i>While we dig on the inside,</i>

20
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,571
<i>our lawyer searches for the truth
on the outside.</i>

21
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:57,368
<i>I have information that will lead
to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.</i>

22
00:00:57,477 --> 00:01:00,810
Somebody on the inside
claims they can exonerate Lincoln.

23
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:02,671
Someone's been talking.

24
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:05,148
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

25
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:07,082
They're ready for you,
Madam Vice President.

26
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:17,619
<i>24 hours from now,
my brother is scheduled to die.</i>

27
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,757
<i>But the way I see it, 24 hours from now,</i>

28
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:22,528
<i>we'll be out of the country.</i>

29
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:23,966
He's there.

30
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:31,810
It can't be done.

31
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:33,807
We're not getting out of here.

32
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:38,848
Unfortunately, pretty,

33
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,613
that ain't an option.

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,587
You are gonna get us out of here.

35
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:58,835
Unless you're gonna use your shank
to take out the pipe, put it away.

36
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:01,031
I'm gonna put it in your neck,
you don't get us out of here.

37
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,735
- Bring it down a peg, T-Bag.
- Shut your mouth!

38
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:08,947
Remember, pretty,
I am serving life plus one.

39
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:11,876
So if I get busted for attempted escape,

40
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,577
I'm gonna throw in a homicide,
no problem.

41
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:15,813
That's like a parking ticket to me.

44
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:32,861
Yeah, I didn't want to throw up
on the floor, so I just came to the drain.

45
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:38,110
Just let me walk this off. I'll be fine.

46
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:41,840
Lincoln, there is no reason
for you to be here if your IV isn't in.

47
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,041
- Everything all right in here?
- It's fine.

48
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,287
Why isn't he cuffed to the table?

49
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:50,754
What's he gonna do, steal a cotton ball?

50
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:54,456
Can't have him walking around, Doc.
You know that.

51
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,339
What was that?

52
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,206
Put your wrist out.

53
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:18,243
You gonna turn this into something?

54
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:22,510
I'm not gonna say it again.
Put your wrist out.

55
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,700
Hey, Keith, come check this out!

56
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:22,945
Keith?

57
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:34,489
We got to go. Now. Give me the rope.

58
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:39,959
Give me the rope now!

59
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:45,293
Tie that off.

60
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,041
Let's just stay here, okay?

61
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:00,942
Okay, I'm down.

62
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:13,061
We gotta go, Michael.

63
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,930
Get down. Let's go.

64
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:34,153
- Did it break off or did someone break it?
- I don't know.

65
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,690
Here's the other half.

66
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:52,544


67
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,974
Hey, hey.

68
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,049
- What's up, Brad?
- Heading over to Sharkey's.

69
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:29,617
It's two-for Tuesday. Wanna hoist a few?

70
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,815
Man, I'd love to, but my wife is
cooking dinner and I told her I'd be home.

71
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:36,391
Wuss. Anybody else?

72
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,759
Suit yourselves.

73
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,829
Ain't none of the Sheetrock
in front of the break room been touched.

74
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:50,963
- The PI's are letting it dry out.
- Still?

75
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,142
Westmoreland!

76
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:39,380
I'm caught
on something.

77
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:42,983
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

78
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,837
Stay there! Stay down there!

79
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:14,055
- Why was this door locked?
- It wasn't locked, boss.

80
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:18,718
The fan kept pushing it open.
So we just had to wedge it closed.

81
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:24,424
You've been in here all night
not doing a damn thing.

82
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,660
The room is still wet, boss.
There's nothing we could do.

83
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,203
It's not like we've been having a picnic.

84
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,539
Bunch of shiftless, no-good convicts.

85
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,840
You got something to say, Scofield?

86
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,852
Wrap it up.

87
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:48,219
And all four of you,
get your asses back to the block.

88
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,328
Hey!

89
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:59,658
Get these nitwits back to the cell block.

90
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,548
You seem to be one light.

91
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:22,781
Right here, boss.

92
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,932
No, no. No way!

93
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,673
I should be halfway
to seeing my family right now!

94
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:46,207
Let's go.

95
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:54,820
Now!

96
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:42,126
Keep it moving. Move it.

97
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:44,033
Go, ladies.

98
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,273
Do you think he knows?

99
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:51,602
Lincoln?

100
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:04,892
I'm here with Henry Pope,
who is the warden of Fox River Penitentiary

101
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:09,260
where Lincoln Burrows is scheduled to die
by electrocution at 12:01 a.m. Tomorrow.

102
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:12,095
Warden Pope, can you tell me what's
gonna happen in the next few hours?

103
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:14,897
There are strict
Department of Corrections guidelines

104
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:17,165
that govern every aspect of an execution.

105
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:20,436
Measures taken to make sure that
the process goes as smoothly as possible.

106
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:21,635
Such as?

107
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,802
The correctional officers will do
a walkthrough,

108
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,380
we'll review the list of witnesses,

109
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:28,314
the chair will be checked and rechecked
to make sure there's no problem.

110
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,408
And Mr. Burrows himself.
Have you spoken with him?

111
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,079
What are his thoughts
in these final hours?

112
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:35,749
I'd say that's between him and his God.

113
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:36,916
And maybe the Governor.

114
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:40,086
I understand Burrows' attorneys
are going to request a stay.

115
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:41,527
I wish them the best of luck.

116
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,928
Does that mean you believe he's innocent?

117
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,125
It means...

118
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:49,097
I believe in the process
but I don't relish the prospect of

119
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:51,000
taking another man's life.

120
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:55,432
Whether it's just or not,
there's no joy that lies before us today.

121
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:57,341
<i>Okay, thank you very much, Warden.</i>

122
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,107
<i>And we will be here with you
throughout the night</i>

123
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:02,514
<i>watching and waiting to see
if Lincoln Burrows does in fact become</i>

124
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:07,487
<i>only the 13th person to be executed
in the state of Illinois since 1976.</i>

125
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:21,031
Just so you got one less thing
to worry about,

126
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:24,196
I want you to know I ain't mad at you.

127
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:30,877
Thank you.

128
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:35,806
- How long until...
- 16 hours.

129
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:40,322
Are his lawyers making any progress?
Is there still a chance with that?

130
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:44,825
No. There's only one person
who can really stop this execution.

131
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,519
Hey.

132
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:23,192
I need to see my brother. Just to talk.

133
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,360
For five minutes.

134
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,896
Yeah. Yeah. I'll try.

135
00:13:55,664 --> 00:14:00,101
I'm sorry. I'm told
that you have to wait until final visitation.

136
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:03,399
Would you talk to your father
for me, please?

137
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:10,272
Believe me, my father knows
where I stand on the death penalty

138
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,816
- and I'm just as clear on his...
- Sara... Dr. Tancredi, I'm sorry.

139
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:20,446
This isn't about the morality
of the death penalty. This is...

140
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:25,259
This is about killing an innocent man,
my brother,

141
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:28,126
and surely your father
can't be in favor of that.

142
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,460
Just talk to Lincoln's attorneys,
just for an hour,

143
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:33,592
and I swear to God
you'll be convinced of his innocence.

144
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:34,994
Michael,

145
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:38,701
I would pick up the phone right now
if I thought there was any chance

146
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:42,072
that I could make a difference,
but you have to understand,

147
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:45,880
I'm the last person in the world
that my father listens to.

148
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:48,643
He hates what I do,
he hates what I believe in.

149
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:53,188
And if I'm the one asking for clemency
for your brother, your brother won't get it.

150
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:08,535
I'm sorry.

151
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:22,594
Look, if Terrence Steadman
is still alive, Lyle,

152
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,565
then it can't be Terrence Steadman
buried in the ground.

153
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:28,069
Yeah, but a secret informant
claims that Steadman is still alive?

154
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,140
I don't know, Nick.
It all sounds pretty far-fetched.

155
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,470
You're his clerk, just get us on the docket.

156
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:34,976
Nick, you're asking him
to commit political suicide

157
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,674
by granting a stay of execution to
Illinois' most notorious death row inmate.

158
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:41,342
Officially, all we're asking
is for an exhumation order.

159
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,920
If he grants it, he can order a stay
until the tests come in.

160
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:45,545
An exhumation order?

161
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:49,148
Oh, well, that's better. Digging up
the Vice President's brother. No way.

162
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,194
Lyle, Lyle, look, we took Intro
to Civ Pro together, remember?

163
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:55,356
We studied for the Bar day and night
in that crappy little apartment of yours,

164
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,696
talking about how we were going to
make a difference.

165
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:59,234
Nick, you filed an 11th-hour motion,

166
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,531
and Judge Kessler's docket
is full this afternoon.

167
00:16:01,638 --> 00:16:03,868
Come on, Lyle,
everyone knows you run that courtroom.

168
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:06,204
You can't adjust things around a bit?

169
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,279
The informant that was killed yesterday,
I was there.

170
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,769
I know firsthand,

171
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:15,181
these people will do whatever they can
to frame Lincoln for Steadman's murder.

172
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,811
All we're asking is to be heard.

173
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,057
I'll give you 15 minutes this afternoon,
that's it.

174
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:26,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

175
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,558
Yeah, you're welcome.

176
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,573
- He doesn't even know what happened.
- He knows you tried.

177
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,805
- Do you think so?
- He's your brother. He knows you.

178
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,246
So, yes.

179
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,812
I promised
I would get him out of here.

180
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,614
You promised a lot of people, pretty.

181
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:54,282
- Enough, man, all right?
- This don't concern you, boy.

182
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,692
You don't get a man's hopes up
like that and then just...

183
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:00,730
Back up or I'll beat your skinny ass
into the ground.

184
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:03,465
And it wouldn't take much to do it.

185
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:08,733
- All right, ladies, rec time is over.
- Back on the block!

186
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,239
You owe me a ticket out of here, pretty.

187
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:15,240
And I will collect.

188
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:26,682
- I'm really sorry about your brother.
- Thanks.

189
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,319
Look, I know you were
counting on this, so...

190
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:32,190
Let me worry about my problems.

191
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:34,992
'Cause I know you've got enough
on your mind right now.

192
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,061
For what it's worth, over the years,

193
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:40,659
I've known a few men
who've sat on that chair,

194
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:44,502
and as the day gets near,
all you can really do is pray it goes quick.

195
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:49,638
Once, about 10 years ago,
there was a man caught a few sparks,

196
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,475
not enough to do the job.

197
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:56,179
Had to wait another three weeks
while they reset the whole process.

198
00:17:56,687 --> 00:18:00,623
And it may sound crazy, but he said
it was the worst three weeks of his life,

199
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:04,353
because it's not the lightning
that kills you, it's the wait.

200
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:08,296
So, take solace in the fact
that your brother's wait is over.

201
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:10,958
So if something happens to the chair,

202
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:13,464
he's got three more weeks?

203
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,038
There's a lot of protocol in killing a man.

204
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,002
A new death warrant,
another medical clearance.

205
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:21,100
A lot can happen in three weeks.

206
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:22,940
Yo, what scrapes, yo?

207
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:25,176
Thanks.

208
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,114
- What y'all talking about?
- Nothing.

209
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:35,991
Keep it together.

210
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,788
Go, keep it together!

211
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,893
I'm going in.

212
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,163
It's daytime.

213
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:50,703
I'll hang a sheet.

214
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:28,936
Do you have any questions about
what's gonna happen tonight?

215
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:33,913
When I get to eat,
when I'm supposed to walk,

216
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,219
how it's gonna feel
when they tighten the belts.

217
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,550
Any of that gonna help come midnight?

218
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:41,655
Some feel it's best to be prepared.

219
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:45,761
- How's Michael?
- He's anxious to see you.

220
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,962
Unfortunately, we've been told that
that's not possible until final visitation.

221
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:58,606
- You've been through this before?
- No.

222
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:04,111
Just so you know,
a doctor needs to be present, so,

223
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:06,949
for what it's worth, I'll be there tonight.

224
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,780
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yeah. What?

225
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,419
When I'm gone, can you

226
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:15,983
look out for my brother?

227
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:55,360
What were you doing back there?

228
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:06,806
- So you like doing that, too?
- Dipping a fry in the shake? Hells, yeah.

229
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,212
Good times. Good times.

230
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,048
So what's going on out there?

231
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,715
Nothing, you know,
just staying out of trouble.

232
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:20,222
I meant in terms of any office gossip
you might have for me.

233
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,489
Yo, check it.

234
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:26,153
This one fool has been trying
to cop a joint.

235
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:28,424
So, I'll keep ear-hustling for that.

236
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:34,730
We had an agreement. You were supposed
to bird-dog Scofield and get back to me.

237
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:39,036
I been trying, man, I've been working
the corners. Trust me. I ain't got nothing.

238
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:41,440
I seen you talking to him in the yard,
him and the geezer.

239
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:44,514
Yeah, I talked to Scofield,
but he ain't told me nothing.

240
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:47,276
Then it's 100 bucks
for the burger and fries.

241
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:51,980
- Boss, you know I ain't got no money.
- Then you better start selling your ass.

242
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:55,122
100 bucks by the end of the shift,
or there's gonna be a bidding war

243
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,352
to see who gets you as their new cellie.

244
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:58,792
Beat it.

245
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,074
In the yard today,
I did hear Scofield say something.

246
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,381
And?

247
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,614
He said if something goes wrong
with the chair,

248
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:28,287
his brother gets three more weeks to live.

249
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:36,232
We're square. Get out of here.

250
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:59,414
- How's it going in here?
- Ready for liftoff.

251
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:01,047
- Chair is working?
- Yeah. Why?

252
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:02,125
Run a test.

253
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:05,524
I already did. The electrical contractor
signed off on the diagnostic this morning.

254
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:07,324
- We're good to go.
- Run it again.

255
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,058
- Why?
- Run it.

256
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:20,366
It ain't working.

257
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,705
Son of a bitch.
I don't know what could've happened.

258
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:35,286
So once they redo all the paperwork,
your brother gets three more weeks.

259
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:36,359
Right.

260
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,427
- So we got time, then.
- Not a lot. But some.

261
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:40,155
Are we still going through the infirmary?

262
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:43,460
If I corrode that pipe again,
they'll know something's up.

263
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,391
You got another way?

264
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:48,830
Right now I'm just worried
about getting through tonight.

265
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:08,248
Careful. There's 2,000 volts
running through that thing.

266
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:13,553
Oh, God.

267
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:22,699
I came in here a man. Give me
the strength to walk out of here a man.

268
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:25,775
I came in here a man. Give me
the strength to walk out of here a man.

269
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,172
I came in here a man...

270
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:31,208
I came in here...
Give me the strength to walk...

271
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:32,679
I came in here...

272
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:35,815
I came in here...

273
00:24:44,794 --> 00:24:46,056
I want to see my brother.

274
00:24:46,162 --> 00:24:49,063
- When we move you to final visitation.
- When's that?

275
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:51,132
Right after we do this.

276
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:55,093
Just...

277
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,770
It's your last day, Linc.

278
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:02,943
I'd prefer to keep you out of cuffs
as much as possible, but

279
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,407
I need some assurances.

280
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,579
You've always been straight up
with me, Stolte.

281
00:25:11,054 --> 00:25:12,385
You have my word.

282
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:24,397
Your Honor, from the outset,
Mr. Burrows' case has been tainted

283
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:27,095
by conspiracy characterized
by destruction of evidence,

284
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:29,262
distortion of the truth
and witness intimidation.

285
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:31,237
Again, Judge, I have to object.

286
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:34,538
These are some serious accusations
with absolutely no proof.

287
00:25:34,644 --> 00:25:37,169
No proof? What have I been arguing
for the past 20 minutes?

288
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,338
You got me.

289
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:41,245
Judge Kessler, Mr. Tucci
might not appreciate the weight

290
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:43,581
of what we've just presented,
but surely you must.

291
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,952
As Miss Donovan stated,
a top video forensic analyst

292
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,490
has disputed the authenticity
of a surveillance tape

293
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:51,924
that was the key piece of evidence
in convicting Lincoln Burrows.

294
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:54,019
That's the tape
that no longer exists, right?

295
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,961
Because your client had it destroyed.

296
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:59,627
Unless my client is a rusted water pipe
in the County Records Office,

297
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:00,828
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

298
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:03,599
Judge, Miss Donovan's apartment
was blown up in an attempt

299
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:05,174
to silence both her and me.

300
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:08,608
That was independently corroborated
as a gas leak, Your Honor.

301
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:10,906
Judge, a month ago,
a Secret Service agent

302
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:13,209
named Paul Kellerman visited my office.

303
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:17,275
I saw Kellerman last night, when he shot
and killed another agent, Daniel Hale,

304
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:20,823
right after Hale told me that
Terrence Steadman was alive and well.

305
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:24,587
Your Honor, I'm presenting to the clerk
an affidavit from the director

306
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,594
of the Secret Service Agency.

307
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:29,563
It states that at no time
has there ever been

308
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,929
an agent of that organization by the name
of Paul Kellerman, or Daniel Hale.

309
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:37,006
In addition, there were no other witnesses
to this shooting.

310
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:40,736
No bullets were found, no blood,
no shell casings.

311
00:26:40,844 --> 00:26:44,678
The only witness to this alleged murder
is Veronica Donovan,

312
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:47,612
Lincoln Burrows' ex-girlfriend.

313
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,878
Now, Your Honor, I feel for Miss Donovan.

314
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,453
- Save it.
- I do.

315
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,884
But desperation causes desperate acts.

316
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:57,459
And that's what we're seeing here today,
Your Honor.

317
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,723
My client,
the Vice-President of the United States...

318
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,263
Judge Kessler.

319
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:07,002
Do either of you have any evidence
that is admissible?

320
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:09,003
Even just tangible?

321
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,595
Your claims, if true, are terrifying.

322
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:13,574
But anything or anyone
that could verify your story

323
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:16,167
is either gone, missing or dead.

324
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,950
I know time is of the essence.
I'll reserve judgment for now.

325
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:27,746
I'll take your arguments
into consideration,

326
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:30,382
and I'll have a decision within a few hours.

327
00:27:36,332 --> 00:27:40,462
These little bastards are the bane
of my existence, I swear to God.

328
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:41,761
You get this a lot?

329
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,771
Yeah, they're attracted to the heat
when they're cold,

330
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:45,636
plus, they got collapsible vertebrae
or some deal,

331
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:48,336
so they can squeeze through a crack
yea big, if they're determined.

332
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,572
And he shorted out the wire
just by biting on it?

333
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,309
Not by chewing on the wire alone,
but if the tail touches metal,

334
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:57,682
it acts as a ground, and boom, fuse pops.

335
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,518
- Along with the rat.
- I'll be damned.

336
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:02,352
So, can you change the fuse?

337
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,256
Yeah, there's another one right here
in the box.

338
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,554
Can you do it now?

339
00:28:05,662 --> 00:28:08,460
Right after I notify the state
and fill out the paperwork.

340
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,192
Now, hold up a minute.

341
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:12,493
Both of you.

342
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,532
We're gonna give more time to a guy
who killed the Vice President's brother?

343
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:21,203
- This guy's a terrorist.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

344
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:24,175
Forget about losing our jobs,
we could all face charges.

345
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,248
Only the three of us know.

346
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,780
Real easy to keep it that way.

347
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:39,390
It's your guys' call.

348
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:47,234
How much longer?

349
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,635
- Six hours.
- Open on 40!

350
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:59,347
Scofield, your brother's gonna be
transported to final visitation soon.

351
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:01,246
You can meet him there.

352
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,649
You look surprised.

353
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:08,688
You knew it was scheduled today.

354
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,090
No, I...

355
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,630
You were saying?

356
00:29:57,674 --> 00:30:01,337
They'll be transporting you
to final visitation in a minute.

357
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,247
Thanks for keeping your word, Linc.

358
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:38,947
Linc, you're gonna have to change
into these.

359
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:41,372
What's that?

360
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:45,113
At the moment of death,
the body becomes incontinent, so...

361
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:47,218
- It's a diaper?
- Yeah.

362
00:30:48,257 --> 00:30:49,918
You need to wear it.

363
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:51,821
Make me.

364
00:30:56,699 --> 00:31:00,658
Good look, huh? It's for the electricity.

365
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:03,197
Hair gets in the way or something.

366
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,946
I did everything I could.

367
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:13,671
I know you did.

368
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:21,688
Last time I had my head shaved
was when I was running with Derek.

369
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,952
- Remember Derek?
- Uh, yeah.

370
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:27,922
Bet me 40 bucks I wouldn't shave it.
I said, make it $100.

371
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:29,064
Still owes me.

372
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:34,499
- Have you heard from Veronica?
- She's supposed to be coming.

373
00:31:34,604 --> 00:31:36,663
- Is there any news on the appeal?
- Don't know.

374
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:37,797
'Cause there could still be a...

375
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:39,670
Stop, Michael, please.

376
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:43,335
This thing's gonna happen.

377
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:46,808
I got to get my head straight.

378
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:51,712
Let's just share memories, swap stories,
talk about the damn weather,

379
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:54,984
anything but torturing myself
with the idea of hope.

380
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,392
I can't take it anymore.

381
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,227
All right.

382
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:06,233
- You can't go, LJ.
- I don't care. I have to see him.

383
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:08,860
You can't go to the prison.
You'll never make it through the gate.

384
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:10,029
There will be cops everywhere.

385
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:13,074
Look, you got to wait until
we get all this cleared up, all right?

386
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:18,611
It's the judge's clerk.

387
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:21,345
Lyle, what do you got?

388
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:23,712
Yeah.

389
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:28,584
- Thanks, man.
- They ruled against us.

390
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:29,749
Yeah.

391
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:33,055
- I'm gonna go and see him.
- I'm gonna stay here with LJ.

392
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:36,325
- You gonna be okay going alone?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

393
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:40,232
Tell Lincoln... You know, just, we tried.

394
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:47,309
Go to the back room. Go!

395
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:59,621
You're the attorneys for Lincoln Burrows?

396
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:18,503
You letting me win, Michael?

397
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,109
- No.
- Show me your cards.

398
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,270
- I'm not gonna show you my cards.
- Show me your cards.

399
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,781
- I'm not gonna show you my cards.
- Give me your cards.

400
00:33:29,118 --> 00:33:30,949
- Gin.
- Funny, that.

401
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:35,148
Three out of five.

402
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:40,961
- How often would you make those for LJ?
- Whenever I had him on weekends.

403
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:43,699
May be the only decent thing
I ever did for him.

404
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,997
- No. You were there for him.
- Not enough.

405
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,133
I don't know how I can
stomach this stuff before...

406
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,285
We lost the appeal.

407
00:34:15,631 --> 00:34:17,929
Your friend Sara came by, though.

408
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:20,793
- Did she hear you out?
- She did.

409
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:23,133
- Is she gonna talk to her father?
- I sure as hell hope so.

410
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,571
It doesn't matter anymore, guys.

411
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:28,232
You've done more than enough for me.

412
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:30,436
That's the most important thing.

413
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:33,243
I couldn't bring LJ.

414
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:35,710
I know.

415
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:40,055
I can get him on the phone, though.

416
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:42,013
What do I say?

417
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,629
LJ. It's your dad.

418
00:34:58,074 --> 00:34:59,200
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

419
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:02,106
LJ. So this is it.

420
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:03,535
Yeah.

421
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,412
<i>I... I want you to</i>

422
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:11,045
stick with Veronica and Nick
and clear your name. You'll be all right.

423
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:13,487
I wish I could be there, Dad.

424
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:16,985
Me, too.

425
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,423
'Cause there's something
I want to tell you.

426
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:24,493
<i>- What's that?
- I had a dream last night.</i>

427
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:28,499
<i>You and me were working on a house,
pounding nails.</i>

428
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,367
And in the dream,

429
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:33,968
it felt like we were older.

430
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,870
<i>It was so clear. The whole dream.</i>

431
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:41,240
<i>And when I woke,</i>

432
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:45,152
<i>I knew that today
wasn't going to be the end.</i>

433
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:47,447
That...

434
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,891
That we'll see each other again, Dad.

435
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:52,991
<i>I know it.</i>

436
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:56,397
I love you, Dad.

437
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:07,908
Those numbers support Burrows' claim

438
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,240
about Terrence Steadman's
pending indictment.

439
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:13,804
Now, with the related murders,
and then the confidential informant,

440
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,942
I just wanted to make sure that
you were fully aware of the circumstances.

441
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:18,850
I'm fully acquainted
with the Burrows case, Sara,

442
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:20,445
but I never heard about any of this.

443
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:23,616
Well, I hadn't either, until I spoke
with Burrows' attorneys this afternoon.

444
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:25,318
And I understand
that most of this evidence

445
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:29,023
is technically considered circumstantial,
but I think you'll agree it's hard to ignore.

446
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:30,655
And how did you get involved
with all this?

447
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:33,234
These men are my patients.
It's my job to advocate for them.

448
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:35,861
Come on, Sara. How many of these guys
say that they are innocent?

449
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:37,337
Eighty, ninety percent?

450
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:41,034
It's not like you're asking me
for a new bike here, kid.

451
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:44,075
Being tough on crime,
capital punishment,

452
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,740
it's all part of a philosophy
that I believe in.

453
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,148
Part of a philosophy that I campaigned on,
was elected for.

454
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:55,353
I have to go back to Fox River.

455
00:36:55,524 --> 00:36:57,185
I have to be there when they kill this man.

456
00:36:57,293 --> 00:37:00,023
The least you could do is review his case.

457
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:03,259
And, Dad, if it helps,
pretend it didn't come from me.

458
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,041
I've never given a damn
about what people thought of me.

459
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:17,544
Never. The last couple of days...

460
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:20,005
I gotta admit, you know...

461
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:26,485
Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth,

462
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:28,948
Lincoln Burrows.

463
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:32,384
I'm gonna go down in history
with these freaks.

464
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:37,998
Bitch of it all is I didn't do it.

465
00:37:41,704 --> 00:37:43,467
I didn't do it!

466
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:00,444
I didn't do it.

467
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:16,769
It's time.

468
00:38:58,514 --> 00:38:59,708
Warden!

469
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:02,846
- What is it?
- It's the Governor.

470
00:39:09,758 --> 00:39:11,225
Yes, Governor.

471
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:29,810
Okay. I understand.

472
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:34,480
The Governor has
reviewed your case fully.

473
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:38,244
He's not granting clemency.

474
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,558
Let's proceed.

475
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:02,100
You did your country and your party
a great service.

476
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:05,075
It won't go unnoticed.

477
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:08,617
- Thank you, Madam Vice President.
- Thank you, Governor.

478
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,630
Can't go past here.

479
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:33,204
Once he's in the death chamber,
you'll be escorted to the viewing room.

480
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:36,806
Can I...

481
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,138
Yeah.

482
00:40:51,393 --> 00:40:54,294
I've loved you
since the first time I saw you.

483
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:04,168
Uncuff him.

484
00:41:34,603 --> 00:41:36,093
Let's go, son.

485
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:46,271
<i>- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- Swear to me.</i>

486
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:47,440
<i>I swear to you, Michael.</i>

487
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:51,217
<i>Preparation can only take you so far.</i>

488
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,821
<i>After that,
you gotta take a few leaps of faith.</i>

489
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:00,595
<i>Don't give up on me.</i>

490
00:42:01,497 --> 00:42:04,398
<i>- What if something happens to you?
- You just have a little faith.</i>

491
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:06,567
<i>Just have a little faith.</i>

492
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:09,832
<i>How about every Sunday,
we have our own special breakfast?</i>

493
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:11,996
<i>- Just you and me.
- Yeah.</i>

494
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:15,275
<i>- Give me your hand.
- You gotta have faith, LJ.</i>

495
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,008
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

496
00:42:22,818 --> 00:42:24,149
I came in here a man.

497
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:27,279
Give me the strength
to walk out of here a man.
