1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:03,485
<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:06,993
There's a whole lot of real estate
in between here and the outside walls.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,769
The infirmary's the weakest link
in the security chain.

4
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:14,068
These were seriously hard to get.
What you need 'em for?

5
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:15,528
None of your business.

6
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:19,787
If I'd known how this was gonna turn out,
I'd have gotten some crap job with the feds.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,541
Keep talking like that,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

8
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:25,298
- We gotta go.
- You're in trouble, aren't you?

9
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,718
<i>- Veronica Donovan?
- Who is this?</i>

10
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:31,559
I have information that will lead
to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.

11
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:33,730
I gotta check the status in there.

12
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:37,822
- It's all good.
- Then you won't mind me checking it out.

13
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:42,497
Get off of him! Get off. Get off.

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,255
- We leave tonight.
- Michael, we got a big problem.

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,009
Argh! Argh!

16
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,064
- Back out.
- Of the escape?

17
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,194
Or die.

18
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,944
<i>- Stay with me, John.
- I need you to stay with me. Breathe.</i>

19
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:12,245
Keep breathing.
You're gonna be OK. Keep breathing.

20
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:17,964
Stay with me, John.
You stay with me, John. You stay with me.

21
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:19,927
Stay with me.

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,018
All right? Can you do that? Keep breathing.
You'll be OK. Stay with me.

23
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,188
Almost there. Almost there.

24
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,379
Be OK.

25
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:45,308
<i>Large laceration to the throat.</i>

26
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:48,607
<i>- He's lost a lot of blood. He's hypovolemic.
- Got it.</i>

27
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,652
- What's his blood type?
- A neg!

28
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,492
His blood pressure's too low.
He's definitely hypovolemic.

29
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:58,834
- We gotta get him to Chicago.
- Chicago's a 20-minute flight.

30
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:04,052
We gotta go, Doc.

31
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:25,177
And then there were six.

32
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:30,604
Far as I know, there's five.

33
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,160
Don't you ever step up to me like that again.

34
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,163
Who's the tough guy now, huh?

35
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:56,278
Warden, where's my brother?

36
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,448
He's in a lot of trouble, son.

37
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,161
You have to let me see him.

38
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:03,124
That's not a request
I can grant at the moment.

39
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,754
Please.

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,974
We're 36 hours away from his execution.
He panicked. He got violent.

41
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:16,066
For the rest of his time at Fox River,
we're gonna keep him in ad seg,

44
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:25,667
It's not your right to see him...
until tomorrow...

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,256
at his execution.

46
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,975
I'm sorry, son.

47
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:44,822


48
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,933
The name is John Abruzzi.

49
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:18,149
A-b-r-u-z-z...

50
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,196
I don't care what protocol is.

51
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,159
I just want to know if he's OK. Hello?

52
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,039
Hello?

53
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:27,000
Coño.

54
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,059
The hospital won't give out any information.

55
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:42,572
Wonder what happened to him. Maybe them
Mafia chickens came home to roost after all.

56
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:46,210
- We gotta put this on hold.
- We're not putting nothing on hold.

57
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:50,426
I don't think you heard me. Until
I get my brother out, no one's doing a thing.

58
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,515
God bless Sink, but the man is gone.

59
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:56,814
You go to the tombs, you don't get out,
not until they strap you up.

60
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:01,615
If you think I'll leave my brother behind,
you have massively underestimated me.

61
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:02,742
- Really?
- Really.

62
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:05,540
That ain't my fight.

63
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:09,630
I'm through that hole, pretty,
with or without you, next time I'm on PI.

64
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:13,137
We're not having this debate.
We're not having this debate.

65
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:16,768
We oughta open the floor to everyone else,
see what they all say.

66
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:22,154
We got a clear shot. Every day we don't use
that hole is another day the screws can find it.

67
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,996
- The way is not finished.
- We're clear to the infirmary.

68
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,875
That's all we need.

69
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,423
Through that window,

70
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:34,386
over that wire, over that wall.

71
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:37,600
The two of you will never make it.

72
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:40,188
Oh, fish, it's notjust two.

73
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:46,869
If it's now or never, we gotta go.

74
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:49,666
Go with us.
You've done everything you could.

75
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,298
They're grown men, Michael.
They can all decide for themselves.

76
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,801
- You son of a...
- Wait a minute!

77
00:05:55,885 --> 00:06:00,811
- Hey! Who are you separating there?
- Hey, it's good, boss. Just playing around.

78
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,192
It's all good.

79
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:09,537
There are two things
that everybody needs to get with.

80
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:14,171
First, hillbilly,
you have got to learn some respect.

81
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:18,054
The man here made everything possible.

82
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:24,190
And you, you're gonna have to get with
that we are doing this thing this afternoon

83
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:27,238
as soon as we get on PI.

84
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:31,955
So you're just gonna make a run for it
in the middle of the day.

85
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,837
Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, huh, baby?

86
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,969
 You are gonna screw
this whole thing up.

87
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:42,600
That's not for you to decide any more.

88
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:47,025
Now, this train is leaving the station,
and I suggest you get on it.

89
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:49,029
Get on the train, fish.

90
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,950
Get on the train.

91
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:56,252
Well, you know what, you sons of bitches?
I won't let you do it.

92
00:06:56,335 --> 00:07:00,843
What you gonna do?
Blow the whistle on your own escape?

93
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,688
He'll be back.

94
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:42,966
Those guys, they go before us tonight,
they use that hole, it's over.

95
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,807
COs will turn this whole place upside down
till they find it.

96
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:50,480
Well, sounds like you're thinking about it.

97
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,739
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.

98
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,744
I want to be out of here yesterday.

99
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,583
I got a kid coming, man.

100
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:07,639
Michael, you can't get him out of there.

101
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:19,245
Can I say something?
I know you won't want to hear it, but...

102
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:21,999
they're strapping him up either way now.

103
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,672
Once he's gone,
you'll be stuck here for another five years.

104
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,179
If they trace the hole back to you,
they'll toss another dime.

105
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:31,976
<i>That's 15 years, papi.</i>

106
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:40,368
Of course, if I were you,
I wouldn't leave my brother behind either.

107
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,663
Not to die like that, no.

108
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:45,167
Uh-uh.

109
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:51,305
Worst thing in the world they can do to a man
is strap him to a chair like that.

110
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,169
- We're in business.
- What?

111
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:12,680
I just spoke to a friend who's a clerk at the
superior court. I told him about the informant.

112
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:16,519
If he gives any evidence to warrant a stay,
my friend will hear us out.

113
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:19,610
- We might be able to stop this.
- I gotta tell Lincoln.

114
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,156
Go to that prison, they'll be all over you.

115
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:27,583
They've kept us on the run because if anyone
hears from us, we can do them damage.

116
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,466
Maybe it's time
we do the exact opposite - go big.

117
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:34,679
What do you mean, "big"?
You mean media big?

118
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,683
We got all the ammo we need.

119
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,940
There's a string of murders connected to this.

120
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:43,404
Are you ready to show your face again? Huh?

121
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,284
Are you ready for that?

122
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:49,291
It's the bottom of the ninth.
What else are we gonna do?

123
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,795
<i>Hello?</i>

124
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:17,804
- Hey. This is Daddy, baby girl.
- Daddy!

125
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:20,560
<i>Daddy's on the phone.</i>

126
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:26,404
- How are the camels?
- Oh, well, the camels... the camels are fine.

127
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:30,745
<i>- When do I get to see you?
- Earlier than I thought.</i>

128
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,250
Daddy said he's coming home soon.

129
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,426
Hey, put Mommy on the phone.

130
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:41,140
Thank you, sweetie.

131
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,439
First Sergeant Benjamin Miles Franklin,
how are you?

132
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:50,576
Oh, baby. Just driving trucks, eating dates,
trying to keep the sand out of my eyes.

133
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,331
I saw on the news the other day
it was 110 in Kuwait.

134
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:57,255
- You must be melting over there.
- You have no idea.

135
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,888
What's this about you coming home?
You're not getting your daughter's hopes up?

136
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:05,645
- You sitting down?
- Sure.

137
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,900
Your man is coming home this week.

138
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:11,824
This week? What are you talking about?
They said it'd be another year.

139
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:14,371
The orders just came down the pipe.

140
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:17,251
And the hell if I care
where they came down from.

141
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:21,803
<i>- All that matters is we'll see each other.
- When? When is this happening?</i>

142
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:25,141
Thursday, Friday. I'm not sure yet.

143
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,813
Do you need me
to pick you up from the airport?

144
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,901
Oh, no. No, no.

145
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:34,786
The army's got that all arranged.
You know, you just be waiting for me.

146
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:37,874
Well, you know I got that down.

147
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:41,507
<i>Today, C-Note.</i>

148
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,303
Would you back up?

149
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:51,233
Hey, you know, comm is only letting me
use this linkup for a few more minutes.

150
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:56,953
- Is Darius there? I need to speak to him.
- Yeah, yeah. I'll go get him.

151
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,206
I love you.

152
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,837
I love you more.

153
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,844
<i>Yo.</i>

154
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:08,516
Yeah, what's up, money?

155
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:12,023
Your sister out of the room?

156
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,862
She is now.

157
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:19,412
So, how is it out there, man?
Fox River all that they say it is?

158
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:23,003
Oh, man, it ain't all that.
Not for long, anyway.

159
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:26,383
- What you mean by that?
- I need you to do something for me.

160
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,638
Yeah, all right.

161
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:32,187
- You still drive that Escalade?
- Is Michael Jackson still white?

162
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,608
Ha-ha, you gotjokes, son.

163
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,237
How many does it hold?

164
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:42,414
OK.

165
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:46,715
OK what?

166
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:49,887
Let's do it.

167
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:53,311
What? You mean tonight?

168
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:56,149
What about Linc?

169
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,612
I need a razor blade.

170
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:03,538
- A razor blade ain't gonna get him out.
- Do you have one or not?

171
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,926
Careful, bro.

172
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,347
<i>Ay, Cristo amado.</i>

173
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:17,031
Thou shalt not kill!

174
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,201
Thou shalt not kill!

175
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,502
Leadeth me beside the still waters,
restoreth my soul.

176
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:27,343
Leadeth me in the path
of righteousness for your sake.

177
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:32,060
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,

178
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,731
for thou art with me.

179
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:39,783
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

180
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:43,373
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

181
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:46,379
all the days of my life,

182
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:51,347
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

183
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,937
- Amen.
- Amen.

184
00:14:56,481 --> 00:15:00,030
- He does hear our prayers, the Lord...
- Yes.

185
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:03,955
On behalf of Lincoln.

186
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:09,172
- All who seek forgiveness will be delivered.
- Yes.

187
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:13,848
If your brother accepts the Lord,
he'll be free of this cage forever.

188
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:16,143
Yes.

189
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:22,447
I'll be available
through this whole thing if you need me.

190
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,410
Reverend.

191
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:30,213
Reverend, would you give this to my brother?

192
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:36,517
It'd mean a lot to him,
knowing it came from me.

193
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,231
I will.

194
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:55,010
That was my mother's.

195
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:58,851
Tell her it's going
to save someone a lot of pain.

196
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,109
You sure you know what you're doing?

197
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:07,408
It's in God's hands now.

198
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:15,423
You've been the clean-up crew for me
the whole time I've been in here.

199
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:19,181
Toes, contusions, insulin shots.

200
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:21,393
Well, somebody's gotta do it.

201
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:24,066
Well, I'm grateful.

202
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,739
You ever think, in another life...

203
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:32,999
- I won't be that woman, Michael.
- I wasn't asking you to be.

204
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,755
But it is something to wonder about.

205
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,136
What if?

206
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:45,356
Anyway, just wanted to make sure it was said.

207
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:49,782
Why do I feel
like you're saying goodbye to me?

208
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:52,036
I don't know.

209
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,797
I guess in a place like this, you never know
which day is gonna be your last.

210
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:02,557
- Sara, we got a backup out here.
- OK.

211
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,103
You're set.

212
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:08,109
I...

213
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,201
I'm sorry about your brother.

214
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,668
Doctor...

215
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,397
Thank you.

216
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,749
This is it, bro.

217
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,381
Hey.

218
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:31,852
Good luck to both of us.

219
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:34,566
PI! Let's do it!

220
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:53,651
Came to your senses, did you?

221
00:18:56,239 --> 00:19:00,832
You figure a magic way to get your brother
out of that hole and into the guards' room?

222
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:03,628
He's not gonna be there.

223
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,355
Could you put the light on?

224
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,864
You OK?

225
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,453
What do you think, Rev?

226
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:26,046
I spoke with your brother today.
He's been praying for you.

227
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,718
He must be desperate.

228
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,559
What about you? Are you feeling desperate?

229
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:34,395
No.

230
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,858
Just for everyone else.

231
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:39,948
The ones you leave behind.

232
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:43,537
The ones I never got to say goodbye to.

233
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,377
I can be with you
all day tomorrow, you know.

234
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:49,632
Right up to the time.

235
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:52,013
Thank you.

236
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:55,936
He wanted me to give this to you.

237
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,899
Michael.

238
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:12,636
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

239
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,099
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

240
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:19,524
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

241
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:23,031
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

242
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,662
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

243
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:29,377
Thou shalt not kill!

244
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,799
- She's back in play.
- Good. Who's there with you?

245
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:36,264
- Tangren.
- What about Hale?

246
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:38,434
Nope. MIA.

247
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,814
He should be there. What do you mean, MIA?

248
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:43,403
I think it's a fairly concise term.

249
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:54,716
Don't get it.

250
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:02,189
- What time's the flight?
- 11. I gotta head up to Wrigleyville.

251
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:06,238
I'll be back in a couple hours to collect you.
Pack everything.

252
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:08,869
Once we're out that door,
we won't come back.

253
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:13,836
- What are you gonna do?
- There's a letter I gotta deliver.

254
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,425
<i>Thou shalt not kill!</i>

255
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,927
You'll have to step away.

256
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:21,057
I'm Veronica Donovan.
I represent Lincoln Burrows.

257
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:24,315
<i>- This isn't the time.
- You'll have to step aside.</i>

258
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:27,737
I'm sorry, did you say
that you represent Lincoln Burrows?

259
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,954
<i>- That's right.
- Angela West. I'm a producer with News Six.</i>

260
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:13,556
So, Mr Pied Piper, what's the play?

261
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:19,860
We do what we always do -
pretend to be working, be model citizens,

262
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:21,863
till the time comes.

263
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,701
- And that'd be?
- Nine o'clock.

264
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:28,459
You seem to be forgetting
that PI shuts down at five o'clock.

265
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:32,299
Well, we have to make sure
it doesn't, don't we?

266
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,369
Hammer.

267
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:53,590
Whoa! What the hell are you doing, man?

268
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:14,798
- What the hell happened here?
- Messed up. Hit a pipe.

269
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:18,431
- Should've killed the water before we started.
- Should've?

270
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:22,019
It's not that big a deal.
We can fix it in the morning.

271
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:25,068
I don't think mould
should be a problem before then.

272
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:27,029
- Mould?
- Scofield, shut up, man.

273
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:29,242
You shut up. What are you talking about?

274
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:35,421
You get drywall and insulation soaked like
this, you run the risk of stachybotrys mould.

275
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:41,015
Boss, that's just, like,
one time in a thousand, for real.

276
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:43,059
Tell you what.

277
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:46,817
<i>You and all your compañeros here
aren't stepping outside this door</i>

278
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:50,365
until every damn molecule of water
is out of this place.

279
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:55,959
- It's gonna take all night.
- Well, then it's gonna take all night.

280
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,465
Don't catch a sniffle.

281
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:12,283
Man.

282
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,668
<i>- Free Burrows!
- Free Burrows! Free Burrows!</i>

283
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:21,759
<i>- Great. A lot of it checks out.
- Put her on.</i>

284
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:25,767
- If you don't mind, we'd like to put you on.
- That's why I'm here.

285
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:32,112
Great. Holly here will be asking the questions.
Just watch his hand, OK?

286
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,834
Peter, I'm with Veronica Donovan,
the lawyer for Lincoln Burrows.

287
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:42,006
- You're petitioning for a stay, is that right?
- Yes.

288
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,931
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that my client was framed.

289
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:47,475
Get specifics.

290
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,233
- Do you have any proof?
- There's a whole string of proof.

291
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:54,738
Murders - Leticia Barris,
a potential exculpatory witness,

292
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:56,994
Lisa Rix, the mother of Lincoln's child,

293
00:24:57,077 --> 00:25:00,292
Bishop McMorrow,
who could have petitioned for clemency.

294
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,586
Someone's killing these people off?

295
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:07,973
Somebody's trying to hide what happened,
the truth about Terrence Steadman.

296
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:12,398
Is this speculation, or is there
hard evidence to substantiate your claims?

297
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:14,944
<i>- I have a source.
- Get a name.</i>

298
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:16,823
- Could you elaborate?
- No.

299
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:20,038
<i>Somebody on the inside
claims they can exonerate Lincoln,</i>

300
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:23,043
<i>that Terrence Steadman
wasn't in the car that night.</i>

301
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:25,631
Someone's been talking.

302
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:39,950
- Is there a reason you're on direct current?
- Sorry?

303
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:45,670
You know, ACIDC.
Alternating current, direct current.

304
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:49,762
DC's kinda yesterday's news
for this sort of thing.

305
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:54,102
You can kill a man
with half the energy if you go AC.

306
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:59,071
OK. Let's see what we got.

307
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:08,923
You ready to run one?

308
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,538
I think you better turn these lights on.

309
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:47,292
Can't do it. Your client's being disciplined.

310
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,631
You're violating
his Eighth Amendment rights.

311
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:55,685
Either you turn those lights on, or you'll
be the first defendant named in a lawsuit.

312
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:20,063
You OK?

313
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:24,948
- LJ?
- He's good.

314
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,000
He's scared, but he's good.

315
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:33,966
- I found someone who's gonna talk.
- Who?

316
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:36,721
I don't know,
but I'll meet him in a few hours.

317
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:41,272
- A few hours is cutting it close, V.
- We don't have any other choice.

318
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:43,777
You have to have faith, OK?

319
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,200
Nick's already primed the court
to hear our case.

320
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:50,998
Whatever Michael's doing,
he doesn't need to do it now.

321
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:54,130
- We'll beat this the right way.
- What if you're wrong?

322
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,052
- I'm not.
- What if you are?

323
00:27:57,135 --> 00:28:00,726
You gotta trust me, OK?

324
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:15,170
Don't give up on me.

325
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:19,053
Promise?

326
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,933
- Didn't mean to scare you.
- It's all right. Paul, how are you?

327
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,564
I'm good, I'm good.

328
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:50,237
<i>- You?
- Oh.</i>

329
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:58,003
- Where you going?
- Vacation.

330
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,757
Bahamas.

331
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:04,932
- Packing kinda heavily for the Bahamas.
- You know women.

332
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:07,228
Yeah.

333
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:11,361
So, where's Danny?

334
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:15,535
- Running errands, I think.
- Errands, huh?

335
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:20,128
Where... where might those errands be?

336
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:40,208
- Lewis, you there?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here, Linc.

337
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,004
What time you got?

338
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:46,845
A little after eight.

339
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,017
It's 8:15.

340
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:32,975
You OK?

341
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:35,815
No.

342
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,414
<i>Oh, Michael,
what have you done to me?</i>

343
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:39,895
Nine o'clock, fish.

344
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,066
Showtime.

345
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,994
Let's go, man.

346
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:03,649
Tancredi leave yet?

347
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:05,903
I don't think so.

348
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:08,492
You better call her.

349
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,470
See you on the other side.

350
00:32:57,753 --> 00:33:00,801
Well, everything tells me it's food poisoning,

351
00:33:00,884 --> 00:33:04,056
which means you should
feel better in a couple of hours,

352
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:06,019
but...

353
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:12,698
I wish I could say that this would be enough
to forestall the execution. It's not gonna be.

354
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,286
It's all right.

355
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,544
I can stay with you if you want.

356
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:21,966
No.

357
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:25,265
It's fine. Thank you.

358
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:27,351
OK.

359
00:33:56,949 --> 00:34:00,039
We got a lot to talk about
and not a lot of time to do it.

360
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:04,298
Your boyfriend, he can still be saved.

361
00:34:08,054 --> 00:34:13,398
Burrows was chosen a long time ago.
Hand-picked to be an assassin.

362
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,903
But he never pulled the trigger.

363
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:19,659
Who did? Come on.

364
00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:23,291
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

365
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:26,130
- Nobody.
- What?

366
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:28,593
Terrence Steadman's still alive.

367
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:34,103
There's three sheets of paper inside.

368
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:36,735
You'll find all the names
you need are on them.

369
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:42,036
Everyone that started this whole thing,
from top to bottom.

370
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,294
You need to take two steps that way,
right now.

371
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:52,305
Behind the car. Get behind the car.
You want to stay alive, do as I say. Now.

372
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:16,018
Your boys better be there, rughead.

373
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:19,274
They'll be there, cleatis. Don't you worry.

374
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,255
This is crazy.

375
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,046
So, what are you doing here, Danny?

376
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:56,144
- Where's the lawyer?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:58,480
Allison told me.

378
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:00,484
I got it out of her.

379
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:03,782
- You didn't touch her?
- Why would I do that?

380
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:07,330
We're partners, right? We're on the same side.

381
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:09,669
No.

382
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:12,757
Allison's fine. She's just...

383
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:17,350
You're gonna have to ask yourself
who you want to give up.

384
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:21,025
Your wife, or this lawyer.

385
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,405
Just tell me where she is.

386
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:28,580
Is she here? Has she been?
What exactly have you told...

387
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,959
Don't do this.

388
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,055
- Give me your gun.
- I can't.

389
00:36:37,138 --> 00:36:39,267
Yes, you can. I'm your superior.

390
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:41,814
I give you a command. You obey it.

391
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:46,866
Give me your gun.

392
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:58,261
- Paul, it's nothing. It's not...
- Don't. Back up.

393
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,127
It's...

394
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:19,679
It's amazing.
You got it all on only... three pages.

395
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:27,402
You know what would happen
if this fell into the wrong hands?

396
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,502
You named me?

397
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:39,800
- Right there along with the rest of them?
- I got scared.

398
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,304
- You named me?
- Please, man!

399
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:44,392
Allison's due in one month.

400
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:52,575
Paul, you and me,
we-we've been friends since the academy.

401
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,303
You named me.

402
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:50,059
OK. Let's go.

403
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:56,738
Hey, hey, hey. Put that away, man.
What you doing? Put that away, man.

404
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:59,744
Hey, yo-yos.

405
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:01,873
This is a state penitentiary.

406
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:04,629
You can't park here.

407
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:08,094
You think we meant to park here?

408
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:15,733
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

409
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,910
I said put your hands where I can see 'em.

410
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:34,269
All fixed.

411
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:37,818
What do you say you two hit the road?

412
00:39:40,865 --> 00:39:45,165
You two hit the road right now,
or we're gonna have a problem.

413
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:22,445
- You all right?
- I'm good. Haven't been this good in years.

414
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:41,146
They replaced it.

415
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:50,081
Michael?

416
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:52,460
He's there.

417
00:40:53,713 --> 00:40:55,926
Son of a bitch!

418
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,096
He's there.

419
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,937
He's there.

420
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:04,275
Here, Michael. Use this.

421
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:10,245
Come on! You ready?

422
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:22,435
Shh!

423
00:41:38,673 --> 00:41:41,012
Ready?

424
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:10,944
What? Talk to me.

425
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:13,282
<i>- It can't be done.
- What?</i>

426
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:15,829
It's too thick.

427
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:18,375
I'm so sorry.

428
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:29,647
We're not getting out of here.

429
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:34,656
Unfortunately, pretty,

430
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:37,745
that ain't an option.
