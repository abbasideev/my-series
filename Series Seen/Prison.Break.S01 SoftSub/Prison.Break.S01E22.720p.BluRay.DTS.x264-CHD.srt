1
00:00:01,594 --> 00:00:03,392
<i>Previously on Prison Break.</i>

2
00:00:03,498 --> 00:00:05,728
You got a couple foxes
in your hen house, right?

3
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,236
They both want out of here.
They'll behave until then.

4
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:10,900
Look, this is it, man.
Ain't no do-overs this time.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,845
We break out tonight,
or we ain't never getting out.

6
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:18,580
Brains of the outfit, huh, Scofield?

7
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:22,086
He's leading you off a cliff, boys.

8
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,831
Now you're acting
like you still in charge.

9
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:25,990
Pretend I ain't here.

10
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,036
Yeah, you and the radio.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,941
The thing I can't quite figure is

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,882
with the crap storm this thing's become

13
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,088
why they haven't killed you.

14
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,659
<i>We have an employee.
She's not working out.</i>

15
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,696
We fire her. It needs to be that simple.

16
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:47,165
She's the Vice President
of the United States.

17
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:48,794
And that's all she'll ever be, Jim.

18
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:49,964
What's going on?

19
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:51,838
You get to Blackfoot,
you find Steadman.

20
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:53,541
Just give me a chance.

21
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,039
- No!
- Where's the lawyer?

22
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,462
We're through.

23
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,564
- Hey, hey, hey. You okay, old man?
- No!

24
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:27,434
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,200
Sound the alarm.

26
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,400
- Come on, Michael!
- Sound the alarm!

27
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,705
Come on!

28
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:36,777
Come on!

29
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,188
Michael, come on, move it!

30
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,565
Michael, grab my hand!

31
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:50,337
Grab my hand.

32
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:55,111
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Get down!

33
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,328
Don't shoot, please!
Don't shoot, please!

34
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,696
We got a 10-98! Inmates over the wall!

35
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:32,168
- Who was with you? Who was with you?
- Nobody!

36
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:33,903
- Nobody, huh?
- No.

37
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:37,077
Talk or I swear to God,
I'll snap your neck right here!

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,682
I don't know! I don't know!

39
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,652
Names. I want names.

40
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:48,328
Scofield, Burrows, Sucre.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,070
- And that Vanilla Ice kid.
- Who else?

44
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,313
- Was there anybody else?
- I don't know.

45
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:05,284
Was there anybody else?

46
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:10,035
Westmoreland.

47
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,580
<i>We got inmates over
the wall. Repeat.</i>

48
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,245
- How many?
- Eight.

49
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:29,131
Warden, they just found Bellick.

50
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,039
Get me my shotgun.

51
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,394
Pope's already given orders
for all the COs to hit the streets.

52
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,841
Did I stutter?

53
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:41,777
Get me my shotgun!

54
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,180
Those piles of crap,
doing what they just did,

55
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:49,943
they just signed their death warrant.

56
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,067
Every last one of them.

57
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:03,960
<i>When those men
went over the wall, they made a choice.</i>

58
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,864
<i>That choice makes them
a threat to society once again.</i>

59
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:11,961
<i>Now, as many of you know, some
of those men are convicted killers.</i>

60
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:13,567
<i>Now, our job</i>

61
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:17,478
<i>is to protect and ensure
the safety of the general population.</i>

62
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,314
<i>That means if we have to bring them
down to ensure that safety,</i>

63
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,187
<i>by God we will do it!</i>

64
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,454
<i>This time we're playing for keeps,
gentlemen.</i>

65
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,331
<i>Now it's been at least 12 minutes
since they went over that wall.</i>

66
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:33,464
<i>That's one mile on foot at best.</i>

67
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:37,406
<i>If they've got their hands on a vehicle,
they could be 10 miles from here.</i>

68
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,609
<i>So let's get moving!</i>

69
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:10,227
Yo, come on, man, we got to roll.

70
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:14,569
We don't got to do anything but wait
right here and let them get ahead of us.

71
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,009
<i>I don't know
if we're gonna get a chance, papi.</i>

72
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,681
Dogs. Son of a bitch.

73
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,953
- They're coming right for us.
- Nobody move.

74
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,262
They can't smell us.

75
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,402
But they can see us.

76
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:50,298


77
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,252
<i>Hey, this is Nick. Can't get
to the phone. Leave a message.</i>

78
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,481
Hey, Nick, it's me.

79
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,685
Look, I just landed in Montana.
I'm about an hour outside of Blackfoot.

80
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:49,027
And this house, it's got something
to do with Terrence Steadman's murder,

81
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,157
I know it.

82
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:54,570
And if whatever's here can help free
Lincoln, then I wanted to say thank you.

83
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:56,869
<i>Bye.</i>

84
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,186
Soft money makes the world go round.
You know it, and I know it.

85
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,227
You cut my funding and I can't run
a proper campaign without it.

86
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,629
There was a lot of internal debate,
trust me.

87
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:12,260
And there's every chance that
you can still win with your message,

88
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,536
- and it would certainly be our loss...
- Oh, cut the crap.

89
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,737
Is there anything else
you want to tell me,

90
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,217
or did you just come here to
twist the knife you stuck in my back?

91
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,723
Well, actually, I came here
to express our gratitude

92
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:28,362
for all that you've done for us
over the years.

93
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,661
And to let you know
that this isn't personal.

94
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,966
Surely you've been in politics
long enough to know that.

95
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,439
Look, is this about the energy bill?

96
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:38,706
The energy bill has nothing to do with it.

97
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:41,546
Why am I finding that
so tough to believe?

98
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,784
I'm a grown woman.

99
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,021
How about you give it to me straight?

100
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:50,429
All right.

101
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,732
All right.

102
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:56,407
The bottom line, Madam Vice President,
is that

103
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,276
you can't effect change
in the Oval Office.

104
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,648
And that is what we need the most.
Certitude.

105
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:04,620
Simply put,

106
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,552
you can't get things done.

107
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:12,761
Well, maybe you don't know me so well.

108
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,807
I highly suggest
that in the coming weeks,

109
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:25,448
as the race narrows
and the candidates start falling out,

110
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,623
that you walk away, quietly,
of your own volition.

111
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:34,935
Otherwise, maybe it'll be
of The Company's volition.

112
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:53,060
Hey, hey, take the suit off.
You're practically glowing in the dark.

113
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,195
- I only got my Skivvies on underneath.
- Take the suit off!

114
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:56,969
- I'll freeze to death!
- Hey! Hey, hey!

115
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:58,044
Hurry up.

116
00:09:58,145 --> 00:09:59,442
We got to do something
about that freak.

117
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:02,073
You got it, dude. Come on.
Come on, hurry up. Hurry up.

118
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:16,173
Where the hell is the van?

119
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,807
Eyetie, where in the hell is the van?

120
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,643
Ye of little faith.

121
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,285
Come on, come on.

122
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:39,601
I told you. I told you.

123
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,580
Behind the wheel, Cro-Magnon.

124
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,174
Hey, hey, hey.

125
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:55,065
- What the hell you doing?
- I'm getting us invisible.

126
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:07,982
- John, where are the keys?
- What?

127
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:09,081
The keys, where are they?

128
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:12,131
I told you, in the garbage can
by the trees in a plastic bag.

129
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:13,962
What are you waiting for?

130
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,093
Oh, the keys.

131
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:16,797
Come on, come on.

132
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,442
The keys.

133
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,253
Must find the car keys.
Where are the keys?

134
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:31,553
The keys. The keys. The car keys.

135
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,599
There's not even a plastic bag.

136
00:11:37,974 --> 00:11:39,499
No! No, no, no!

137
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,243
No!

138
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,760
We got the on-ramps to 55 and 80
being monitored.

139
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:53,924
We've got traffic checks
on 171, 6 and 53.

140
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,503
Special Services has secured a watch
on passenger lists

141
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:57,630
at O'Hare and Midway.

142
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,866
How are we doing with the wiretaps?

143
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:01,673
They're being set up on all the family
members of the escapees as we speak.

144
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,271
Surveillance teams
are being established

145
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,283
- outside the residences as well.
- Thank you.

146
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:07,380
What do you got?

147
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:10,255
Door wasn't forced. Lock wasn't picked.

148
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,864
As far as I can tell,
they basically just walked right in.

149
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,093
I don't see how that's possible.

150
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,296
These doors are locked down
every night when we leave.

151
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:18,930
It's priority number one.

152
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,637
- Only thing I can think is...
- What?

153
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,643
Someone left it open for them.

154
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,861
Hey, John, I've got to ask you

155
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:40,169
why you were so intent
on Lincoln driving here

156
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:42,768
and you taking that particular seat?

157
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:51,757
Now, what is it exactly you got up
underneath there, huh?

158
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:54,795
What the hell are you doing?

159
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,130
You think that will stop me, huh?

160
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:59,173
Think twice, Johnny boy.

161
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:02,071
You shoot me, pretty here

162
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,078
will be dragging around 170 pounds
of dead Alabama flesh with him.

163
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,982
Will be dragging around 170 pounds
of dead Alabama flesh with him.

164
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,280
And considering how much
you need him to get this little

165
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,619
Fibonacci vendetta of yours...

166
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,358
So I just don't think
you're gonna be pulling that trigger.

167
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:17,392
No.

168
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:26,509
You're gonna give me the key
to those cuffs, T-bag.

169
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,919
Give me the key, you son of a bitch.

170
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,721
Get it, get it. Get it.

171
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:33,591
You looking for this?

172
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:39,498
- Come on. Spit it out!
- Spit it out!

173
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:41,503
Come on.

174
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,772
Oops.

175
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,768
They drink this,
it's only a matter of minutes.

176
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,670
This glycoside saxitoxin hybrid goes
to work in the blood stream instantly.

177
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,076
<i>Five minutes is the outside limit</i>

178
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:09,246
<i>even the strongest cardiac muscles
can continue to function.</i>

179
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:13,819
<i>After that, massive cardiac arrest
with no chance of survival.</i>

180
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:16,425
<i>What about toxicology tests?</i>

181
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:19,695
Well, they'll reveal nothing.

182
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:22,674
Death will appear to be
from natural causes.

183
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:28,343
This is high treason.
You know that, don't you?

184
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,884
- It's fresh, boss.
- From tonight.

185
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,419
Can't be more than an hour old.

186
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,616
- Dogs get the scent?
- Already have.

187
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:55,486
Hey, boss, check this out.

188
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,402
Captain,

189
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,181
this guy lives up the road.
Works on the property during the day.

190
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:10,483
- You see a vehicle parked here?
- I think so, yeah.

191
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:15,759
- What did it look like?
- Like a... Like a van. A blue van.

192
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,094
And you didn't think
to report it to the authorities?

193
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:21,171
A parked car?

194
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,606
Come on.

195
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:36,321
If you think I won't gut you myself
to get that key,

196
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:37,922
you're in for a big surprise.

197
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:41,472
I encourage you to remember the last
time you came at me with a knife.

198
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,840
Shut up! Shut up! Both of you!

199
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,607
You can settle this in Mexico.

200
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:50,346
- How far to the airstrip?
- I guess five miles, maybe.

201
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,592
You know your jet better be there,
Mr. Mafia.

202
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,670
You feel me? It better be there.

203
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:12,848
<i>Canine unit being deployed.</i>

204
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,927
<i>Roger that.</i>

205
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:19,056
<i>Push past the search perimeter
before we can pick up track. Over.</i>

206
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:22,697
- They're everywhere out there.
- Tell me something I don' t know.

207
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,882
You're saying you don't know
anything about this?

208
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:36,224
- Honestly, I don't.
- The door was left open, Katie.

209
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,060
- It wasn't me.
- Well, then who was it?

210
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,567
Only you and Dr. Tancredi
were left at the end of the night.

211
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:43,402
- The orderly confirmed that.
- It wasn't me.

212
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:44,942
Then you're telling me
it was Dr. Tancredi?

213
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:46,102
No...

214
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:51,614
I know you know something, Katie.

215
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:53,884
And anything you know,
you have got to tell me.

216
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:57,294
If you don't, you are gonna lose
a lot more than your job.

217
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,457
Withholding information
makes you an accessory.

218
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:03,097
And I will press that button
if you don't start talking!

219
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,342
- Sara.
- What about Sara?

220
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,120
Sara had a thing for Scofield.

221
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,060
Thank you, Katie.

222
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,773
All I want to do is touch her belly,

223
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:32,955
feel that he's in there.

224
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:36,758
After that,

225
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:40,563
whatever I got to do, I'll figure it out.

226
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:44,302
I just want to touch her belly.

227
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:46,806
<i>We're close, papi.</i>

228
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,911
We got trouble.

229
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,474
Yo, dawg, man, this is bananas.
We got to get off this road.

230
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:11,552
- Any other way to the airstrip?
- This is the only road.

231
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:12,847
Then let's just run this bitch.

232
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:15,186
Somebody shut him up, or I will.

233
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,887
- Can we go back?
- That won't do us any good.

234
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,425
It'll only get us farther
from where we need to be.

235
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,560
Which means we got to
bust that roadblock.

236
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,436
Maybe not.
We've got to try and go around.

237
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:27,638
Come on.

238
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,124
We're gonna get that key from you.

239
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:40,960
I don't care if you got to crap it out.

240
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:43,899
You got a foul mouth sometimes, pretty.

241
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:50,374
What?

242
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:56,882
- Son of a bitch, we're stuck!
- Everybody out. Everybody out.

243
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:58,261
You heard.

244
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:08,508
- This for the speech tonight?
- Need some ID.

245
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:13,477
- Secret Service.
- Have at it.

246
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:21,493
Come on!

247
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:26,403
- This thing ain't going nowhere!
- How far is the airstrip?

248
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,272
On foot? Maybe two miles.

249
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,108
What the hell are we waiting for?
Let's move.

250
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:32,343
Three-legged race over here
ain't going to make it 10 feet.

251
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:36,220
- We'll manage, won't we?
- Sure, pretty. We're teammates.

252
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:38,794
- Teammates till the end.
- Let's get out of here! Let's go!

253
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:39,955
Let's go.

254
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:41,531
Let's go. Come on.

255
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,560
- This is as far as you go, my friend.
- What?

256
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:46,664
No, man, you can't leave me out here,
not like this.

257
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,710
We had a deal, remember?

258
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,283
- Yeah, but come on, bro.
- You and I, we're not bros.

259
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:58,656
And I don't think you want me
telling the guys what I know.

260
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:02,895
Now walk.

261
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:10,843
We got trouble, pretty.

262
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,473
We got more than that.

263
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,684
Go! Go! Come on!

264
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,721
Oh, my God!

265
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:39,191
Oh, come on.

266
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:40,854
Now what?

267
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,489
- What do we do now, Michael?
- I don't believe this.

268
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,828
What now?

269
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,205
This area clear. Negative contact.

270
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:25,098
It's coming back, y'all,
it's coming back!

271
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,672
Make yourself small.

272
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:39,622
There's no way we are gonna make
two miles like this.

273
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:43,388
Especially with that bird up there.

274
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,112
We are if I got something to do with it.

275
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:34,212
Excuse me.

276
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,782
What can I do for you?

277
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,448
Sort of was gonna ask you
the same question.

278
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,927
I run the tower during the day. There's
no traffic allowed here after sundown.

279
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,362
Had some mechanical problems.

280
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:45,933
You need me to take a look at anything?

281
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:47,698
No, no, we got it.

282
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,571
Don't trouble yourself.
We'll be on our way in no time.

283
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:53,670
- You sure?
- Positive.

284
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:56,607
Okay.

285
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,383
- Have a good night, hey, buddy?
- Yeah, you, too.

286
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,694
Those guys better hurry up.

287
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:14,539
Hey, it's me.

288
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:16,777
I've got an unidentified aircraft here
at Goose Park.

289
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:21,382
I think you better have a look at it.
Tail number's 986-Delta.

290
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:25,525
Hurry it up.

291
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:29,231
<i>Tranquilo. Just let papi work
a little bit of his magic, okay?</i>

292
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:31,809
- You know what you're doing?
- Are you kidding me?

293
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,345
Hot-wiring this thing
is like hot-wiring a toaster.

294
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:37,043
Now, if it were to be an Acura,
or one of those Chinese cars,

295
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:38,745
that's a whole different story.

296
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:42,224
Electronic ignition, computer chips,
forget about it.

297
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,258
But, no, we're good.

298
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:48,132
Well, that chopper's gonna be
coming back again, so hurry up.

299
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,456
Hey, yo.
What they got in Mexico, anyhow?

300
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:06,691
You never been there?

301
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:09,863
Ain't never been nowhere
except for Iraq,

302
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,341
Chi-Town and Fox River.

303
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,008
What you looking at?

304
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,484
Look, man,

305
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,858
is it a good place
where you can have a family?

306
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:29,235
Lots of families down there, so I hear.

307
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:31,465
Man, you know what I'm talking about.

308
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:36,481
For a black man,
an American man with a family.

309
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,852
So that's the plan, huh?

310
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,454
They're gonna meet you
down in Mexico?

311
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,493
Yeah, it's worse to not see them.

312
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,756
And I can't do that no more.

313
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:48,961
Not much of a life for them.

314
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,234
But it'll be a life.

315
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:57,348
More than what me and them have been
having for the last two years, man.

316
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:02,548
They're family, snowflake.

317
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:06,964
Ain't no way in hell
I'm leaving them behind.

318
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,836
We're good.

319
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:13,233
I must have done this a thousand times.

320
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:16,006
Man, I thought you got busted
for armed robbery.

321
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,211
That's what they caught me for.

322
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,556
Red's the juice, white is the ground.

323
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:25,953
You strike them together
and we blow this town.

324
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:29,793
- What? What?
- I don't get it.

325
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,948
Great. That's just great.

326
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:59,883
It's okay.

327
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,276
Sorry.

328
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:31,901
Engine's still warm, and I don't see
any other tire tracks out here.

329
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:35,442
They're on foot,
and judging by how hot this engine is,

330
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:38,708
they haven't gone far. Five,
ten minutes ahead of us, at the most.

331
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,942
Where are you? Renwick road?

332
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:43,386
<i>A quarter mile west of Weber
on Renwick.</i>

333
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:46,955
Okay, we've got Renwick on the south,
Weber on the east,

334
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:50,899
143rd Street on the north
and 55 on the west.

335
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:53,506
Units are in place along all those roads.

336
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:55,301
And I've got a dozen more coming.

337
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:58,642
Brad, this could be over
quicker than we thought.

338
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:01,107
We've got them boxed in.

339
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:06,454
Sir, we've got an update
on Dr. Tancredi.

340
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,550
Tell me.

341
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:09,757
None of the staff
had any interaction with her.

342
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:12,097
She left work suddenly
in the early afternoon,

343
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:15,801
returned for maybe an hour,
then left again. All of it's very erratic.

344
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,310
Has anyone been able to reach her?

345
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:20,075
Doesn't have a home line,
cell phone seems to be shut off.

346
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:23,018
Chicago PD identified her car
outside her residence.

347
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:25,591
They're getting an emergency warrant
to go in.

348
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:31,091
Sir, it's none of my business,
but are you gonna call the Governor?

349
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:34,262
This is his daughter we're talking about.

350
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:41,339
- Captain, the dogs picked up a trail.
- Which way?

351
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,852
- That way and that way.
- They split up?

352
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,722
- Looks like it.
- What the hell we waiting for?

353
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:30,789
I think it's pretty clear that
our policies have been effective.

354
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:35,803
We've had 14 consecutive quarters
of GDP growth above 3%.

355
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:38,599
The tax cuts are working.

356
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,577
- Madame Vice President!
- Madame Vice President!

357
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,772
Peter.

358
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:43,475
Madame Vice President, a lot of people

359
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:46,487
question the wisdom
of granting tax cuts to the oil industry,

360
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:49,115
in light of the fact that
they're seeing record profits.

361
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:50,695
Do you have thoughts on that?

362
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:53,529
We're a market-driven economy, Peter.

363
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:56,499
Punishing companies
for being a good business model

364
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:59,475
doesn't make a whole lot of sense
to this administration.

365
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:02,139
- Madame Vice President!
- Yeah, Rebecca.

366
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:04,684
Thank you. Madame Vice President,
are you saying...

367
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:09,551
if you're elected president?

368
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:13,765
If those tax breaks result in growth, yes.

369
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,071
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir? Yes.

370
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,242
Sir, can I...

371
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:46,583
Where are they?

372
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,589
They were way the hell back there.

373
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:50,250
Now they're
slowing us down, man.

374
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:53,355
This ain't gonna work like this.
We've got to do something.

375
00:30:58,173 --> 00:30:59,505
This way.

376
00:31:03,515 --> 00:31:04,710
Come on.

377
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:11,221
What's going on? What's going on?

378
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,332
- Guys, what are you doing?
- What the hell you doing?

379
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:23,613
- I swear to God.
- You swear what?

380
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,649
It ain't gonna work.

381
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,463
I guess it was just meant to be,
hey, now, fellas?

382
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,705
He's lucky I didn't take this to his head.

383
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,485
You cut his... You cut his...

384
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:05,256
- You cut his...
- Sucre, shut up.

385
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:07,526
Hello!

386
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:10,772
Hello.

387
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:15,405
Hello!

388
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:31,266
Come on, let's go.

389
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:36,546
- We can't leave him to just like...
- You want to stay here? Be my guest.

390
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,896
Good boy, good boy.

391
00:33:02,223 --> 00:33:04,124
Boss, we got something.

392
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,863
Yes, this is Warden Henry Pope
at Fox River Penitentiary.

393
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:55,068
I need to speak with the Governor.

394
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,909
<i>- Yes?
- Governor, I'm sorry to bother you,</i>

395
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:03,114
- but there's been an...
- Are you watching this?

396
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,284
- Watching what?
- I suggest you turn on your TV, Warden.

397
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:14,506
<i>Doctors at Washington
Medical Center have corroborated</i>

398
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:17,670
<i>that President Mills
was admitted into emergency care here</i>

399
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,910
<i>a little more than 45 minutes ago.
In the chief surgeon's words,</i>

400
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,648
<i>President Mills suffered
massive cardiac arrest,</i>

401
00:34:23,857 --> 00:34:25,826
<i>doctors were unable to revive him.</i>

402
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:28,522
<i>The news out of Washington
Medical Center is official now.</i>

403
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:31,693
<i>The President of the United States,
Richard Mills, is dead.</i>

404
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,495
<i>And keeping with protocol,</i>

405
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:36,577
<i>Vice President Reynolds
is in an undisclosed location,</i>

406
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:38,647
<i>being sworn in as the 46th president...</i>

407
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:43,153
"I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States,

408
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:44,314
"and will to the best of my ability,

409
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:48,156
"preserve, protect and defend

410
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:50,699
"the Constitution of the United States."

411
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:54,740
I hereby recognize you
as the 46th president of this country.

412
00:34:56,944 --> 00:35:00,883
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot to attend to tonight.

413
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:03,177
Thank you, all.

414
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:16,334
And you said I couldn't get things done.

415
00:35:17,645 --> 00:35:19,705
Madam Vice President,
perhaps we could get together

416
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:20,873
and discuss how to move...

417
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:23,112
It is "President" now, madam,

418
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,453
and you're going to have to talk
to my organizers.

419
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:29,519
My schedule is suddenly quite full.
I'm sure you'll understand.

420
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:40,346
Sara Tancredi! It's the police.
We have a warrant to come in.

421
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:45,781
It's easier if you just open the door.
Otherwise, we're gonna come on in.

422
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:09,191
- Dispatch, this is 15 David on scene.
- Roll a bus to 1616 Vanlear Drive.

423
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:13,365
Apartment 236. Possible overdose.
Likely DOA.

424
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:14,596
Copy.

425
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,174
<i>- Copy 15 David.
- Bus en route.</i>

426
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:04,011
The airstrip's on the other side
of that field.

427
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,385
Just 500 yards,
and this whole thing's over.

428
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,291
He's not moving.

429
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:12,628
Every second we stay here is another
chance for them to find the plane.

430
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,702
- We got to go now.
- Wait, wait.

431
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:26,348
All right, let's go. Let's go.

432
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:28,686
Michael.

433
00:37:28,994 --> 00:37:31,259
If this doesn't work out,
I want you to know...

434
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:33,629
I know. I know.

435
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:48,119
<i>Freeze. Don't move.</i>

436
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:55,494
- I'll tell you when we got to go.
- No, man. I mean, we got to go.

437
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,977
Fire her up.

438
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:15,496
We find the defendant charged of
murdering Terrence Steadman guilty.

439
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:22,970
<i>This stunt by Lincoln Burrows'
defense counsel</i>

440
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:25,951
<i>is an affront
to the memory of my brother.</i>

441
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:33,463
<i>We made an imprint
of the deceased's teeth,</i>

442
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:36,799
and compared them to the dental
records of Terrence Steadman.

443
00:38:36,905 --> 00:38:38,771
They were a perfect match.

444
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,413
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

445
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:45,380
Nobody.

446
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,522
Hello, Terrence.

447
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:14,823
I can see it.

448
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:30,456
- Faster.
- Oh, God.

449
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:32,323
Come on, let's go.

450
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:34,694
- It's on the runway. Right there.
- Let's move it. Let's go.

451
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,348
I see it, baby.

452
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:55,625
Let's go.

453
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,458
- We're almost there.
- It better be there, man.

454
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:16,727
It better be there.

455
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:54,587
What's the deal? Hey!

456
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:56,593
- Hey!
- Where's it going?

457
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:11,550
No! No!

458
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:18,990
What do we do now?

459
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:26,843
We run.

460
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:30,247
This way, this way.

461
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,780
Run into the dark. Run into the dark.

462
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:39,993
<i>Stop and put your
hands up. You are completely surrounded.</i>

463
00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:47,841
<i>Stop and put your hands up.
You are completely surrounded.</i>
