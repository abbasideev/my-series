1
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:03,376
<i>Previously on Prison Break.</i>

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,089
- I didn't kill that man.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:10,761
- I was set up.
- Put down your weapon.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,597
I find it incumbent
you see the inside of a prison cell.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,517
- I'm looking for Lincoln Burrows.
- He killed the vice president's brother.

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,103
- Why you wanna see Burrows?
- He's my brother.

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,356
- I'm getting you out.
- That's impossible.

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,066
Not if you designed the place.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,860
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,112
I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,990
- You find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

12
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,325
The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,995
- A lawyer's poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,624
Scofield, found you a new cellie.
Haywire, get in here.

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,543
- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

16
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,087
Where is Fibonacci?

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,589
I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

18
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,049
Joey.

19
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,115
On your feet.

20
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,450
What time is it?

21
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,828
- Get up.
- What's going on?

22
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,788
Let's go, Lincoln. On your feet.

23
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,665
- Bellick.
- Come on, move it.

24
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,460
Bellick. Bellick. No! Bellick!

25
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,629
Bellick!

26
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,884
Bellick! Where are you taking...
Bellick! No!

27
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,556
No! Bellick, no! No! I got a month left!

28
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,392
Wait, no, Bellick!

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,687
Bellick, no. Bellick, please, no!

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,149
No, I got a month left! Please!

31
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,234
No, Bellick...

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,031
Please, Bellick...

33
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,978
Make your peace, Lincoln.

34
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,570
Let's get on with it.

35
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>Open 40.</i>

36
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,964
Close 40.

37
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,937
Haywire, you ever thought of breaking out?

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,441
- What the hell would I do out there?
- Not be here.

39
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:58,530
Halfway houses. Psych visits.
Meds. Checking in with the PO.

40
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,033
Urine tests. Keeping ajob.

41
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,870
No. Why'd you ask?

44
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,755
He'll make life easier for you if...

45
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,095
If what?

46
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,598
- Your tattoos.
- What about them?

47
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,937
What are they of? No, no, no,
what are they? Like, some kind of...

48
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:36,151
<i>- They're just tattoos.
- Candy time, Haywire.</i>

49
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,366
They think I have schizo-affective disorder
with bipolar tendencies.

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,535
Think you got it?

51
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,246
Whatever.

52
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,339
I take the pills
to keep the quacks off my back.

53
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,679
Bye, now.

54
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,557
Get outta the way.

55
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,734
You know, maybe they give you
those things for a reason.

56
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,154
Yeah. To keep me dull.

57
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:25,158
To keep me
in their invisible freaking handcuffs.

58
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,744
Seriously. Those tattoos, they're beautiful.

59
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,789
You mind if I, you know,
look at the whole thing?

60
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,833
I do, actually.

61
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,251
Why?

62
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,545
<i>Yo. Stand clear.</i>

63
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,215
Does there need to be a reason?

64
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,224
Sucre.

65
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,101
I'm not even talking to you, man.

66
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,892
<i>What's the problem?</i>

67
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,229
- Nothing I can't handle.
- Well, I knew there was a problem.

68
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,899
I could tell by looking at you
from across the yard.

69
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,361
Guys, didn't I say there was a problem?

70
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,863
So what's the problem?

71
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,993
- You're looking at it.
- What, Haywire?

72
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,288
Yup. He's my new cell mate.

73
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,332
- That's a problem.
- He doesn't sleep.

74
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,127
- So when do you dig?
- I don't.

75
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,131
Hey, you and I are in bed now.

76
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:07,093
You made me a promise. You said
that we were gonna get out of here.

77
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,763
You renege now, and I'm gonna cut you.

78
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,182
So you better take care of your business.

79
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,435
Or I will take care of you.

80
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,813
Have a nice day.

81
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:33,477


82
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,878


83
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,113
It's really coming together, isn't it?

84
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,657
- Yup.
- You think it'll be done in time?

85
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:17,580
Well, I figure we still have the interior alcoves
and pilasters to do, which is no small task.

86
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,000
But, yes. I think so.

87
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:29,133
Listen, I have to say I really appreciate
all the effort that you put into this.

88
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:34,180
I wish there was some way I could,
you know, pay you, or something.

89
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,058
There is one thing you could do for me.

90
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:43,439
- My cell mate.
- The inimitable Charles Patoshik. Haywire.

91
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,776
- Then you know.
- Hold it right there.

92
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,739
Officer Bellick is in charge of cell transfers.
You're gonna have to talk to him about that.

93
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,076
I tried. But he seems to think
we're a good match.

94
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,663
- Has he threatened you?
- Who? Haywire or Bellick?

95
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,377
Unfortunately, unless there's
some evidence of violence

96
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,088
or sexual predation between cell mates,

97
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,217
those kinds of requests
fall on deaf ears around here.

98
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,680
Prison system's a little too crowded
for requests based on personality.

99
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,892
It's not exactly Sandals out there.

100
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,606
Warden, sorry. Your wife is here.

101
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,653
What? She's not supposed
to be here till four o'clock.

102
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,948
Becky, do not let her come in here
under any circumstances.

103
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:39,370
She's not supposed to see this
until our anniversary. I'll be right out.

104
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,878
Hi, sweetheart. You're early.

105
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,425
- Let's go eat.
- You're acting funny.

106
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,511
- I am?
- What's going on in there?

107
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:01,100
- Just going over some files.
- Becky said you were in a meeting.

108
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,228
This isn't Toledo all over again, is it?

109
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,732
Toledo? How can you say that?

110
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,653
- Then you won't mind if I look.
- Uh, Judy...

111
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:17,908
Warden, I'm not gonna be able to cooperate.
I'd get killed if I did.

112
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,787
Johnson's still deciding.

113
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,957
Then you and I are done.

114
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,170
You should have just told me.

115
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,631
Well, you know how anxious I get
when you come around the inmates.

116
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,384
Becky, have a guard
escort Johnson back to his cell.

117
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,845
I'll deal with him later.
Come on, let's eat.

118
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,741
- What are you doing here?
- I'm your attorney.

119
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm representing you now.

120
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,037
Hm.

121
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,207
If that's all right with you.

122
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,545
- Last time I saw you, you called me a liar.
- Things have changed.

123
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,216
I believe you now.

124
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,316
I got in touch with
Crab Simmons' ex-girlfriend, Leticia.

125
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,985
She corroborated your story.

126
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,906
- Will she testify?
- She's missing.

127
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,743
I don't know.
I think the Secret Service got to her.

128
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,454
- Secret Service?
- They've been poking around.

129
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,332
They show up, she disappears.
What do you think?

130
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,167
Oh, man.

131
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:56,507
I didn't realise it was that high up, you know?
Do you know what we're up against?

132
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,803
I know it's a lot more
than either of us can handle on our own.

133
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,348
- Project Justice.
- Why have I heard of them?

134
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,476
They handle death penalty cases.
There's a guy, Ben Forsik.

135
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,980
I sent him copies of everything.
You could tell him what you found.

136
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,899
Maybe it'll be enough to bring him on board.

137
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,401
OK.

138
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,824
So, uh, how's Sebastian?

139
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,244
What do you mean?

140
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:29,957
Well, you being here.
I mean, is he cool with it?

141
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,544
I haven't talked to him.

142
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,464
The, um...

143
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,092
The engagement's off.

144
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,594
Oh.

145
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,013
Sorry.

146
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,516
You could at least say that like you mean it.

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,685
I do.

148
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,023
God, you always were a lousy liar.

149
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,901
Yeah.

150
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,615
I better get to Project Justice.

151
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,750
Veronica.

152
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,674
Thank you. I didn't have a whole lot left.

153
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,427
You can thank me when I get you out of here.

154
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,947
Baby, it's me. Are you there?

155
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,657
Hello? Are you there?

156
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:50,412
Hey. If she is,
she obviously don't want to talk to you.

157
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,543
It's Wednesday, babe.
You were gonna come around today, right?

158
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,172
Look, I gotta hang up now.
I gotta go back in the block, but...

159
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:03,217
you're gonna be here today, right?

160
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,969
I'm your man, baby, and I love you.

161
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,138
I do.

162
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,823
It's a pattern.

163
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,451
- What did you say?
- Your tattoo. It's a pattern.

164
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,829
You're seeing things.

165
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,839
Putting him in with Haywire is a low blow.

166
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,592
What? The shrinks cleared Haywire
for re-entry into Gen Pop.

167
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:50,097
- He's so doped up on meds he's like a kitten.
- A kitten who murdered both his parents.

168
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,809
With respect, sir,
if you give Scofield preferential treatment,

169
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,520
it'll undermine your credibility.

170
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:59,982
I know you got a soft spot for the guy
because he's got brains

171
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:04,111
and he's helping you with that contraption,
but the guy's a violent criminal.

172
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,156
He deserves punishment
as much as the rest of these guys.

173
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,702
You know that I'm less interested
in punishment than I am in rehabilitation.

174
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,205
And sticking him in with Haywire
is not rehabilitation in my book.

175
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,166
You delegated authority
over Gen Pop to me, boss.

176
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,837
- I know I did.
- You gotta let me do my job or pass it on.

177
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,214
Now, Brian, go easy.

178
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:29,845
There's a reason I'm giving you
more and more responsibility.

179
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:34,975
When I retire,
I'm recommending you to take my place.

180
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,269
Don't make me regret it.

181
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:44,276
All I'm saying is, take another look at the
Scofield situation. I trust yourjudgment.

182
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,111
Yes, sir.

183
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,585
Hold up. This is supposed to be
an open visitation. Why we doing it here?

184
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,754
Ask your visitor.

185
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,721
What are you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

186
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:15,641
- She's not gonna be coming any more.
- Is she hurt?

187
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,853
No, no, she's fine, she's fine.
She's just, uh...

188
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,608
She's with me now.

189
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,778
She's with you now? It's ajoke, right?

190
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,573
No, she made a decision, man.
She decided she needed stability.

191
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:37,954
- Is she gonna get that from you?
- You can think what you want about me, but...

192
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm not the one who's in prison.

193
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,504
I actually can do something for her.

194
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,465
She wanted me to talk to you first
in case you got mad...

195
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,550
<i>Hijo de tu madre, ¡te voy a matar!</i>

196
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,678
<i>Así sea lo ultimo que hagas.</i>

197
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,097
<i>¡Desgraciado! ¡Te voy a matar!</i>

198
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,477
You just proved my point.

199
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:04,606
You're a con.

200
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,692
And that's all you'll ever be.

201
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,171
Make it quick.

202
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,994
Yeah. He's right in here.

203
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,037
Take a walk, Choppy.

204
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:11,047
Scofield.
You're in a restricted area.

205
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,551
I'm doing yard work for PI.
We need some fertiliser.

206
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,512
Then why are you in the masonry section?

207
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,650
Oh, by the way, how's the foot?

208
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,163
Don't ever go around me to the Pope again.

209
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,375
Now, move.

210
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,416
You know what, Haywire?

211
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,918
I don't think we're gonna work out.

212
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,257
And since I was here first,
I think you should go.

213
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,679
I crapped myself once in junior high.

214
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:28,267
During PE, we were playing badminton,

215
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:34,315
and I knew I had to walk past a bunch of the
other students to get back to the locker room,

216
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:38,611
and so I just started walking.

217
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:42,823
And I tried to make fun of it,
you know, before anyone else did.

218
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:48,662
So I turned around behind me,
and I said, "Look, I have a tail."

219
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:58,172
I just shared a secret with you.

220
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:01,634
- Now it's your turn.
- You want to know what the tattoos mean?

221
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,803
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

222
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,143
<i>Hey, fish.</i>

223
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:14,021
Making any progress?

224
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:17,775
With Sleeping Beauty back there?
Or with the digging?

225
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,944
- Either.
- No.

226
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:25,324
- But I know what to do.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:30,913
Problem is,
you don't got the stugots to do it.

228
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,920
<i>Abruzzi, let's go.</i>

229
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:41,048
See ya.

230
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:54,895
Yeah? Really?
Well, tell the crazy son of a bitch I said hi.

231
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,606
- Wrap it up.
- How's Aunt Ruth? She out of hospital?

232
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,151
- Wrap it up.
- Hold on, Ma.

233
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,319
Bite me.

234
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,531
OK. We got a problem now, man.

235
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,700
Let's handle it then.

236
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,453
That's what I thought.

237
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,380
- Hello?
- Maricruz? It's me.

238
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:24,383
What's going on?
What's the deal with you and Hector?

239
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,343
<i>- When were you gonna tell me?
- What?</i>

240
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:28,929
That Rita Saldaña's been visiting you.

241
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:31,390
<i>- What?
- Yeah. Hector told me.</i>

242
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:35,811
Hector told you. Of course he told you.
Baby, that guy is a snake. He's a liar.

243
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,063
<i>- Why would he lie?
- Why would he lie?</i>

244
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:42,693
Because he's been trying to get into your
pants since the minute we started dating.

245
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:46,071
You know what? I don't know what to believe.

246
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,449
<i>Me, mami. Believe me.</i>

247
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:51,452
<i>Yeah, while I wait by
the phone twice a week.</i>

248
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:54,038
Baby, where is this coming from?

249
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:56,206
I don't know.

250
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:01,086
Look, there's just so many things.

251
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:06,759
Yesterday I went to Teresa's house,
and I saw her baby.

252
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,596
Is that what this is about?
Your clock is ticking?

253
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,766
Well, I am gonna be 30 in a few years.

254
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:17,311
You're 25. You want to get pregnant?
Let's get pregnant right now.

255
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:19,605
I can't get pregnant until I'm married.

256
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:23,150
We're gonna get married. In 16 months.

257
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:31,158
Yeah, well, Hector says
that if something goes wrong in there,

258
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,786
you could serve your full sentence.

259
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,414
I can't wait ten years.

260
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,459
<i>I can't wait ten years, baby.</i>

261
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,587
I'm gonna be out in 16 months.

262
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:45,631
<i>Te lo prometo, mi amor.</i>

263
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:47,841
<i>But what if something does happen, huh?</i>

264
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:50,427
Baby, I can't wait that long.

265
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:54,640
I can't.

266
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:57,643
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

267
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:01,146
Hello? Baby, wait... Hello?

268
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:15,994
Even if Leticia turned up,
her testimony would be worthless.

269
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:20,416
By and large, mostjunkies with
criminal records don't shine on the stand.

270
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,043
I just found all this out
in the past couple days.

271
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:27,506
I'm confident I can find out more
now that I'm devoting all my time to the case.

272
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:31,593
The agent who came to visit when Leticia
was in your office, what did he want?

273
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:36,849
Nick, please. You've got to understand,
unless there's new information for us,

274
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:40,102
we've already reviewed
Mr Burrows' case thoroughly.

275
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,396
Do you have any new evidence?

276
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,439
- No, but I...
- But.

277
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,818
That is what you're telling us, right?
I need to clarify here.

278
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,362
Yes. That is what I'm telling you.

279
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:54,950
But, Mr Forsik, you don't need to point out
what I don't have. I'm well aware of that.

280
00:23:55,033 --> 00:24:00,330
I'm asking for your help. I don't think a man
should be killed for something he didn't do.

281
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:03,500
That's what it says
on your mission statement in the lobby.

282
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,920
- We get many requests for representation.
- I'm sure you do...

283
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:11,133
And I have to decide which cases we're going
to devote our limited resources to.

284
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,594
I will do all of the legwork, Mr Forsik,

285
00:24:13,677 --> 00:24:16,180
but with no experience
in death penalty cases,

286
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:20,601
I'm just asking you
to point me in the right direction.

287
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:24,813
Please.

288
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:27,065
I'm sorry.

289
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,902
We just don't have the manpower.

290
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:38,869
Thank you for your time.

291
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:53,091
She's just leaving now.

292
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:56,386
It'll take her a half-hour
to get across town in this traffic.

293
00:24:58,055 --> 00:25:01,808
We're not gonna need nearly that much time.

294
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:09,858
I've turned up quite a bit already.

295
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,369
Hey. Hey, have you seen my toothpaste?

296
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,080
- It was right here.
- I haven't seen it.

297
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:27,626
- I always put it in the same place.
- I'm sure it'll turn up.

298
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:33,173
<i>Lights out in ten minutes.</i>

299
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:12,129
The tattoos - there's a maze.

300
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:15,132
- Get away from me.
- I need to see 'em.

301
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:17,551
You gotta show 'em to me.
It's pulling me in.

302
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:21,388
I said, get away from me.

303
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,019
OK.

304
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:30,397
He's got a maze on his skin.

305
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:35,193
Man's got a maze on his skin.

306
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:41,658
Why? Why would he do that? Why?

307
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:45,537
Why would he put a maze on his skin?

308
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,456
Um...

309
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,624
I don't know.

310
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:14,323
- How are your contacts in chemical lockup?
- Depends who's asking.

311
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:18,035
I need a bottle of drain line root control,
sooner than later.

312
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:21,789
You got weeds growing in your cell?

313
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,500
Just one.

314
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,296
<i>Looking for me?</i>

315
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,800
I wanted to ask some questions
about the Lincoln Burrows case.

316
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:34,802
- Yeah?
- I'm Veronica Donovan.

317
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:37,137
I'm representing Lincoln on his appeal.

318
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:38,347
What about it?

319
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,101
You were the first one to Lincoln's
apartment the night of the murder.

320
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:43,227
Right.

321
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,273
I'd really appreciate it if you could
just tell me exactly what you saw.

322
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:51,819
Dispatch called. Burrows was seen running
from the garage where they found Steadman.

323
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:54,738
So we went over to Burrows' place.

324
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:59,076
<i>We spread out, I took the bathroom. I saw
your client washing out the bloody pants.</i>

325
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,120
Police! Hands up.

326
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:03,789
I don't need to tell you
it was Steadman's blood.

327
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:08,877
In the report you typed up, you said
you saw Lincoln in the bathroom. That's all.

328
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:12,798
Later, you testified that you saw him
washing the pants. Which one is it?

329
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:16,844
- Does it matter?
- Did you see him washing the pants or not?

330
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:22,474
Yes. He stood up, turned around,
his hands were all wet, looking guilty as hell.

331
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,146
Your testimony factored into his conviction.
You know that, right?

332
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:34,111
You know, lady, if you got any other
questions, just go through the department.

333
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:47,082
Ms Donovan?

334
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,710
I didn't mean to scare you.

335
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:53,422
- What are you doing here?
- Nick Savrinn, with Project Justice.

336
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:56,467
I know who you are,
but what are you doing here?

337
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:02,473
Look, my boss may not think
Lincoln's case is worth looking into, but I do.

338
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:21,241
There's a quicker way
to take care of your problem.

339
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,875
There's smarter ways, too.

340
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:45,557
<i>- Lights out in ten minutes.
- Hey, lights out in ten minutes.</i>

341
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:20,843
What stood out was that most death penalty
cases take ten years to exhaust all appeals.

342
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:23,011
Lincoln got there in three.

343
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:27,057
So for it to be expedited, there had
to have been some political influence?

344
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,103
Steadman was the vice-president's brother.
It's not hard to believe.

345
00:30:31,186 --> 00:30:34,147
How? They got to every judge
that rejected his appeal?

346
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:36,316
It doesn't take ajudge.

347
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:41,196
All it takes is a little special attention
from one of his clerks.

348
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,741
But how Lincoln got fast-tracked
doesn't interest me. It's why.

349
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,952
If he was set up, then why?

350
00:30:47,035 --> 00:30:50,622
I think the answer to that
might lie in the victim.

351
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:55,127
What do we know? He was a CEO of EcoField,
right? He was pushing alternative energy.

352
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,463
<i>Successfully pushing alternative energy.</i>

353
00:30:58,547 --> 00:31:01,341
Oil companies, the Saudis,
even our government.

354
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:06,263
A lot of people stood to benefit
with Steadman out of the picture.

355
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:09,391
Why did you wait till now
to take up this case?

356
00:31:09,474 --> 00:31:13,437
I thought he did it, like everybody else.

357
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,731
I just hope it's not too late.

358
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:19,359
It very well may be.
You need to prepare yourself for that.

359
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:24,239
What about you?

360
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:26,408
Why death penalty work?

361
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:31,997
My father did 15 years
for a crime he didn't commit.

362
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,877
I know that when the government gets you in
their cross hairs, you stand very little chance.

363
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,337
That's why.

364
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:45,135
Now, do you want my help?

365
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,202
- I want in.
- Too late.

366
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:13,246
I'll do anything.
These hands are digging machines.

367
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,209
I'll get you to China.
I'll dig like a psychotic rodent if I have to.

368
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:19,211
Fish, I gotta be back in.

369
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:23,256
As of right now, there is no in.
Van Gogh over there is my new cell mate.

370
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,592
But you're gonna get rid of him.

371
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:29,721
- I'll do what's necessary.
- You're my boy.

372
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:35,519
- So how you gonna do it?
- Let's just put it this way.

373
00:32:35,602 --> 00:32:38,522
Someone's gonna get hurt.

374
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:47,697
<i>How did we miss this?</i>

375
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:52,536
Scofield's father was out of the picture by the
time he was born. Took his mother's name.

376
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,706
All right. Scofield had no priors
and a full-time job as an engineer?

377
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,459
<i>- Correct.
- Then he goes and robs a bank,</i>

378
00:32:59,543 --> 00:33:01,878
discharging a gun in the process,

379
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:05,090
so in sentencing he could
manoeuvre his way to Fox River,

380
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:08,552
<i>where his brother's
scheduled to die in less than a month.</i>

381
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:11,638
<i>- Obviously, something's up.
- With all due respect,</i>

382
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:15,809
brothers are incarcerated together all over.
It may just be a coincidence.

383
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:18,395
<i>Move on the younger brother.</i>

384
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:24,276
Do it pre-emptively, before anything rises up,
bites any of us in the ass.

385
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:39,082
It's a pathway.

386
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,043
Where does it lead?

387
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:44,963
Where are you taking me?

388
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,389
What? Are you nuts?

389
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:57,601
Officer! I need an officer!

390
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,895
What the hell's the problem down here?

391
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:05,108
What the... Son of a bitch.
Open up on 40.

392
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:08,194
He's got the pathway on his body.
It leads somewhere.

393
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:10,447
- Back off, Haywire.
- Now, look.

394
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,657
Look at his tattoos. It's a pathway.

395
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,993
I said back off.
You want a hot shot?

396
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:16,953
I'm telling you, look... Argh!

397
00:34:17,037 --> 00:34:19,039
Back off, man.

398
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:23,376
- Let's go. Get him out of here.
- It leads to hell! It leads to hell!

399
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,840
It's a pathway to hell!
He's taking us all to hell!

400
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:50,251
So, the gang's all back together again.

401
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:53,003
Well, ain't that swell?

402
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:55,548
I told you
not to go around me with the Pope.

403
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:59,260
But you just keep making waves, don't you?

404
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:11,522
- Good to be back, man.
- Good to have you back.

405
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:18,195
So, when do we get started?

406
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:49,852
- Good afternoon, Mr Scofield.
- Hello.

407
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:52,021
How are you feeling today?

408
00:35:52,104 --> 00:35:54,189
Real good.

409
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:57,568
What happened?

410
00:35:57,651 --> 00:35:58,986
Uh...

411
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:02,197
Caught an elbow playing basketball.

412
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:03,324
Uh-huh.

413
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:08,370
- Mind if I take a look?
- By all means.

414
00:36:17,296 --> 00:36:23,135
You know you're gonna get killed
in here, right? If you're not careful.

415
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:25,471
I'll make you a bet.

416
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:30,517
When I get out of here, alive,
I'll take you to dinner.

417
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:35,189
Lunch. Cup of coffee.

418
00:36:35,272 --> 00:36:39,276
Michael, this charm act

419
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,238
could be exactly what's getting you
into trouble out in the yard.

420
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:50,037
Lean forward.

421
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:05,636
All right. You went to the parking garage,
Terence Steadman is already dead.

422
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,056
- That's right.
- You saw that, you ran? Took the gun?

423
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,933
- Dumped the gun.
- Where?

424
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:14,686
- Storm drain. Van Buren and Wells.
- Nobody ever found it.

425
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:18,107
What did you do after that?
Go back to your apartment?

426
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,108
Yeah.

427
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:26,031
<i>I was freaking out,
trying to figure out what had happened.</i>

428
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:29,326
<i>Then I saw the bloody pants in the tub.</i>

429
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:35,457
The cops, they busted in
a minute after I got there.

430
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,043
The pants, with Steadman's blood on them.

431
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:41,380
First cop on the scene says
he saw you washing them in the tub.

432
00:37:41,463 --> 00:37:45,175
He's lying. My hands were wet
after splashing water on my face.

433
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,719
Police! Let's see the hands! Hands up!

434
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,598
I never touched those pants.

435
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:54,309
Which brings us back to the gun,
the one you dumped.

436
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:57,271
It was planted.
Only way it could have got there.

437
00:37:57,354 --> 00:38:02,526
- Ballistics matched it to a slug...
- The gun was planted. Just like the pants.

438
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,654
Your fingerprints were all over the gun.

439
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:10,409
Bo.

440
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:17,457
- Who's Bo?
- He's the guy who arranged everything.

441
00:38:20,294 --> 00:38:24,506
<i>He had me come round the night before,
try a few guns, see which one felt right.</i>

442
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,926
<i>That was the setup. One of those
must have been the murder weapon.</i>

443
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,806
That's how they got my fingerprints
on the gun. Had to be.

444
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:39,271
All right. So this Bo, he coerces you
into doing this, all to clear a $90,000 debt?

445
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:42,983
He was gonna kill my son.

446
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:47,237
- Well?
- Lot of "I didn't do it", don't count for much.

447
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:50,365
The tape that shows Lincoln
pulling the trigger. You got it?

448
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:53,577
- Yeah.
- If Lincoln's telling the truth, the tape's lying.

449
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,290
I think we should have a look,
decide for ourselves.

450
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:05,923
You're clear.

451
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,067
If the chemicals can eat
through the iron pipes,

452
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,694
how come they can't eat
through the tube?

453
00:39:27,778 --> 00:39:31,031
When the chemicals are combined,
they become a corrosive.

454
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:34,409
- You studied chemistry or something?
- Not in school.

455
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:53,720
But what you're doing up there
in the infirmary,

456
00:39:53,804 --> 00:39:56,014
what's it gotta do with this here?

457
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:59,184
Getting through this wall
is just the beginning.

458
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:03,480
There's a whole lot of real estate
in between here and the outside walls.

459
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:08,318
The infirmary's
the closest building to those walls.

460
00:40:12,364 --> 00:40:15,325
And the weakest link in the security chain.

461
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,494
Cool.

462
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:26,586
I think I've removed enough grout
to bust through.

463
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,881
I'm gonna need you to make some noise.

464
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:40,183
<i>♪ Como una promesa, eres tú.
Como una mañana... ♪</i>

465
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:43,019
Is that the best you can do?

466
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:46,690
<i>Have some faith, papi. Have some faith.</i>

467
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:49,359
<i>♪ Como una sonrisa, eres tú ♪</i>

468
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:52,362
<i>- Shut up!

<i> ♪ Eres... ♪</i>

477
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:42,353
Not one more word! Next inmate
that opens his mouth goes in the hole!

478
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,845
We're good.

479
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:27,624
You OK?

480
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:32,754
Work.

481
00:42:32,837 --> 00:42:35,340
It's fine.

482
00:42:37,384 --> 00:42:39,469
I got it.

483
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:46,351
- Everything all right?
- Couldn't be better.

484
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:49,062
You want to come in?
We just sat down to eat.

485
00:42:49,145 --> 00:42:53,316
No. I just wanted to stop by
to tell you in person.

486
00:42:54,818 --> 00:42:58,279
- Problem solved.
- What's this?

487
00:42:58,363 --> 00:43:05,370
That is a transfer request. Michael Scofield
is getting shipped out tomorrow.

488
00:43:09,374 --> 00:43:11,459
Have a good night.
