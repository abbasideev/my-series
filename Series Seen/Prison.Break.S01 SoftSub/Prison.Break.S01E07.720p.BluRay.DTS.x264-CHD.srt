1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,547
- I didn't kill that man.
- The evidence says you did.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,633
I was set up.

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,219
Put down your weapon.

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,055
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison cell.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,934
- I'm looking for Lincoln Burrows.
- Man killed the vice president's brother.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,561
<i>- Why do you want to see Burrows?
- He's my brother.</i>

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,813
- I'm getting you out.
- It's impossible.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,317
- Not if you designed the place.
- You've seen the blueprints.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,903
Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,948
I spoke to your mother.

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,326
- If you mean that guy at Fox River...
- He refuses to call him his father.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,536
Take the only thing Burrows has left.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,998
<i>The chair isn't the only way
to take a man's life in prison.</i>

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,668
<i>And now scenes
from last week's episode.</i>

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,588
Constantly coming up here for count won't
let me do what I need to do to get through.

16
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,049
The only way to stop count is a lockdown.

17
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,259
<i>You'd better get the inmates riled up.</i>

18
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,388
All right! That's it! Lockdown!

19
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,307
The anonymous caller
couldn't have seen Lincoln.

20
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,519
- How do you know?
- Because the call came from Washington DC.

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,107
This is Bellick. Our wing has been breached.

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,818
Hooke's Law of elasticity.

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,698
If we drill holes in strategic locations, we
compromise the wall's load-carrying capacity.

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,492
- Take the cuffs off.
- A rookie CO.

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,829
- Get out of here, T-Bag.
- I think we can work something out.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,664
No deal.

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,044
<i>- Where's my daughter?
- She's fine.</i>

28
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,589
A guard assures us everything is fine.
We have everything under control.

29
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,425
You'd better hope you do.

30
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,888
They're breaking out.

31
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,933
They're breaking...

32
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,519
Shh.

33
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,439
- We need a favour.
- Heavy hitters want this done.

34
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,650
Burrows is as good as dead.
You looking for Scofield?

35
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,862
- Yeah, Turk.
- Come on.

36
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,948
Hey, yo! Stroke is about to get the doc.

37
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,912
Finish what we started.

38
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,749
No one touches the CO. No one.

39
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,738
<i>- Attention all personnel.
- Attention all personnel.</i>

40
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,865
<i>Secure the perimeter.</i>

41
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,744
<i>Remove private vehicles from all areas.</i>

44
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,451
- Any word from the governor?
- Not yet, boss.

45
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:27,165
- Bellick! Get those guys in line.
- Get 'em into formation.

46
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,000
- Going back in?
- Not yet.

47
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:33,380
We cut the water off about an hour ago.
The stink alone should drive 'em out of there.

48
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,133
- You think that's gonna work?
- No, but it's protocol.

49
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,386
And we're all gonna do this by the book.

50
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,265
<i>- It's the best chance we have.
- Hey!</i>

51
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,772
This is the warden.
What's happening in there?

52
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,899
We got some demands.

53
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,527
Tell them we need the air back on.

54
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,654
We need the AC.

55
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,573
We got a hostage - the guard.

56
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,327
We got a hostage - the new guard.

57
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,498
Find out who's in there.

58
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,550
They got Bob.

59
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,303
And the girl doctor. Tell him we got her.

60
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,725
- Why don't you do it?
- I don't wanna get shot.

61
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,896
And we got the girl doctor.

62
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,983
- The doctor?
- There's only one.

63
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,029
How the hell did that happen?
How did they get their hands on her?

64
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,283
- I thought she was safe in Sick Bay.
- We gotta get her out. We gotta go in now.

65
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,536
- We can't do it, sir.
- Why not?

66
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,955
It's not by the book.

67
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,761
Sir, I've got some updates for you.

68
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,143
Help!

69
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,437
Help!

70
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,368
Scofield's in here?

71
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,204
Argh!

72
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,790
You sure he's in here?

73
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,048
Turk.

74
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,342
Turk.

75
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:02,558

Drills and the Devil (Part 2)

76
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,397
You ain't gonna use that.

77
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,942
You making up the rules now, ese?

78
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:27,780
- It's my house. You got a problem?
- Yeah, I got a problem. We all do.

79
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,907
No problem.

80
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:36,247
I swear to God. I'm not gonna say anything.
I didn't see anything.

81
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,293
That's right, badge. You didn't see nothing.

82
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,589
Wait. Don't leave.

83
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,471
Sorry. I'll be back.

84
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,184
Don't worry. I'll cover for you.

85
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,944
Don't worry, CO. All right?
I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

86
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm part of the team now.

87
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,998
Help a brother out. Drag that over.

88
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,839
That's the way. Mm-hm-hm-hm.

89
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,966
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

90
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,637
We are making our final approach
into Washington DC.

91
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,432
We need to focus on the real question.

92
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,685
Who wanted Terrence Steadman dead?

93
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,479
The call came from DC.
What does that tell you?

94
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,024
You gotta think past the government.
Anybody could be here.

95
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,902
A business partner, a rival.

96
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,780
Before Steadman was killed,
EcoField introduced

97
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,075
a prototype electric engine
at the techno conference.

98
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:40,955
$60 barrels of oil would be obsolete
if that thing ever hit the mainstream.

99
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,874
Could be oil. Oil companies.

100
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,878
Suppliers, consumers, everything in between.

101
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,674
Or the government of an oil-based economy.

102
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,468
Like the United States.

103
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,972
- Can I take your soda?
- Sure. Thank you.

104
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,935
At any rate, we land, we meet my guy,

105
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,273
and even if we don't find the person
who tipped off the cops, we find his phone.

106
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,318
The paper trail begins.

107
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:24,457
Only a matter of time, Doc.
It's only a matter of time.

108
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,962
Help!

109
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,256
That's the governor.

110
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,009
Whatever happens, don't say anything.

111
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,326
Governor. Appreciate you coming.

112
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,456
Since our conversation, the situation has
escalated. But we're making good progress...

113
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,004
Just cut the crap, Warden,
and tell me where my daughter is.

114
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,343
Help!

115
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,973
Help!

116
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,768
<i>We got here Tyler Robert Hudson.</i>

117
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,021
That is fancy, CO!

118
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,441
And look at that address - 144 Oak Park...

119
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,111
- What's this?
- Terrace.

120
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,573
Terrace. How'd you swing that, CO?

121
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:07,328
Sounds like you're about something,
living on a terrace.

122
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,999
I can't wait to kick it on a terrace. What?

123
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,335
Oh.

124
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,047
- This here must be your daughter.
- Put it back.

125
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,215
Prom?

126
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:28,223
You know what they say
about a prom dress, don't you?

127
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,897
She didn't come home that night, did she?

128
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,734
No, she wore that all night long.

129
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,530
Next morning...

130
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:48,702
she had to throw that dress in the trash can
behind the motel so her momma didn't see...

131
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,538
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

132
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:56,794
- What the hell are you doing?
- Kicking with Deputy Dawg. Talking women.

133
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:04,301
I'll be very clear here,
because you and I face an evolutionary gap.

134
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:12,142
You ain't gonna hurt this man.
We're locked into this thing now.

135
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,894
Understand?

136
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,774
And he's the only leverage we have.

137
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

138
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,036
Now, do we have an understanding?

139
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,498
I'm on your side now. You understand me?

140
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,042
I'm just going with the flow.

141
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:41,588
You let me know
when you're done with your "leverage".

142
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,109
Let me out!

143
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,909
Let's smoke the bitch out!

144
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,173
<i>Help!</i>

145
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,478
<i>What are you thinking now, Doc?</i>

146
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:53,076
It ain't gonna hurt real bad
if you make it easy.

147
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,246
If you make it hard, though...

148
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:04,087
Open the door! Come here!
Open this door! Open this door!

149
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,798
Come on. Grab my hand.

150
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,011
Come on!

151
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:19,132
Come here. Open the door. Open this door!

152
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,805
I've got you.

153
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:38,550
Are you all right?
It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you.

154
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:43,931
See these pipes?
We're gonna stay on them.

155
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:48,769
They go through the wall and over the
hallway and they'll get us out of here.

156
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:51,855
All you have to do is follow me.

157
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:53,524
- OK?
- Yeah.

158
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,359
OK.

159
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,236
Let's go.

160
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,997
Where did she go?

161
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:28,183
- Where are we meeting him?
- Georgetown. In a garage.

162
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:34,606
He's a private investigator. He used
to be my roommate in freshman year at Duke.

163
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,860
<i>- The disturbance has escalated.
- Nick, look.</i>

164
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:40,529
<i>At least two hostages have been confirmed</i>

165
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:45,868
<i>in what is now being called a full-scale riot
here at the Fox River State Penitentiary.</i>

166
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,203
Should we go back or keep going?

167
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,372
We should keep going.

168
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:56,920
You wanna go back and stand there with
the rest of the people who aren't helping?

169
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,755
Come on.

170
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,844
<i>The National Guard responded after Frank
Tancredi declared a state of emergency...</i>

171
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:06,930
- Come on, honey. It's time to go.
- Hold on. Hold on.

172
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:10,934
<i>- No word on what caused the disturbance.
- That's not Fox River?</i>

173
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:13,729
<i>Tensions often run high at this facility.</i>

174
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:17,316
<i>Fox River is a level-five institution,
housing dangerous...</i>

175
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,860
- What are you doing?
- We have to go. Come on.

176
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:26,533
- No. Dad might be in trouble.
- He's already in trouble. We can do nothing.

177
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:29,494
Just don't make a scene, OK?

178
00:18:29,578 --> 00:18:33,457
He gets very uncomfortable with this thing.
Just... Let's just go.

179
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,002
Oh, God forbid, man!

180
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:42,591
We're just talking about my old man here
and his life, if that's all right with you?

181
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:45,260
- Leave me out of this.
- I am leaving you out of it.

182
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:47,304
I left you out of it the day I met you.

183
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:50,432
Nothing in her life or mine
has anything to do with you.

184
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:53,185
- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
- Yeah? Or what?

185
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:56,772
- This is the kind of crap I have to deal with.
- Let me handle it!

186
00:18:56,855 --> 00:19:01,860
The kind of crap you have to deal with?!
You got no clue, do you?

187
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:06,865
- Honey...
- Leave me alone! Get off me.

188
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:12,162
- Don't touch your mother like that. Take that.
- Stop it! Stop!

189
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,290
Go upstairs, LJ, now!

190
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:17,167
Go!

191
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,044
- You love that man?
- Just go.

192
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:22,047
- You love that man?
- Do what I say.

193
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,158
Turk, why are you doing this? Who sent you?

194
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:53,203
Why? Why?

195
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:33,076
Why did you do this?
What's it all about? Who sent you?

196
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,456
Aren't you gonna help me?
You've gotta help me. Please.

197
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,960
Turk!

198
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,622
- Who is your friend?
- You scared the hell out of me.

199
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,124
Who are you talking to?

200
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:26,171
It's the fish's idea. The devil marks the wall
so you know where to drill the holes.

201
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:32,427
- You're making holes with an egg beater?
- Crazy, huh? It's called the Hooker Law.

202
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,892
He says that if you poke the exact right holes
in something big and strong, it gets weak.

203
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,602
That's true.

204
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:44,439
When the wall is weak, we can take it down.

205
00:21:45,273 --> 00:21:50,236
- At least that's the plan.
- Yeah. That's always the plan.

206
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:55,742
You should never underestimate a wall.

207
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:58,662
You see, sometimes,

208
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:02,957
no matter how hard you try,
itjust won't give in.

209
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,890
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK. I'm fine.

210
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,896
Don't let 'em get away.

211
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:36,783
You know what? I need a minute. I'm sorry.

212
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:39,994
- It's not much further.
- Just a sec.

213
00:22:40,078 --> 00:22:42,539
We can stop if you want. Catch your breath.

214
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:45,875
OK. Yeah, I could use a minute.

215
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:52,507
- Come here, girl. Come here.
- Things should be winding down now.

216
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,886
Pretty soon, the powers that be
will break in and it'll all be over.

217
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,764
It's just a matter of time.

218
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:02,684
What's happening in A-Wing?

219
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:06,312
All hell's breaking loose.

220
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:11,025
But I think if we stay up here,
we should be OK.

221
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,404
I can't believe this is happening.

222
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:18,032
Yeah. Come here.
Gonna catch you real good, Doc.

223
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:22,454
I miss you, girl.
I know you want it, girl.

224
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:29,794
You ever been to Baja?

225
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,755
Mexico?

226
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:38,553
There's this great place down there.
20 bucks a night.

227
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:41,347
Hammock on the back deck.

228
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:44,142
Beers are 50 cents.

229
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,311
25 cents at happy hour.

230
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:52,317
You ever been to Thailand? Thailand's great.

231
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,863
Michael, if you're trying to calm me down,
you're doing a terrible job.

232
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:59,324
But I am trying.

233
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:02,702
Shh! You hear that?

234
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:06,873
- Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

235
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,628
Crawling around in the ceiling,
risking your life.

236
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:15,924
You needed help and... I came to find you.

237
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,891
How did you know where to go?

238
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:32,357
When everything went off in A-Wing, the COs
left the station and I saw you on the monitor.

239
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,486
One of my first assignments on PI,
we were up here cleaning out toxic mould.

240
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:41,699
Took days, so I'm
kind of familiar with the layout.

241
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:45,244
- Hope you wore a mask.
- Excuse me?

242
00:24:45,328 --> 00:24:49,624
To prevent inhalation.
Mould can be really dangerous.

243
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:52,251
Yeah, I wore a mask.

244
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:01,970
Get up there. Get up there.

245
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:08,476
The door to the visitation room -
do you ever use it?

246
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,438
Um... Not usually,
but my access card should work.

247
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:15,274
<i>Get up.</i>

248
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,610
Psst.

249
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:20,196
Come on.

250
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,532
Let's go.

251
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,910
Come here.

252
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:42,677
Let's go!

253
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,056
Dammit! Come here!

254
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,480
I understand.
But believe me, Sara is our top priority.

255
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:59,193
The hell she is!
I ordered a state of emergency an hour ago.

256
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:02,113
- Get me your commanding officer.
- Right away.

257
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:06,534
- Now what the hell is going on out here?
- Negotiating. They can't hold out for long.

258
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:10,204
- Negotiating?
- It's 100 degrees. They're almost out of water.

259
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:12,999
We are trying to avoid
doing anything extreme.

260
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:17,503
I don't care if it takes a massacre to get
her out of there. Do you understand me?

261
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:20,173
- If you're not going to do it, I am.
- Sir.

262
00:26:20,256 --> 00:26:24,218
- Captain, spread the news; you're going in.
- Yes, sir.

263
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:27,180
It's time to do this my way.

264
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,976
Come here! Come here!

265
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,615
All right.

266
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:05,426
I got you.

267
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:19,232
Hey, fish! You gonna keep that nurse
all to yourself?

268
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:44,590
Stop!

269
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:54,225
Agh! My knee!

270
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,895
Come on. This way.

271
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:20,042
Good call, Governor, bringing in the big guns.

272
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:24,672
- Appreciate your support.
- Captain Brad Bellick.

273
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:29,051
I sent you a letter earlier this year -
my views on penal reform.

274
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:31,470
Oh. And what are they?

275
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:36,809
These inmates don't mess around.
Us COs need to get tough.

276
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:39,895
Warden Pope's a good guy,
but he doesn't understand

277
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:43,733
that you gotta grab the situation
by the gonads and take control.

278
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:47,653
- And is that what you would do?
- Yes, sir. That's exactly what I'd do.

279
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:49,238
So...

280
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:59,790
Give me that. Give me that.

281
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:04,712
- I don't know if...
- Give me that. Demolition runs in the family.

282
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:07,298
The whole trick is pressure.

283
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,218
Where should I? Here? Good.

284
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:16,640
You see, you should push hard, but not
too hard. Just like when you, you know...

285
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:18,893
- But you gotta be careful.
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,229
I mean it. One slip and you'll hit the gas pipe.

287
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:23,898
Gas pipe?

288
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:27,234
Yeah, you know,
as in pipe that carries the gas.

289
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:43,417
- We can't go this way.
- We have to. There's no other way.

290
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,711
- This is it.
- No, it's not.

291
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:49,507
- It's back this way.
- This won't help.

292
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,133
- Trust me.
- If you're wrong...

293
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:53,511
We don't have time.

294
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:04,021
Not too hard. Not too soft.

295
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:08,651
When I was her age, I had such bad skin.

296
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:13,322
Acne, they called it.

297
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:20,538
She looks just like all them girls
that made fun of me.

298
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,249
After I kill you,

299
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:26,877
I'm gonna crawl out that hole
and call me up a limousine

300
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:30,631
and me and your baby's going to the prom.

301
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:55,114
- What's the news with Sara?
- Still trying to find her.

302
00:30:55,197 --> 00:31:00,536
- You don't even know where she is?
- We're on it. Once we do, we'll let you know.

303
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:04,206
You should listen to Captain Bellick
and gas the whole block.

304
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,585
- Captain Bellick?
- He knows what these guys can do.

305
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,380
You'd better pray
that Sara gets out in one piece.

306
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:14,591
I do, Governor, but this is still my prison.

307
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:18,595
Whatever happens, I take full responsibility.

308
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,973
Excuse me.

309
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:33,986
It's this way.

310
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:36,780
Yeah.

311
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,743
Yes! We're through.

312
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,873
Time to put this theory to the test.

313
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:48,584
I guess we start chipping away now.

314
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,419
Right on.

315
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:52,588
She's all yours, pal.

316
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,576
This is it.

317
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:26,121
We did it.

318
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:31,210
That's it.

319
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:35,214
- Wait. I can't leave you here.
- You have no choice. I'm a bad guy.

320
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,675
All right, go, man. Go, go, go!

321
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,428
Come on, man. Through there. Check this out.

322
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:52,356
<i>- Can you see the assailant?
- Affirmative. I've got him in sight.</i>

323
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:56,443
What are you gonna do?

324
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:59,196
Go back to my cell. Stay out of the way.

325
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,240
- Michael.
- What?

326
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:05,494
They see us.

327
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:11,750
- You have to go.
- I can't. They'll kill you.

328
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,775
You go out the door. I'll drop to the floor.

329
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:33,862
- They're sharpshooters. They won't miss.
- That's why you can't stay.

330
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,281
- What's going on?
- I'm coming, Doc.

331
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:37,824
Go!

332
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:13,735
<i>Who's this?</i>

333
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,574
That's my guy.

334
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:32,170
- Hey.
- Nice ride.

335
00:34:32,254 --> 00:34:34,464
Yeah. You like that?

336
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:37,092
Cop auction. 300 bucks.

337
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:44,766
You must be Veronica. Whoever tipped off the
cops about Burrows called from this number.

338
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:49,521
That wasn't an easy trace.
I hope you're not too bummed.

339
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:53,775
- Why? What's the problem?
- It's a payphone.

340
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,280
- This is it.
- Anyone could have made that call.

341
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:02,367
Any one of the million people
who pass through here every day.

342
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,036
That's empty.

343
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:07,414
What about that?

344
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:12,210
Federal Energy Commission.
That's interesting.

345
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:16,923
- Where are you going?
- To see if this guy knows what was in there.

346
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:23,305
Excuse me.

347
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,808
Do you what was in that space before?

348
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:30,270
OK, thanks.

349
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:37,611
Hey. It was the regional headquarters
for a company called EcoField.

350
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:41,406
<i>- Terrence Steadman's company.
- That's right.</i>

351
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,838
<i>- Hello?
- Veronica.</i>

352
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,341
Who... who is this?

353
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:03,887
<i>That's the problem, Veronica.
You ask too many questions.</i>

354
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,097
<i>Now I have one for you.</i>

355
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:09,017
<i>Is Lincoln Burrows really worth it?</i>

356
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,227
Here, give me the phone.
Who is this?

357
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,606
<i>- Nick Savrinn.
- I just want to let you know,</i>

358
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:17,400
<i>as of now, both of you are dead.</i>

359
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,946
Come on. Let's go.

360
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:28,203
<i>All inmates have one minute
to return to their cells.</i>

361
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,788
Michael!

362
00:36:29,996 --> 00:36:32,665
Michael!

363
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,959
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

364
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:39,464
I didn't touch the man.
I didn't touch him. Ask him.

365
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:43,301
Things have changed since we last met.

366
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:48,223
Relax, partner. I'm in on it now.

367
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:52,352
The rabbit plan.
Know all about it. So does the CO.

368
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,237
- Why'd you take Abruzzi down?!
- I didn't. He just showed up.

369
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,073
- And the paedophile thinks he's in!
- I know.

370
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,700
Shut up! Where's Michael?

371
00:37:07,784 --> 00:37:09,869
Where's Michael?

372
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:14,415
Michael! Michael!

373
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:26,678
<i>Final warning.</i>

374
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:41,943
- Where have you been?
- All over. Are you all right?

375
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,737
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yes. Yes.

376
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:48,491
Move!

377
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,210
- We'll take it from here.
- Are you OK?

378
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:01,379
I'm OK.

379
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,134
- Bellick.
- She's walking. That's a good sign.

380
00:38:06,593 --> 00:38:09,262
Yeah. Astute observation.

381
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:13,141
Maybe you'd like
to share that with the governor.

382
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:17,270
- I was tense. I was just trying...
- Next time you bad-mouth me to a superior,

383
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:21,858
there are gonna be serious consequences.
Do I make myself clear, Captain?

384
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:24,360
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

385
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,452
Sara!

386
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:34,913
Sara. Sara.

387
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:39,834
- Dad.
- Sara. Are you all right? Are you OK?

388
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:43,713
I told you when you took this job.
I knew something like this would happen.

389
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:45,924
I knew something like this would happen.

390
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:49,427
God, Dad, how about,
"I'm happy to see you alive"?

391
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,972
Well, I just want you to see
what you're doing to yourself.

392
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:56,893
There is nobody
that is forcing you to be here.

393
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:59,062
I know. Thanks, Dad.

394
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,069
All right. Let's clean this mess up.

395
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,206
- What's going on?
- We did it.

396
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,209
Those little Hooker holes were right on.

397
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,711
Get everyone out of here. Especially him.

398
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,674
- I'm gonna take care of him myself.
- You're not gonna kill him.

399
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:30,593
- I'm not coming back.
- It's over! We don't need him.

400
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:34,263
- You're not gonna kill him.
- You're gonna let him walk?

401
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:37,850
- That ain't for you to decide!
- After all he's seen?!

402
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:40,561
- After all he's seen.
- Get out!

403
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:43,439
Keep your mouth shut and turn left.

404
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:45,441
Get out!

405
00:39:47,276 --> 00:39:50,321
If we have a problem,
we know where to find you.

406
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:52,365
Mau-mau.

407
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,495
Forget about it. Just forget about it, all right?

408
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,349
No!

409
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,123
One for the team.

410
00:40:59,348 --> 00:41:02,393
OK, so this is a complete list
of the injured and the dead.

411
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:04,812
- And it's the whole list?
- Yeah.

412
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,981
Thank you, very much.

413
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,822
Hey, Ron.

414
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:18,492
Dr Tancredi.
Glad to see you made it out alive.

415
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,661
Yeah. Me too.

416
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:24,081
Question.

417
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:29,295
Why did your department assign inmates
on PI to do a toxic mould removal project?

418
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:32,048
What toxic mould project?

419
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,675
In the crawl space in A-Wing.

420
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,599
PI didn't go there.
We'd never assign inmates to do that.

421
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,019
- OK, sorry.
- No problem.
