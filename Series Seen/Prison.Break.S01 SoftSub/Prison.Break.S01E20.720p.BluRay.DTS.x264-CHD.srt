1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:02,969
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,565
I want him under 24-hour surveillance.

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,903
I have to be there when they kill this man.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,536
The least you could do is review his case.

5
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:11,872
<i>Terrence.</i>

6
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:13,541
The thing I can't quite figure is

7
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:16,213
with the crap storm this thing's become

8
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,348
<i>why they haven't killed you.</i>

9
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:19,858
Have at it.

10
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:27,230
Now, out of respect
for what you once were,

11
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:29,636
I'm going to let you walk away.

12
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:42,223
Why don't you
just hand me that shank you're holding?

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,026
I'm not even sure why you need it.

14
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:49,102
Thank you.

15
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,331
Your keys, they were right over there
by your in-box.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,875
Well, you got a maintenance guy
waiting outside here,

17
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,605
says you want him to change the locks.

18
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:58,682
Want me to call him off?

19
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:01,344
No, send him in.

20
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:02,944
It's your last chance, Tweener.

21
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,457
Scofield and his whole PI crew,

22
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,624
they're escaping.

23
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,813
You know I can't let you leave here, boss.

24
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:24,991
Dogs. The numerous times
I've been apprehended

25
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:26,583
while trying to elude the authorities,

26
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:29,290
it's always because of the damn dogs.

27
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,872
Turns out you can run
from just about everything in your life

28
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,571
except your own particular stink.

29
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,048
Yeah, well, some of us stink
more than others.

30
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,985
Kinte, you can smell
like a bouquet of bonbons,

31
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:47,216
but unless you get rid of your smell

32
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,987
you might as well
send a note to the police

33
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:50,790
with directions and some cab fare.

34
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,957
You know, Theodore's right, man.

35
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,263
We gotta scrub down our cells.

36
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,396
- What about our bunks?
- Pillows, sheets, everything.

37
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:59,668
Either get rid of your smell or change it.

38
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,084
Well, how much time we got?

39
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,712
- John?
- Three days.

40
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:12,726
That's the soonest I could get us
into the guards' room for PI.

41
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,123
You think you'll have
the extra suits by then?

44
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:20,198
All we got left is figuring out

45
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,673
how to get through that door
in the infirmary.

46
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,107
How to get Linc out of that box.

47
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:28,650
- And you can do that in three days?
- Three days should be plenty of time.

48
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:32,145
We got to get out of here.

49
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,149
Now.

50
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:42,278


51
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,560
I don't know how he found it. He just did.

52
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:12,930
So the hole's just sitting there?

53
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:16,029
I covered it the best I could,
but it's just a matter of time

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,336
before someone discovers
Bellick's missing.

55
00:04:18,443 --> 00:04:19,877
What do you mean Bellick's missing?

56
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,764
Okay, okay, okay. Fox River is a big place.

57
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,163
Maybe they won't notice for a while.

58
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,793
Nothing happens around here
without Bellick's say so.

59
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,702
Somebody is gonna notice
that he's missing.

60
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,003
And when they do,
they're gonna close this place down

61
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,373
until they find him.

62
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,605
What are we gonna do?

63
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:48,117
As soon as it gets dark, we go.

64
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,280
- Tonight?
- Pretty, we ain't ready to escape tonight.

65
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:51,481
Escape already started.

66
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,082
It started
the minute Bellick found that hole.

67
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,662
And it's gonna end the minute
they figure out that he's missing.

68
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,095
Then stay!

69
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,426
I'll be sure to read the papers
in the morning.

70
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:02,403
See how many years you got
when they realized

71
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:05,909
which crew was working in that room
and dug that hole.

72
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,618
So what's the play, man?

73
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,986
Do you think you can have
the plane ready by tonight?

74
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,183
Sure.

75
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,391
- You had kitchen duty, right?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:19,053
What'd you use to scrub down the floors?

77
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:21,325
I don't know. I think it was some peroxide,
or something like that.

78
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,561
That'll work. Get as much as you can.

79
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,163
I'll work on getting us
that key to the infirmary.

80
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,606
The rest of you find whatever you can

81
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,177
to get rid of the scent in your cells.

82
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,305
None of this matters
if we can't get in the guards' room.

83
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,507
We're gonna leave after dinner,

84
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:34,107
during tier time when the gates are open.

85
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:36,780
7:00, one by one, through my cell.

86
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,620
Whoa, whoa. No, we were supposed
to go through the guards' room.

87
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:40,989
That was going to give us a head start,

88
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:42,723
hours before they even found out
we were missing.

89
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,697
We leave through your cell,
we ain't got no lead time.

90
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,771
- 7:00. Count's at 8:00, that's only...
- Sixty minutes.

91
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:51,240
Sixty minutes to get over that wall
and as far away from here as possible.

92
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:52,743
They'll be right on our asses.

93
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:57,011
Quit your talking and start
your walking. Ladies, yard time is over!

94
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,013
They already are.

95
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,933
Come on, let's go. Hurry it up. Single file.

96
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,901
You know, there's one thing
we didn't talk about out there.

97
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,136
Your brother.

98
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,475
I mean, he's under 24-hour surveillance.

99
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,881
I'm just saying,
if you can't get to him by tonight,

100
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,919
we still have to go, you know that, right?

101
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,699
Lock it down.

102
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,421
Hey, boss.

103
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:51,689
What do you want?

104
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,321
My brother's in Gen Pop.

105
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:56,062
He's got no clue I was in an accident.

106
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:57,461
So?

107
00:06:57,571 --> 00:07:00,770
Well, is there any way
I can get a message to him?

108
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:03,069
Yeah. Put it in your will.

109
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:16,926
And you're sure all those dots connect?

110
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,625
Okay. Thank you.

111
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,662
- Who was that?
- A friend of mine at the title company,

112
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,537
handled a lot of my firm's business.

113
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,874
She dug up an address
for that phone number in Blackfoot.

114
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,003
Where is it?

115
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,481
It's not the where that's interesting,
it's the how.

116
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,382
It turns out our little place in Montana

117
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:35,016
was purchased for $2 million
by an offshore holding corporation.

118
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,857
Well, that's pretty standard
for a transaction that size, though, right?

119
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:41,833
Sure. Only this holding corporation
was bankrolled by a trust.

120
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:45,236
A trust financed
by the estate of Terrence Steadman.

121
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:49,677
Looks like you and I
are going to Blackfoot, Montana.

122
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:12,609
- Have you seen Bellick today?
- No.

123
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:14,511
- Why?
- Mack was asking.

124
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:18,246
- I guess he ain't showed up yet.
- He's probably just late.

125
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:22,116
Bellick? I haven't beat that guy to work
in eight years.

126
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,157
Scofield, this ain't Gibsons. Move.

127
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,465
They're already starting
to ask questions, man.

128
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,334
We're not gonna
make it out of here in seven hours

129
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,635
without them finding the answers.

130
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:35,877
How we coming with that peroxide?

131
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm gonna need it
before we meet up for yard duty.

132
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,281
Probably not till later.

133
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,355
You wanna tell me what you need it for?

134
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,860
Makkos, you going to be
eating them there Brussels sprouts?

135
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:55,098
No.

136
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:57,334
- You mind if I...
- Take them.

137
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,375
They smell like crap.

138
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:01,180
Do they, now?

139
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,397
What's up?

140
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,301
- Yo, if you got...
- Tonight.

141
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:23,206
- What?
- Change of plans.

142
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:28,146
- Why, did something happen?
- Just find Sucre.

143
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:30,314
He'll tell you
what you need to do to be ready.

144
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:32,518
- But what about the...
- Tonight.

145
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,069
What the hell's going on?

146
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,200
The President changed his mind.

147
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,872
We were given assurances
he would veto the energy bill.

148
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:50,315
Assurances can tell you everything
that a man is going to do

149
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:53,879
until he wakes up in the morning
and changes his mind.

150
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:57,291
- Then change it back.
- I don't think you understand.

151
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,492
- The President...
- Have you enjoyed our support?

152
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:03,497
- Yes.
- Good.

153
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:06,006
We certainly wouldn't want you
to take it for granted.

154
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:09,273
- Are you threatening me?
- Why? Do you feel threatened?

155
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,406
Caroline, we've all been
through this before,

156
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:14,180
the ebbs and flows of political conscience,

157
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,984
but we've found at the end of the day
we get what we want.

158
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,650
It's simply a matter of who helps us get it.

159
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,595
If you can't convince a doddering old fool
finishing up his second term

160
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,135
what the best thing is
for this country's economy,

161
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:28,764
perhaps you're not the kind of helper
we're looking for.

162
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,125
Sara.

163
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,530
- I was thinking about something...
- Enough, Michael.

164
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:53,097
Enough with the lies and the coincidences
and the stories, all of it.

165
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,179
- It's not what you think.
- I know what you did.

166
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,374
The question is,
are you man enough to admit it?

167
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,015
The keys.

168
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,890
Congratulations. Is that the first time
you've been honest with me?

169
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:07,826
- It's not...
- The second?

170
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,831
What are you after, Michael?

171
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:13,199
- Is it drugs? Is it needles?
- Neither.

172
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,937
Then what?

173
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,177
Please understand that I never meant...

174
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:25,555
I never wanted to involve you in this.

175
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,716
Well, you've done a pretty poor job of that.

176
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:30,261
I came here to tell you something.

177
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:34,158
I'm getting my brother out of here.

178
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,463
Tonight.

179
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,738
And I need your help.

180
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:59,384
Michael, honestly, for your own good,
don't say anything more.

181
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:00,616
You know he's innocent.

182
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,057
Do what you're talking about
and he won't be.

183
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,185
But he'll still be alive.

184
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:06,424
You understand that I'm required
to report everything you're telling me.

185
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:07,865
- Yes.
- Then why would you?

186
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,494
Because you're the only one that can help.

187
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,767
And because I know
you want to be part of the solution.

188
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,809
Yeah, aiding and abetting
is not part of the solution.

189
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:16,380
Neither is doing nothing
knowing what you know about his case.

190
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,211
How dare you put this on me.

191
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:20,548
I did what I could.
I gave my father the information...

192
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:24,523
No offense to your father,
but the people who are framing Lincoln,

193
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,652
let's just say they have
a higher security clearance.

194
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:29,163
- So now it's a conspiracy?
- I didn't come here to have a debate.

195
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:32,260
- You're asking me to break the law.
- I'm asking you to make a mistake.

196
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,840
Not hurt anyone, not steal anything.

197
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:38,207
Just forget to lock up.

198
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:42,348
Leave the door unlocked
when you leave tonight.

199
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,783
That's it.

200
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,283
Please.

201
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,322
This is where you're breaking out of?
This room?

202
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:56,465
There are alarm contacts
on the glass surrounding the door.

203
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:58,506
Otherwise, I wouldn't need you to...

204
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,577
I was part of your plan.

205
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:07,147
- Was it all an act?
- At first, yes.

206
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,954
I needed to be here.

207
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:16,093
- But then I wanted to be here with you.
- Right.

208
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:20,232
And it's killing me to know
that you'll never believe that.

209
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,141
Whatever you may think of me,
this is about Lincoln.

210
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,840
Don't make him pay for my mistakes.

211
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,240
<i>- Yeah?
- Hi, it's me.</i>

212
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:49,575
There's been an acceleration.

213
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:52,648
<i>- How fast are we talking about?
- Fast. Tonight.</i>

214
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,243
Son of a bitch.

215
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:57,052
I think what you're trying to say is,
"No problem"?

216
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,288
<i>- Yeah, of course. It'll be taken care of.
- Good.</i>

217
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,265
<i>- The van?
- Waiting up Fitz Street, 200 yards...</i>

218
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,733
Behind the old mill?

219
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,271
Behind the old mill, I got it.

220
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:10,672
One question, John.

221
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,140
Don't you want a bigger plane?
You only got three seats.

222
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,515
I thought you said
there were seven or eight guys.

223
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,680
Well, not everybody gonna have a ticket.

224
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,089
You gonna tell me who is?

225
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,394
The three of us still breathing.

226
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,029
Whatever airport's closer to Blackfoot.

227
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,265
Aisle, window, it doesn't matter,
just get us on the next flight.

228
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,972
Yeah, I'll hold.

229
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:39,142
Hello?

230
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:40,618
Change of plans.

231
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,919
We're going to need you to have
a girl at the airstrip tonight.

232
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:45,319
Tonight?

233
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:47,054
Was I not enunciating?

234
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:49,528
No, it's just that...

235
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,634
Look, things could get messy.

236
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,132
So wear a smock.

237
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:19,933
Is that his nympho secretary?

238
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,739
Come on, man, like you wouldn't hit that.

239
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:26,376
I don't know, Vegas, 2:00 a.m., maybe,
but if she didn't have such a big booty.

240
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:28,682
Man, the booty is the man's
biggest weakness.

241
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:30,781
I know I would've hit it.

242
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:45,778
You find a way to the infirmary yet?

243
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,710
I'm working on it.

244
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,627
- Yo, you seen Bellick today?
- Not yet.

245
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,863
I need to talk to him.
Do you know if he went somewheres?

246
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:24,834
Do I look like his mother?

247
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,405
The guy hasn't shown up yet.

248
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,104
You sure he ain't showed yet?

249
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,510
'Cause I thought I saw him here
this morning, man.

250
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:33,810
Tweener!

251
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:36,849
- Need a hand over here.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

252
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:45,025
- All right?
- Fine.

253
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,398
It's just sore, that's all.

254
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:51,770
You live to my age,
you'll know all about it.

255
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:18,642
You know you got
a couple of foxes in your hen house, right?

256
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,809
- Who are we talking about?
- The bastard and the born again.

257
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,286
They both want out of here.
They'll behave until then.

258
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,686
Think so?

259
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:29,160
I just picked this off of T-Bag yesterday.

260
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:30,754
If I would've been there 10 seconds later,

261
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:34,495
they'd have been serving Abruzzi
with red sauce over at the morgue.

262
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,334
I know you want to be shot caller
and everything, and that's cool,

263
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:39,239
but you got to handle things, man.

264
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:41,608
Are you picking up
what I'm putting down?

265
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:43,342
- Yeah.
- Look, this is it, man.

266
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,282
Ain't no do-overs this time.

267
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:47,082
Can't be no complications.

268
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:50,455
We break out tonight,
or we ain't never getting out.

269
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:03,774
We got that paperwork in from the county.

270
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,977
- Sara?
- Yeah. Sorry.

271
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,749
- The paperwork from the county.
- Right. I got it.

272
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,222
Do me a favor,
could you take care of that for me?

273
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,127
- I got to get out of here.
- Sure.

274
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:18,256
Thanks.

275
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:20,733
- Where are you going?
- Out.

276
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:40,026
Put your blues on over your PI gear.

277
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,826
- What?
- Just do it.

278
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,764
You want to tell us why?

279
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,395
If we don't have time
to get the suits we need,

280
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:47,769
we're gonna have to make them.

281
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:50,145
Yo, what the hell are you doing, man?
We got company.

282
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:52,942
It's okay. He's coming with us.

283
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,081
Hey, whatever happened to,
"We got too many people"?

284
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:00,250
When the plan changed, so did the timing.

285
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,795
- I'll make sure we all get through.
- Well, for health reasons,

286
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:05,731
information like that should be
disseminated a little more pronto.

287
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:09,431
Uh-uh, Fish. One more person means
there's one more thing that can go wrong.

288
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,564
He is not coming.

289
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:12,701
- It's not up for discussion.
- The hell it ain't.

290
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:14,143
I owe him.

291
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,943
I don't owe you a damn thing.

292
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:20,951
Well, you're gonna if we get nailed

293
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:24,255
'cause you didn't wanna
cut down on the damn guest list.

294
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,161
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

295
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,477
Hey! Hold up, cons.

296
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:51,693
I saw some drops of blood
on the floor of the PI locker room.

297
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,634
Now who's going to tell me
what's going on?

298
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,350
That'd be me, boss.

299
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:16,568
I did it while I was loading
some equipment back into the shed.

300
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:20,300
You make sure and get that patched up.

301
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:22,004
Will do.

302
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:24,238
Okay.

303
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:26,810
Move it!

304
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:35,061
Are you okay?

305
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,895
Okay enough
to make it out of here tonight,

306
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,229
I swear.

307
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,111
Hey, Shelly, this is... It's me.

308
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:14,344
Listen, I know I'm supposed
to call you as my sponsor,

309
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,182
in case I have a...

310
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,117
Whoa!

311
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:08,722
Right.

312
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:11,932
I think we should break
a bottle of champagne across its bow.

313
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:14,903
If you're intending to get this thing home
for your anniversary tonight,

314
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:17,201
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- No.

315
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:21,411
Listen, I want you to know that I...

316
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,153
Well, I feel very fortunate to have met you.

317
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,948
Yeah. I'm guessing
not many structural engineers

318
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:29,583
make their way into Fox River.

319
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,355
No, no, I don't mean
because of your vocation.

320
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:32,862
I mean because
you're a decent young man,

321
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:35,400
and there are not many of those
who make their way into Fox River.

322
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:38,940
Well, for what it's worth,
there are a few down there.

323
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,433
Well, that's good to hear.

324
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:45,209
Listen, I know this goes without saying,

325
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,551
but if there's anything you need...

326
00:22:48,654 --> 00:22:51,385
Well, let's just say that I owe you one.

327
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:54,055
Actually,

328
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:57,592
there is one thing you can do for me.

329
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:02,665
So this whole thing,
this whole time, it was never about me.

330
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,402
It was about Dad.

331
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,540
I can't believe it.

332
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:09,910
Michael. Michael!

333
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:13,017
- What?
- You got something you want to tell me?

334
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,114
Just told you everything we knew
about Dad was a lie,

335
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:17,126
and you barely blinked.

336
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,099
We have to go. Tonight.

337
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,361
What are you talking about?

338
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:27,234
Bellick found the hole,
so either we go now or it's over.

339
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:29,237
Michael.

340
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:31,314
Look, I know it's gonna be tight,
but I can do this.

341
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:34,875
- Michael, stop it.
- The chains on your locks, they're...

342
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:37,183
- Michael! Michael!
- I can do this!

343
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,758
Listen to me!

344
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:43,325
- Go. You gotta go.
- Don't say that.

345
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:47,837
Look at me! You can't do this.
There's not enough time.

346
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,836
If you stay here,
they'll nail you and you'll rot in here.

347
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:56,076
I'm not asking you, man, I'm telling you.
Leave me behind.

348
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:02,082
Go.

349
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:33,832
- What the hell you think you doing?
- Nothing, man.

350
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,104
You trying to run something
for those Wonder Breads

351
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,643
- you been running around with?
- No, it ain't even like that.

352
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,337
Tell me something, boy.

353
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,917
Is you stepping or is you fetching?

354
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,952
I thought I made myself clear
when I said your punk ass

355
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:47,786
was no longer in business.

356
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:50,623
This ain't business, all right?
This is personal.

357
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:53,324
What you got there anyway,
some kind of cleaner?

358
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:57,804
What you trying to clean up,
Sergeant Franklin?

359
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:25,370
<i>There's breaking news report
with implications</i>

360
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,038
<i>in the race for the Presidency.</i>

361
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:29,481
<i>Political correspondent
Nancy Lu has the details.</i>

362
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:30,609
<i>Nancy.</i>

363
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:33,154

00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:40,760
<i>Perhaps the biggest surprise</i>

367
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:43,736
<i>is the inclusion of Illinois governor
Frank Tancredi.</i>

368
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:46,535

<i>Thanks, Nancy.</i>

375
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:03,263
<i>Locally, a jackknifed big rig...</i>

376
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:58,141
- What the hell are you doing, John?
- Lord's work.

377
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:01,075
The Lord wants you to spread horse crap
all over your mattress?

378
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:04,085
It's not in our place to question his will.

379
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:06,322
Are we clear?

380
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:14,524
Hey, hey, hey! Let's cut the noise.

381
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,622
Open on 88!

382
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,297
- Yo, what's that?
- Avocado's gear.

383
00:27:39,704 --> 00:27:42,071
He's getting out of the infirmary tonight.

384
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:43,233
Tonight?

385
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:46,336
So you got plenty of time
to bake him a cake.

386
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:51,286
Hey, I heard you were asking Patterson
about Bellick.

387
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:54,222
Said you thought you saw him
this morning?

388
00:27:57,897 --> 00:27:59,627
Yeah. I was.

389
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:10,580
No, it was yesterday.
That's when I saw him.

390
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:12,279
You sure?

391
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:15,046
Yeah.

392
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:19,249
You know, time just sort of blends
together up in here.

393
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:22,295
All right.

394
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,667
Close on 88!

395
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:35,082
What am I supposed
to do with this?

396
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:36,583
Pour it in the toilet.

397
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:38,621
You had C-Note steal some peroxide
from the kitchen

398
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:39,781
so we can clean the toilet?

399
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:41,620
We got to get all of us
in the psych ward tonight

400
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:42,989
to access the pipes.

401
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:47,329
A bunch of cons wearing their prison blues
would stick out like a sore thumb.

402
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,734
But the inmates in the psych ward
all wear...

403
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:50,862
White.

404
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:53,671
- Peroxide acts as a bleach.
- Camouflage.

405
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:05,459
Just a few more hours now.
Looks like we got everything we need.

406
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,860
Everything except your brother.

407
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:10,124
You worry about the suits.

408
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:13,569
I'll worry about Linc.

409
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:19,144
- Could you give us a couple of minutes?
- Of course, Mr. President.

410
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:22,216
- You probably know why I'm here.
- Lf I were a betting man,

411
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:24,411
I have a pretty good idea
where I'd lay my chips.

412
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,855
The energy bill, Richard.
Why did you change your mind?

413
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,360
You've been saying for months
it's so full of pork,

414
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:31,987
the damn thing's ready to squeal,

415
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:34,090
- and now all of a...
- Yes, the bill is flawed,

416
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:35,897
but it's better than doing nothing.

417
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,997
And, frankly, I find it a little curious
that you're here,

418
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,704
telling me to veto a bill
you voted in favor of.

419
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:43,677
You're on the way out.

420
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,515
Some of us need to think ahead.

421
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,952
Actually, I've been doing
some thinking ahead as well, Caroline,

422
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:51,992
specifically, about my endorsement.

423
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:55,428
- What?
- I'm considering making a switch,

424
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:58,331
throwing my weight
behind Senator Challis.

425
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,998
- You can't do that.
- Can't I?

426
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:06,143
Caroline, you are everything
that's wrong with politics.

427
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:09,844
You vote not to legislate change,
but to profit.

428
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,958
You run not to make a difference,
but to make demands.

429
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:18,925
You put me on your ticket
not because I share your views,

430
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:21,831
but because I didn't share your gender.

431
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:26,375
So don't take the moral high ground.
We all know how this game is played.

432
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:28,969
- Richard, please, I...
- Good day, Caroline.

433
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,413
Richard! Richard!

434
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:36,924
You know what I got my wife
for our anniversary?

435
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,617
- What?
- A scarf.

436
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:42,631
Well, this is a big one for me.
I had to do something special.

437
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:45,294
Okay, let's get this thing down to the car.

438
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:47,770
- We'll do it all together on three.
- All right.

439
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:49,569
- Ready? One.
- Ready.

440
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:51,474
Two. Three.

441
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,976
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Put it down, put it down, put it down.

442
00:30:58,455 --> 00:31:00,617
All right, get Scofield up here right away!

443
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,128
It's working.

444
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:06,764
All right, get them out and get them dry.

445
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:08,996
We got to get them on under our clothes
before tier time,

446
00:31:09,104 --> 00:31:11,232
which is in 45 minutes.

447
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:14,004
- You think everyone else will be ready?
- We don't have a choice.

448
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:15,442
As soon as the gate's open, we go.

449
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:16,912
And we're gonna need every second.

450
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:18,381
Open on 40.

451
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:24,753
- Scofield, Pope needs to see you, ASAP.
- Now?

452
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:27,352
- What for?
- A bar mitzvah. Let's go.

453
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:30,199
- It's 6:15, bro. You can't...
- Now!

454
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:48,355
Hey, pretty, tick-tock.

455
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:47,940
Excuse me a minute.

456
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,576
Sara, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

457
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:55,553
I guess to congratulations.

458
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:57,489
Can't believe I had to hear about it
on the news.

459
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:59,528
Oh, the VP thing. Well, that's just talk.

460
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:00,653
- Is it?
- Yeah.

461
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:01,959
What was it your mother used to say?

462
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,898
"It's always nice
to be invited to the dance,

463
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:06,164
"even if you don't have the right shoes."

464
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:08,468
Yeah. She also used to say,
"Your father's a lying bastard,"

465
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:11,568
but I figured
that was just the booze talking.

466
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:13,609
You know,
it's always nice to see you, Sara.

467
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:14,876
Is there something that you needed?

468
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:17,249
- Or did you just come by to...
- Just tell me something.

469
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:20,814
Did you look at the information I gave you
from Lincoln Burrows' attorneys?

470
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:22,052
Sweetheart, move on.

471
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:25,155
The man's attorneys had a window
to present new evidence, they didn't.

472
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:26,825
Now that window is closed.

473
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,028
I just need to know,
did you look at the information?

474
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:31,231
- Come on, Sara.
- Answer me.

475
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:34,676
I swear,
working at Fox River has changed you.

476
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,680
You're always saying
you want to make a difference?

477
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,013
At that place? It's too late.

478
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,384
You should be a teacher,
so that you can get to these people

479
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,788
- before they become...
- Did you look at the information?

480
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:45,485
I didn't need to.

481
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:48,924
I supported the findings of the court.

482
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:52,361
If you have a problem with the verdict,
go after them.

483
00:33:52,472 --> 00:33:55,203
But before you do,
I suggest you look at the guy's rap sheet

484
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:57,437
and ask yourself
if the world will be a better place

485
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,013
with Lincoln Burrows walking the streets.

486
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:00,104
Just tell me one thing.

487
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:01,616
Did they promise you the vice presidency

488
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:04,552
before or after
you signed his death warrant?

489
00:34:04,655 --> 00:34:07,386
I will not discuss morality
with an addict and a thief.

490
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:09,052
You want to talk reality, Sara?

491
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:11,495
How many times did I use my influence
to keep you

492
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,761
and one of your junkie boyfriends
out of jail?

493
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:15,861
How many? Was it three, four times?

494
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,271
I swear, Sara, it's funny, you know?

495
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:21,539
You have no trouble whatsoever
with me bending the law,

496
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:24,583
especially when it's bent in your direction.

497
00:34:25,352 --> 00:34:26,581
Grow up.

498
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:34,697
You talk to that Tweener kid?

499
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:37,564
Yeah, he says he got his days mixed up,
but I don't know.

500
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:40,138
- What?
- Just something about the way he said it.

501
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,401
Oh, come on, man,
Bellick's just taking a personal.

502
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:45,002
- I don't want to get the guy busted.
- And if he's not?

503
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:48,846
I'm just saying, it's 6:30,
and no one's heard from the guy.

504
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:51,116
We got to tell Pope.

505
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,188
Okay. I'll tell him.

506
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:00,799
Did you call
a cab for the airport?

507
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:01,892
No, not yet.

508
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:03,905
Why not?
Come on, the flight leaves in an hour.

509
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:05,372
Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:09,076
I'm starting to think
that us going to Montana

511
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:10,342
might not be a good move.

512
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,315
What are you talking about?

513
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:14,718
What if you are right
and the smoking gun is in that house?

514
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,415
You think they're just gonna
let us walk in there

515
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:17,584
and make a citizen's arrest?

516
00:35:17,694 --> 00:35:19,423
Look, Nick,
I don't know what your deal is lately,

517
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,728
but I'm getting on that plane
with or without you.

518
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:27,670
I can't let you do that.

519
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:41,583
All this time you were one of them?

520
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:46,534
Who's pulling your leash, Nick?
Steadman? Kellerman?

521
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,729
Look at me.

522
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:50,101
I want you to remember my face

523
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,540
when you do
whatever the hell it is you're gonna do.

524
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:55,111
Look at me!

525
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,743
You're a coward.

526
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,903
- Scofield's outside, sir.
- Okay.

527
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:15,100
I want you to try every number we have
for Brad Bellick.

528
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,271
Try his home first.
His mother usually answers.

529
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:25,817
Mrs. Bellick? Hi.

530
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:29,293
One moment, please.
I have Warden Pope here for you.

531
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,762
Mrs. Bellick?

532
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,767
No cause for alarm, no, no. We just...
We haven't seen him,

533
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:36,839
and we were wondering
if he might be home under the weather.

534
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:45,980
So Brad called you
when he pulled in this morning?

535
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,056
And he said he was here?

536
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:50,284
Okay, well, thank you, Mrs. Bellick.

537
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:53,227
We'll keep you posted. I'm sure he's fine.

538
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:54,754
Radio Mack.

539
00:36:54,866 --> 00:36:57,028
Have him check the parking lot
for Bellick's truck.

540
00:36:57,136 --> 00:37:00,072
If he finds it,
have him call me immediately.

541
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:05,473
457.

542
00:37:05,582 --> 00:37:07,744
This is base. What's your 20?

543
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:18,957
- I'm pregnant, Fernando.
- I'm gonna have your son.

544
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,867
But all I know is, is I'm really scared.

545
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,631
I'm really scared to do this alone.

546
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,578
John, it's never too late.

547
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:36,056
If you'll agree
to accept Christ into your heart

548
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,650
and turn from your sin,

549
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:41,027
he will forgive you
and save you in eternity.

550
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:44,795
I'll give you Fibonacci
when the time is right.

551
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:46,065
The time is right now.

552
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:49,303
No, the time is right when you and I
are both standing outside those walls.

553
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:09,330
I'm gonna get out of here someday,
and when I do,

554
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:15,111
don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

555
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:31,663
I'm being shipped back off.

556
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,196
How many times I got to say it?

557
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,269
You only got one thing I need.

558
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,770
You only got one thing I need.

559
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:19,569
<i>I've got some bad news, Charles.</i>

560
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:21,905
<i>Your daughter's got esophageal cancer,</i>

561
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,242
<i>and she wants to see you
while there's still time.</i>

562
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:28,844
- How long does she have?
- Hospital says a week.

563
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:25,149
<i>I read somewhere
where the actual Taj Mahal</i>

564
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:28,053
<i>appears pink in the morning,
milky white in the evening</i>

565
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:30,491
<i>and golden when the moon shines.</i>

566
00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:34,726
<i>The changes, they say,
depict the different emotions of a woman.</i>

567
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,093
Well, I can tell you something,

568
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,363
if we don't get this thing fixed tonight,

569
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:39,702
I don't wanna know what kind of emotion
my wife is gonna have

570
00:41:39,808 --> 00:41:41,709
if I walk through that door empty-handed.

571
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,370
It's strange. I mean, it just gave way.

572
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,473
We lifted it up,
and the support beam snapped.

573
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:50,818
- What's this?
- The support.

574
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:54,725
And the one that holds up that beam.

575
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:56,763
You took it?

576
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:00,367
I'm sorry.

577
00:42:01,707 --> 00:42:04,108
But I needed to get back in here.

578
00:42:04,677 --> 00:42:08,205
- I don't understand. Why would you...
- I'm breaking out.

579
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:13,017
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.
