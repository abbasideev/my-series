00:00:01,104 --> 00:00:02,959
<i>Previously on Prison Break.</i>

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,590
I need you to let me get us out of here.

3
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:08,259
If you try to screw me over again,
I'll kill you.

4
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:10,166
Because if Crazy steps out of line,

5
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:14,574
all I gotta do is shoot him with 40ccs
of shut-your-trap, and it's beddy-bye.

6
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,713
Scofield and his whole PI crew,
they're escaping.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,487
You know I can't let you leave here, boss.

8
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:32,539
I've been clean for 18 months now.

9
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:35,612
I want to help people
get from where I've been to where I am.

10
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:39,446
I'm getting my brother out of here tonight,
and I need your help.

11
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:40,646
You're asking me to break the law.

12
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,419
I'm asking you to make a mistake.
Forget to lock up.

13
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:46,291
Leave the door unlocked
when you leave tonight.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,234
- The inmates in the psych ward all wear...
- White.

15
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:53,206
- Peroxide acts as a bleach.
- Camouflage.

16
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,212
- Where's your girl?
- She'll be at my place in about an hour.

17
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:58,647
Pretty soon,
we're going to call in our favor.

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,117
I'm getting on that plane
with or without you.

19
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,884
I can't let you do that.

20
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:07,687
- There's been an acceleration.
- Don't you want a bigger plane?

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,859
Well, not everybody gonna have a ticket.

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,234
If you can't convince a doddering old fool

23
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,536
what the best thing is
for this country's economy,

24
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:17,614
perhaps you're not
the kind of helper we're looking for.

25
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:20,015
I'm breaking out,

26
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:23,680
and you're going to make sure
my brother goes with me.

27
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,016
You son of a bitch.

28
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,217
We're going to
take this real easy, Warden.

29
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,353
I just need you to do
a couple things for me.

30
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,263
<i>- You just bought yourself 10 years.
- Warden?</i>

31
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:41,097
Bellick's truck is here, sir.
I'm staring right at it.

32
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,367
<i>Should we start looking for him?</i>

33
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,281
- Michael, if you just put that shank down...
- Tell the guard you spoke with Bellick,

34
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:49,411
and he said he's taking
some personal time.

35
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,080
You can't possibly get away with this, son.

36
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:55,563
I don't think you want to find out how
badly I want to get my brother out of here.

37
00:01:58,503 --> 00:01:59,937
<i>- Sir?
- Mack.</i>

38
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,064
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

39
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,136
I just spoke with Bellick.
He's walked into town.

40
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:07,045
<i>- He's taking some personal time.
- Is he all right?</i>

41
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,989
<i>- He's fine.
- Copy that.</i>

44
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,836
And he needs to be there overnight.

45
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,779
How long have you been planning this?

46
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:29,910
That is a conversation
for another day, Warden.

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,321
<i>- Pope to Base.
- Go ahead, sir.</i>

48
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:35,418
Have Lincoln Burrows
transferred to the infirmary.

49
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,399
<i>- I want him held overnight for tests.
- Copy that.</i>

50
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:44,276
Once we're gone, you'll find Bellick
in a hole under the guards' break room.

51
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,746
I'm sorry you got caught in the middle,

52
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,787
but, one day,
you'll understand why I did this.

53
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,483
You'll never make it over the wall.

54
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm sorry, Henry.

55
00:03:58,463 --> 00:03:59,955
Everything all right?

56
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:04,536
Yeah, he's getting an earful
from someone over at the DOC.

57
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:08,240
Oh. Is he on with Mr. Drushal?

58
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:12,478
I'm not sure,
but it's turning into a conference call

59
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,249
and he said he didn't want to be disturbed.

60
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:17,157
- Oh, well, of course.
- Have a good night.

61
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,798
You know, Michael...

62
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,370
You know, he can be
a big old grump sometimes,

63
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,137
but I hope you know
how highly he thinks of you.

64
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:30,113
There's no way he'd get that
Taj Mahal done in time for his anniversary

65
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:31,582
without your help.

66
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:54,952
It's 6:55.

67
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,624
That's five minutes till tier.

68
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,890
It's one hour till the next count.

69
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:05,330
One hour to get over that wall and
as far away from this prison as possible.

70
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,399
You unscrewed the toilet, right?

71
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:33,641
That's five minutes we don't have.

72
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,511
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just...

73
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:41,022
Just... I just feel like
my head is spinning a little.

74
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,612
Are you okay?

75
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:58,820
If we get caught,

76
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:06,766
I can't do 10 more years, bro. I can't.

77
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,739
Tier time, one hour!

78
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,318
There's no going back now.

79
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:24,325


80
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:20,927
If you get stuck
in one of them pipes, boy...

81
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,158
Bull.

82
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:31,008
Keep walking, Bull, keep walking.

83
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,478
- You okay?
- Great.

84
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:50,745
It's got blue spots.

85
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:54,645
- No, I got a late start.
- Only one thing you needed to do.

86
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,188
Block the gate. I got to finish this off.

87
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,570
Said a prayer for you, Theodore.

88
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,342
Said a prayer for us all.

89
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:35,040
I want him dead.
Anybody gets in the way, gets run over.

90
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:48,906
Hey, do you want some coffee?

91
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:53,577
Just a half cup, Mack.
If I have more than that, I'll be up all night.

92
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:55,211
Thank you, bro.

93
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,840
How many more screws?

94
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,064
Get C-Note out here.

95
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:33,509
Huh? Haven't seen him, man.

96
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,049
That's real touching and all,
you sticking up for a brother,

97
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:40,020
but y'all need to step aside, right now.

98
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,243
Something you need?

99
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:00,612
- Where is he?
- Told you, we haven't seen him.

100
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:18,445
<i>Wilson, medical eval, five minutes.</i>

101
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:20,384
<i>Ramirez, report to the...</i>

102
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,326
This whole time,
everything you said was a lie?

103
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:30,963
No. No, I never stopped fighting
for Lincoln's innocence, never.

104
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,670
They approached me after I took this case.

105
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,836
Who's they?

106
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:36,839
John Abruzzi.

107
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,350
- John Abruzzi, the mob boss?
- Yes, yes.

108
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,516
How much did he pay you?

109
00:11:42,224 --> 00:11:43,624
My father's freedom.

110
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:46,663
- You said your father was exonerated.
- I lied, okay?

111
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:49,258
I agreed to keep tabs on you.
In exchange, Abruzzi had some guy

112
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,563
who was already doing a life sentence

113
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:52,538
cop to the murder
that my father didn't commit.

114
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:54,837
And that's how I got him out of jail.

115
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,081
- Your dad's life for mine.
- No one needs to get hurt here, Veronica.

116
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,018
Oh, you think Abruzzi
wants legal advice from me?

117
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:03,683
All you have to do is make sure Michael
gives this Abruzzi guy

118
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:05,853
what he needs to know, that's it.

119
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:10,869
Nick, you don't think
they're gonna let me live, do you?

120
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,104
I gotta believe that.

121
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,728
Yeah. Okay.

122
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:28,923
Right.

123
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:32,571
Stand up. We have to go.

124
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:35,807
Get up.

125
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,041
Charles.

126
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,426
Here you go.

127
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,236
Sucre, drop the sheet.

128
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,514
Manche, you're next.

129
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,280
Let's move it.

130
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:06,660
That one's for you.

131
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:08,460
Move your fat ass.

132
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,742
That's for you.

133
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,145
Age before beauty.

134
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:29,922
All right.

135
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,281
So, you got a key to the infirmary?

136
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,449
Not exactly.

137
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,880
- All right. How are we doing, baby?
- Not good.

138
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:21,713
- All right. How are we doing, baby?
- Not good.

139
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,581
We're already 10 minutes behind.
Let's move it.

140
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:24,881
Give me that.

141
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:18,605
Help!

142
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:23,382
Help!

143
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:29,931
Help!

144
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:31,768
Help!

145
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:37,952
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

146
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,658
Help!

147
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,349
Hear anything?

148
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,187
There's nobody here, man.

149
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,093
I swear, I heard something.

150
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:10,705
Come on, let's go.

151
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,640
You scream

152
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:18,115
and I'll cut out your windpipe, got me?

153
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:20,312
I need his jacket and his hat.

154
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:00,848
Evening, Doc.

155
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:07,527
Brains of the outfit, huh, Scofield?

156
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,995
He's leading you off a cliff, boys.

157
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,700
Now, you're acting like you still in charge.

158
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:16,040
Shut your mouth, bitch.

159
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:21,645
Let's go.

160
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:29,099
You. You know, he's...

161
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:00,208
Nick, please don't do this.

162
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:03,118
Tell Michael to give Abruzzi
what he wants.

163
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:06,217
Please, Nick, come on,
they're going to kill me. Nick!

164
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,190
Nick! Please, no!

165
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,062
No, Nick.

166
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:16,005
Everyone put your coveralls on.
I'll be back in a minute.

167
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,806
Yo, where you going, man?

168
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,340
Hey!

169
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,317
You heard him. Come on.

170
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,191
This is ridiculous, man.

171
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,762
One, three, five, eight.

172
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:56,975
Three, five, eight, one. Enter.

173
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:01,580
Eight, one, three, five. Enter.

174
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:21,171
The scope of this, which we're all
aware of, can cloud judgment.

175
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:24,281
I suggest we look at this
in very simple terms.

176
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:28,517
We have an employee,
she's not working out. We fire her.

177
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:29,920
It needs to be that simple.

178
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,466
<i>She's the Vice President
of the United States.</i>

179
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:35,903
<i>And that's all she'll ever be.
She's plummeting in the polls.</i>

180
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:40,445
<i>If we keep her as our candidate, we're
handing the presidency to her opponent,</i>

181
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:44,618
<i>and then everything we hope to gain
with Caroline in office, it's all gone.</i>

182
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,418
<i>Fine. We ask her to drop out.</i>

183
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,423
How do we know she'll keep her mouth
shut on everything she knows?

184
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,958
Samantha?

185
00:19:57,207 --> 00:19:58,232
Yes, sir.

186
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:00,609
I need a very frank assessment
from you, right now.

187
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:04,345
Based on your contact with her,
will the Vice President go quietly?

188
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:08,815
No. Absolutely not.

189
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,488
Becoming president
is the most important thing to her.

190
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:14,865
If we take that away,
she has absolutely nothing to lose.

191
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,533
And I guarantee you, she will do
everything she can

192
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:19,975
to take everyone she can down with her.

193
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:24,851
We need to make a move on her. Now.

194
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,995
Okay, here we go. Go.

195
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:37,567
You okay, Doc?

196
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,155
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

197
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:31,323
What are we supposed to do, just sit here?

198
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:33,522
No. I don't know!

199
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,159
Man. This whole thing is messed up, bro.

200
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,432
Feel free not to come, Gordo.

201
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:06,444
We're screwed. We're screwed!

202
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,112
Come on, let's go! Let's...

203
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:10,618
- Michael, we got to go back.
- We're moving forward.

204
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,779
We stick with the plan.

205
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,155
Look, do your ears work, fool?
Do you hear that?

206
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,285
It's the fire alarm in psych ward.

207
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:18,126
- How do you know?
- I set it off.

208
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:19,325
Why?

209
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,676
<i>Exit the building
in an orderly fashion.</i>

210
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:32,583
<i>Exit the building in an orderly fashion.</i>

211
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:16,626
We're in the sticks.

212
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,028
You know how many people
would have heard a jet like this land?

213
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,692
Don't worry about it.

214
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:30,244
False alarm.
Back to the psych ward, everyone.

215
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,115
Walk in with me, now. Very good.

216
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:38,388
- Just gonna keep on walking.
- Come on, guys, you heard him.

217
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,833
Come on, let's go. It's cold out here.

218
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:45,867
That's it.

219
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,072
Come on, baby, let's go.

220
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:05,030
Hold up!

221
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:08,911
- Got some stragglers.
- Cool.

222
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,940
Let's go!

223
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:17,551
Wait a minute.
That's not wack-shack-issue.

224
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,649
Everybody, stop!

225
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:21,756
Stay where you are!
I said, stay where you are.

226
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:24,135
What's the problem?

227
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,041
That's John Abruzzi right there.

228
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:33,449
Yeah, that's... That's bad news.

229
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:36,352
Listen, you got that sedative
you were talking about?

230
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:38,984
- Yeah.
- You got some now?

231
00:24:39,962 --> 00:24:41,590
- Yeah.
- Let's have it.

232
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,766
- This will put him out, right?
- Like a light.

233
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:58,391
Let's go. Let's go, let's go!

234
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:01,760
- Where are we going?
- Straight down the hall. Straight down.

235
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,503
Nick, please don't do this.

236
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:28,866
Come on.

237
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,771
- What's going on?
- I'm getting you to the airport.

238
00:25:32,883 --> 00:25:35,979
Go, go, go.
You get to Blackfoot, you find Steadman.

239
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:39,059
There's still time for you
to get to the bottom of this thing.

240
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,551
Take this, take this.

241
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:46,166
I'm sorry about this, okay?
You gotta believe me, I'm sorry.

242
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,237
- Take her to O'Hare.
- You bet.

243
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,081
Dad, you still got the key
to my apartment?

244
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:02,823
Yeah, just meet me there.
I'll explain it later, just meet me there.

245
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:18,819
Halfway there, yo.

246
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:25,255
- What's up?
- I know you told Bellick.

247
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:30,640
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- But I owed you, and I pay my debts.

248
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,271
But as soon as we're out of here,
you go your way, we'll go ours.

249
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:36,749
You understand?

250
00:26:58,654 --> 00:26:59,747
Oh, Sara.

251
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:03,089
It was a false alarm at the psych ward.
That's what all that racket was about.

252
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:04,526
Good, thank you.

253
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:07,059
Good night.

254
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,453
Hey. Look, baby, it ain't worth it
if it's gonna kill you.

255
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:24,757
I'm getting out of here.

256
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,995
Good night, Doctor.

257
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:12,035
- You're overreacting.
- I don't mean to shock you, Paul,

258
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,010
but I am privy to things that you're not.
And I am telling you,

259
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,280
- the company is selling me down the river.
- It's a Legend for Literacy fundraiser.

260
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,944
- The company is selling me down the river.
- It's a Legend for Literacy fundraiser.

261
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:22,079
It doesn't mean anything.
It's a rubber-chicken dinner.

262
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:24,921
Which I got uninvited to on the day of.

263
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:26,619
You don't do that to your candidate,

264
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:29,859
unless the candidate
is no longer your candidate.

265
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:32,504
Caroline, you've been drinking,
you're upset.

266
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:36,100
How can you not understand this
is so beyond me.

267
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,941
I would think,
after being by my side for 15 years,

268
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,921
you would have gained
at least a rudimentary understanding

269
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:45,390
of how things work.

270
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:47,326
Listen to me. Listen to me.

271
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:51,699
They're doing this
to see how you will react.

272
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:54,139
So you need to be strong.

273
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:58,340
Be presidential, and you get through this.

274
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:01,209
We get through this.

275
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,962
I'm figuring I'll need a two-inch lift,

276
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:13,834
if I'm gonna run with the new set
of 30-by-nine-and-a-halfs.

277
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,237
Question is,

278
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:19,508
add coil springs
or just stay with the spacers?

279
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:20,982
What do you think?

280
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:23,311
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

281
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:24,720
Easy, hey.

282
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:28,329
I ain't a hero for $14 an hour.
You do what you will.

283
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,957
- Uncuff my brother.
- You got it, boss.

284
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:43,341
- Pretend I ain't here, boss.
- Oh, yeah. You and the radio.

285
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,604
Dad, are you here?

286
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,776
Dad, you gotta get ready. We gotta go.

287
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:04,014
How's it going, Savrinn?

288
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,752
<i>And I get why the guy's
lighting the candle,</i>

289
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:28,258
<i>but why are the other two
playing the bagpipes?</i>

290
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:31,999
<i>Welcome to Joke Line.
Just $2.99 a minute...</i>

291
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:34,866
<i>- What the hell?
...50 cents for each additional minute.</i>

292
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:36,405
Where's the lawyer?

293
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,075
- She's gone.
- Yeah?

294
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:42,913
- Then so is your dad.
- No, no!

295
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:44,712
Don't.

296
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:47,490
- Have you got her or not?
- I can find her.

297
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:50,963
And will you have her in front of me
in the next two minutes?

298
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:53,159
It's a very simple question, Nick.

299
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:57,675
No. Just... Just give me a chance.
You just got to listen to me.

300
00:30:58,076 --> 00:31:01,673
- No!
- Hey! This is happening right now!

301
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:05,276
You have one more chance!
Where's the lawyer?

302
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,362
Where's the lawyer?

303
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:24,942
She's about a million miles away
from here. You're never gonna find her.

304
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:27,589
Why don't you just sock it?

305
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:49,592
Better be open, bro.

306
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,299
We're in.

307
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:17,029
First we gotta get that window out,

308
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:19,630
then we gotta get the bars off.

309
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,846
Manche, Manche.

310
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:34,891
- Is this gonna work?
- We're about to find out.

311
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,134
Warden?

312
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:46,776
Warden?

313
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:05,506
Ready.

314
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,346
Pull that. Come on.

315
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:22,641
What now, genius?

316
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:37,324
Take your time.
We got 15 minutes to get over that wall.

317
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,728
We're through.

318
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,603
And you're sure
you didn't see him walk out?

319
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:26,805
Positive.

320
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,978
Let's go, guys,
I need those suits.

321
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,325
Good job, kiddo.

322
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:38,931
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

323
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,662
Take this.

324
00:34:46,747 --> 00:34:47,976
I knew it.

325
00:34:48,283 --> 00:34:49,580
- Haywire.
- I knew it.

326
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:52,520
As soon as I saw you go
into psych ward, I knew it.

327
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,214
Either I come with...

328
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:58,430
You want me to make
a little person-to-person call here?

329
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,660
Haywire, just take it easy.

330
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:02,567
The other person being
a correctional officer.

331
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:04,131
He's in.

332
00:35:04,242 --> 00:35:05,504
- What?
- He's in.

333
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:07,446
You're crazy!

334
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:08,447
You're crazy!

335
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:12,957
Okay, after Lincoln, we go alphabetically.

336
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:16,152
- Whoa, hold on, A-bruzzi.
- You want a seat on the plane?

337
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:19,055
Line forms after me.

338
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,239
Got it?

339
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,745
Yeah. Go, go, go.

340
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,034
- Hey, Roy?
- Yeah?

341
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,633
- Did you see Pope leave?
- No.

342
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,407
No way he could have walked by?

343
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:50,984
I haven't left my post since I punched in.

344
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:48,735
All right.

345
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,930
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Charles?

346
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:46,005
- You okay, old man?
- No.

347
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:48,569
Let's take a look.

348
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:02,192
It's just a few more steps.
You can make it.

349
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:06,738
Oh, I could make it another foot,
maybe two, but why?

350
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,505
I wasn't going for me.
I was going for my daughter.

351
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:14,140
And you can do that. Will you promise me?

352
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:18,251
Yes, I promise.

353
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:23,923
The money is buried under a silo

354
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:28,473
at the Double K Ranch
just outside of Tooele, Utah.

355
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:32,276
There's plenty to split.

356
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,712
The government didn't want
any more embarrassment

357
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:40,725
after I took off with the money,
so they lowballed it to the papers.

358
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,891
The truth is, Michael,

359
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:46,295
it's not $1 million under that silo.

360
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:50,033
There's $5 million there.

361
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,246
- You check the chow hall?
- Yeah. Nothing.

362
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:15,782
- Anybody try his cell phone?
- Oh.

363
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:21,959
Give Anna her Papa's love.

364
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:26,004
I will. I will.

365
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:39,425
Here, easy, easy.

366
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:56,088
Now, where is that coming from?

367
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,404
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Control, this is S and E 5.

368
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:08,999
I have a code three in the warden's office.
I repeat, code three.

369
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:11,741
- Sound the alarm.
- Patterson to Base. Right now.

370
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,044
- No, right now.
- Sound the alarm!

371
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,175
- Yo, bro, we gotta go.
- Go, Michael.

372
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,613
Go, and don't look back.

373
00:40:37,558 --> 00:40:39,117
- No, no, no.
- Go on.

374
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:40,559
I better go last.

375
00:40:43,435 --> 00:40:46,633
Come on, Michael! Come on. Come on.

376
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,912
Michael, move it!

377
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,119
<i>All prisoners,
prepare for immediate shakedown.</i>

378
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:00,520
Come on!

379
00:41:10,278 --> 00:41:12,576
Michael, come on! Come on, Michael.

380
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,013
Michael, come on.

381
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,475
Go, go, go.

382
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:54,772
Come on, move it!
Michael, come on, move.

383
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:02,359
Michael!

384
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,388
Michael, grab my hand.

385
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:07,800
Michael, give me your hand.

386
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,576
Give me your hand. Come on.

387
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,608
Give me your hand. Come on.

388
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:32,130
Check out the wire. He's on the wall!

389
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:33,168
Get down!

390
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:37,849
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Get down!
