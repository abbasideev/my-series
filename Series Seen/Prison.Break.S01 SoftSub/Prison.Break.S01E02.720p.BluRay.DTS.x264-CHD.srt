1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,966
I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison cell.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>- Why do you want to see Burrows?
- Because he's my brother.</i>

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,640
So you get yourself
tossed into Fox River with him?

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,017
To what? Save him?

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,270
And whoever it was that set me up wants me
in the ground as quickly as possible.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,566
The closer it gets, the more I'm worried that
the bottom will fall out of this whole thing.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,860
That son of a bitch fingered Abruzzi.

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,655
<i>- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?</i>

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,075
<i>- Why'd you hire him?
- Keep your friends close,</i>

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,826
and your enemies closer.

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,747
- They come at me, I'm coming after you.
- I doubt it.

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,668
I'm getting you out of here.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,128
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place it isn't.

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,799
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

16
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,551
I've got 'em on me.

17
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,986
You're anticipating every one of my moves
three moves in advance.

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,863
You're a hell of a strategist, fish.

19
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,867
You ever think about Boston?
Think you'll ever see it again?

20
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:21,123
I'm a 60-year-old man with 60 years left
on my ticket. What do you think?

21
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:25,669
- I'm thinking about going.
- Well, there's going and there's going.

22
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,754
Which one do you mean?

23
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,132
The one you think I mean.

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:38,432
Three days inside and he's already
thinking about turning rabbit.

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:44,813
It'll pass. It always does. Got bigger things
to worry about at the moment.

26
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,899
I've been in here long enough
to know it when I see it.

27
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,610
The calm before the storm.

28
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:54,281
Whites and blacks are going at each other
real soon here.

29
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,659
Everybody chooses sides
and a lot of guys bleed.

30
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,453
There a reason?

31
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,748
Same reason you don't put
cats and dogs in the same cage.

32
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,125
They don't get along.

33
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,947
- Hm.
- What?

34
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,909
- Toilet won't flush.
- So?

35
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,037
<i>- Means only one thing, fish.
- Shakedown!</i>

36
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,543
You can't flush your contraband.

37
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,255
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Says who?

38
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,679
<i>Under the table, conjo.</i>

39
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,436
- What the hell is this?
- It's insurance, white boy. Now dump it.

40
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,610
Open it.

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,574
So, tooling up for the race riot, are we?

44
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,254
- Which side are you on, anyhow, fish?
- That would be neither, boss.

45
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:37,384
Maybe you're gonna go extracurricular
with it, then. Stick a CO, maybe.

46
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,846
- Is there a problem here, deputy?
- Got a shank in here.

47
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,892
Is this yours?

48
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,652
You're not a good liar.

49
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,906
Come on, Sucre. You're going to the SHU.

50
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,415
- Move along.
- I'm not done shaking this cell down yet.

51
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,126
I said move along.

52
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,258
In the old man's back pocket, are you?
Well, I got news for you, fish.

53
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:23,930
He may run this place during the day,
but I run it during the night.

54
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:30,289


55
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,390


56
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,766
<i>What the hell
were you thinking, Michael?</i>

57
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,187
- How are we doing it?
- The infirmary.

58
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,606
<i>Infirmary.</i>

59
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,233
It's the weakest link in the security chain.

60
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,361
If I get that PUGNAc,
I'll get all the access I need.

61
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:25,074
- What the hell's a PUGNAc?
- It lowers my insulin levels.

62
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,744
As long as the good doctor
thinks I'm diabetic,

63
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,789
- I'll have time there to do what I need to do.
- Which is?

64
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,958
A little work. A little prep for your arrival.

65
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,836
- That's the idea, anyway.
- The idea?

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,509
There's a little hitch in getting the PUGNAc.
They don't exactly stock it at the commissary.

67
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:48,306
- This thing's riding on a bunch of pills?
- Someone's working on it as we speak.

68
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,231
- Now's not the time to trust a black inmate.
- Our relationship transcends race.

69
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,275
Nothing transcends race in here.

70
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,570
Good behaviour,
you're outta here in three years.

71
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,199
- Gonna be a whole lot sooner then that.
- It can't be done.

72
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,618
No one's ever broken out of Fox River.

73
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,996
Every step's already been mapped out.
Every contingency.

74
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,335
You may have the blueprints to this place but
there's one thing those plans can't show you.

75
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:23,132
Guys like Abruzzi. You so much as look at
these guys the wrong way, they'll cut you up.

76
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:28,471
As far as these guys are concerned, I'm just
a con doing his time, staying out of trouble.

77
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:33,226
- You don't gotta look for trouble. It finds you.
- And when it does, we'll be long gone.

78
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,895
This is madness. You can't get outta your cell.

79
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,398
- Not true.
- What, you got a key?

80
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,025
<i>Something like that.</i>

81
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,243
<i> Wrong piece of real estate,
fish. Belongs to T-Bag.</i>

82
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,245
<i>Who?</i>

83
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,833
Speak with respect, fish. Man kidnapped
half a dozen boys and girls down in 'Bama.

84
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,420
Raped and killed 'em.
Wasn't always in that order either.

85
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,341
<i>- Does T-Bag have a real name?
- That is my real name.</i>

86
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,972
No, no, no. Please, sit.

87
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,938
So, you're the new one I've been hearing
all the rave reviews about.

88
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,856
Scofield.

89
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,360
One thing's for sure.
You're just as pretty as advertised.

90
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,195
Prettier, even.

91
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,534
- Rugheads got you scared, do they?
- Sorry?

92
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:59,747
I assume that's why you're over here. A few
days on the inside, any white man realises

93
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:04,418
the correctional system's got a lean
toward the African-American persuasion.

94
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,422
- I hadn't noticed.
- They got the numbers, all right.

95
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,051
We got one thing they don't. Surprise.

96
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,388
We gonna take the ball game
to them real soon.

97
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:20,184
It's gonna be nasty for a first-timer like you.
We'll protect you. I'll protect you.

98
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:25,439
All you gotta do is...
take this pocket right here

99
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,569
and your life'll be all peaches and cream.
I walk, you walk with me.

100
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,989
I'll keep you real close
so no one up in here can hurt you.

101
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,826
Looks to me you already got a girlfriend.

102
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,789
I got a whole 'nother pocket over here.

103
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,625
I'll pass.

104
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,089
I don't protect you, them rugheads
are gonna gobble you up like a plate of peas.

105
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,092
- I said no.
- Then you'd best move, then.

106
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,512
Now.

107
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:05,438
You come around these bleachers again, it's
gonna be more than words we're exchanging.

108
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,482
Know what I'm saying?

109
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,821
<i>Are you the Tim Giles
that represented Lincoln Burrows?</i>

110
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:18,075
- If you're a reporter...
- I'm not a reporter. I know the defendant.

111
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,954
- Oh. You family?
- Not exactly.

112
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,415
We were in a relationship a few years back.

113
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,960
Ma'am, I... I don't know what to tell you.
The man was guilty.

114
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,840
- The prosecution's case was a slam dunk.
- The victim was the vice president's brother.

115
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,094
If you're suggesting the government
rammed this through, I take offence.

116
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,681
- I fought for that guy.
- That's not what I meant.

117
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,727
The evidence was there.
Lincoln worked for Steadman's company.

118
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,607
He gets into a public altercation with the guy,
so he gets fired. Steadman's shot dead.

119
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,235
The weapon's found in Lincoln's house,
the blood on his clothes.

120
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,449
Trust me. There are cases you lose sleep over
but this isn't one of 'em.

121
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:03,829
What about Crab Simmons?
Lincoln said he could exonerate him.

122
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,750
The man's a five-time felon, all right?
He had no credibility.

123
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,961
- So you wouldn't mind if I paid him a visit?
- Be my guest.

124
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,298
But I don't think it'll do you any good.

125
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,113
Strange feeling. Don't know how to explain it.

126
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:46,539
You know, um, usually my whole life
it's always been crazy and noisy.

127
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,417
Maddening, you know, in my head.

128
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,462
But now it's quiet.

129
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,590
It's perfect.

130
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm glad you came back.

131
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:04,056
I thought about you the whole time.

132
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,059
You know, I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

133
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,436
I know that.

134
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,148
- I'm gonna make it right.
- I know you will.

135
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,577
- What are you doing?
- I want to remember this.

136
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,788
- No.
- Oh, come on. Come on, Vi, please. Just one.

137
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,039
OK.

138
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,176
- Easy.
- How are we doing on the PUGNAc?

139
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,515
- Hey, I'm working on it.
- Well, work faster. I need that stuff tonight.

140
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,019
What's up there in that infirmary
that you need so bad?

141
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,064
You get me that PUGNAc
and maybe I'll tell you.

142
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,744
<i>Uh-uh-uh.</i>

143
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,710
Thought we had an understanding.
This here's for the family.

144
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:20,924
You made it pretty clear you ain't blood.
How about you hand that over?

145
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:37,441
Nice-Iookin' piece of steel. Bit of work.
You could do some serious damage with it.

146
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:40,986
Question is,
who is it you was planning on damaging?

147
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,155
I seen you with the Negroes, you know.

148
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:47,201
Well, maybe you're one of them
milk chickens, all confused, like.

149
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,371
White on the outside,
black as tar on the inside.

150
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,624
Maybe we oughta take a look at them insides
and find out.

151
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,461
Girl Scouts, is there a problem over there?

152
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,259
<i>I think we'll just hang onto this
if that's OK with you.</i>

153
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,639
Hey! I'm not gonna ask you again.
Let's break up the party, ladies.

154
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,476
You heard the man, little doggie.

155
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,312
Get along.

156
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,746
What's it take to shake down another inmate?
Get something he's taken from you?

157
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,499
- It would take Fibonacci.
- Well, I'll give you Fibonacci.

158
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,501
I promise you that.

159
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,713
<i>- When the time is right.
- The time is right now.</i>

160
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,966
No, when you and I are both standing
outside those walls.

161
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,137
You're on life without parole.
You'll never stand outside those walls.

162
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,391
Not unless you knew someone,
someone who knew a way out.

163
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:21,813
- What do you say, John?
- I say I've heard nothing but blabber.

164
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,418
Philly Falzone.

165
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,214
It's an honour. What are you doing here?

166
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,135
Well, I, uh, just thought we'd,
you know, fraternise.

167
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,389
- He looks like it, doesn't he?
- Looks what?

168
00:16:55,472 --> 00:17:01,186
Like everybody's been saying.
You got no sack. You've been neutered.

169
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,522
You shouldn't talk to me like that.

170
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,358
- You used to pick up my laundry.
- Not any more.

171
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:11,863
Word is someone knows where Fibonacci is
and you're not doing anything about it.

172
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,950
- I'm working on it.
- Not fast enough.

173
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:18,328
Apparently Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

174
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,665
Next month, a congressional hearing.

175
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:27,629
Now, if he testifies at that hearing
a lot of people are going down, including me.

176
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,799
Now, I've known you a long time.

177
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:35,637
Our wives are friends.
Our kids go to the same Catholic school.

178
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,852
It would be a shame if anything happened to
your kids. I know my kids would miss them.

179
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,105
- You don't need to do this.
- I do.

180
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:48,733
I'll get this guy. We'll get Fibonacci.

181
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:53,405
- For everyone's sake, I hope you're right.
- I am.

182
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:55,615
Be well, John.

183
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,995
Thank you.

184
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,589
Yo, badge, I gotta use the phone.

185
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:18,430
- Sure. You want a pizza and a pedicure too?
- I gotta call my girl. She's expecting my call.

186
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:24,686
- Put a sock in it. You got nothing coming.
- No, no, no, man! No, man!

187
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,235
Hey, pull up the manifest.

188
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:37,949
Is there an Allen Schweitzer in gen pop?

189
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,829
- No.
- How about the SHU?

190
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,956
No. Why you asking?

191
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,125
Curious, that's all.

192
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:31,920
You hear the trumpets, fish?
I know you can. That's Judgment Day.

193
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:34,506
It's coming. Real soon.

194
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,683
<i>Yo, Curly! Come on, May Tag.</i>

195
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,079
<i>What you doing in my cell?</i>

196
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,501
I want in.

197
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,054
I'm not sure I heard that.
Did you say you're in?

198
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,559
<i>- That's right.
- In for an inch, in for a mile.</i>

199
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:31,813
You want me to fight, I'll fight.
The bolt from the bleachers was for that.

200
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:37,652
Well, you wanna fight,
you're gonna get your chance. Next count.

201
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,696
- Tonight?
- Problem with that?

202
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:45,952
We goin' straight at 'em. You better catch a
square, fish. We're undermanned in a big way.

203
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:50,373
- All I need's a weapon.
- You want a weapon, bitch?

204
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:55,086
<i>- There you go.
- All prisoners, return to your cells.</i>

205
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,549
You have to prove yourself
before we trust you with the heavy artillery.

206
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:02,427
<i>Gates closing!</i>

207
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,980
- I'm sorry for being so short with you before.
- No problem.

208
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:17,567
Closer it gets to an execution,
the harder it becomes.

209
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,195
That's why I wanted to give you this.

210
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,489
It's the surveillance tape
of the garage that night.

211
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,826
It was a closed trial
so no one outside the courtroom saw it.

212
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,162
- It could help you out.
- With what?

213
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,122
Closure.

214
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:23,341
Allen Schweitzer.
That name mean anything to you?

215
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:28,513
- Should it?
- I don't know. You tell me.

216
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,102
- Never heard of the guy.
- Are you sure?

217
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:36,270
Positive.

218
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,504
Ah, what's up, snowflake?

219
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:11,806
Do you think I'm a fool?

220
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:18,271
- What are you talking about?
- I see you up there with the Hitler Youth.

221
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:20,857
I got a good mind
to slash you open right now.

222
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,611
It's not what you think.
They've got something I need.

223
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:30,867
Now, see, that's funny,
because I got something you need too.

224
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,787
You want your PUGNAc, fish? Huh?

225
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:40,168
I hate 'em, baby. So will you.

226
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:47,675
Listen, white boy. Your luckjust ran out.

227
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:50,011
You chose the wrong side.

228
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:35,128
Man, it's great to see your face.

229
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:42,577
I think it's time you quit the charade,
don't you?

230
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:46,498
- What?
- It's starting to ruin people's lives.

231
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:50,210
Michael's in here
cos he thinks you're innocent.

232
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:54,506
- What's he told you?
- He hasn't told me anything, but I know.

233
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,050
I know what he's planning.

234
00:24:57,134 --> 00:25:00,345
Call him off. If you love him, call him off.

235
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:05,851
- I saw the tape.
- That's not how it went down.

236
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:11,022
- I know what I saw.
- I know what I saw. I was there, remember?

237
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:20,949
<i>I got high that night. I had to.
It was the only way I could go through with it.</i>

238
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:38,216
<i>I never pulled the trigger.
The guy was already dead.</i>

239
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:42,429
- I know. You told me a thou...
- Listen! I was set up.

240
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:47,267
I went there to clear a debt. Crab Simmons
was on my ass for the 90 grand I owed him.

241
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,979
Told me the mark was some drug dealer
and if I took it we'd be clean.

242
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:55,358
I never pulled the trigger. Somebody wanted
me in the same garage as Steadman.

243
00:25:55,442 --> 00:25:58,320
Why would somebody wanna set you up?

244
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:03,116
It wasn't about me. It was about him.

245
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,784
- Steadman?
- Yes.

246
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:09,706
The guy was a saint. All the charity work, the
environmental progress his company made.

247
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:14,544
About the only person in this entire country
who had motive to kill him was you.

248
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:19,633
You came all the way down here
to tell me how guilty I am?

249
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:22,469
I don't know why I came here.

250
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:29,935
You have your life now. I know that.

251
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:36,149
But if what we had before meant anything
to you, you'd find out the truth.

252
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,487
Maybe all this is the truth.

253
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:43,365
Maybe they got it right.

254
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:23,446
- Badge! Badge, open up! Badge!
- You talking again?

255
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,618
It's my girl's birthday. Please. I'll give you
$1 million if you let me use the phone.

256
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:32,372
I've seen your kick. You got something
like 40 cents to your name.

257
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:35,375
Please! No! No! No!

258
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:01,568
All right, Maricruz.
What are you doing? Come on.

259
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:05,488
- It's OK, Hector. You go ahead.
- What are you talking about?

260
00:28:05,572 --> 00:28:11,536
- I think I'm just gonna take a cab.
- What do you mean? You just got here.

261
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:17,250
He didn't call you, did he?

262
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:24,174
Look. I love Fernando to death,
but the guy's a deadbeat.

263
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:26,968
You gotta move on with your life.

264
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:37,604
- Mr Giles, we'd like a word with you.
- I really don't...

265
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:41,191
I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.

266
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:47,447
It's come to our attention that you made
a FOIL request on the Burrows case.

267
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,160
- Yeah. So?
- You made a dupe off the surveillance tape.

268
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:53,912
That's right.

269
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:58,958
- Mind us asking why?
- It was for one of Burrows' old girlfriends.

270
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:03,338
She thought the guy was innocent.
I figured it'd help her with closure.

271
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,423
She's in possession of the tape now?

272
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:09,302
Don't pull that card with me.
It's the Freedom of Information Act.

273
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:14,015
- She's entitled to that tape as much as you.
- No, no, no. By all means. By all means.

274
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:16,684
- May I go now?
- Just one more thing.

275
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:19,062
This old girlfriend of his.

276
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:21,356
What's her name?

277
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:37,497
- Excuse me. Is this the Simmons residence?
- I'm Ms Simmons.

278
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,669
I'm sorry. Um, I'm Veronica Donovan.
I'm looking for Crab Simmons.

279
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:45,338
- Are you related?
- He's my son.

280
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:48,132
- Is he around?
- No.

281
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:52,470
- Could you tell me where I could find him?
- Lady, go away. I can't help you.

282
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:57,058
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just... a man's life is at stake,

283
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:59,644
and maybe your son could help him.

284
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:01,854
Crab can't help nobody, lady.

285
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:04,023
He's dead.

286
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,569
I'm sorry.

287
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,711
Heads up! Seven up, cons.
Stand at your gates.

288
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:31,092
About to jump off, fish.

289
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,860
Ballard, get back on your number.

290
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:54,615
<i>- Need backup right away.
- I said get back on your number.</i>

291
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:42,038
<i>Get back immediately!</i>

292
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:59,013
Help me.

293
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:02,558
<i>Inmates, back down!</i>

294
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:04,393
Scofield!

295
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:07,772
<i>Inmates, back in your cells!</i>

296
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:23,454
<i>Get back immediately!</i>

297
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:44,183
You're a dead man, Scofield.

298
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:46,602
Do you hear me?

299
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:49,564
You're a dead man!

300
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,461
I really don't know
what to say to you gentlemen.

301
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:45,009
I try to give you the benefit of the doubt.
I try to treat you with respect.

302
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:47,428
You can't even respect yourselves.

303
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:53,559
So, there's gonna be a 48-hour lockdown.
No mess, no showers, no visitation.

304
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:59,190
And I strongly suggest
that you all learn to get along,

305
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:03,986
otherwise the next time it's gonna be a week
and the time after that, a month.

306
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,614
Think about it.

307
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:42,442
<i>- Got a Leticia Barris on the line.
- I don't know who that is.</i>

308
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:46,112
She says she used to date Crab Simmons.

309
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:51,659
<i>- Thank you for calling.
- You wanna hear what I have to say?</i>

310
00:34:51,742 --> 00:34:56,372
<i>- We meet in public where they can't get to us.
- Wait. Where who can't get to us?</i>

311
00:34:56,456 --> 00:35:00,334
<i>You wanna hear what I have to say?
Cos if you don't, I'm gonna hang up now.</i>

312
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:04,046
No, no, no, no.
You just name the time and the place.

313
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,429
<i>- Over here.
- Hey, Leticia, thanks for coming.</i>

314
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:15,975
We don't know each other. We'll stay out
here in the open where they can't get to us,

315
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:19,145
where they can't do what they do.

316
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:22,648
They gonna kill your boy
like they killed mine.

317
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:26,152
Coroner said smack killed your boyfriend.
It was an overdose.

318
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:28,070
- No overdose.
- What do you mean?

319
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:32,491
Crab didn't use. He had a bad heart.
If he touched the stuff, it'd kill him.

320
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:37,705
Don't you think it's just a bit of a coincidence
he OD'd a week after your boyfriend's crime?

321
00:35:37,788 --> 00:35:41,626
They killed him cos he knew things,
things they didn't wanna get out.

322
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:44,462
- Like what?
- Like who was really behind that hit.

323
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:49,425
It wasn't Crab and it wasn't Lincoln. Neither
of them knew what they were getting into.

324
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:53,012
They were just pawns in a big game.
They're here.

325
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:56,766
- Who's here, Leticia?
- Don't try to follow me. I won't testify.

326
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:00,978
- Just slow down and talk to me.
- I'd get as far away from here as you can, girl,

327
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:04,398
cos there ain't nobody they can't get to.

328
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:06,067
Leticia!

329
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:44,814
- Hello?
- We have a small complication.

330
00:36:44,897 --> 00:36:47,024
There's a lawyer poking around.

331
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:49,735
<i>Veronica Donovan.</i>

332
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:51,237
Yes.

333
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,701
You can handle a girl who graduated
in the middle of her Baylor Law School class.

334
00:36:56,784 --> 00:37:03,374
At least, I'd like to think so, given the stakes
of what we're dealing with here.

335
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:12,299
Anyone that's a threat to what we're doing
is expendable.

336
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:14,635
<i>- Anyone.
- Understood.</i>

337
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,221
<i>Do what you need to
do to make this go away.</i>

338
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:34,405
Are you there, pretty?

339
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:40,286
I know you're there.

340
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:43,622
Just want you to know I'm coming for you.

341
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:47,001
You got nowhere to run.

342
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:50,546
You're trapped in that little hole of yours,

343
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:53,924
trapped like a pig I'm gonna slaughter.

344
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,852
<i>- Who's my one o'clock?
- Michael Scofield.</i>

345
00:39:30,854 --> 00:39:34,108
<i>- I was wrong about you.
- Here's your PUGNAc.</i>

346
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:37,111
- A little bit late.
- Better late than never, right?

347
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:40,114
- Scofield! Infirmary.
- We'll see about that.

348
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:42,282
Mm-hm.

349
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:48,497
I'm gonna find out, you know,
what it is you're doing up there.

350
00:39:58,924 --> 00:40:03,137
<i>- How long does this take?
- They've come a long way with glucose kits.</i>

351
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,431
This'll take us about ten seconds.

352
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:09,435
Slide the strip into the meter
and we're ready to go.

353
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:15,941
I'm sure you know this, but average glucose
for the non-diabetic is about 100mg/dl,

354
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:21,655
so we see a number like that here
and we know you've been misdiagnosed.

355
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:30,372
You seem nervous.

356
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:33,208
- I do?
- You're sweating.

357
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:37,129
Must be the needles.
Never really got used to 'em.

358
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:41,967
Somehow with diabetes and that tattoo
I find that hard to believe.

359
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,094
Ah.

360
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:48,223
Bad news, I'm afraid.

361
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:53,771
180mg/dl. You're definitely diabetic.

362
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:03,197
Do you need anything else from me?

363
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,658
- Arm to stick a needle in.
- OK.

364
00:41:06,742 --> 00:41:09,620
I'll see you Wednesday.

365
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:12,080
<i>- Cute.
- Prisoner.</i>

366
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:17,503
- There's something strange about him.
- What do you mean?

367
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:23,592
I gave him the results of his blood test and
there was this look on his face. It was, um...

368
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:26,220
relief.

369
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:32,184
It's all right. I got it.
I'm headed over to A-wing anyhow.

370
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:40,943
- You're positively beaming, boss.
- Got up on the right side of the bed, I guess.

371
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:43,403
Hold up. Sugar.

372
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,989
Now, don't you move, fishy.

373
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:52,788
<i>- What are you doing?
- You're coming with us, fish.</i>

374
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:08,345
This little polka
you and I have been doing for a while,

375
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:11,306
as of this moment,

376
00:42:12,224 --> 00:42:14,559
it's over.

377
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:21,358
Fibonacci.

378
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:26,071
I wanna know how you got to him
and where he is, right now.

379
00:42:26,154 --> 00:42:28,573
Not gonna happen, John.

380
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:48,510
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

381
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:53,640
- One...
- I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

382
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:56,310
You know it and I know it.

383
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:58,979
Two...

384
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:02,107
I'll tell you the moment
we're outside those walls.

385
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,568
You tell me now.

386
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:11,116
- Not gonna happen, John.
- Hey! I'm gonna give you one last chance.

387
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,462
Three.
