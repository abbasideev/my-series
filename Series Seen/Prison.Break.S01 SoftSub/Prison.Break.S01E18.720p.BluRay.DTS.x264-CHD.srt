00:00:00,963 --> 00:00:02,735
<i>Previously on Prison Break:</i>

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:03,533
What are you doing?

3
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,678
I'm trying to remember those
blueprints, what we lost to the burn.

4
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,027
Without them, we'll never
be able to navigate those pipes

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,330
beneath psych ward.

6
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:15,333
Then I need to know
where you got that burn. Right now.

7
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:17,843
Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary.

8
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:19,937
I put my blood into this...

9
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:21,344
How about you elaborate on that?

10
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:23,316
How about you
stop with all the questions?

11
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,883
You are a glorified bodyguard, that's it.

12
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:29,781
Okay, I got it.

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,489
- Put it down.
- You're not a killer.

14
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:35,893
Get out of the way.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,969
You know, maybe they give you
those things for a reason.

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,268
Yeah. To keep me
in their invisible freaking handcuffs.

17
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,774
Hello, roomie.

18
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,674
You were right about my tattoo.

19
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,110
It is a path...

20
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,682
And I need you to remember
when you saw it, Haywire.

21
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,084
Who are you?

22
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:56,804
Scofield. Michael Scofield.

23
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:59,909
Doesn't ring a bell.

24
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:03,414
We met a while ago in Gen pop. Cell 40.

25
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:07,050
- Gen pop?
- General population.

26
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,888
Officer Bellick assigned you to my cell.

27
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:14,192
I have a tattoo, you drew it.

28
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,438
Haywire, do I look even
vaguely familiar to you?

29
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:33,286
Are you the guy who stole my toothpaste?

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,098
Yes, yes. I stole your toothpaste.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,396
So you do remember.

32
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:41,833
Candy man.

33
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,139
Mr. Patoshik.

34
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:51,380
- Mr. Scofield.
- No, thank you.

35
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:54,283
Medication is mandatory.

36
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:57,950
It's just a mild sedative
prescribed by Dr. Tancredi. Come on.

37
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:01,095
Then I'll talk to her directly.
I'm feeling better.

38
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:03,792
Oh, really? That's great. Now take the pill.

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,891
Take them. They're good.

40
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,068
I'm fine. Thank you.

41
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,508
Carter, could you come here a sec?

44
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,257
- So he's not coming back here?
- Doubt it.

45
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:23,188
They had him in the whack shack.

46
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:26,162
- What about Sucre?
- He's in ad seg. Why?

47
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:29,632
Middle cell, middle tier,
prime piece of real estate.

48
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:33,129
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Maybe.

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,507
We promise to keep it a single
for a couple of months, auction it off.

50
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:39,904
Make it happen.

51
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:47,158
I don't need medication.

52
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:50,696
Swallow it, or it's going in the rear door.

53
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:57,867
All gone?

54
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:02,903
Nice.

55
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,573
You were right, Haywire.

56
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,609
I did steal your toothpaste,

57
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,307
and you drew that tattoo from memory,
and I need you to do it again.

58
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,429
Middle cell,
cool in the summer, warm in the winter.

59
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:45,127
How much you asking?

60
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,332
- How much you got?
- $200.

61
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,404
- We got a deal?
- Deal.

62
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,476
Now get your ass out of here
and I'll put in the transfer.

63
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,049
Hey, man,

64
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:00,987
the toilet's leaking.

65
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:04,760
Look, it's dripping.

66
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:08,163
I'll put in a work order.
It'll be replaced in 24 hours.

67
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,896
You got it, boss.

68
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:17,243
- I heard you was moving some real estate.
- Already been moved.

69
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:20,239
- Ain't that Scofield's cell?
- Not anymore.

70
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:22,585
Close on 40!

71
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:35,931


72
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,044
Is that your daughter?

73
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:09,514
My wife gave me this when she was born.

74
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,996
Outliving your wife is bad enough.

75
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,424
Outliving your daughter...

76
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:23,603
No man should have to endure that.

77
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:28,907
How long does she have?

78
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:32,450
Hospital says a week, maybe two.

79
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:37,353
We got us a problem.

80
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,995
Mojo's moving into Scofield's cell,
and that ain't all.

81
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:45,563
He's bitching about the toilet,
so Geary's putting in a work order.

82
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:47,899
- They move that toilet...
- They find the hole.

83
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:49,667
We are all screwed.

84
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,800
- How much Mojo promise?
- $200.

85
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:55,279
Oh, Gomer, now you see,
you had me scared there for a second.

86
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,857
- I hear you got a cell.
- Not anymore.

87
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:08,126
And if you were smart,
you'd keep quiet about that.

88
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,670
- Hey, look, I'll double what you're getting.
- I'm getting $250.

89
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,637
$500? Ain't a problem.

90
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,902
I ain't talking cigarettes
and extra chow line desserts here.

91
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,140
I'm talking green paper
with dead white guys on it.

92
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,275
I said it ain't a problem.

93
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:40,669
Come on.

94
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:44,106
- Where?
- It's a surprise.

95
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:02,531
- I don't wear a diaper.
- I never said you did.

96
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,510
Then what are you doing?

97
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,809
You got something in your teeth.

98
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:10,348
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Right there.

99
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:13,249
- I don't...
- It's right there in the back.

100
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:16,718
Come on.

101
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,535
- Why are you doing this?
- I am helping you.

102
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,737
Remember what you used to call
those little pills?

103
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:29,775
"Invisible handcuffs."

104
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:32,778
Handcuffs on your mind.

105
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,250
You hate them, remember?

106
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,560
You got a phone call.

107
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,365
- Who is it?
- Your son. It's an emergency.

108
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:56,506
Oh, LJ, what were you thinking, kid?

109
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,376
<i>I don't care
what happens to me anymore, okay?</i>

110
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:01,246
<i>They won. They'll always win.</i>

111
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,249
I just wanted
to take one of them down with me.

112
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,589
Put Veronica back on.

113
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:11,222
Lincoln?

114
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,091
What are the charges?

115
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,561
Attempted murder.

116
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:19,333
<i>He's also being arraigned for the murder
of his mother and his stepfather.</i>

117
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:22,504
<i>- I guess bail is out of the question?
- Exactly.</i>

118
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,341
<i>Anything you can do?</i>

119
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:27,476
Right now, his only shot is
if we can get him tried as a minor.

120
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,019
<i>But he needs to show some remorse.</i>

121
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:32,457
I need to sell to the court
that he was just a scared kid.

122
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,962
But where his head's at right now,
he won't listen to me.

123
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,726
He'll listen to me. I need to see him.

124
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,199
Lincoln, there's no way.

125
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:41,396
He gets tried as an adult,
he may as well sit in my lap in the chair.

126
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:44,705
<i>- You got to do something, Veronica.
- Okay.</i>

127
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,409
Look, I'll petition the DOC,
but it's a million-to-one shot

128
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:50,109
<i>they're gonna let you out to see him.</i>

129
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,017
All right.

130
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,694
Yo, Trumpets.

131
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:03,528
You all gotta round up all outstanding
debts that are due ASAP, all right?

132
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,069
Do it right now?

133
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,605
Like yesterday, all right?

134
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,903
- I'll put it out there.
- Good.

135
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:34,300
Are you insane?

136
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,939
You are done, bodyguard.

137
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:43,354
Lincoln's son, a 16-year-old pothead,

138
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:45,424
managed to track you down
and shoot you.

139
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,359
You are now
a witness in his criminal investigation.

140
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,623
I can still do my job.

141
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:53,168
You are not to make a move on Burrows
under any circumstance.

142
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,931
We make that call.

143
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,972
You know what, trixie?

144
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,743
There are actually higher agendas here.

145
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:04,749
Yes, there are,
and they don't belong to you.

146
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:08,655
Paul Kellerman no longer works
for the Secret Service.

147
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:12,119
You're just good old Owen Kravecki
from now on.

148
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,021
Have I made myself clear?

149
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:20,696
Hey.

150
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:26,506
I need you to focus.
I need you to remember what you drew.

151
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,737
Haywire. Time for group.

152
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:46,263
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

153
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:48,408
There we go.

154
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:51,679
It's a path.

155
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:56,581
Yes. It is a path.

156
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,286
Let's go.

157
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:17,607
So, what's up, man?

158
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:20,516
Here's the thing. You got nothing coming.

159
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,915
All your outstanding markers,
they're mine now.

160
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:25,083
Is that so?

161
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:27,685
You got a problem with it,
go cry to your new crew,

162
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,766
T-Bag and the white boys.

163
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:33,837
Okay, so that's what this is all about.

164
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:36,464
This is about staying true to your own.

165
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,203
Well, you know what, man?

166
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:42,146
I can have tea
with the grand wizard of the KKK if I want,

167
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:44,317
and I still get my money.

168
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:48,220
- You got that, little boy?
- No. We don't got that.

169
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,558
Now, out of respect
for what you once were,

170
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,790
I'm gonna let you walk away.

171
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,914
You were right.

172
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,692
The pills don't let me see the pathway.

173
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,981
That's a pathway to hell.

174
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,076
No, it's not. It's just the opposite.

175
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,706
I remember.

176
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,755
Looks like the Bank of Africa
wasn't allowing any withdrawals.

177
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,024
Look, we are gonna have to find
another way to get that money, okay?

178
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,327
Well, then I reckon
it ain't too much of a problem

179
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:03,836
for our friend here to rummage up,
ain't that so, D.B?

180
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,067
A, I'm not D.B. Cooper,

181
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:09,168
and, B, there's no visitation today.

182
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,479
Which means that none of us can get
any money from the outside world.

183
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,750
I guess that only leaves us
with one real option.

184
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,152
The kitchen game.

185
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:22,190
Gambling? And that's your solution?

186
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:27,604
Son, trust me.
When I play cards, it ain't gambling.

187
00:14:28,472 --> 00:14:32,711
There's maybe five people in this country
that can do what I do with a deck of cards.

188
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:33,007
There's maybe five people in this country
that can do what I do with a deck of cards.

189
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,103
So why are you just bringing this up now?

190
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:36,876
'Cause if Jesus, over there,

191
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:38,953
catches you sleeving aces
in the kitchen game,

192
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:42,387
well, let's just say
there are lots of knives handy.

193
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,653
Of course,
you need 50 bucks just for the sit-in,

194
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:49,222
and since we don't have any money,
I'd say we're in a catch-doubley-deuce.

195
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,337
You sit right here.

196
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:00,245
There you go. Take this.

197
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,749
And this.

198
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:19,501
Oh, no. It's gone.

199
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,500
That's why I need you to fix it.

200
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:24,273
That's why I need you to remember
what was there before.

201
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,043
Oh, this is bad. You can't break a path.

202
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:30,145
- Then it doesn't lead anywhere.
- That's right.

203
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:34,789
That's why I need you to remember
what was there before it was broken.

204
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:39,729
I remember. I remember the demons.

205
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:42,930
Wait, no, maybe they were pilgrims.
They were pointing to the way,

206
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,407
and they were saying,
"This is the way, this is the way."

207
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:48,468
I can't see it.

208
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,048
I can see it, but I can't see it.

209
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,248
I'll be right back.

210
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:58,885
Hey!

211
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,831
I need you to give Sucre a message.

212
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:09,101
Tell him I'm okay,
and that I'm trying to fill in the blanks.

213
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,733
He'll know what that means.

214
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,679
- You're trying to fill in the blanks?
- Just do it. Please.

215
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,864
<i>What the hell am I gonna do now?</i>

216
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,174
You've been down in 13
as long as I can remember.

217
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,945
Why the sudden interest in moving?

218
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:45,955
Second-story units like this
don't come on the market too much.

219
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:50,888
I figure since I'm getting on in age,
maybe it's time I retired in comfort.

220
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:52,863
Open on 40!

221
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,161
Make it quick.

222
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:15,792
Hey, Bob Vila, it's a cell.

223
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,100
Quit kicking the tires and make a decision.

224
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:21,364
I'll give you 100 bucks for it.

225
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:24,271
You wasted my time.
Get the hell out of here.

226
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,174
Sorry, boss. I thought it was a good bid.

227
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,447
Close on 40!

228
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:48,165
Hello, Benjamin.

229
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,906
Now, let me see,

230
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,709
minted in 19 and 72.

231
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,045
That's your buy-in.

232
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:58,318
The rest is up to you.

233
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,950
Hot damn.

234
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:12,770
- Keep walking, peckerwood.
- Got the buy-in for the card game.

235
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,574
Go get our money, boy.

236
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,478
Unfortunately, you and I are gonna
have to be partners in this endeavor.

237
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:22,041
Oh, hell, no.
I don't play cards, I'm a dice man.

238
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,519
Look, all you need to know is this,

239
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:27,081
every time I deal,
you bet big and never fold.

240
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:31,432
See, if I'm winning every time I deal,
I end up with a Colombian necktie.

241
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,160
You know what I'm saying?

242
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:35,430
But if you're the one raking in all the cash,

243
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:39,943
well, I seriously doubt anyone would
ever think you and I are working together.

244
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:45,182
It's all right, baby, yeah.

245
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:49,482
Excuse me.

246
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:53,119
I've been all over town.
I can't find a charger for this.

247
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:55,623
- Well, let me check.
- Thanks.

248
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:10,682
How you doing, Savrinn?

249
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:14,320
- Where's your girl?
- She's doing her job, all right?

250
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:19,022
Filing a petition down at the courts.
She'll be at my place in about an hour.

251
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,861
See, that was easy.

252
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:26,000
I shouldn't have to chase you down
to get that information.

253
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,870
Why don't you just take a step back?

254
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:32,175
And why don't you remember
who you're talking to, who I work for?

255
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,387
You need to keep
an eye on Veronica Donovan.

256
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,082
Not some of the time, all of the time.

257
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:43,822
'Cause pretty soon,
we're gonna call in our favor,

258
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,627
unless you want to go back on our deal.

259
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:49,998
- No.
- Good.

260
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,275
Be in touch.

261
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:04,952
Haywire.

262
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:11,830
Haywire, did you take your meds?

263
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:16,671
Well, come on.
You got something in your teeth again.

264
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:26,654
You should be careful when you tell people
to remember things, Michael.

265
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:29,423
Because I remember everything now.

266
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,122
I remember how you set me up!

267
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:35,623
How you smashed your own head

268
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,836
and had me sent back here.

269
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,369
I also remember this.

270
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:48,883
The pathway.

271
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,115
Your map.

272
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:53,549
Your escape.

273
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:54,818
Give me that.

274
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,188
Don't. Don't.

275
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:01,334
Now, do I tear this up

276
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,708
or do you tell me exactly where
and when you're doing this?

277
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,902
- It starts in the basement.
- Okay.

278
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:24,442
This line leads
from the hatch in the coal room,

279
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:28,242
to this pipe system here,
and that runs to the infirmary.

280
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,381
That's how we'll get out.

281
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:32,784
I just need to get out of psych ward
to set things up.

282
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:36,792
But three days after I'm gone,
I'll come back up through the basement

283
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:38,294
and get you out.

284
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:39,920
You're just telling me what I want to hear.

285
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,465
No, I'm not.

286
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,432
I need you to let me get us out of here.

287
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,507
I need you to trust me.

288
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:02,586
If you try to screw me over again
I'll kill you.

289
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:14,500
- Hey.
- Hi.

290
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:17,476
- How did it go?
- Filing the petition was easy,

291
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:20,575
getting it approved,
that's a whole 'nother story.

292
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,756
- You found the charger?
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:33,499
- Why didn't you plug it in?
- I was just... Just thinking for a minute.

294
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,970
- About what?
- Nothing.

295
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:42,346
We're in business.

296
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:43,677
What is it?

297
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:47,119
His entire phone book is still in here,
322 numbers.

298
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,099
No open seats. Gotta wait.

299
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:29,377
- C-Note, crap or get off the pot.
- I'm thinking.

300
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:32,477
We ain't betting on CPT here, man.

301
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,846
Either you gonna see his bet

302
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:36,012
or you can go outside
and Million Con March

303
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:37,646
or whatever your people do.

304
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:40,090
Either way, get on with it, son.

305
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,826
I'm in.

306
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:50,936
Three bitches, bitches.

307
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,637
What you holding?

308
00:23:58,284 --> 00:23:59,684
You tell me.

309
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:03,720
- Full house.
- A full house?

310
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:07,991
That's a concept a Mexican should be
quite familiar with, eh, Jesus?

311
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:14,698
She said what?

312
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:18,471
She said, in unequivocal terms,
that I was not to move on Burrows.

313
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:22,676
Whatever their agenda is with Burrows,
it is not the same as ours.

314
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,451
This whole business with his father,

315
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:27,786
it interferes with the one thing
that we set out to do in the first place.

316
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:30,086
Put Lincoln Burrows in the ground.

317
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,827
If he lives,

318
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:34,723
you're the one that stands to lose,
not the Company.

319
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,564
They get themselves another candidate,

320
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,900
and you're the one
that suffers the brunt of it.

321
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:41,999
Then maybe it's time we broke ranks.

322
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:45,340
We do that,
they pull support for the campaign.

323
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,609
You know that, don't you?

324
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:51,018
That is, if they know, Paul.

325
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,121
Smell that kitty.

326
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:01,127
Jacks or better, Trips to win.

327
00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:07,975
Last hand.

328
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:11,076
I'm tired of losing all my money today.

329
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:16,318
- How much you up?
- I don't know. $300.

330
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:18,891
- Does it hurt?
- What?

331
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:20,689
The horseshoe up your ass.

332
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:23,390
Rather be lucky than good, ping-pong.

333
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,272
Misdeal. Bury the card.

334
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:37,175
- Man, I don't care if you all saw my card.
- Yeah, I bet you don't.

335
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:40,851
- Bury the card, young blood.
- Hey, chill, wrinkles.

336
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,489
Ain't my fault saltine here
got a sloppy deal.

337
00:25:43,593 --> 00:25:45,289
That there was just uncalled for.

338
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:47,091
Now, all right. You know what?
I'll tell you what.

339
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:50,599
I'm gonna deal another hand,
you gonna be such a baby about it.

340
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:56,909
On a misdeal, you bury the card,
finish out the hand.

341
00:25:58,046 --> 00:25:59,446
House rules.

342
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:37,388
- Warden.
- I have some good news for you, Linc.

343
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,969
Somehow, your lawyer's
petition went through.

344
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:44,406
The Department of Corrections
is allowing you a one-hour visit

345
00:26:44,508 --> 00:26:45,999
with your son.

346
00:26:48,146 --> 00:26:51,345
I've never seen
one of these granted before, ever.

347
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,422
- Good lawyers.
- No lawyer's that good.

348
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:57,919
I'll make the travel arrangements,

349
00:26:58,027 --> 00:26:59,654
but this is not going to be
a ride in the country.

350
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:02,129
You're gonna be y-cuffed,
and the men are gonna be heavily armed.

351
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:06,568
- I don't want any problems.
- There won't be, I just want to see my son.

352
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:25,992
I'll bet all I got.

353
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:31,428
$82.

354
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,143
You better have some aces
shoved up there with that horseshoe,

355
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:37,974
or that pot's mine.

356
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:43,310
You in or out?

357
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,187
I'm in.

358
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:18,496
And I raise you $74.

359
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:24,433
- I said I only got $82 left.
- Well, then I guess you're out of luck.

360
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:28,640
- You never heard of a gentleman's game?
- Yes, I have, but this ain't it.

361
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,776
You want to borrow some money?
Ask your boys.

362
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,879
But I'm in here to make money, bro.

363
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:38,120
You want welfare,
you'd better vote Democrat.

364
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:57,516
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay away from me in the yard.

365
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,541
You think you're smarter than me?

366
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:39,905
No, no, no!

367
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,813
Okay, there's a pathway.
No, there's a pathway! There's a pathway!

368
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,944
Look, he's trying to escape!
He's trying to escape. This is his map!

369
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:49,683
- Haywire, I need you to come back!
- He set me up!

370
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,055
- Zap him!
- No! No!

371
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:08,580
There he is.

372
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:17,350
Hey, boss.
I think you dropped something, man.

373
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:20,923
That's half a G-note.

374
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:23,059
- So when do I move in?
- You don't.

375
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:24,228
What?

376
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:29,541
- Oh, come on, chief, now, we had a deal.
- Renegotiation, the price is $700 now.

377
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,279
That ain't right. I just gave you $500.

378
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:37,718
What you gave me was a down payment.
If you can't come up with the rest, well...

379
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:40,257
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.

380
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:42,225
One minute, all right?

381
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,201
Oh, man, he's trying to shake us down.

382
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:50,772
- I'm gonna need that watch.
- Not an option.

383
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:54,640
Look, would you rather be
looking at a picture of your daughter

384
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:57,909
or holding her in your arms
once you get outside?

385
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,840
Hey, look, man,
Father Time owed me a few bones.

386
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,851
He gave me this in trade.

387
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:27,582
That should be
more than enough to cover it.

388
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,952
Not bad.

389
00:31:29,358 --> 00:31:32,192
Your problem is somebody
already gave me $700 for the cell,

390
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:34,059
so, you're S.O.L.

391
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:36,700
No! No! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

392
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:38,600
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Look.

393
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:40,332
So you're just gonna
take my money and walk?

394
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,035
Yeah, well, write to your congressman.

395
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:49,884
Oh, come on!

396
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:03,634
- Hey.
- Hi.

397
00:32:03,744 --> 00:32:07,147
- They said you wanted to talk to me.
- Yeah, yeah.

398
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,842
Okay.

399
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:10,711
Good.

400
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,423
Please.

401
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:18,524
Thanks.

402
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:22,765
I made you something.

403
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:30,905
It's an ashtray.

404
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:33,112
- I don't smoke.
- Yeah, I know.

405
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:36,552
But they only
let us make these and jewelry,

406
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:39,185
and I didn't figure you
for the macaroni necklace type.

407
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,920
It's very sweet.

408
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,661
How about we talk
about how you're doing?

409
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:50,803
I think we both know I don't belong here.

410
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:55,107
I don't remember much about that night,
but being locked up in ad seg,

411
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,239
something must've snapped.

412
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,653
What I'm trying to say is,
I think I've had enough of arts and crafts.

413
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,058
But that's your call.

414
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:08,825
And the doctors here
do say that you've been acting fine.

415
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:11,299
The problem is that
if you don't tell the Pope who burned you,

416
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:13,667
he's gonna lock you back up in ad seg.

417
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:17,732
And after a couple days of that,
you're gonna be right back here.

418
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,577
Michael, I hate what happened to you,
and I hate that you're here.

419
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:28,180
But you have got to let me help you.

420
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:33,298
If you want to get out of psych ward,
and stay out,

421
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:36,836
you've got to tell the Pope
the truth about that burn.

422
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,171
Out with the old, in with the new, cons.

423
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,459
I got a message from your cellie, bro.

424
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,655
He says he's okay
and he's trying to fill in the blanks.

425
00:33:57,764 --> 00:34:00,962
Did he say he's trying,
or that he already got the blanks filled in?

426
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:03,231
Yo, man, I don't know.
I didn't write it down.

427
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:06,366
Okay. Now you gotta tell him
that I filled in the hole.

428
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:10,140
Yeah, yeah, I'm done
with your little secrets and messages, bro.

429
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,046
I saw Scofield's back.

430
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:15,519
He's got a burn in the same spot
as the burn in that guard's shirt.

431
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:19,060
I don't know what you're doing
but I have an idea, huh?

432
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:23,228
And I'm through helping you
until you tell me what's going on.

433
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,823
I can't, bro.

434
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,268
<i>- Then good luck in the hole, jefe.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait.</i>

435
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:29,567
Manche.

436
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:33,368
- Who's that?
- That's Linc, bro.

437
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,345
- Linc the Sink?
- Yeah.

438
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,746
Come here.

439
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,670
I think we can work something out.

440
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:56,137
All I can say is, before I get out of here,
Geary will pay. Believe that.

441
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:57,942
No one's getting out of here

442
00:34:58,046 --> 00:35:01,312
if maintenance goes to
replacing Scofield's toilet.

443
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:04,178
I got a way to help you
with your Scofield problem.

444
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:08,123
- What'd you say, slim?
- I said I got a way to help you with...

445
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:12,594
- Who the hell said we had a problem?
- It's cool, man. Relax.

446
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:14,793
Lincoln and Sucre told me everything.

447
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:18,031
What in the hell did they tell you?
Exactly, what did they tell you?

448
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:22,601
Everything. They said I can come with you,
you know, on early parole,

449
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:25,478
if I can help get the Fish out of psych.

450
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:29,910
What are we, the A train?
Everyone gets to ride with us?

451
00:35:31,424 --> 00:35:34,758
Why don't you take a walk,
before I give you a smack?

452
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:39,699
You got another solution to our situation?

453
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:44,167
I didn't think so.

454
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,680
Me and my cuz and Lincoln

455
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:53,982
came up with something.

456
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:56,751
Now, it can work, but it's risky.

457
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,416
You ready to get out of
this aquarium, Fish?

458
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,530
Assure me I'll be protected.

459
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,437
Michael, you know me
well enough by now.

460
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,945
Such assurances are not necessary.

461
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:31,343
With all due respect, Warden,
if I had been protected in the first place,

462
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:33,819
none of this would have happened.

463
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:46,028
- A name.
- Geary.

464
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:48,333
Geary?

465
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:52,437
He shakes cons down for money,
anything he can get his hands on.

466
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:55,377
He knew I went to college, so he must've...

467
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:57,681
He must've thought
I was rich or something.

468
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:01,020
Anyway, when I couldn't pay up,

469
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:05,530
he held me down with one arm,
and burned me with the other.

470
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:11,262
I don't know what he used,

471
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:14,676
but it was hot as hell.

472
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:22,515
What a surprise. Disconnected.

473
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:27,125
Two-hundred and fifty businesses,
72 residences, covering all 50 states.

474
00:38:27,228 --> 00:38:31,131
- London, Martinique, Jakarta, Dakar.
- All the numbers out of service.

475
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,462
As soon as Quinn disappeared,

476
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:34,593
they must've
erased the paper trail within days.

477
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:37,003
Is there anything they can't do?

478
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,845
My P.I. Buddy in DC.
What if I send him all this,

479
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,746
see if he can make
a connection between the numbers?

480
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:46,911
I'll tell him I need it ASAP.

481
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:49,183
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's no big deal.

482
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:52,056
I'll just overnight him all this stuff.

483
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,526
No. For everything.

484
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,630
For hanging in there, keeping me going.

485
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,969
- Thank you.
- Sure.

486
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:06,814
Guy with a six ERA,
signs for four mil a year.

487
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:09,146
Sucks at his job, he still gets a raise.

488
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:12,085
You suck at your job.
You should ask the Pope for a raise.

489
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:13,553
Very funny.

490
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,493
Warden, what brings you
to our little clubhouse?

491
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,632
Hey, what gives?

492
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,970
Hey, that was a gift from my old man.

493
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:55,206
Since when is your name Charles
and your dad's name Ann?

494
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:33,258
This is a railroad. I didn't do nothing!

495
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:37,561
Don't look at me like I'm some con.
You're as crooked as scoliosis.

496
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,469
I don't get caught.

497
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:16,480
When we get there,

498
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:19,252
I'll take you out of the y-cuffs
and put you in a four-piece.

499
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,624
- Got it?
- Got it, boss.

500
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,224
You play nice, I play nice.

501
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:27,062
- Understand?
- Got it.

502
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:53,928
She's here. I've got her.

503
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,244
<i>Scofield for re-admission
to Gen pop.</i>

504
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,556
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

505
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:15,532
Never thought
I'd be so glad to be back in my cell.

506
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:23,969
Pope wanted me to give you this.

507
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:02,987
- What the hell are you staring at, anyway?
- Everything.
