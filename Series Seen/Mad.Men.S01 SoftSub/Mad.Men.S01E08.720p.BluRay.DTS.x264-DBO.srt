1
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,775
Hold the doors, please!

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,283
Thank you. Good morning.

3
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,977
Good morning.

4
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,747
Draper has you in early, huh?

5
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,823
- What's he up to?
- I don't know.

6
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,620
I kind of came in for myself.

7
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:01,988
Okay.

8
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:03,459
Honestly, I couldn't sleep.

9
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,463
I'm just filled with nerves.

10
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,260
The service elevator is out.

11
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:08,560
Do you mind?

12
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,865
I'm moving today.

13
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:22,004
I'm supposed to go by at lunch
and supervise the movers.

14
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:25,083
Probably lose the rest of the day
watching other people work.

15
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,652
Well, that is a big day.

16
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:29,584
What do you have
to be nervous about?

17
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,917
Nothing.

18
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:34,754
Just I think Mr. Rumsen is presenting
my copy today to the Belle Jolie people.

19
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,795
A thing like that.

20
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,961
We really took the local, didn't we?

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,833
It's 7 in the morning.

22
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:48,133
I'm very sorry, sir.

23
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,708
Here we are.

24
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,988
I'm going to hop down for a coffee.

25
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,150
- Would you like some?
- No.

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,727
Are you sure?

27
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,456
Come in here, please.

28
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,366
Close the door.

29
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,840
There's no one here.

30
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,411
Close the door.

31
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:43,195
Peggy... do you know how hard it is

32
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,060
to see you walking
around here every day?

33
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,303
Your skirt. It's tight.

34
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,840
Just pull it up.

35
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,012
Be careful.

36
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,669
Listen,

37
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,640
maybe this isn't
the right time to mention this,

38
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,178
but I want to clear the air.

39
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:10,373
I know I told you I would read
the copy that you wrote,

40
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,543
but... I haven't.

41
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,714
I'm glad.

42
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:19,347
I thought you just didn't like it.

43
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,922
That's too bad.

44
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,227
Peggy.

45
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,766
I know what you're going to say.

46
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,736
No.

47
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,500
You don't.

48
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,769
You haven't been right once.

49
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,381
I have all these things going on
in my head, and I can't say them.

50
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,218
Do you think about me?

51
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,758
I'll be honest.

52
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,927
A few times.

53
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,629
You're only 20 yards away.

54
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,467
Not right now.

55
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,512
I wake up in the morning
and I look into Trudy's eyes,

56
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:18,982
and I think, "We're supposed
to be one person. "

57
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,948
But whatever I try...

58
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:27,787
I have all these things
going on in my head.

59
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,997
She's just another stranger.

60
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,305
Pete.

61
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,938
You're not alone in this.

62
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,586
I'm sorry I ripped your blouse.

63
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,183
It's okay.

64
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,341
Morning. Sterling Cooper. Please hold.

65
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,343
Look who's off the clock again.

66
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,685
He's speaking Italian to his mother.

67
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,387
<i>Ciao, ciao.</i>

68
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:39,964
My stars.

69
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,727
Two weeks in, and she's already a goner.

70
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,803
He talks to his mother a lot.

71
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,337
Mr. Crane? I'll connect you.

72
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,531
Because he's not married.

73
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,903
Well, he's in the Art Department?

74
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,374
What does he look like?

75
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,638
<i>Did you see that movie Marty
with Ernest Borgnine?</i>

76
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,008
He lived with his mother.

77
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,479
Stop teasing her.

78
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,981
Yes, right away.

79
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,675
My guess is tall, dark, and handsome,

80
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,253
but I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.

81
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,649
She is so thoughtful.

82
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,315
- Let me get my purse.
- Forget it.

83
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,451
Mrs. Sterling will be calling
before lunchtime today.

84
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,859
Please put her through directly to me.

85
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,124
- Done.
- Ask her. She'll know.

86
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,897
Salvatore Romano in the Art Department.

87
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,060
Do you know him?

88
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,571
Handsome. Very debonair.

89
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,608
Cologne, but not the cheap stuff.

90
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,267
Something European, maybe.

91
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,810
You're so specific.

92
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:30,075
You have voices. I have other things.

93
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,241
Thank you so much for holding.

94
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,713
Good morning.

95
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,083
Good morning.

96
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,657
Mr. Cooper wanted
to see you in his office.

97
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,282
Tell Mr. Sterling I'll be right there.

98
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:43,020
No, it's just Mr. Cooper.

99
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,492
Thank you, Peggy.

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,862
What happened there?

101
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,833
I caught it on something.

102
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,904
I might start keeping a spare.

103
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,851
Come on in.

104
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,088
I'd prefer you didn't
smoke in here right now.

105
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,101
Don, I am appreciative of your talents,

106
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,103
and although that cannot be measured,

107
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:30,164
I have made an effort to quantify.

108
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,713
$2,500.

109
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,015
L...

110
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,751
Thank you. That's what you say.

111
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,555
Have you read her?

112
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,894
Rand.

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,901
<i>Atlas Shrugged.</i>

114
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,130
That's the one.

115
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,469
Yes. Yes, it is.

116
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,543
See, I know you haven't read it.

117
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:06,770
When you hit 40,

118
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,875
you realize you've met or seen
every kind of person there is,

119
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,545
and I know what kind you are.

120
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:21,316
Because I believe we are alike.

121
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,827
I assume that's flattering.

122
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:27,695
By that I mean you are a productive
and reasonable man,

123
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,793
and in the end completely self-interested.

124
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,633
It's strength.

125
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,570
We are different...

126
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,074
unsentimental about all the people

127
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,874
who depend on our hard work.

128
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:49,752
Take $1.99 out of that $2,500
and buy yourself a copy.

129
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,356
I will.

130
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,434
Well, hello, there.

131
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,370
Hello.

132
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you Traffic, or are you here for casting?

133
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,635
I'm... I'm not a model.

134
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,713
I'm new.

135
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:15,871
Excuse me, Marty,

136
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:18,347
who's doing the Firestone comps,
you or Frank?

137
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,918
Neither of us. Sal.
We were talking to Miss...

138
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,250
Lois. Lois Sadler.

139
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:25,414
I'm new here. Switchboard.

140
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,889
Marty Faraday.

141
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,220
Why would they hide you?

142
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,024
Hi, Lois. Duane Davis.

143
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,065
Salvatore Romano.

144
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,758
Sorry about the mess.

145
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,062
Oh, no, it's divine.

146
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,636
I work in a closet all day,

147
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,898
so just to come out
and walk around is wonderful.

148
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,304
Is there anything I can do for you?

149
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,206
I'm such a featherhead.

150
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,143
I need to get my paperwork
in to Accounting,

151
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,112
then find my way back
to the switchboard room.

152
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:51,682
Am I close?

153
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,981
No. You're not even on the right floor.

154
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,247
I'll walk you there.

155
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,845
No. Just point me there. I'm fine.

156
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,287
Go upstairs,

157
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,858
make a left outside of the stairwell,

158
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,154
follow the wall past the ladies' room.

159
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,794
Well, nice to meet you.

160
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,232
<i>Ciao, ciao.</i>

161
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,342
That ate up some time.

162
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,071
I like when they flirt with me.

163
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,044
She was flirting with him.

164
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:25,742
You know, I had the salesman
pushing this tie on me for 20 minutes.

165
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,082
I'd have bought it right away
if I knew it worked.

166
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,656
It's not the ties.
They always talk to you.

167
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,486
They can tell you make money.

168
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:38,461
I told you, you don't need money
to dress better than you do, Duane.

169
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,929
<i>Mr. Campbell, I have your wife.</i>

170
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,599
What line?

171
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,005
Light up a line, will you?

172
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,578
<i>No, she's right here, in person.</i>

173
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,979
Send her in.

174
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,218
Hello, my love.

175
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,221
Hello, homeowner.

176
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,483
What are you doing here, lovely?

177
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,491
I thought I'd come get you
and we could go together.

178
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,753
We could even walk.

179
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,089
It's 30 blocks.

180
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:11,992
It's beautiful outside.

181
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,668
I have a, uh, busier day than I thought.

182
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,200
Well, then let's do this here.

183
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,746
I said I'd meet you there
if my schedule allowed,

184
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:32,476
and now it doesn't look so good.

185
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,916
No, you didn't, and I'm here now.

186
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,918
What does it matter?

187
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,750
This is my office.

188
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,751
How do you think it looks?

189
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,387
Like you are beloved by your wife.

190
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,693
You see what happens
when you just show up like this?

191
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,395
We fight.

192
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:55,700
I came here to celebrate
us having our apartment,

193
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,674
which I for one am happy about.

194
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,369
And you have ruined it.

195
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,777
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:06,442
I'm just busier than I thought.

197
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,850
Let's have a glass of champagne.

198
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,285
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,793
We're going to live there a long time.

200
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:19,830
There's no point in being superstitious.

201
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,169
<i>It's as simple as E pluribus unum:</i>

202
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,964
"From many, one. "

203
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:30,201
From many shades of lipstick,
one that belongs to her.

204
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,877
From a basket of kisses,
she picks one.

205
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,210
It makes her unique. It colors her kiss.

206
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,945
And her kiss, well, it colors her man.

207
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,547
"Belle Jolie Lipstick. Mark Your Man. "

208
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:48,057
I only see one lipstick in your drawing.

209
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,859
Women want colors,
lots and lots of colors.

210
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,592
"Mark Your Man. "

211
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,928
It's pretty cute.

212
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,831
Oh, you like this?

213
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:01,702
Well, maybe we should cut
down to five shades or one.

214
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,299
I'm not telling you to listen to anyone,
but this is a very fresh approach.

215
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,604
It's okay, Kenny.

216
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,705
I don't think there's much else
to do here but call it a day.

217
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,408
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

218
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,576
Is that all?

219
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:17,849
You're a nonbeliever.

220
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,117
Why should we waste time on Kabuki?

221
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,693
I don't know what that means.

222
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,625
It means that you've
already tried your plan,

223
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,789
and you're number 4.

224
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,661
You've enlisted my expertise,

225
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,201
and you've rejected it to go on
the way you've been going.

226
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,170
I'm not interested in that.
You can understand.

227
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,504
I don't think your three months
or however many thousands of dollars

228
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,908
entitles you to refocus
the core of our business.

229
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,243
Listen, I'm not here to tell you about Jesus.

230
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:44,576
You already know about Jesus.

231
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,618
Either He lives in your heart
or He doesn't.

232
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,519
Every woman wants choices,

233
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:55,787
but in the end, none wants to be one
of a hundred in a box.

234
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,452
She's unique.

235
00:14:57,562 --> 00:15:00,998
She makes the choices,
and she's chosen him.

236
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:04,159
She wants to tell the world, "He's mine.

237
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,066
He belongs to me, not you. "

238
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,698
She marks her man with her lips.

239
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,332
He is her possession.

240
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,310
You've given every girl
that wears your lipstick

241
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,143
the gift of total ownership.

242
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,649
Sit down.

243
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:27,224
No.

244
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,726
Not until I know I'm not wasting my time.

245
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,262
Sit down.

246
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,860
Do you know how to get
back to the Roosevelt?

247
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:40,904
We could have someone walk you over,
or just meet you, if you're interested.

248
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,735
You're a troublemaker.

249
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,002
Although, it is a place to get into trouble.

250
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,805
They just did this incredible renovation.

251
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,574
It reminds me a little of a steamship.

252
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:50,841
And the people...

253
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,348
I was in the lounge last night,

254
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,851
and I end up having a drink
with Robert Mitchum.

255
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,579
Actually, many drinks.

256
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,680
Now, you know we wouldn't
steer you wrong.

257
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,719
Nice work.
I think you may be right about this.

258
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,592
Well, we'll never know, will we?

259
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,062
What?

260
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,427
It's not a science, Hugh.

261
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:09,898
We'll do our best.

262
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,663
That Jesus thing.

263
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,935
I don't know what to say.

264
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,035
Probably better than dangling him
out the window by his ankles.

265
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,704
That's just a story.

266
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,338
Don's never actually done that.

267
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,280
Ken, you will realize in your private life

268
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,219
that at a certain point seduction is over
and force is actually being requested.

269
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,414
Ah, he's a kid.

270
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,320
He thinks it's the other way around.

271
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,537
<i>Peggy, icel We'll need some.</i>

272
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,543
Should I just put it down?

273
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:00,612
How much ice?

274
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,277
How do you take it?

275
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,921
Home run, ballerina.

276
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,982
Go ahead, before
Joan Holloway sees.

277
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,665
You call that celebrating?

278
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,173
The meeting was so long, I was worried.

279
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,334
We barely finished the presentation,
and he bought it.

280
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,469
No, he's being modest.

281
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,376
Donald walked around
the village three times

282
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,073
and then set it on fire.

283
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,913
Oh, my God. Can I see it?

284
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,617
It's marvelous.

285
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:40,884
I thought it was going to say

286
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,789
"It's the mark
you make on your man. "

287
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,691
Was it, now?

288
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,559
You may be a writer, honey.

289
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,825
Really?

290
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,662
You're arrogant.

291
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,668
You want another drink?

292
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,965
I don't know.

293
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,334
- Not a writer.
- Not a writer.

294
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,935
Can I keep it?

295
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,205
No.

296
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,884
What are you doing?

297
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,649
Don't ever put your name on a list.

298
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,690
They keep track of everything we do here.

299
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,726
Have you never heard
of Joseph McCarthy?

300
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:17,488
It's the bowling team.

301
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,325
Oh, my God. It happened.

302
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,898
- They loved it.
- What are you talking about?

303
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,466
I'm heading out. Don't look for me.

304
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,228
I have errands to run.

305
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,201
My Belle Jolie copy. They loved it.

306
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,236
Congratulations!

307
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,328
That's so fascinating!

308
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,772
I'm glad your other work
was suffering for a reason.

309
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,207
They poured me a drink.

310
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,902
- Who?
- Mr. Draper.

311
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,207
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Romano, and...

312
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:37,440
Oh, I'm so jealous.

313
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,608
Don't be. I was just...
I shouldn't be bragging.

314
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,117
They sold Peggy's copy.

315
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,277
My word.

316
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,581
Actually, they changed it a little bit,

317
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:44,620
but it worked.

318
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,452
- Oh, we're celebrating.
- How about it?

319
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,049
Five minutes to 5,
we head to P.J. Clarke's.

320
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,320
Perfect!

321
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:02,436
It's going to be a hell of an afternoon
traffic meeting.

322
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,872
Oh, champagne.

323
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,272
When did that happen?

324
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,504
Another grateful client stopped by.

325
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:08,579
I thought you were moving today.

326
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,080
I was looking forward to seeing you
in a pair of coveralls.

327
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,412
Yes, well, I managed to explain
to the concerned party

328
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,213
that I already have a job.

329
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,515
Do they ever stop asking for things?

330
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,093
Hello.

331
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:25,355
Hello.

332
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:28,159
Hildy, um, she must have
gone to lunch already.

333
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,665
Congratulations.

334
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,259
Yes. I hear you're quite the little scribe.

335
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,496
You can trust Ken's opinion here.

336
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,765
He's a published author, you know.

337
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,238
But he can't write copy.

338
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,832
I don't like to limit my words that much.

339
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,639
I also hate puns.

340
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:41,803
Come on.

341
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,110
"Admiral: The television
that won't go down the tubes. "

342
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,318
Shut up.

343
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:50,384
So you going to celebrate?

344
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:51,512
Well, yes, actually.

345
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,286
A bunch of us... just the girls so far...
are going to P. J. Clarke's tonight.

346
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,623
Forget tonight. I heard Cooper, Sterling,
and Draper already left.

347
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,627
Am I wrong?

348
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,459
What about Mr. Rumsen?

349
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,556
Freddie Rumsen's at P.J.'s right now,

350
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,861
and he doesn't know there's a party.

351
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,529
3:00, after the traffic meeting.

352
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,764
Joan's a tattletale.

353
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:10,472
I don't know, Peggy.

354
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,510
I'm kind of senior ranking
when those other men are gone.

355
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,445
Speaker of the House.
He'll be there.

356
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:22,780
I should probably go home, actually.

357
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,946
Well, if we're starting at 3,
you can go home at 5.

358
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,819
It'll still be after work.

359
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,017
We all work so hard,

360
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,423
I think we all need it.

361
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,489
Why not?

362
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,026
Toodle-oo.

363
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,206
Hello.

364
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,911
Mr. Romano, I was headed out to lunch,

365
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,817
but I have a phone call for you.

366
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,048
Well, I'm glad I stayed in.

367
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,388
Oh, it's disconnected.

368
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,629
<i>Everybody's talking about the meeting.</i>

369
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,998
Miss Olsen said your artwork
was spectacular.

370
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,593
She did, did she?

371
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,899
<i>Anyway, a bunch of us</i>

372
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,303
are taking her out to drinks.

373
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,466
P.J. Clarke's?

374
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,566
<i>She deserves it.</i>

375
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,805
You have to come.

376
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,177
This is Lois Sadler, by the way.

377
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,909
I know that.

378
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:28,918
<i>I'll be there.</i>

379
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,817
Good.

380
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:44,757
Can I help you?

381
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,137
Can I help you, sir?

382
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,108
It's Don. The ad man.

383
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,610
He's okay.

384
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,874
Excuse me, fellas.

385
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:06,450
Oh, just because I can't call you
doesn't mean you can't call me.

386
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,616
Hello.

387
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,901
Pack a bag. We're going to Paris.

388
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:19,162
- What?
- Paris.

389
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,237
Now?

390
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,106
Where'd you get that?

391
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,178
It's a bonus.

392
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm not sure what for.

393
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,511
I bet.

394
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,549
What do you say?

395
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,743
I called Idyllwild.

396
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,151
We can have breakfast at Versailles.

397
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,887
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,426
I have a special night planned.

399
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,492
I thought you didn't make plans.

400
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,999
Is he joining us?

401
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:51,966
Yes. He has to.

402
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,197
He looks kind of square.

403
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:57,832
Kibby just came four days straight
from Juarez.

404
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,569
May I?

405
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,872
I've been thinking about this
since Port Authority.

406
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,615
Stay. You'll love it.

407
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,051
We're going to get high and listen to Miles.

408
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,214
That's your plan?

409
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:15,690
We can do this first and then do that.

410
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,921
It'll be a lot more fun.

411
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,965
Sit down. Relax.

412
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,966
Next to me, Icky.

413
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,029
Where did you find him?

414
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:31,233
You know you need to leave the Village
for a decent screw.

415
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,171
I'll take care of him.

416
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:48,648
Do you like it?

417
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,064
I feel like Dorothy.

418
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:00,364
Everything just turned to color.

419
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,666
The words.

420
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,868
You are good with the words, man.

421
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,036
Well put.

422
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:15,882
Kibby, why don't you make yourself useful
and get me a glass of water?

423
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,928
My word, I need to get one of those.

424
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,690
No, thanks.

425
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,836
Okay.

426
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,338
Maybe.

427
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:42,001
We realize there's no music playing.

428
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,102
Just the...

429
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,179
Good afternoon, ma'am.

430
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,657
I'm embarrassed to ask,
seeing as we all have it hard right now,

431
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,320
but is there any way
I can trouble you for a meal?

432
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm willing to work for it.

433
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,126
Look around you.

434
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,790
We're not Christians here no more.

435
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,233
That is not true.

436
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,134
Fine, fine.

437
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,831
Work will feed your soul,

438
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,102
but there's no work left here today.

439
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,904
Come back tomorrow?

440
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,947
Nonsense.

441
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,951
You'll stay with us and eat with us,

442
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,487
and work tomorrow.

443
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,385
I will have to boil those clothes, though,

444
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,253
if you're going to sit at my table.

445
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,348
I'm not offended.

446
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,054
It would be a relief to me as well.

447
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:09,998
Dick Whitman, stop digging holes.

448
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,365
Build a fire under the cauldron.

449
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,801
Hiya, kid.

450
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,039
What did I say to you?

451
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,044
Reminds me of myself.

452
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:25,377
That doesn't surprise me at all.

453
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,780
So we thank You, Lord,

454
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,717
for this bounty we are about to receive

455
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,086
that we may share it with those in need.

456
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,419
Amen.

457
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,428
Thank you again.
Thank you so much.

458
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:41,691
This smells delicious.

459
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,858
Where are those manners from?

460
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:47,028
Let him eat and be on with it.

461
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,571
I'm from just east.

462
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,801
About New York, originally,
some other places.

463
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,002
Ah. New York.

464
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,876
It's how you took to being
on the bum so easy.

465
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:59,006
Archie, no one takes to charity easy.

466
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:03,845
I'm just saying I bet he don't know
which end of a weed to pull.

467
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,423
That's the truth, sir.
I only know some farm work,

468
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,788
but I've seen mills and docks and factories.

469
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,417
I've been a worker.

470
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,189
Are you a communist?

471
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:13,627
No.

472
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:17,030
Yeah, I imagine they're different, all right.

473
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,695
They take a club to the jaw
like anyone else.

474
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,932
They are souls,
but they can't be saved.

475
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,732
That's true.

476
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:28,903
My mom always said
that life is like a horseshoe.

477
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:34,244
It's fat in the middle,
open on both ends,

478
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,979
and hard all the way through.

479
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,194
Tomorrow...

480
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,167
when you've finished some work.

481
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,771
Bless you.

482
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:20,394
I had to see this place for myself.

483
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:21,430
Good.

484
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,227
It's something, huh?

485
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,995
No Bob Mitchum?

486
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,229
What are you drinking?

487
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,237
Campari with a twist.

488
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:30,931
You know, when I mentioned
the renovation,

489
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,771
I didn't know if you heard me.

490
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,437
I've been curious about seeing this place.

491
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:38,447
I'm actually involved with architects
on this department store.

492
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,176
Signage, mostly.

493
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:44,345
I like this room,
although I am its prime target:

494
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,683
Traveling salesman.

495
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,055
In that suit? I should say not.

496
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,755
No, I'm not one of those boys
who looks forward to a business trip

497
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,388
to escape the wife and kids.

498
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,059
I'm really a homebody.

499
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,362
But New York?

500
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:59,595
When you arrive,

501
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,365
and that train starts slowing down

502
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:02,939
and it gets all dark,

503
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,304
my heart pounds, and I think,

504
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,106
"I'm going to climb that staircase
and be in New York. "

505
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:11,477
I take it for granted.

506
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,914
It is a masterpiece of some kind.

507
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,112
Wherever I'm staying,
I always demand a view.

508
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,189
It's building after building.

509
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,123
Little compartments
filled with possibilities.

510
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:23,750
What's that from?

511
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:25,328
<i>42nd Street?</i>

512
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,760
What?

513
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:27,853
Uh, no.

514
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:30,160
No. I'm just saying it's...

515
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,498
it's like you can do anything.

516
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,198
I'm two ahead of you.

517
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,501
I have to eat something,

518
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,701
or I'm going to continue to rhapsodize.

519
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,072
What time is it?

520
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,682
I bet you don't have an expense account.

521
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:16,009
I'm not saying Peggy
doesn't have something upstairs.

522
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:17,444
I'm just saying at Sterling Cooper

523
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:18,742
things are usually happening downstairs.

524
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,511
I didn't know that.

525
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,179
My God, the whole office is here.

526
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,586
I don't see the Art Department.

527
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,716
What about those two?

528
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:36,330
Uh, I think I had too much to drink.

529
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,925
You are very petite.

530
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,769
Going back to the well. Interested?

531
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,691
Dance with me.

532
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,127
I don't like you like this.

533
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:13,216
Literally, "With flies. "

534
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,588
The espresso beans mean health, wealth,

535
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,923
and, um, happiness.

536
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:19,222
Seems redundant,

537
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,560
I mean, if you already
have health and wealth.

538
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:23,257
So, are you happy?

539
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:25,999
I'm one of those people

540
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:28,697
who thinks the minute you ask
that, you're not happy, so...

541
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,008
no.

542
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:35,272
You're loud, but you're shy.

543
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:37,847
I feel like I'm getting my fortune told.

544
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:38,937
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:41,381
Ah, it's fine.

546
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,452
So what do you want to do?

547
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,252
Uh... I don't know.

548
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,850
Maybe break off with one of the writers,

549
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,690
have my own little shop

550
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,665
where copy follows art
and not the other way around.

551
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,564
No, I mean my view.

552
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,068
You have to see it.

553
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,105
It's all the way to the park.

554
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,299
Of course it's dark now.

555
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,140
I don't know.

556
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,810
May I?

557
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,495
I...

558
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,327
don't know what to say.

559
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,333
It's Elliot.

560
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:34,097
And, Salvatore, you don't
have to say anything.

561
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,570
No, I... I just...

562
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,333
No.

563
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:43,345
Have another drink. Think about it.

564
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:47,549
Elliot,

565
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:50,347
I have thought about it.

566
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:54,447
I know what I want.

567
00:34:54,558 --> 00:34:56,822
I know what I want to do.

568
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:02,088
I know what you're thinking.

569
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,599
I'll show you.

570
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,467
What are you afraid of?

571
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:17,675
Are you joking?

572
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:27,420
This... has been a pleasure.

573
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,135
Don, are you all right?

574
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,179
I don't know.

575
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,811
It's always the same thing!

576
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,050
It's probably the guy in 2F.

577
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,626
He uses his wife like a speed bag.

578
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,160
Oh, man.

579
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,924
I was going to truck down
for some carrot juice.

580
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,062
Wait, wait.

581
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,156
Thank you.

582
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,160
Smoke?

583
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,161
No.

584
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:43,528
He speaks.

585
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,660
I'm supposed to tell you
to say your prayers.

586
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,398
Praying won't help you from this place, kid.

587
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,337
Best keep your mind on your mother.

588
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,103
She'll probably look after you.

589
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,337
She ain't my momma.

590
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,904
We all wish we were
from someplace else, believe me.

591
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,950
Ain't you heard?

592
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:03,679
I'm a whore child.

593
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:08,281
No. I hadn't heard
anything about that.

594
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,486
You don't talk like a bum.

595
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:14,325
I'm not. I'm a gentleman of the rails.

596
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,956
For me, every day is brand-new.

597
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,661
Every day's a brand-new place,

598
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,295
people, what have you.

599
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,103
So you got no home.

600
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,700
That's sad.

601
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:29,142
What's at home?

602
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:31,043
I had a family once:

603
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,083
A wife, a job, a mortgage.

604
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:37,517
I couldn't sleep at night
tied to all those things.

605
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,748
Then death came to find me.

606
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,553
Did you see him?

607
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,560
Only every night.

608
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,530
So one morning, I freed myself
with the clothes on my back.

609
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,429
Good-bye.

610
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,468
Now I sleep like a stone:

611
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:55,436
Sometimes under the stars, the rain.

612
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,097
The roof of a barn.

613
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:58,834
But I sleep like a stone.

614
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:01,536
So where do you go?

615
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:03,169
Tomorrow I'll be leaving this place,

616
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,838
that's for certain.

617
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:07,416
If death was coming
anyplace, it's here, kid,

618
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,042
creeping around every corner.

619
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,056
Here.

620
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,524
You're an honorary.

621
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,425
This is how we talk to each other.

622
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,227
On the front gate of every house,
there's a mark.

623
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,461
It's a code, just like
you heard on the radio.

624
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,628
See...

625
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,498
That's a pie.

626
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:33,303
It means the food here is good.

627
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,377
This one...

628
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:39,072
That means watch out
for the nasty dog.

629
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,309
This one here...

630
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,050
That means a dishonest man lives here.

631
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,146
And this one...

632
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,222
That means tell a sad story.

633
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,663
Here.

634
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,967
Don't be scared, kid.

635
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,232
You ain't a man yet.

636
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,167
Of course.

637
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,432
What?

638
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,906
You two.

639
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,068
You're in love.

640
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,237
What?

641
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,975
That's ridiculous.

642
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:51,520
Every day I make pictures
where people appear to be in love.

643
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,556
I know what it looks like.

644
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,551
Looks like a magazine.

645
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,029
Love is bourgeois.

646
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,501
You're breaking my heart.

647
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:08,469
Dig. Ad man's got a heart.

648
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,132
The grownups are talking.

649
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:13,573
Don't defend him.

650
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,441
Toothpaste doesn't solve anything.

651
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:21,541
Dacron sure as hell won't bring back
those ten dead kids in Biloxi.

652
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,813
Neither will buying some Tokaj wine

653
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,980
and leaning up against a wall
in Grand Central

654
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:27,386
pretending you're a vagrant.

655
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,928
You know what it's like to watch
all you ants go into your hive?

656
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,491
<i>I wipe my ass with the Wall Street Journal.</i>

657
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,431
How come every time we have a party,

658
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,163
the ladies have to sit
and listen to the men talk?

659
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:42,203
Look at you...

660
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,864
satisfied,

661
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:48,502
dreaming up jingles
for soap flakes and spot remover,

662
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,375
telling yourself you're free.

663
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,348
Oh, my God. Stop talking.

664
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:55,850
Make something of yourself.

665
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,887
Like you?

666
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,925
You make the lie.

667
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:11,729
You invent want.

668
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:14,702
You're for them...

669
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,035
not us.

670
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,165
Well, I hate to break it to you,

671
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,836
but there is no big lie.

672
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:24,345
There is no system.

673
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:28,441
The universe is indifferent.

674
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,152
Man, why'd you have to say that?

675
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,924
Paris.

676
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,501
Now. Let's go.

677
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:47,365
Don.

678
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,138
No, I can't.

679
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:07,946
Buy yourself a car.

680
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,360
Don.

681
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,294
The cops.

682
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,629
You can't go out there.

683
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,870
You can't.

684
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,144
Good evening.

685
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,875
Wake up, Bobby.

686
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,621
Come on, kiddo.

687
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:15,723
Daddy.

688
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,021
Your sister's sleeping.

689
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,160
Ask me anything.

690
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:25,859
What?

691
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,163
Anything.

692
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,898
I'm tired.

693
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,671
Ask me.

694
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:38,908
Uh, why do lightning bugs light up?

695
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,481
I don't know.

696
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:54,763
But I will never lie to you.

697
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,907
Well, sir, I believe that does it.

698
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:16,042
I'll be on my way.

699
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,645
Thank you, again,
for sharing your home.

700
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,349
Good luck to you.

701
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,642
Be on your way already.

702
00:46:58,582 --> 00:46:59,480
Good morning, Peggy.

703
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,050
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
