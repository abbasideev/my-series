1
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:14,495
Finished, sir?

2
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:16,164
Yeah. Hey, do you have a light?

3
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,344
Old Gold man, huh?

4
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,447
Lucky Strike here.

5
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:32,655
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you smoke Old Gold?

6
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:35,090
I'm sorry, sir.
Is Sam here bothering you?

7
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:37,753
He can be a little chatty.

8
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:40,229
No, we're actually just
having a conversation.

9
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:41,230
Is that okay?

10
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,995
Can I get you another drink?

11
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:47,162
Yeah. Do this again.
Old-fashioned, please.

12
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,169
So you obviously need to relax
after working here all night.

13
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,507
I guess. I don't know.

14
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:56,012
But what is it? I mean, low-tar?

15
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:57,012
Those new filters?

16
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,548
Why... I mean... Why Old Gold?

17
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,845
They gave 'em to us in the service...

18
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:02,442
a carton a week for free.

19
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:04,215
So you're used to 'em,
is that it?

20
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:07,019
Yeah. They're a habit.

21
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,025
I could never get you
to try another brand...

22
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,958
say, my Luckies?

23
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:14,191
I love my Old Golds.

24
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:17,894
All right, well, let's just say tomorrow
a tobacco weevil comes

25
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,972
and eats every last
Old Gold on the planet.

26
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:22,802
That's a sad story.

27
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:25,706
It's a tragedy.

28
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,244
Would you just stop smoking?

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,875
I think I could find something.

30
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:32,347
I love smoking.

31
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,976
"I love smoking. " That's very good.

32
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,714
My wife hates it.

33
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,881
<i>Reader's Digest says it will kill you.</i>

34
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,219
Yeah, I heard about that.

35
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,928
Ladies love their magazines.

36
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,464
Yes, they do.

37
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:22,091
You weren't worried
about waking me, were you?

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,531
Am I interrupting anything?

39
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:24,863
Mmm, no.

40
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:32,776
You're lucky I'm still up working
and I'm alone.

41
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,277
How's it going?

42
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,940
They invented something called
Grandmother's Day.

43
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,952
That ought to keep me busy
drawing puppies for a few months.

44
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,954
Can I run a few ideas past you?

45
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:46,887
Does that mean
what I think it means?

46
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:50,018
Because I'm familiar
with most of your ideas.

47
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,323
I'm having a situation
with my cigarette account.

48
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:55,832
Wow, you really are here to talk.

49
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,835
The Trade Commission is cracking down
on all of our health claims.

50
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,996
<i>I get Reader's Digest.</i>

51
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:03,597
This is the same scare
you had five years ago.

52
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,834
You dealt with it.

53
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:08,344
I know I slept a lot better
knowing doctors smoke.

54
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,379
Well, that's just it.

55
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:12,609
The whole "safer cigarette"
thing is over.

56
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:14,685
No more doctors,
no more testimonials,

57
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:18,187
no more cough-free,
soothes your T-zone,

58
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,349
low-tar, low-nicotine, filter tip.

59
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,017
Nothing.

60
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,721
All I have is a crush-proof box

61
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,357
and "four out of five
dead people smoke your brand. "

62
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,025
Is this the part where I say,

63
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,127
"Don Draper is the greatest ad man ever,

64
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,173
"and his big, strong brain will find a way

65
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,435
to lead the sheep
to the slaughterhouse"?

66
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:42,978
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

67
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,379
You gonna pitch to me or not?

68
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,112
Midge, I'm serious. I have nothing.

69
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,154
I am over, and they're
finally gonna know it.

70
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:51,313
Next time you see me,

71
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:52,913
there will be a bunch
of young executives

72
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,116
picking meat off my ribs.

73
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:56,456
That's a pretty picture.

74
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:00,192
What's your secret?

75
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:06,002
Nine different ways to say...

76
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:09,562
"I love you, Grandma. "

77
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,086
We should get married.

78
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,596
You think I'd make a good ex-wife?

79
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,098
I'm serious.

80
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,600
You have your own business.

81
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:41,433
You don't mind when I come over.

82
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,167
What size Cadillac do you take?

83
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:46,404
You know the rules.

84
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,671
I don't make plans,

85
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,111
and I don't make breakfast.

86
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:59,852
Sterling's having the tobacco people in
in nine hours, and I have nothing.

87
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,125
People love smoking.

88
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:06,288
There's nothing that you,
the Trade Commission,

89
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,629
<i>or Reader's Digest
can do to change that.</i>

90
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,138
There's this kid who comes
by my office every day,

91
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,143
looks where he's gonna put his plants.

92
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:22,608
Is he handsome?

93
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:45,001
23.

94
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,092
Uh, not right away.

95
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:47,831
Pal, could you take the long way up?

96
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,373
I am really enjoying the view here.

97
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:51,635
You going to Campbell's
bachelor party?

98
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:52,869
Yeah, I want to be there

99
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:56,004
before they tie an anchor around his neck
and drag him out to sea.

100
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,411
I hear she's a nice girl.

101
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:58,709
Eh, who wants that?

102
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:05,847
What did you do that for?

103
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,720
She'll probably be
assigned to one of us.

104
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,487
Then she'll know what she's in for.

105
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,653
You got to let them know
what kind of guy you are.

106
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,321
Then they'll know what kind of girl to be.

107
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,298
I have a feeling we won't be going
to your bachelor party soon.

108
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,666
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,
I'm a Boy Scout.

109
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,170
Excuse me. Is he expecting you?

110
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:22,466
He's not expecting anything.

111
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,305
Oh, honey, don't worry.
I'll get home safely.

112
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,271
I have an important
appointment right now,

113
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,350
so why don't you go
shopping or something?

114
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,077
Take your mother to lunch.

115
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,516
Tell her it was my idea.

116
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,281
Wow. He's good.

117
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,449
It's just a bachelor party, dear.

118
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:43,118
No, I really don't know
what they have planned,

119
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,423
but judging from the creative brain power
around here,

120
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,589
<i>we'll probably end up
seeing My Fair Lady.</i>

121
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,167
I'll tell you what.

122
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:53,100
I'll drop by your place on my way home.

123
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,569
Your mother can check
under my fingernails.

124
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:59,037
Of course I love you.

125
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:02,204
I'm giving up my life to be with you, aren't I?

126
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,116
What a great gal.

127
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,751
Tell ya, boys,

128
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:12,482
she stole my heart.

129
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,217
And her old man's loaded.

130
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,589
Now, this is the executive floor.

131
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,688
It should be organized, but it's not,

132
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:25,031
so you'll find account executives
and creative executives all mixed in together.

133
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,398
Please don't ask me the difference.

134
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:27,402
Great.

135
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,063
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,

136
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,108
you can avoid some of the mistakes
I've made here.

137
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,870
- Hello, Joan.
- Like that one.

138
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,514
So how many trains did it take you?

139
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,582
Only one, but I got up very early.

140
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:40,241
In a couple of years,
with the right moves,

141
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,342
you'll be in the city with the rest of us.

142
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,183
Of course, if you really make
the right moves,

143
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,347
you'll be out in the country,

144
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:48,221
and you won't be going to work at all.

145
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,850
You'll be here just
across the aisle from me.

146
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,429
We'll both take care of Mr. Draper
for the time being.

147
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,863
I don't know what your goals are,
but don't overdo it with the perfume.

148
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:58,026
Keep a fifth of something
in your desk.

149
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:59,694
Mr. Draper drinks rye.

150
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,864
Also, invest in some
aspirin, Band-Aids,

151
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,908
and a needle and thread.

152
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:05,941
Rye is Canadian, right?

153
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,739
You better find out.

154
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,445
He may act like he wants a secretary,

155
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:11,776
but most of the time,

156
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,716
they're looking for something
between a mother and a waitress.

157
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,446
And the rest of the time, well...

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,388
Go home, take a paper bag,

159
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,053
and cut some eyeholes out of it.

160
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:26,892
Put it over your head, get undressed,

161
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:28,659
and look at yourself in the mirror.

162
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,895
Really evaluate where your strengths
and weaknesses are,

163
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:33,402
and be honest.

164
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,496
I always try to be honest.

165
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,336
Good for you.

166
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:41,303
Now, try not to be overwhelmed
by all this technology.

167
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:42,401
It looks complicated,

168
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:45,210
but the men who designed it made it
simple enough for a woman to use.

169
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:46,408
I sure hope so.

170
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,645
At lunch, pick up a box of chocolates,

171
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,380
a dozen carnations,
and some bath salts.

172
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:51,420
I'll explain later.

173
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:52,990
Thank you, Miss Holloway.

174
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:55,582
You're really wonderful
for looking out for me this way.

175
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:57,126
It's Joan.

176
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:59,025
And listen,

177
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,791
don't take this the wrong way,

178
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,766
but a girl like you,
with those darling little ankles,

179
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,665
I'd find a way to make 'em sing.

180
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,603
Also, men love scarves.

181
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,197
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

182
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,871
Oh! And Mr. Sterling. How are you?

183
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:15,946
Morning, girls.

184
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,717
You look like a hundred bucks.
Long night?

185
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,344
It's not this tobacco thing, is it?

186
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:24,887
It's been on my mind.

187
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,456
Yeah, well, I should hope so.

188
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:27,616
Lee Garner, his father,

189
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,625
the whole Lucky Strike family
will be here at 4.

190
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,020
You worried?

191
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,462
No.

192
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,397
If I was worried,
I'd ask you what you've got,

193
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,334
but I'm not, so I'm just going to assume
you've got something,

194
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,405
which means you should be worried.

195
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,974
So you came here because you wanted
to watch me get dressed?

196
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,635
No, I wanted to make sure
you were here.

197
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:50,646
In body. Give me about a half hour
for the rest of it.

198
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:53,810
How do I put this?

199
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,386
Have we ever hired any Jews?

200
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:57,852
Not on my watch.

201
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:00,823
That's very funny. It's not what I meant.

202
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,156
We've got an Italian.
Salvatore, my art director.

203
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,389
- That won't work.
- Sorry.

204
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:08,522
Most of the Jewish guys
work for the Jewish firms.

205
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,827
Yeah, I know.

206
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,333
Selling Jewish products to Jewish people.

207
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:12,664
That's very good.

208
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,931
It's just that our 11:00
is with Menken's Department Store

209
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,236
and I wish we had someone
to make them feel... comfortable.

210
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,971
You want me to run
down to the deli and grab somebody?

211
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:23,573
You missed a button.

212
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,888
Ah. Look at you, Gidget.

213
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,431
Still trying to fill out that bikini?

214
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,262
Summer's coming.

215
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:19,495
Without the medical claims,

216
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:24,598
all we have is a white box
with a red spot on it.

217
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,233
My neighbor posed for that.

218
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:29,677
Believe me, he always
looks very relaxed.

219
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:31,180
Of course, he doesn't smoke.

220
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,374
Had him hold a pencil.

221
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:35,247
If I know these guys,
you're better off with a little sex appeal.

222
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:37,253
Can you give me a woman
in a bathing suit,

223
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,447
put her next to your guy?

224
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,683
A sexy girl? I can do that.

225
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,419
Give you a chance
to get a real model.

226
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,825
Oh, I love my work.

227
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,419
Speaking of sexy girls,

228
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,328
are you going to Pete's bachelor party?

229
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,094
I'm not really big on those things.

230
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:52,601
Tell me about it. It's so embarrassing.

231
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:54,262
If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,

232
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,363
I want to be alone so I can do something.

233
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,839
Should we drink before
the meeting or after?

234
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:03,277
Or both?

235
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:06,942
So... that's it, huh? Relax?

236
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,609
Don't be short with me.

237
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,119
You're the writer.

238
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,519
I thought it was worth a try.

239
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:14,352
<i>Greta Guttman is here to see you.</i>

240
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,357
Send her in.

241
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,552
Oh, great.

242
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,720
Now we get to hear from our man in research.

243
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,296
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,

244
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:26,802
you both seemed more relaxed
than I expected.

245
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:29,498
Do you have some kind of surprise
for the tobacco people?

246
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,404
I'm doing my own research.

247
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,477
If you're planning to continue
with medical testimony,

248
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,638
you'll only be inviting
further government interference.

249
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:37,976
We must police ourselves.

250
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:39,845
- There's your slogan.
- The medical thing is dead.

251
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:40,883
We understand that.

252
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,146
Yes, dead. An apt choice of words,

253
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:46,382
considering the public is convinced
that cigarettes are poisonous.

254
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,924
If we can't insist that they're not,

255
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,620
I believe my most recent surveys
have provided a solution.

256
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:53,458
We can still suggest
that cigarettes are part of American life,

257
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,225
or too good to give up,

258
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,927
or, most appealing,
an assertion of independence.

259
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,266
So, basically, if you love danger,
you'll love smoking.

260
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,703
We can put a skull
and crossbones on the label.

261
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:03,774
I love it.

262
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,502
Before the war,

263
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,407
when I studied with Adler in Vienna,

264
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,742
we postulated that what Freud called
the death wish

265
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,075
is as powerful a drive

266
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:13,707
as those for sexual reproduction
and physical sustenance.

267
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,843
Freud, you say?

268
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:16,920
What agency is he with?

269
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:20,684
So we're supposed to believe
that people are all living one way

270
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,919
and secretly thinking
the exact opposite?

271
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,517
That's ridiculous.

272
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,620
Let me tell you something,
Miss Guttman...

273
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,028
Doctor.

274
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,032
Dr. Guttman.

275
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:33,069
Psychology might be great
at cocktail parties,

276
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:38,006
but it so happens that people were
buying cigarettes before Freud was born.

277
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,236
The issue here isn't
why should people smoke.

278
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:43,370
It's why should people
smoke Lucky Strike.

279
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:45,881
Suggesting that our customers have a...

280
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:48,713
What did you call it? A death wish?

281
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,685
I just don't see that on a billboard.

282
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,552
<i>So what if Reader's Digest
says they're dangerous?</i>

283
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:55,785
<i>They also said Bambi
was the book of the century.</i>

284
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:56,791
There's no proof.

285
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,521
There's conclusive proof

286
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,996
that none of these low-tar,
low-nicotine, or filtration systems

287
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,432
have any effect on the incidences
of lung cancer.

288
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,264
Just give me the damn report.

289
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,565
I think you'll find it very convincing.

290
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:09,970
I'm sure I will.

291
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,200
You're the one who found

292
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:13,277
all of our medical testimonials
in the first place.

293
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:14,571
That's true, Mr. Draper, but I...

294
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,169
Has anyone else seen this?

295
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,474
Of course not. It's your account.

296
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:18,844
Good.

297
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,414
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

298
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,988
I'm sorry. I just find your whole
approach perverse.

299
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,593
Good luck at the meeting.

300
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,753
I'm sure it will be a quick one.

301
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,336
Sal, I'll take that drink now.

302
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,872
Mr. Draper.

303
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,942
Excuse me.

304
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:25,174
Mr. Draper.

305
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,650
I'm sorry to wake you,
but Mr. Campbell is outside.

306
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:32,480
He doesn't know I'm sleeping in here, does he?

307
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,488
No, sir.

308
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,718
That's good.

309
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:36,724
Who are you?

310
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:39,227
I'm Peggy Olsen, the new girl.

311
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:47,396
Can you go out there
and entertain him?

312
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:52,339
I know it's my first day,
and I don't want to seem uncooperative,

313
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:55,139
but do I have to?

314
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,408
I see your point.

315
00:16:58,449 --> 00:16:59,973
I brought you some aspirin.

316
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:05,983
Send him in.

317
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,586
You look like a hundred bucks.

318
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,559
Ready to go sweet-talk
some retail Jews?

319
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,256
You are tough to take
first thing in the morning, Pete.

320
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,730
I've never had any complaints.

321
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,767
Speaking of which,
who's your little friend here?

322
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:19,597
She's the new girl.

323
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,535
You always get the new girl.

324
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:23,368
Management gets all the perks.

325
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:25,636
Where are you from, honey?

326
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,938
Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.

327
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,444
Top notch.

328
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,741
But I meant where are you from?

329
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:33,942
Are you Amish or something?

330
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:36,952
No. I'm from Brooklyn.

331
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,214
Well, you're in the city now.

332
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:40,290
It wouldn't be a sin
for us to see your legs.

333
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:42,916
If you pull your waist in,
you might look like a woman.

334
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,790
Is that all, Mr. Draper?

335
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,658
Hey, I'm not done here.

336
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:47,822
I'm working my way up.

337
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,399
That will be all.

338
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,660
Peggy, right?

339
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:52,133
Yes.

340
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:54,727
Oh, and it's time for
your 11:00 meeting.

341
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,830
Oh, and sorry about Mr. Campbell here.

342
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,841
He left his manners
back at the fraternity house.

343
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,344
She's a little young for you, Draper.

344
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,314
The future Mrs. Pete Campbell
is a very lucky woman.

345
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:08,407
When's the wedding again?

346
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,215
Sunday. Did Ken tell you
about the bachelor party tonight?

347
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:12,346
He sure did.

348
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,855
So do I get first crack at her?

349
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,483
<i>Word is she took down more sailors
than The Arizona.</i>

350
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,152
How old are you, Pete?

351
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,627
I just turned 26.

352
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,995
I bet the whole world looks like
one great big brassiere strap

353
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,260
just waiting to be snapped, huh?

354
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:26,700
You are good with words, Draper.

355
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:29,329
Campbell, we're both men here,
so I'm gonna be direct.

356
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,102
Christ, are you already
sleeping with her?

357
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,177
Advertising is a very small world,

358
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,644
and when you do something
like malign the reputation

359
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,375
of a girl from the steno pool
on her first day,

360
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,144
you make it even smaller.

361
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:45,621
Keep it up, and even if you do get my job,
you'll never run this place.

362
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,315
You'll die in that corner office,

363
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,416
a mid-level executive
with a little bit of hair

364
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,392
who women go home with out of pity.

365
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:55,124
Want to know why?

366
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,200
Because no one will like you.

367
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:06,568
Oh! Here are our miracle-workers now.

368
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:07,974
You know Pete Campbell, of course,

369
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,047
your account executive
if you choose to do business with us.

370
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,012
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,

371
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:13,276
the best creative director in New York.

372
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,511
Well, at least the building.
Pleasure to meet you.

373
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:17,810
Oop. Sorry about that.

374
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,981
I'm Rachel Menken.

375
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,582
Oh. Uh, sorry. I was expecting...

376
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,718
You were expecting me to be a man.

377
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,057
My father was, too.

378
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:29,224
And you are?

379
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:34,564
Why, Don, you remember David Cohen
from the art department.

380
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,299
Of course! David.

381
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,898
One of the rising stars
here at Sterling Cooper.

382
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,034
Well, why don't we make
ourselves comfortable?

383
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,238
And, Miss Menken, you can tell us
what you have in mind.

384
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:44,405
Wonderful.

385
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:47,883
That's very subtle.

386
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:49,009
Isn't that your shirt?

387
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,055
Had to go all the way to the mailroom,
but I found one.

388
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:17,713
So you must be Peggy Olsen.

389
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,347
Joan Holloway sent you over.

390
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:22,976
She's a great girl. How is Joan?

391
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:24,645
She sends her regards.

392
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:26,154
She's a lot of fun.

393
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,986
Must be a scream to work with her.

394
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,219
Yes, it's pretty terrific.

395
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:34,728
Try to make yourself comfortable.

396
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:35,856
Relax.

397
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:48,111
I see from your chart, and your finger,
that you're not married.

398
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:49,941
That's right.

399
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,845
And yet you're interested
in the contraceptive pills.

400
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:55,443
Well, I was...

401
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:57,248
No reason to be nervous.

402
00:20:57,354 --> 00:20:59,549
Joan sent you to me
because I'm not here to judge you.

403
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:01,352
There's nothing wrong
with a woman being practical

404
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,484
about the possibility of sexual activity.

405
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:04,891
Spread your knees.

406
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:07,660
That's good to hear.

407
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:09,494
Although, as a doctor,

408
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,864
I'd like to think that putting a woman
in this situation

409
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:15,461
is not gonna turn her
into some kind of strumpet.

410
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:17,632
Slide your fanny toward me.
I'm not gonna bite.

411
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,979
I'll warn you now,

412
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:32,180
I will take you off this medicine if you abuse it.

413
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,916
It's for your own good, really.

414
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,790
But the fact is,
even in our modern times,

415
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:42,662
easy women don't find husbands.

416
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:46,802
I understand, Dr. Emerson.

417
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:49,270
I really am a very responsible person.

418
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:52,501
Well, I'm sure you're not
that kind of girl.

419
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,202
Now, Joan...

420
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:56,541
I'm just kidding along here.
You can get dressed.

421
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,251
I'm gonna write you
a prescription for Enovid.

422
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:05,254
They're $11 a month,

423
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,824
but don't think you have to go out
and become the town pump

424
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:10,485
just to get your money's worth.

425
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:11,720
Excuse my French.

426
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,530
So what Don is saying
is that through a variety of media,

427
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:20,297
<i>including a spot during
The Danny Thomas Show,</i>

428
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:22,998
if you can afford it,
we could really boost awareness.

429
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:26,304
Then, a 10% off coupon
in select ladies' magazines

430
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,344
will increase your first-time visitors.

431
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:30,174
Once we get them into the store,

432
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:34,047
the rest... is kind of up to you.

433
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:36,278
Mr. Draper, our store is 60 years old.

434
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:38,514
We share a wall with Tiffany's.

435
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:40,180
Honestly, a coupon?

436
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:44,020
Miss Menken, coupons work.

437
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:45,823
I think your father would
agree with the strategy.

438
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,693
He might, but he's not here

439
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:51,393
because we just
had our lowest sales year ever.

440
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:54,665
So I suppose what I think
matters most right now.

441
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,440
Miss Menken, why did you come here?

442
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:03,411
There are a dozen other agencies
better suited to your... needs.

443
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:07,848
If I wanted some man who happened
to be from the same... village as my father

444
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:09,283
to manage my account,

445
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:10,614
I could have stayed where I was.

446
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:13,087
Their research favors coupons, too.

447
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,550
It's not just research, Miss Menken.

448
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,150
Housewives love coupons.

449
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:19,854
I'm not interested in housewives.

450
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:22,262
What kind of people do you want?

451
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:24,493
I want your kind of people, Mr. Draper:

452
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:26,126
People who don't care about coupons,

453
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:27,430
whether or not they can afford it.

454
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:29,938
People who are coming to the store
because it is expensive.

455
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,066
We obviously have very different ideas.

456
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:35,873
Yes, like the customer is always right?

457
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,939
Gentlemen, I really thought
you could do better than this.

458
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,814
Sterling Cooper has a reputation
for being innovative.

459
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,115
Miss, you are way out of line.

460
00:23:45,222 --> 00:23:46,154
Don, please.

461
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:47,518
Let's not get emotional here.

462
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,058
There's no reason
we can't talk this out.

463
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,922
Talk out what? This silly idea

464
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,258
that people are gonna come
to some store they've never been to

465
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:54,626
because it's more expensive?

466
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,029
It works for Chanel.

467
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,532
Menken's is not Chanel.

468
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,364
That's a vote of confidence.

469
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,199
What Don's saying is,

470
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:03,205
Chanel is a very different kind of place.

471
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:06,470
It's French, it's continental, it's...

472
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,340
Not just another
Jewish department store?

473
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:09,639
Exactly.

474
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,339
You were right, Roger.

475
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:13,848
This place really runs on charm.

476
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,646
- This is ridiculous.
- Don.

477
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:17,846
I'm not gonna let a woman
talk to me like this.

478
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:20,515
This meeting is over.
Good luck, Miss Menken.

479
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:33,765
Hey, Don, I don't blame you.

480
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:35,202
She was way out of line.

481
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:38,035
Adding money and education
doesn't take the rude edge out of people.

482
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:41,976
Roger's not gonna be happy,
so I guess that's good for you.

483
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,139
I'm not gonna pretend I don't want your job,
but you were right.

484
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:48,082
I'm not great with people, and you are.

485
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,653
I mean, not counting
that meeting we were just in.

486
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,985
So I'm kind of counting
on you to help me out.

487
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:56,116
There's plenty of room at the top.

488
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,590
Look, I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before.

489
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,998
It's just this damn tobacco thing.

490
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:07,195
You'll think of something.
A man like you

491
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:09,499
I'd follow into combat blindfolded,

492
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:11,005
and I wouldn't be the first.

493
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:12,473
Am I right, buddy?

494
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:15,836
Let's take it a little slower.

495
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,743
I don't want to wake up pregnant.

496
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,149
Fuck you.

497
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:29,321
Dr. Emerson's a dream, isn't he?

498
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,757
He seemed nice.

499
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,488
He has a place in South Hampton.

500
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:35,656
I'm not saying that I've seen it,
but it's beautiful.

501
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,358
Now, don't be nervous,

502
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:41,097
but this is the nerve center of the office.

503
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,606
You and your boss rely on the willing
and cheerful cooperation

504
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,642
of a few skilled employees.

505
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:51,147
Never snap, yell,
or be sarcastic with them.

506
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:54,376
And above all, always be a supplicant.

507
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:02,656
I know you girls are busy,
but we've got a new one.

508
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,251
Peggy, this is Marge, Nanette, and Ivy.

509
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,296
I brought you some things.

510
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:10,332
I guess a sort of
"getting to know you" gift.

511
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,600
Well, aren't you a sweetheart?

512
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:15,569
If I know Joan, the candy's for me.

513
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:17,003
Joan, you're not fair.

514
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:19,473
You know she has to lose 8 pounds
by the Christmas party.

515
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,510
I think you look great.

516
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,546
Yeah, it's because I'm sitting down.

517
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,547
You can come back and visit
any time you want, honey.

518
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:26,809
Who does she work for?

519
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,214
Don Draper.

520
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:29,512
They got rid of Eleanor?

521
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,144
She moved on.

522
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,155
Draper wasn't interested.

523
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:34,918
Well, she couldn't get a call through.

524
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:36,322
Rude little thing.

525
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:37,984
We see that you've got your hands full.

526
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:39,528
Don't want to be a bother.

527
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,528
Nice meeting you.

528
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:41,563
Hey, you have great legs.

529
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:43,064
I bet you Mr. Draper would like them

530
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,101
if he could see them.

531
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:47,397
Sterling Cooper.
How may I direct your call?

532
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:54,604
I just don't know what we have to do
to make these government interlopers happy.

533
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:58,044
They tell us to make a safer cigarette,
we do it,

534
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,514
and then suddenly that's not good enough.

535
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:02,346
Might as well be living in Russia.

536
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,853
Damn straight.

537
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,784
You know, this morning I got a call

538
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:14,056
from my competitors
at Brown & Williamson,

539
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:16,462
and they're getting sued
by the federal government

540
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,262
because of the health claims they made.

541
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:19,835
Yeah, we're aware of that, Mr. Garner,

542
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,165
but you have to realize

543
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,136
that through the manipulation
of the mass media,

544
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,502
the public is under the impression

545
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:30,342
that your cigarettes are linked to...
certain fatal diseases.

546
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:32,108
Manipulation of the media?

547
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:33,877
Hell, that's what I pay you for.

548
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:36,919
Our product is fine.
I smoke 'em myself.

549
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,955
My granddad smoked 'em.
He died at 95 years old.

550
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,388
He was hit by a truck.

551
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:43,857
I understand. But our hands are tied.

552
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,725
We're no longer allowed to advertise
that Lucky Strikes are safe.

553
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,263
So what the hell are we gonna do?

554
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,890
We've already funded
our own tobacco research center

555
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,832
to put this whole rumor to rest.

556
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:54,528
And that's a very good start.

557
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:57,232
But it may not affect sales.

558
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,510
Don, I think maybe that's your cue.

559
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,973
Well, uh...

560
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:07,141
I have been, uh...

561
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,546
thinking quite a bit about this,

562
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:12,212
and, uh...

563
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,199
I mean, you know I'm a Lucky Strike man
from way back, so...

564
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,941
I might have a solution.

565
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:42,345
At Sterling Cooper, we've been pioneering
the burgeoning field of research,

566
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:46,115
and our analysis shows that the health risks
associated with your product

567
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,747
is not the end of the world.

568
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:51,453
People get in their cars
every day to go to work,

569
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:53,825
and some of them die.

570
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:56,263
Cars are dangerous.

571
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,994
There's nothing you can do about it.

572
00:28:59,102 --> 00:29:00,865
You still have to get where you're going.

573
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:04,570
Cigarettes are exactly the same,

574
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,643
so why don't we simply say,

575
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:09,041
"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?

576
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:10,579
"You're a man.

577
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:11,875
"The world is dangerous.

578
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:14,348
"Smoke your cigarette.

579
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,851
You still have to get where you're going. "

580
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:20,952
That's very interesting.

581
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:23,993
I mean, if cigarettes were dangerous,

582
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,026
it would be interesting.

583
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:26,652
Except they aren't.

584
00:29:26,763 --> 00:29:28,424
That's your slogan?

585
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:31,092
"You're going to die anyway. Die with us"?

586
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:34,398
Actually, it's a fairly well-established
psychological principle

587
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:37,769
that society has a death wish,

588
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:40,274
and if we could just tap into that,

589
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:41,742
the market potential is...

590
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:43,403
What the hell are you talking about?

591
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:44,810
Are you insane?

592
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:46,212
I'm not selling rifles here.

593
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:48,181
I'm in the tobacco business.

594
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:49,718
We're selling America.

595
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,721
The Indians gave it to us, for shit's sake.

596
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,290
Come on, Dad.

597
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:55,756
Let's get out of here.

598
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,026
The bright spot is at least we know

599
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,928
if we have this problem,
everybody has this problem.

600
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:17,746
Gentlemen, before you leave,
can I just say something?

601
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:20,874
I don't know, Don. Can you?

602
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:26,650
<i>The Federal Trade Commission
and Reader's Digest</i>

603
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,224
have done you a favor.

604
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:30,054
They've let you know that
any ad that brings up

605
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,028
the concept of cigarettes
and health together...

606
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:37,100
Well, it's just gonna
make people think of cancer.

607
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,930
Yes, and we're grateful to them.

608
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:44,633
But what Lee, Jr., said is right.

609
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:49,903
If you can't make those health claims,
neither can your competitors.

610
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:55,952
So we've got a lot of people
not saying anything that sells cigarettes.

611
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:57,145
Not exactly.

612
00:30:57,254 --> 00:31:01,953
This is the greatest advertising opportunity
since the invention of cereal.

613
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:07,259
We have six identical companies
making six identical products.

614
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:10,357
We can say anything we want.

615
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,435
How do you make your cigarettes?

616
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,766
I don't know.

617
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:17,066
Shame on you.

618
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:19,972
We breed insect-repellent tobacco seeds,

619
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:21,772
plant them in the North Carolina sunshine,

620
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:25,211
grow it, cut it, cure it, toast it...

621
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:26,577
There you go.

622
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:27,843
There you go.

623
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:38,090
But everybody else's tobacco is toasted.

624
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:42,256
No. Everybody else's
tobacco is poisonous.

625
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:43,992
Lucky Strikes...

626
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,500
is toasted.

627
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:50,539
Well, gentlemen, I don't think I have to tell you
what you just witnessed here.

628
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:54,167
I think you do.

629
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:59,170
Advertising is based on one thing:

630
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:01,113
Happiness.

631
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:03,413
And you know what happiness is?

632
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,489
Happiness is the smell of a new car.

633
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:09,950
It's freedom from fear.

634
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,656
It's a billboard on the side of the road
that screams with reassurance

635
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:18,757
that whatever you're doing... it's okay.

636
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,806
You are okay.

637
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:32,675
It's toasted.

638
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,610
I get it.

639
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:50,090
You had me worried.

640
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,636
I don't know if you were drunk or not drunk,

641
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,068
but that was inspired.

642
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:57,800
For the record, I pulled it out of thin air,

643
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,603
so thank you, up there.

644
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:01,472
You're looking in the wrong direction.

645
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:04,274
So now that I've got you
in the afterglow here,

646
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:07,646
what do you say you reconsider this
presidential campaign?

647
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:10,117
I don't know. Bunting and babies?

648
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,687
That's hard work.

649
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,255
I'd only make hash of it.

650
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,586
Modesty. That's adorable.

651
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:18,354
Consider the product:
He's young, handsome, Navy hero.

652
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:19,758
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult

653
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:21,694
to convince America Dick Nixon is a winner.

654
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,925
<i>Mr. Draper, you've got visitors.</i>

655
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:27,697
Could you be a little
more specific, honey?

656
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,803
We heard you saved the day.

657
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:34,536
Oh, thank you, boys. I appreciate it.

658
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:35,941
I told them how amazing you were.

659
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:37,638
I'm still tingling.

660
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:40,341
Well, looks like you're all going to engage
in a little mid-level camaraderie,

661
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,610
so I'll be on my way.

662
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,049
Don, thanks again for the home run.

663
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:45,018
- I love to come through.
- Speaking of which,

664
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:47,316
any chance you could
patch things up with Rachel Menken?

665
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:49,483
Any way you can be
as charming as I said you were?

666
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:51,823
Haven't you had enough
of my magic for one day?

667
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:54,396
She's worth $3 million.

668
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:55,987
You're a whore.

669
00:33:58,768 --> 00:34:00,201
Peggy...

670
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:02,237
Could she get us a little more ice?

671
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:04,773
<i>- Yes, Mr. Draper?
- Just a minute.</i>

672
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,899
Fellas, I think this party's gonna
have to move elsewhere.

673
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,308
We'll move wherever you want, but it's 5:15.

674
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:10,709
The bachelor party's underway.

675
00:34:10,814 --> 00:34:11,940
I don't know.

676
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:14,278
Oh, come on, Don. All hands on deck.

677
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:16,045
Aren't you gonna help
give Pete his big sendoff?

678
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:17,915
Maybe next time.

679
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:21,656
Come on, guys.

680
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:23,282
Don will join us later, right, Don?

681
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:33,233
If Greta's research was any good,

682
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:34,462
I would have used it.

683
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:37,600
What are you talking about?

684
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,766
I'm saying I had a report just like that.

685
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:42,470
And it's not like there's
some magic machine

686
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,945
that makes identical copies of things.

687
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,342
I still think she was right.

688
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:55,823
Have a great night, Pete.

689
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:56,892
Congratulations.

690
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:09,297
I heard you were
amazing in the meeting.

691
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:12,000
Fear stimulates my imagination.

692
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:17,772
I just wanted to thank you
for a great first day,

693
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:20,543
and for, you know...

694
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,813
standing up for me with Mr. Campbell.

695
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:39,058
First of all, Peggy,

696
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:41,569
I'm your boss, not your boyfriend.

697
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:46,467
Second of all, you ever let Pete Campbell
go through my trash again,

698
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:49,511
and you won't be able to find a job
selling sandwiches in Penn Station.

699
00:35:52,482 --> 00:35:55,178
He said he left his fountain pen in here.

700
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:56,980
I didn't know.

701
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,488
I hope you don't think
I'm that kind of girl.

702
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:06,460
Of course not.

703
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,861
Go home. Put your curlers in.

704
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,956
We'll get a fresh start tomorrow.

705
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:14,864
Oh. And, Peggy,

706
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,370
I need you to place a call.

707
00:36:38,194 --> 00:36:40,128
I want to see you here every 15 minutes,

708
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,289
whether you have drinks or not.

709
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,457
Uh, every five minutes.

710
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,630
Let's live here.

711
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,170
Better do more than look tonight.

712
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:50,762
Do you have a girlfriend, Salvatore?

713
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:53,741
Come on. I'm Italian.

714
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:55,708
Is there some kind of party here?

715
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,938
How did you swing it?

716
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:00,982
They work at the Automat.

717
00:37:01,084 --> 00:37:03,814
He pressed a button, and they came out.

718
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,581
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

719
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:07,087
Definitely not.

720
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,351
Well, I have the best seat.
What are we drinking?

721
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:11,654
More of whatever's
making you the way you are.

722
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:13,251
I love this place.

723
00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:16,264
It's hot, loud, and filled with men.

724
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,027
I know what you mean.

725
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,510
Oh, my God. I can already feel it.

726
00:37:32,615 --> 00:37:35,140
I have a feeling you're like this all the time.

727
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:36,684
I like to laugh.

728
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:38,117
Is that right?

729
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,280
Now, you stop that.

730
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,755
You said you like to laugh.

731
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:43,519
I mean it.

732
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:45,150
It's... It's too...

733
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:46,956
Too delicious.

734
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:49,497
Hey, I said stop it.
What do you think you're doing?

735
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,294
You know exactly.

736
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:52,993
Um, you know what, girls?

737
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:54,228
I think we should go.

738
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,395
Oh, come on.

739
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:57,166
You're hurting me.

740
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,567
I'll be good.

741
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:05,114
Buy the girls whatever they want.

742
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:13,786
So, uh, what do you fellas do?

743
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,484
You're looking at the finest
ad men in New York.

744
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:18,493
Hell, the world.

745
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:46,216
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,

746
00:38:46,322 --> 00:38:48,051
and one whiskey neat.

747
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:54,789
So...

748
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,866
you're going to ply me with drinks

749
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:59,400
and convince me what a terrible
mistake I'm making.

750
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,093
That is quite a drink.

751
00:39:02,205 --> 00:39:05,231
You got in trouble, didn't you?

752
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:09,542
I shouldn't have lost my temper,

753
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,614
and I certainly
shouldn't have treated you

754
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:12,908
like anything less than a client.

755
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:14,950
Apology accepted.

756
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,654
So you understand.

757
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:20,552
Now I do.

758
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:24,525
It was, uh, refreshing, really.

759
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:29,064
I mean, actually hearing all the things
I always assumed people were thinking.

760
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,494
Well, I'm not really as bad as all that.

761
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:36,867
I was under a lot of pressure.

762
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:39,271
Another account.

763
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:43,740
Doesn't really matter.

764
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,905
No, it doesn't.

765
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:53,747
So, without making things worse,
can I ask you a personal question?

766
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,292
Don't you want to get
a second drink in me first?

767
00:39:57,393 --> 00:39:58,690
Why aren't you married?

768
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:02,562
Are you asking
what's wrong with me?

769
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:04,826
It's just that you're
a beautiful, educated woman.

770
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:07,061
Don't you think that getting married
and having a family

771
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,762
would make you happier
than all the headaches

772
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:10,304
that go along with...

773
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:11,930
fighting people like me?

774
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,911
If I weren't a woman,
I would be allowed

775
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:19,607
to ask you the same question.

776
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,081
And if I weren't a woman,

777
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:24,711
I wouldn't have to choose
between putting on an apron

778
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:28,814
and the thrill of making my father's store
what I always thought it should be.

779
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:35,023
So that's it. You won't get married
because you find business to be a thrill.

780
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:37,429
That and...

781
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:42,631
I've never been in love.

782
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:46,197
She won't get married
because she's never been in love.

783
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:48,971
I think I wrote that once to sell nylons.

784
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:53,174
For a lot of people,
love isn't just a slogan.

785
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:54,544
Oh, you mean love.

786
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:56,175
You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart

787
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:58,310
where you can't eat and you can't work

788
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:04,690
and you just run off
and get married and make babies.

789
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:08,730
The reason you haven't felt it
is because it doesn't exist.

790
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:10,093
What you call love

791
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,192
was invented by guys
like me to sell nylons.

792
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:17,336
Is that right?

793
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,101
I'm pretty sure about it.

794
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,334
You're born alone,
and you die alone,

795
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:24,777
and this world just drops
a bunch of rules on you

796
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:26,109
to make you forget those facts,

797
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:27,739
but I never forget.

798
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,517
I'm living like there's no tomorrow...

799
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:34,681
because there isn't one.

800
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:39,661
I don't think I realized it until this moment,

801
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,690
but it must be hard being a man, too.

802
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,164
Excuse me?

803
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:50,938
Mr. Draper...

804
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,371
- Don.
- Mr. Draper,

805
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,808
I don't know what it is
you really believe in,

806
00:41:55,912 --> 00:42:02,909
but I do know what it feels like
to be out of place, to be disconnected,

807
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:05,715
to see the whole world
laid out in front of you

808
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:08,188
the way other people live it.

809
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:13,422
There is something about you
that tells me you know it, too.

810
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,929
I don't know if that's true.

811
00:42:23,072 --> 00:42:25,302
You want another drink?

812
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,467
No.

813
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:30,978
But you can tell your boss
that you charmed me.

814
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:39,851
So I guess we'll be
seeing each other again.

815
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:45,087
I'll be back in the office Monday morning,
for a real meeting.

816
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:47,162
I'd like that.

817
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:04,641
We're not buying anything.

818
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:06,908
Actually, for the first time today,

819
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:09,143
I'm not selling anything.

820
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:11,413
Does Peggy live here?

821
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:12,510
Hold on.

822
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:26,365
Do you know him?

823
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,163
It's okay, Marjorie.
We work together.

824
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:32,930
He's really drunk.

825
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,101
It's okay, Marjorie.

826
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:41,709
So... what are you doing?

827
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:42,876
Nothing.

828
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:46,250
Just, uh, sitting in my room
listening to records.

829
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:48,289
I'm getting married on Sunday.

830
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,416
I heard that.

831
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:54,955
You must think I'm a creep.

832
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,559
Why are you here?

833
00:44:09,078 --> 00:44:11,774
I wanted to see you tonight.

834
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:17,515
Me?

835
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,986
I had to see you.

836
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:30,930
Marjorie?

837
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,092
Yeah, Peg?

838
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:35,170
I'm going to bed now.

839
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,824
I called the office. They said you'd left.

840
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:09,654
I didn't want to bother you.

841
00:46:09,765 --> 00:46:11,528
It's no bother.

842
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:14,933
I just assumed you were staying
in the city again.

843
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:19,471
There's a plate in the oven.

844
00:46:25,614 --> 00:46:27,548
Unless you're not hungry.

845
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,947
I'm not.

846
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:34,981
I'll be right back.

847
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:37,252
Don't move.
