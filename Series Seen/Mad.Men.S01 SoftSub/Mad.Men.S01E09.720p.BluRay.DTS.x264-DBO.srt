1
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:59,155
Mommy, look at that!

2
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,755
Hello.

3
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:40,832
Don Draper. How are you?

4
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:45,266
<i>Probably about like you:
Enduring the splendor of Fiorellol</i>

5
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,828
You know we got
that Israeli tourism thing, right?

6
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,532
Mazel tov.

7
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:53,668
I ran into Jim Jordan from BBDO
at the Athletic Club

8
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:57,408
with, uh, Frank from Y&R.

9
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,507
Your name came up.

10
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,779
Three millionaires
in towels in a steam room.

11
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,616
I don't know how to take that.

12
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:05,314
Take it as a compliment,

13
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:08,587
a sign that you're
destined for greater things.

14
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:11,959
I think "Jesus Over Rio"
was the best tourist campaign

15
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,554
I've seen in over 20 years.

16
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,656
Wasn't good enough
to land the Israelis.

17
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,961
Ah, that's not you.

18
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,697
That's the tiny store you work in.

19
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,740
Now, if you were with me at McCann,

20
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,139
you'd have over 500 people
at your disposal...

21
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:27,006
and that's just in New York.

22
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,943
We can get a lot of things done.

23
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:31,743
Can you get me out
of the second half of this show?

24
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,342
All I'm saying is you've done your time
in the farm leagues.

25
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,718
Yankee Stadium is on the line.

26
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,791
I changed my mind.

27
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,291
I decided you deserve a visit to the bar.

28
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,521
Adele, this is Donald Draper.

29
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,757
If we're being introduced,
I assume that you're in advertising.

30
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,096
Would you both like
to talk about that some more?

31
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,100
Betty.

32
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,329
My wife.

33
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,461
Jim and Adele Hobart.

34
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,665
Hello. Betty Draper.

35
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:56,763
A pleasure.

36
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,809
Your husband here was about to prove

37
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,879
that he can speak about things
other than advertising.

38
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,709
Oh, he's very interesting.

39
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:05,908
Well, then, come with me.

40
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:07,484
Let's get those drinks.

41
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:08,644
We'll be back.

42
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:09,812
Champagne?

43
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:24,130
Besides getting the handsome prince,
are you an actress or something?

44
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:27,433
No, I'm a housewife.

45
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,442
I did do some modeling...
a lifetime ago.

46
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,307
I'm not surprised.

47
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,711
That is some face you've got there.

48
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:40,114
Anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for Grace Kelly?

49
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:41,913
They used to.

50
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,955
You know what?

51
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,490
Coca-Cola's deep into this, uh,

52
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:50,288
international campaign right now.

53
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,558
A European face like yours,
like Grace Kelly's,

54
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,997
might be a road we could go down.

55
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:59,229
Uh, we could put a call out
for a Grace Kelly type,

56
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:02,932
but, uh, I don't think we'd come this close.

57
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,906
You say you've modeled?

58
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,671
I'm retired.

59
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:10,439
This is silly.

60
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,641
Think about it.

61
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,742
Your coloring with a green bottle
and an Irish setter...

62
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,450
Oh, drink up.

63
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,684
It's back to Tammany Hall.

64
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,225
I like the show.

65
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:23,726
Very gay songs.

66
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,693
Well, we'd better get back in there or leave.

67
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,767
Come on.

68
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,632
Uh, it was very nice
meeting both of you.

69
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,085
Why didn't you want
to go to dinner with Jim and Adele?

70
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,857
People like Jim Hobart
always talk business

71
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:03,025
because they have
nothing else to say.

72
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:06,536
I can see that.

73
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:08,196
You know, he gave me his card.

74
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:09,603
Really?

75
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,142
Did he tell you to put it
under my pillow of something?

76
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:17,204
No. Actually, he was talking to me
about modeling.

77
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:18,782
Was he?

78
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:23,111
I don't think it was like that.

79
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:27,624
He said something about Grace Kelly
and Coca-Cola.

80
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,097
Well, then, there's no need
to doubt his interest, then.

81
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:36,133
I did model, Don.

82
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,998
Am I that wrong for Coca-Cola?

83
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,976
You're not wrong for anything.

84
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,339
So are you going to go there?

85
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:03,560
<i>How was Fiorello exclamation point?</i>

86
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:08,361
Lt'll be six months before I can get Don
back into a Broadway theater.

87
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,168
Oh, we ran into this agency head.

88
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:16,263
Apparently he's courting Don.

89
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,035
He gave me his card.

90
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:20,202
Asked me if I wanted to do any modeling.

91
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:23,042
That's a heck of a line.
What did Don say?

92
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,582
He basically said the man was trying
to sleep with one of us

93
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:27,914
and that he didn't like the idea of either.

94
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,990
I did do some modeling, you know.

95
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,355
I did not know, but I'm not surprised.

96
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,758
Carlton calls you Grace Kelly.

97
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:40,922
I was a model when I met Don.

98
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:42,693
A model in Manhattan?

99
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:43,893
Yes.

100
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:46,061
It was exciting.

101
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:48,765
But when I got started...

102
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:51,205
the summer after college, in Italy.

103
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:52,401
Italy?

104
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,379
There was this Italian designer: Giovanni.

105
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,507
He wanted to be called Johnny.

106
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,586
That's how much he loved Americans.

107
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:03,847
Well, he loved American girls.

108
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:07,721
It was more of an artist/muse relationship.

109
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,794
Okay.

110
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:22,368
So... he made you all this,
and it was platonic?

111
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,567
No petting, nothing?

112
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,940
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

113
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,811
And put my hair up like this.

114
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,056
And Salvatore said he has
the Menken's artwork,

115
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,523
and to meet him in the art department

116
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,321
because you're going
to need a red pencil.

117
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,952
Any other good news?

118
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,692
I think the mail boy
dropped that off for you last night.

119
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,325
Peggy, can you get me
an outside line?

120
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,122
<i>Right away.</i>

121
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:18,786
Don Draper.

122
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,365
Now, why would you
call me out of the blue?

123
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,730
I appreciate the gesture.

124
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:27,236
It's not a gesture, Don,
it's an overture.

125
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:30,364
Let me tell you, you're
a hard man to run into.

126
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:31,874
I don't know what to say.

127
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,204
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

128
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,438
The next step is a quiet rendezvous.

129
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:36,707
The Algonquin?

130
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,578
<i>There's a small hotel.</i>

131
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:40,412
<i>Isn't that the song?</i>

132
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:44,087
I don't know. I'm...

133
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm not ready to wave the flag just yet.

134
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,850
What about the details?

135
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,496
I'd rather do this face-to-face.

136
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,225
But you already know
what you're going to say.

137
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,604
I don't have to tell you

138
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,368
the obvious limitations of Sterling Cooper.

139
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,966
But you're going to.

140
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,635
<i>Do I need to be careful here?</i>

141
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:08,770
<i>It's a mom-and-pop.</i>

142
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,008
McCann Erickson
is an international company.

143
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:14,984
We have a network that extends
far beyond Madison Avenue:

144
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,850
<i>Europe, South America.</i>

145
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:20,789
<i>We're publicly traded.
We issue dividends.</i>

146
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,086
Small is bad.

147
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:23,125
<i>Don,</i>

148
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:25,788
do you know the kind
of clients we attract?

149
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,296
Pan Am, Coca-Cola,

150
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:28,422
<i>Esso.</i>

151
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,864
<i>Can you imagine the lifestyle</i>

152
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,765
that goes with handling Pan Am?

153
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,565
It's a panty-dropper.

154
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:34,899
<i>Television?</i>

155
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,735
<i>You could be in that in a bigger way.</i>

156
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,830
<i>You know that.</i>

157
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,239
<i>What, you want to sell corn?</i>

158
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:40,641
<i>We do a show about Indians.</i>

159
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:43,543
Imagine yourself
in a three-year contract.

160
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:46,515
35 per annum, security set in stone.

161
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,711
<i>Sterling probably hasn't
let you break 30 yet.</i>

162
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,651
No comment.

163
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:53,053
<i>I really don't like
doing this over the phone.</i>

164
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:56,889
All I can say is
eventually you come up here,

165
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:58,929
or you die wondering.

166
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,867
He gave me his card right in front of Don.

167
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:12,602
Well, not right in front of him, I guess.

168
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,338
Well, I told Don about it.

169
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:20,816
I was a model, you know?

170
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,446
In fact, I met Don on a photo shoot.

171
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:28,959
I was wearing this Russian blue fox coat.

172
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,296
He was just a copywriter at the fur company.

173
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:36,797
I remember

174
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:39,995
he saw that I didn't like
giving the coat back.

175
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,129
It's always the hardest part.

176
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,839
He asked me out.

177
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:50,676
He wasn't shy. I liked that.

178
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,909
I said no.

179
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:54,484
Then three weeks later,

180
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,486
the coat arrived at my apartment.

181
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,650
Who knows what kind
of Indian trading

182
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:02,419
he had to do to get it?

183
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,624
I think I only had
two more jobs, maybe three,

184
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,927
before we got engaged.

185
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,700
And then I got pregnant.

186
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:18,933
It's always a nightmare
raising children in Manhattan,

187
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,273
so we moved to Ossining.

188
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,575
Suddenly I...

189
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:29,551
really felt so old.

190
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,122
Tell me more about that.

191
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,819
My mother was very concerned
about looks and weight.

192
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,188
And I've always eaten a lot.

193
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,565
And I like hot dogs.

194
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:52,040
Mother used to say,
"You're going to get stout. "

195
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:59,674
And then I became a model,
and she hated it,

196
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:03,447
even though Suzy Parker
made $100,000 that year.

197
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:07,457
My mother hated it.

198
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,549
Manhattan.

199
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,328
She called me a prostitute.

200
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,459
You're angry at your mother.

201
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,730
What?

202
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,363
Are you going to talk now?

203
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,465
You are angry at your mother.

204
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:28,409
Of all the things I've said in here.

205
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:30,947
You're sitting up.

206
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,576
You don't listen to me.

207
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:36,347
You don't listen to what I say,

208
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,422
and then out of nowhere you provoke me.

209
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,853
Tell me more about that.

210
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,101
I miss her.

211
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,437
I understand that.

212
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,942
It's good and bad.

213
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:14,249
She wanted me to be beautiful
so I could find a man.

214
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,051
There's nothing wrong with that.

215
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,561
But then what?

216
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:29,333
Just sit and... smoke and...

217
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,102
let it go till you're in a box?

218
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:39,249
I don't care why he gave me his card.

219
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,838
Where'd you get this?

220
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:13,041
Kurt Teasdale over at Gil Bascom.

221
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:14,209
It's already on the air.

222
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,751
They wanted to do it
before she had the baby.

223
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:18,378
Am I alone? I don't understand it.

224
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,548
Because it's in Spanish.

225
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,092
I recognize that finishing school voice.

226
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:25,287
You can't govern and listen to that all day.

227
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,364
I'm happy to give up
any Spanish speakers

228
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:28,898
and hope this goes away.

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Cooper thinks if Kennedy creeps up
any more in the polls,

230
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,628
Nixon will panic,

231
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,034
and they'll get desperate for our efforts.

232
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:35,366
He wants everything in place.

233
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:37,031
More risk.

234
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,837
Why are we doing this again?
And out of pocket?

235
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,344
I for one don't question
the wishes of our clients.

236
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:43,812
Clients come and go, Campbell.

237
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:47,009
Sometimes it's best to rid them
of unrealistic expectations.

238
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,279
Are you trying to say that we can't win?

239
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,287
Nixon's got an 8-point lead in the polls.

240
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,447
Not much.

241
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,252
And we still haven't figured out a way

242
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,292
to make an impact about
the Nixon campaign's involvement.

243
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:58,760
My marching orders
were undecided states.

244
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:00,888
I think a plan of attack
would make Coop happy.

245
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,330
The 50/50s: Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois.

246
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,732
Now, it's easy to just say that, isn't it?

247
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,101
I think women will hate her.

248
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,572
It's like their better-looking sister
marries a handsome senator,

249
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,700
and she's going to live in the White House.

250
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,300
<i>I'm practically jealous.</i>

251
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,613
Hi.

252
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:26,985
I called.

253
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,616
I assumed you were staying in the city.

254
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,160
The girl.

255
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:34,959
We gave her a little extra work,
and now she's distracted.

256
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,159
Look at that.

257
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:40,728
It's raw, Don.

258
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,944
Don, I realized something today.

259
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:52,513
I miss modeling.

260
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,676
You were always
telling me you hated it.

261
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,548
Maybe the passing of time

262
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:58,986
has made me... feel differently.

263
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,819
Maybe it's Jim Hobart.

264
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,621
So what?

265
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:06,253
It's still an opportunity.

266
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,025
You want to go back to work?

267
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:10,327
A few days. I mean, is that so bad?

268
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:11,958
I get paid.

269
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:14,560
I can get Ethel to watch the kids.

270
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,902
She watches them half the time now.

271
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,806
That's three-, four-hour stretches.

272
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,870
I think it would be fun
to go in and be that girl again.

273
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:26,347
You're serious?

274
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,850
There will still be ham.

275
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,717
I promise.

276
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,954
Are you resolved?

277
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,755
Or is this even worth arguing?

278
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:41,161
No, it's not like that.

279
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:45,361
It's just... something I'd like to do.

280
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,637
Well, I can't stop you
from doing what you want to do.

281
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,224
You have no idea
how boring it is around here.

282
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,231
Really? I would think one hour
on the Sterling Cooper switchboard

283
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,425
would be a Russian novel.

284
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,001
They told me it would happen,

285
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:20,593
but the truth is
you really just stop listening.

286
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,195
And put ice on your wrists.

287
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:32,276
Peggy, do you need to go home?

288
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:33,509
What?

289
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:34,676
The sweater.

290
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:36,650
Are you having one of those days?

291
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:37,721
It's not that.

292
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:38,880
I'd like to go home,

293
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,423
but I just don't think I can.

294
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:41,991
Then what is it?

295
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,720
You're not helping your silhouette.

296
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,861
I ripped my skirt.

297
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:50,160
You don't have a needle and thread?

298
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,758
It's a big rip.

299
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,771
Oh, honey, I've got
a spare outfit squirreled away.

300
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:57,170
You can borrow it.

301
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,753
We're not exactly dressed
for that, are we?

302
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:13,119
I've lost men like you before.

303
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:16,421
It usually had to do with
my unexpressed confidence.

304
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,586
I think you're one in a million, Draper.

305
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:22,462
Those are nice clubs.

306
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:25,501
That bonus from Cooper
must have made you happy.

307
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,333
It was designed as a kind of an armor
against men like Jim Hobart.

308
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,868
How'd you hear about it?

309
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:39,277
I saw those clubs
going down the hallway.

310
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,374
I thought they were for me.

311
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:43,510
They're from Jim Hobart.

312
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,223
What did he offer?

313
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,588
Bigger.

314
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:54,221
The world, basically.

315
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,163
Well, it can't just be
a number on a salary,

316
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,064
because you know we're open to that.

317
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:59,864
Pan Am.

318
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,636
Pan Am... is not McCann Erickson.

319
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:08,406
Big talent attracts big clients.

320
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,776
We can try and make
that happen here.

321
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,439
- That's true.
- But don't be fooled.

322
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,347
You hear Pan Am,
you imagine London,

323
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:16,283
holed up at the Dorchester
with three stewardesses.

324
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:19,788
The truth is it's more like
a 20-hour boomerang flight

325
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,949
so you can make
a coupon sing in Spanish.

326
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,562
And when you have stockholders
like McCann does,

327
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:28,598
you can't fire clients.
I know you'll hate that.

328
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:34,971
I thought about leaving once.

329
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:39,339
But you know?

330
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:40,842
It's daunting.

331
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,937
Why entertain the prospect of failure?

332
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:45,447
That's a sad thought.

333
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,643
No. It made me look at this place.

334
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,482
I don't want to sound sentimental,

335
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,783
but it's not just accounts.

336
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,950
Look around here at what you have.

337
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,463
You want to start over?

338
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,698
I haven't made up my mind.

339
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,636
I'm taking this very personally.

340
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:15,211
Why? It's business.

341
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,076
Is it?

342
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,088
McCann Erickson is the major leagues.

343
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,588
Good. Let him go.

344
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,658
You're right. Maybe he'll take me with him.

345
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,522
Can you imagine the money?

346
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,789
I heard he's making 30 already.

347
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,161
He's not ten times better than me.

348
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,192
You love him.

349
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:39,860
Everybody loves him.

350
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,733
Sure. His moods and the way he talks.

351
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,103
I don't even know what he's
saying half the time.

352
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,766
Clients do.

353
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:57,186
I'll admit she crossed my mind once.

354
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:01,017
She's having a very bad
freshman year.

355
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,524
They went nuts for her writing.

356
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,025
Belle Jolie, she did that.

357
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,618
Belle Jolie was okay.

358
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:08,721
She obviously let it go to her head...
and other parts of her.

359
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,698
No, I don't think it's the job.

360
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,666
I think we're seeing the real her:

361
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,364
One of those girls
who slimmed down before she got here.

362
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:18,340
Now she's here, and there she is.

363
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,773
Who thinks about her?

364
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:21,708
Maybe she'll go with Draper, too.

365
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,473
It's a tragedy.

366
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:28,280
Piece of fruit that went real bad real fast.

367
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:30,114
And no one ever got to eat it.

368
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,554
Well, I got some work to do.

369
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:38,617
Suddenly upon news of others' success,
a young man is filled with ambition.

370
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:40,253
Drop dead.

371
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:43,060
Harry, you busy?

372
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:01,144
Well, hello. I can't believe this.

373
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,984
I'm sorry. I, uh, overdid it.

374
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:10,083
You're out of the business
a few years, and things change.

375
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:13,254
Please, I'm overwhelmed
with the style of you.

376
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:15,298
Betty Draper, meet Ronnie Gittridge.

377
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,333
He handles the art for Coca-Cola.

378
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:18,992
He's also my brother-in-law.

379
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:20,434
It is a pleasure.

380
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,403
Look at her. What did I say?

381
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:23,871
You ready to work?

382
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:25,942
I'm excited.

383
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,510
It's not that complicated.

384
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:29,875
He's either going to tell you
to think about something else

385
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,379
or just stand there.

386
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:34,713
Jim thinks everyone else's job is easy.

387
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:36,012
Shall we?

388
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,485
Mrs. Draper,

389
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,522
it's just a tryout.

390
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:40,885
No guarantees.

391
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:43,516
I told you I've done this before.

392
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:47,324
Now, where did you get that dress?

393
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:49,423
So basically,

394
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:51,125
whereas Secor previously
spent their money

395
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:52,634
on local print and radio,

396
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,897
we increase the network buy to 30%.

397
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:56,404
More points for each dollar.

398
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:59,271
Secor laxatives.

399
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:01,537
You know, I have to talk
to those people.

400
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,044
They're not what you would expect.

401
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:06,310
They have absolutely
no sense of humor about their product.

402
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:09,580
Who knew that college
was going to get me out of the army

403
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:11,245
and into laxatives?

404
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:13,550
College was the moment, wasn't it?

405
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,990
Fun and games... and girls.

406
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,652
Were you in a frat?

407
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,923
Alpha Delta Phi.

408
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,432
Also known as cutups.

409
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,901
We were the cutups.

410
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:30,735
We had this stray Dalmatian.

411
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,706
Our mascot Mamie.

412
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,107
So it died,

413
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:37,146
and in classic fraternity manner,
we decided to throw a party.

414
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:38,874
Mamie's funeral.

415
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:42,111
One of the pledges pipes in
that our rivals, Psi U...

416
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,312
They are so gung-ho.

417
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:47,049
Psi U is throwing a beauty pageant parade
on Main Street

418
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:48,818
with the girls' school down the road.

419
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:51,156
Now, my friend Chip...
he's a lawyer now...

420
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,128
says "Why don't we go down there
and get a permit,

421
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:57,894
throw a grand funeral for Mamie,
and let the girls run away crying?"

422
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:02,097
That's great. Did you do it?

423
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:05,175
We had police barricades
and 30 brothers following that pledge,

424
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,766
who had the honor of pulling
Mamie in a Radio Flyer.

425
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:09,778
That's beautiful.

426
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,178
Idiots.

427
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,510
Wait a minute.

428
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,950
Nixon and Kennedy
are both buying up air time

429
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:24,289
in these undecided states.

430
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:25,794
It's an arms race.

431
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,456
Nixon buys, Kennedy matches.

432
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:30,226
So if we can't increase
Nixon's presence,

433
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,596
we can decrease Kennedy's.

434
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:33,101
How do we do that?

435
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:36,730
We make big buys in New Jersey,
Illinois, and wherever

436
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,774
for Secor laxatives.

437
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,367
Well, hold on.

438
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,208
So Nixon's selling laxatives?

439
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,805
No. We're selling laxatives.

440
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,475
Nixon's selling Nixon.

441
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:51,486
And Kennedy's
watching Mamie's funeral.

442
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:55,385
This is scary.

443
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,452
It is.

444
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:00,393
Isn't it?

445
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:02,959
<i>Even careful mothers can't completely</i>

446
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:05,228
<i>protect their families
from household germs</i>

447
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:06,597
<i>just by cleaning alone.</i>

448
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:08,365
<i>That's why you need Lysol.</i>

449
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:10,303
<i>Lysol, added to your
regular cleaning water,</i>

450
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:12,068
<i>eliminates germs that cause odors</i>

451
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,803
<i>that may cause illness.</i>

452
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:15,742
<i>Lysol: Fastest, easiest,</i>

453
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,507
<i>most effective way
to kill household germs...</i>

454
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:18,638
It was for me.

455
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,047
<i>...and lingering odors.</i>

456
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:23,119
Who was it?

457
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,883
I'm the girl. The girl with the cola.

458
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,321
It's only a couple days' work.

459
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:35,023
You know, just a couple of photo shoots
and then some kind of testing.

460
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:37,600
But I guess you know how it works.

461
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,430
I do.

462
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:44,733
Don't worry.
I'm not going to ruin this.

463
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,503
I'm very happy for you.

464
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,792
I know you don't like it.

465
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:16,430
But I know you're
a little bit proud of me.

466
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,442
Come upstairs.

467
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:25,572
No.

468
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:28,982
Right here.

469
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:34,317
Okay.

470
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:06,017
How are these open already?

471
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:08,853
Well, Betty, we don't want life
to look difficult, now do we?

472
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,462
You're too much.

473
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:37,985
No! No!

474
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:40,623
Polly, no!

475
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:41,918
Let it go.

476
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,858
If I see that dog in my yard again,

477
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,128
I'm going to shoot it.

478
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:09,418
I see you got there and back in one piece.

479
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,146
Yes.

480
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:12,882
And even though I got lost,

481
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,719
I sent Ethel home at 4.

482
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:19,924
They went to the park,
then to visit Ernie at Francine's.

483
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,328
All in all, everyone had a nice day.

484
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:24,662
So how was it?

485
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:25,826
There was this man Ronnie.

486
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:27,733
I don't even know what his job is.

487
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:30,807
Ronnie Gittridge.
He's the art director. I've met him.

488
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,535
He is such a character.

489
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:34,668
He tells funny stories.

490
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:36,803
I brought the form home.

491
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:39,075
I thought you could
help me fill it out

492
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:40,945
so I can get paid.

493
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,518
I'd love to.

494
00:28:58,101 --> 00:28:59,932
Sweetie pie.

495
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:01,265
What happened?

496
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:03,566
I had a bad dream.

497
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:06,703
Get in bed with Daddy.

498
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:16,442
What was your dream?

499
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:19,852
I don't want anyone to shoot Polly.

500
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:23,325
No one is going to do that, honey.

501
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,520
Yes. Mr. Brestwood said he would

502
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:28,598
because Polly ate one of his doves.

503
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:31,190
They're pigeons.

504
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:33,735
And he said this to you in your dream?

505
00:29:33,837 --> 00:29:36,965
No, he said it today
when Polly ate the birdie.

506
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:40,407
She wasn't hurt that bad.
She could fly.

507
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:46,245
No one is going to hurt Polly.

508
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:51,618
Good night, honey.

509
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:05,234
Now they can't play in the yard?

510
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:10,696
I'm going to get my robe on

511
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:12,798
and go over there
and find out what happened.

512
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:14,103
2 in the morning.

513
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:16,805
He's our neighbor. You'll make it worse.

514
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:19,404
I'll talk to him.

515
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:22,576
You should have Ethel talk to him.

516
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:24,916
Don, they play in the yard
when I'm here, too.

517
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:26,284
And she didn't tell you?

518
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm sure they didn't tell her.

519
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:32,195
They probably wouldn't
have told me, either.

520
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:37,123
There'll be over at Francine's
for the next shoot anyway.

521
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,667
It's one day.

522
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,804
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

523
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:47,934
Maybe not.

524
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,146
She'd never slept well.

525
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,215
That's not true.

526
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:02,117
Did you see those big tears?

527
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:07,321
I really want to get a picture
of her crying one day.

528
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:12,932
I have to say, Don,

529
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:15,766
Lucky Strike, even in this lawsuit,
is stronger than ever.

530
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:17,669
It was a brilliant campaign,

531
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:21,232
like some supersonic jet
flying right over the market.

532
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:29,545
I was there.
Great work.

533
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,679
Thank you.

534
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:35,883
Sorry to interrupt.
Who is responsible?

535
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,390
We've made a significant commitment

536
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:42,192
for as-yet unproduced
Secor laxative commercials.

537
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,698
This didn't go by me.

538
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,735
No, it went by Bob Wilkins
in Media, right to me.

539
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:48,828
Who is responsible?

540
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:54,303
Mr. Cooper, sir, it was me.

541
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:56,538
You thought of this?

542
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:58,580
Well, uh...

543
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:01,048
I bear some of the responsibility as well.

544
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,448
What did they do?

545
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:07,717
Every commercial block on air
in the Land of Lincoln

546
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:12,124
is clogged up with laxative buys.

547
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:15,892
And a little bit of Nixon time.

548
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:20,732
The Kennedy people won't know
what to do with themselves.

549
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:25,797
They're going to have
to put his pretty face on the radio.

550
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:27,604
And with that accent.

551
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:29,144
Nicely done.

552
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:32,079
I didn't think you had it in you,
and I mean that.

553
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:33,774
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

554
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:36,375
Inspired.

555
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:40,055
Congratulations, boys.

556
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,359
Peggy, you want to write that down?

557
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,691
Don said congratulations.

558
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:49,690
Are we done here?

559
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,823
No.

560
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,598
I really thought

561
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:59,732
it was going to go bad for a minute.

562
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:01,071
I was sure it would.

563
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,839
No kidding.
You almost let me detonate

564
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:04,573
a thousand feet from the ground.

565
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:06,649
So much for camaraderie.

566
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:10,183
Mr. Rumsen sent this over.

567
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,846
Unopened. Very nice.

568
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:17,051
Hildy, stay. Have a drink. It's an order.

569
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,252
No, thank you.

570
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:20,693
I'm going to my parents' after work.

571
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:23,027
You know, when something
good happens to me,

572
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,361
it also happens to you.

573
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,094
I know that.

574
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:28,296
I said congratulations.

575
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:30,999
You should do something
with that sour puss.

576
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,404
You're very beautiful.

577
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:37,205
Just being honest.

578
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:39,475
I love watching you walk.

579
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:42,350
I should go.

580
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:44,879
You should.

581
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:45,339
Is he in?

582
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:50,978
Always nice to see you.

583
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:54,823
I'd give you my assurance

584
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:56,755
that nothing good will happen to that boy,

585
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,158
but I can't seem
to keep my word on that,

586
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,286
hard as I try.

587
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:03,491
I might ask you to take me with you.

588
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,591
I see no reason to leave.

589
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,471
Or maybe I see a million.

590
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:12,973
A million? Is that
what it's going to cost me?

591
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:15,067
I was thinking more like 40.

592
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:16,839
45 is good.

593
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,721
I'm not going to be a little girl
and ask you why you stayed.

594
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:29,189
I know it's not money,

595
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:32,090
and I hope it's not to keep
your foot on Pete Campbell.

596
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:33,822
I like the way you do business.

597
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,728
Well, I try to be
as civilized as you can be.

598
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:39,125
No contract.

599
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:41,533
45 and no security.

600
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:43,230
What's in it for me?

601
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:50,870
If I leave this place one day,
it will not be for more advertising.

602
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,608
What else is there?

603
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:55,776
I don't know. Life being lived.

604
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,953
I'd like to stop talking about it
and get back to it.

605
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:02,047
I've worked with a lot of men like you,

606
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:06,561
and if you had to choose a place to die,
it would be in the middle of a pitch.

607
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:07,789
I've done that.

608
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:14,993
I want to do something else.

609
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:29,251
Jim Hobart, McCann Erickson.

610
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:30,410
Of course.

611
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,384
<i>Line 1.</i>

612
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,128
<i>Don,</i>

613
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:41,356
incredible pictures, am I wrong?

614
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:42,931
<i>No, you're not.</i>

615
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:44,897
So, your wife's already here with us.

616
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,127
I know she's happy.

617
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:47,464
Why don't you join her?

618
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,471
I don't know about that, Jim.

619
00:36:50,573 --> 00:36:51,972
You can do better than that.

620
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:54,236
You know what I'm offering here?

621
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,244
It's Yankee Stadium. I know.

622
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:59,577
<i>What, did Sterling come to the rescue?</i>

623
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:00,910
<i>If this is about money,</i>

624
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:03,577
<i>I have to say I might
have judged you wrong.</i>

625
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:05,017
It's not.

626
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,588
I'm surprised.

627
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:09,658
I thought your wife coming here
meant you were interested.

628
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:11,989
No, that was her idea.

629
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:14,393
Can't blame me for trying.

630
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,727
Maybe not, but, uh...

631
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,368
I can't exactly say
that was a big league move.

632
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:26,572
All's fair. No stone unturned, right?

633
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:31,470
<i>It's a pity to lose both of you.</i>

634
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:33,515
You're a very lucky man,
landing that woman.

635
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:47,593
What's going on with Mr. Draper?

636
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:51,292
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

637
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:52,698
Very good.

638
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:55,236
I've been meaning
to give this back to you.

639
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,862
I had it completely dry cleaned.

640
00:37:58,641 --> 00:37:59,801
Why don't you keep it?

641
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:02,241
Have it taken in here and let out there.

642
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:03,744
It's your dress.

643
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:06,873
Hot tea. That's a good idea.

644
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:09,577
What are you talking about?

645
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:16,555
Peggy, you are falling prey
to a very common situation for new girls.

646
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:18,058
I'm not new anymore.

647
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,685
Well, that's just it.

648
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,321
Don't you want to do well here?

649
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:27,927
I'm the first girl to do any writing
in this office since the war.

650
00:38:28,037 --> 00:38:29,197
Marge told me.

651
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:31,170
Writing?

652
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:32,605
Is that what this is about?

653
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:35,269
I thought you were doing that
to get close to Paul.

654
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:38,509
Thank you. Again.

655
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:43,642
I heard you were being
considered for an account

656
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,050
because a client's wife saw you

657
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,554
and thought it would be okay
if he worked with you.

658
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:49,284
You know, you're not a stick.

659
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:51,952
And yet I never wonder
what men think of me.

660
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:56,464
You're hiding a very attractive young girl
with too much lunch.

661
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,557
I know what men think of you:

662
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:02,536
That you're looking for a husband,
and you're fun,

663
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,834
and not in that order.

664
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:07,470
Peggy, this isn't China.

665
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,306
There's no money in virginity.

666
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,538
I'm not a virgin.

667
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:17,815
No. Of course not.

668
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:22,221
I just realized something.

669
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,828
You think you're being helpful.

670
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,366
Well, I am trying, dear.

671
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,035
I'm going home.

672
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,915
Did you have a good day?

673
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,111
I did. It was splendid.

674
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,781
Well, Betty, I have some good news
and some bad news.

675
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:57,482
There's bad news?

676
00:39:57,594 --> 00:40:00,722
The client's moving
the international work to London.

677
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh.

678
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:06,163
More Audrey Hepburn, less Grace Kelly.

679
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:07,258
I see.

680
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,530
As for us,

681
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:10,538
we're all going back to the malt shop.

682
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,235
The good news is you have two
wonderful sets of pictures

683
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:15,675
to start your book again.

684
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:17,268
That's true.

685
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,245
I really am sorry.

686
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:22,750
This was fun.

687
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:25,377
You can keep the dress
and the hairstyle.

688
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,388
I don't do that for everyone.

689
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:32,558
Oh, honey,

690
00:40:32,662 --> 00:40:35,153
it has nothing to do with you.

691
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,876
Thank you.

692
00:40:58,821 --> 00:40:59,913
What do you think, Paul?

693
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,422
Should we move this whole thing

694
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:02,422
down to MacDougal Street?

695
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,083
We're doing great here.

696
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,259
It's good she left.

697
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,665
It probably wasn't
going to happen for her tonight.

698
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,203
It depends how much we drink.

699
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:18,169
How drunk do you have to be?

700
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:21,909
My brother works at the Exchange.

701
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:24,411
They call a girl like her a lobster.

702
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:25,947
All the meat's in the tail.

703
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,150
Are they giving you guys a bonus?

704
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:40,318
Would you calm down?

705
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:43,961
Come on!

706
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,760
Drop you at the station?

707
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:50,236
Sure.

708
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:05,119
Campbell, you sucker-punched me.

709
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:06,449
What is wrong with you?

710
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:08,815
Come on.

711
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:15,021
You just had a fight,

712
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:17,622
and I was not part of it.

713
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:22,103
Either you two make up,
or I do not stand a chance tonight.

714
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,071
Perfect timing.

715
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:35,773
The children are down,

716
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:38,479
but only because they were
running around all day.

717
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:40,613
They fell asleep in front of the TV.

718
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:42,782
How did it go today?

719
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:45,258
Good. Fun.

720
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:48,626
They were talking about a whole string
of other possibilities for me.

721
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:55,101
But honestly,
I don't think I want to work anymore.

722
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:02,500
I don't like you coming home to some...
whipped-together mess

723
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:05,843
of whatever's left in the fridge.

724
00:43:05,948 --> 00:43:11,045
And frankly, I don't like
Manhattan on my own.

725
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:13,546
It's harsh.

726
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:19,519
It can be.

727
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:21,324
And what am I going to do?

728
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,830
Run around the city with my book,

729
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:26,697
like some teenager,
making a fool of myself?

730
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,496
If that's what you want,

731
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:33,973
and it's my job
to give you what you want.

732
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:35,304
You do.

733
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:40,078
Look at all this.

734
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:43,883
I don't know what I was thinking.

735
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:54,122
Birdie, you know I don't care

736
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:00,465
about making my dinner
or... taking in my shirts.

737
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,094
You have a job.

738
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,834
You're mother to those two little people,

739
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,877
and you are better at it
than anyone else in the world.

740
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,781
At least in the top 500.

741
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:26,459
I would have given anything
to have had a mother like you.

742
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:30,792
Beautiful and kind...

743
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,892
filled with love like an angel.

744
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:36,904
You're sweet.

745
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:56,020
And this does not taste whipped-up.

746
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:59,617
No. It's good, isn't it?

747
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:14,607
Have a good day, Daddy.

748
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,608
You, too.

749
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:16,769
Have a good day.

750
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:19,780
We're going to the community center
to watch them fill the pool.

751
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:21,110
That sounds fun.

752
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:23,183
Have a good day.

753
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:24,753
I already am.

754
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:32,918
Mommy, I'm eating.

755
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:50,871
Be careful.
Don't jump off the bed.

756
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,244
Okay!

757
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:27,714
Mrs. Draper,
what the hell are you doing?

758
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:31,478
Mrs. Draper!
