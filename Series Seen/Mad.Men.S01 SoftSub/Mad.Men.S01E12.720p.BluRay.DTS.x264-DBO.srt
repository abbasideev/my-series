1
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,698
<i>America is still going
to the polls at 4:00.</i>

2
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,209
<i>With some precincts opening
as early as 12 this morning,</i>

3
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:47,835
<i>voters across the country are deciding</i>

4
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:50,437
<i>who will hold the most important
office in the fr...</i>

5
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:01,152
Herman Phillips, Bert Cooper.

6
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,023
Actually, "Herman" goes on my checks.

7
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:04,356
People call me Duck.

8
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:06,294
My research says I was not to call you Duck.

9
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:07,558
You should have told me that.

10
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,657
I don't know. I like when you say Herman.

11
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:13,934
Herman was in London with Y&R.

12
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,802
Isn't this a step down?

13
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:16,805
I don't know.

14
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,069
Moving back to the power center
of the universe, New York,

15
00:01:19,177 --> 00:01:21,236
and the chance to put on some weight.

16
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:24,975
English food. I actually ate a kidney.

17
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,846
He landed American Airlines.

18
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:29,045
You could make something
like that happen here.

19
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:31,019
Well, you have to
spend money to make money.

20
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,681
So you're not promising anything.

21
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,258
Why would I do that?

22
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:38,728
My goodness, he does want this job.

23
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,890
I hope you play your cards
close to the vest with clients.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,763
I will keep that in mind.

25
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,632
Here's a test. Who'd you vote for?

26
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:48,706
If I say Nixon, you'll think
I'm buttering you.

27
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:51,002
If I say Kennedy,
you'll want to reform me.

28
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,509
So, uh, I'll say Nixon.

29
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,080
That's nice to see.

30
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,423
Cooper has a smoker
at The Waldorf at 6:00.

31
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:09,425
Marge told me.

32
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:10,517
23 skidoo.

33
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,360
At 6:15, we turn on the returns
and send for some ice.

34
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,058
Party at the in-laws'.

35
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,760
Another ending to a perfect day.

36
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:20,337
<i>Well, Jennifer and I were going
to get tickets to Can-Can.</i>

37
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,633
It's empty, you know.

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,368
She says apparently the phone company
is a war zone on election night.

39
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:25,807
That's what I'm
hoping for around here.

40
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:28,243
Although, You better hope that
she's sitting at her switchboard

41
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,110
and not doing what we're doing.

42
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:31,580
It's my wife.

43
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,914
Besides, what if Nixon loses?

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,351
Won't that put a damper
on things around here?

45
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,355
Who cares? They didn't want our help.

46
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:39,617
You should care.

47
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,888
I do. It matters for the nation
and for Sterling Coop.

48
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:44,757
But tonight, either way.

49
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,330
If Nixon wins, we win.

50
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:47,728
If Nixon loses...

51
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,235
let me console you.

52
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,871
That's him.

53
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,412
Duck Phillips.

54
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,776
I know his name.

55
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,406
Because it's Duck?

56
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,118
I grew up with a Tuck.

57
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:12,053
At least that has an air of dignity.

58
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:14,421
Don took him to Cooper. That's a first.

59
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,619
I heard he disintegrated in London.

60
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:20,323
Got involved with some woman
he met at the British Museum.

61
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:21,990
Her name was Rosetta.

62
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,897
Rosetta Stone.

63
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,066
He's divorced. Lives in a hotel.

64
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:31,700
So what's this? His last stop?

65
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,244
No. He's a killer, but he's...
he's damaged goods.

66
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,438
They're bargain hunting.

67
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:37,378
He's the best one
Draper's paraded around.

68
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:40,781
Let's see if Cooper's
smart enough to know that.

69
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,720
Can I help you?

70
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:48,292
What?

71
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,122
Can I help you?

72
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,893
Mr. Campbell would like to see you.

73
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,135
<i>Send him in.</i>

74
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:58,862
Thank you, sweetheart.

75
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:10,272
So that Duck fellow,

76
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,350
I heard he fell apart in London.

77
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,078
American Airlines.

78
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:16,177
$7 million in billings.

79
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,756
He's not going to bring that with him.

80
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:26,762
Listen, Don, I don't feel you've taken me
seriously as a candidate.

81
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,127
Candidate for what?

82
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,669
For the head of account services.

83
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,499
We may have had our differences,

84
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,664
but Roger knows I've done everything
I could to emulate him.

85
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,605
Roger's not involved in this.

86
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,108
Anything else?

87
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:42,146
I have the loyalty
of our most important clients:

88
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,044
Calvin Highland, Lee Garner.

89
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,707
These men trust me.

90
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,546
They invite me
to their grandchildren's christenings.

91
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,620
When Walter Veidt needed a urologist,

92
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,313
he called me
for a recommendation.

93
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:55,792
Look, you're good at your job.
Cooper loves you.

94
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,054
What's the hurry?

95
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,459
It's been two and a half years.

96
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,258
I could have jumped
ship a hundred times.

97
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:02,424
Is that supposed to persuade me?

98
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,603
I have tremendous value
to this company.

99
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:09,230
I'm aware of that.

100
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,603
But I don't think you are.

101
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,270
I am. I just hope you realize
that, the way things stand,

102
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,404
there will continue to be
someone senior to you.

103
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,504
Why?

104
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,208
What can they offer?

105
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:26,153
All I'm asking is that you think about it.

106
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:29,659
There are men younger than me
with this job at bigger firms.

107
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,660
Cooper sign off on what's-his-name?

108
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:34,754
Duck?

109
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll keep you posted.

110
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,070
He's got a big lead.

111
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,239
See you at the victory
party in the morning.

112
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:52,247
Absolutely.

113
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,443
Well, good night, Don.

114
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,620
He's gone!

115
00:05:57,722 --> 00:05:59,587
Olly olly oxen free!

116
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,154
- Do it.
- All rightie.

117
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:06,196
- Who's got the cups?
- Oh. Sorry.

118
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:09,062
<i>With early returns just coming in,</i>

119
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:13,001
<i>our NBC computer is putting
Senator Kennedy's odds for victory</i>

120
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,265
<i>at a grim-sounding 22-1.</i>

121
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:22,645
This is not good.

122
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,237
And liquor stores are closed tonight.

123
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,146
Draper has plenty of booze.

124
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:33,180
We could ask her to join us.

125
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,350
That might soften her up a bit.

126
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,519
I have a bottle of absinthe in my office.

127
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:38,687
Isn't that illegal?

128
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:39,855
It's marvelous.

129
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,899
I become incantatory.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,467
And what does that mean?

131
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,229
It means he starts making up words.

132
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:46,998
Can someone freshen this?

133
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,769
We're not going to make it.

134
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,036
Really?

135
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:59,107
If I let you into that supply closet,
it is not going to be the sack of Rome.

136
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:02,243
What do we have too much of?

137
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:05,084
Rum, creme de menthe,

138
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,521
dog biscuits.

139
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,964
May the best man win.

140
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:18,524
In matters national and... local.

141
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,306
<i>...majority decision of the American...</i>

142
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,834
<i>I made my judgment long ago.</i>

143
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,413
Stop that. You're going to break it.

144
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:32,108
Look. They're doing math.

145
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,809
What do the numbers say?

146
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,250
Who the president is going to be.

147
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,717
Hello.

148
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,158
Daddy! Hi!

149
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,230
I wasn't expecting you.

150
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,825
I thought you were going to be
watching returns at the office.

151
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:53,426
What are you doing up?

152
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,335
Mommy said it was okay.

153
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,499
I'm watching the news.

154
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,236
Nixon definitely won our precinct.

155
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,675
You should have seen the line.

156
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,247
Mommy said to ask you. What's the...

157
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,441
Electoral College.

158
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,647
I don't think that's a conversation
appropriate for children.

159
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:12,154
Come here.

160
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,918
Do you want something to eat?

161
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,494
I'm going to fix a drink. You?

162
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:19,062
I'm set.

163
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,530
<i>Senator Kennedy seems
to be closing the gap</i>

164
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,466
<i>on the vice president's early lead.</i>

165
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,437
<i>State-by-state, Ohio, Illinois...</i>

166
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:32,400
Come here.

167
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,704
What?

168
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:36,610
You better run.

169
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,307
Go, Allison!

170
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:40,916
White!

171
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,316
Pink!

172
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,420
You can tell me, or I can find out.

173
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:52,826
What color panties are you wearing?

174
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:54,762
What? Oh, my G...

175
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,228
Blue!

176
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:02,931
Who had blue?

177
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:08,945
Can I walk you home?

178
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:18,082
I used to think I'd find a husband here.

179
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,748
I think I'm going to go home.

180
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,157
No, don't go. It's going to be fun.

181
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,133
What are you doing?

182
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:06,567
Why aren't you asleep?

183
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:07,899
What is that?

184
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,633
Nothing.

185
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,139
Myrna found it on the top of the closet,

186
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,905
and I didn't want to look at it.

187
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,650
My father has a box like that,

188
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:23,277
and I looked at it when I was a little girl,

189
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,480
and it was a mistake.

190
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,420
So you didn't open it?

191
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:29,516
Peter, I don't want secrets.

192
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:34,392
I can't sleep.

193
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,399
I know.

194
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,800
I've seen it the last few weeks.

195
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,303
You're not very quiet,

196
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,397
and every time I see
the closet door is open

197
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,305
and that box is gone,
I know you're out here.

198
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,403
And you never looked in the box?

199
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:51,744
It's not yours.

200
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,078
What are you doing with it?

201
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:54,378
I got it by mistake.

202
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,350
So give it back.

203
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:59,184
It's peculiar.

204
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,258
It's not yours.

205
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,388
Come to bed.

206
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:16,565
<i>Vice President Nixon
seems to have carried</i>

207
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:19,165
<i>predominantly Catholic
Hudson County, New Jersey.</i>

208
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,006
Kinsey, you're a liar.

209
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:23,307
I couldn't find any absinthe.

210
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:25,143
Who said you could go in my office?

211
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,218
We were exploring.

212
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:31,049
<i>But all we found was
a large collection of Mad magazines</i>

213
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:35,148
and this fascinating dramatic piece.

214
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,956
<i>Death is My Client... Whoa.</i>

215
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:41,031
A play in one act by Paul Kinsey.

216
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,190
Give it to me.

217
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:45,597
"Peter Tollifson"...

218
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:49,206
"An animal in the board room
and the bedroom. "

219
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:50,604
- Kenny!
- Whoa!

220
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,802
Now, remember, he's angry.

221
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,472
Why do I have to play Tollifson?

222
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:58,708
I wanted to be Galt.

223
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,410
Tollifson is the hero. He thinks.

224
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,588
Galt's a thug born on the wrong
side of the tracks.

225
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,385
You don't want to be Galt.

226
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,793
Go ahead.

227
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,525
I'm sorry. I don't have the pages.

228
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,163
Oh. Sorry.

229
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,001
Um, "I worked with Tollifson for four years.

230
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,302
I shared everything,
but I never knew him. "

231
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,173
"I thought I knew him.

232
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,269
He used to talk to me. "

233
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,211
"I can't control my genius.

234
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,648
I'm not some boorish natural
like that hack Cosgrove. "

235
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,020
That's crackerjack, Kinsey.

236
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,890
"Your genius be damned. "

237
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,427
"Perhaps. "

238
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,554
"You can make anyone buy anything.

239
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:49,155
Anyone but me. "

240
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,168
Turn the music down.

241
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:29,398
<i>We now have confirmation</i>

242
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:35,309
<i>that the State of Ohio has indeed gone
to Vice President Richard Nixon.</i>

243
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:39,850
<i>Its 25 electoral votes
will go in Mr. Nixon's purse.</i>

244
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,196
I'm...

245
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,357
I'm really tipsy.

246
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,042
I feel awful.

247
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,680
No, no. Uh... it was me.

248
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,759
I'm... I'm drunk.

249
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:28,621
I'm happy... but not myself.

250
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,800
I've never really
seen your eyes before.

251
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,975
There they are.

252
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,341
Just the two of them.

253
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:57,088
<i>As Vice President Nixon's
home state of California</i>

254
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,856
<i>continues to count ballots,</i>

255
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,397
<i>both candidates bid
their supporters a good night.</i>

256
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,933
<i>Vice presidential hopeful
Senator Lyndon Johnson</i>

257
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:06,026
<i>had these words:</i>

258
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,867
<i>I'm very proud of the manner</i>

259
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,565
<i>in which the Democratic
campaign has been conducted</i>

260
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,540
<i>and which the people have reacted,</i>

261
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:16,135
<i>particularly in my state,
the entire South,</i>

262
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:17,145
<i>and in many states...</i>

263
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,545
What's going on?

264
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,617
<i>- I don't know.
... feel, uh, very confident...</i>

265
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:21,878
It'll be all right in the morning.

266
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:22,918
He'll win California.

267
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,851
<i>...the counting that...</i>

268
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:25,945
Turn it off.

269
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:27,081
<i>All Americans will be proud,</i>

270
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,954
<i>and I think we have
much to be proud of.</i>

271
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,255
<i>I think this is one
of America's finest hours.</i>

272
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,867
Sit down.

273
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,703
No.

274
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,677
You can't sit down in that dress.

275
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:57,179
You look so different
when you're drunk.

276
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,722
You're not going to call me
Orson Welles again.

277
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:00,984
You loved that.

278
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,957
Who wouldn't like that?

279
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,162
What did I do wrong?

280
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,901
You have a big mouth.

281
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,132
Joan, I never said...

282
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,798
You have a big mouth.

283
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,109
I do.

284
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:25,876
I'm not proud of it.

285
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,282
Did you like the play?

286
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:32,682
No.

287
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:39,527
The meaner you are, the more I like you.

288
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,188
I know.

289
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,570
Just like that?

290
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,237
I thought we could dance.

291
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:13,189
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.

292
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:33,550
Hildy, wake up.

293
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,346
Mm, it's cold in here.

294
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,785
It is. You have to get dressed.

295
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,866
I can't find my glasses.

296
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,702
That's too bad.

297
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,642
Tremendous.

298
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:12,821
Harry?

299
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:15,550
Yes?

300
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:20,521
I hope I didn't step on them.

301
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:27,863
Damn it.

302
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:37,505
There's an optometrist on Lexington.

303
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,140
Great. Of course.

304
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,763
I don't want you to be worried.

305
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,458
It didn't mean anything, okay?

306
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,611
You're not drinking for taste.

307
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,239
Don't be such babies.

308
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,149
Oh, God.

309
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,053
It's definitely not helping.

310
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,592
I'm sorry. Does it offend you?

311
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:06,632
My shirt. And my mad money.
Who did this?

312
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:08,864
I stole your blouse.

313
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:11,032
I'm not joking. I had $3.00 in here.

314
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:14,339
If I give you $3.00,
will you keep your voice down?

315
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:16,606
You're animals.

316
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,342
I'm reporting it to building security.

317
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,977
Striking resemblance
to Broderick Crawford.

318
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,817
Peggy Olsen, Highway Patrol.

319
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:40,463
I've read three different newspapers
with three different results.

320
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,129
I'm sure you know something I don't.

321
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:47,233
Well, I just spent the night literally
in a smoke-filled room at The Waldorf

322
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:52,043
with every Republican luminary
save MacArthur and Jesus.

323
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,014
There's been widespread fraud.

324
00:20:54,118 --> 00:21:00,421
Daley gave Joe Kennedy
every corpse in Cook County.

325
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,958
Otherwise, Nixon wins.

326
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,187
It shouldn't have been that close.

327
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,287
But it is. It always is.

328
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,128
Those jingles.

329
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,668
When they got Frank Sinatra,

330
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,328
I knew they would close the gap.

331
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:16,963
So what does he do now?

332
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,371
Walk away? Concede?

333
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:22,435
A recount in Illinois alone
means 30 days without a president.

334
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,138
You don't want to win like that.

335
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:26,375
But you want to win.

336
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,850
He got 50% of the vote, maybe more.

337
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,784
This way he lives to see another day.

338
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,981
So... what happens?

339
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,551
Neil from P&G said if Kennedy
is willing to buy an election,

340
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:42,325
he's probably willing to play ball with us.

341
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,628
Ah, the optimism
of the American corporation.

342
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,566
It's a football game to them.

343
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,864
Doesn't seem fair.

344
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:48,939
Fair?

345
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,300
Very good.

346
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:02,448
Where do you think you're going?

347
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:03,713
If I were you,

348
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,448
I would be very,
very careful from now on

349
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:07,421
about the way you speak to me.

350
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,924
Can I help you?

351
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,231
What's that?

352
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:18,995
It's yours.

353
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,537
It came to me by mistake.

354
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,833
Well, thanks.

355
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,172
Have you reconsidered
my qualifications

356
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,142
for the head of account services?

357
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:31,681
Would it disappoint you
if I told you it hadn't crossed my mind?

358
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,894
I feel strange having
to talk to you in this way.

359
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:55,531
Spit it out, Campbell.

360
00:22:57,174 --> 00:22:59,972
I know that your name
is not Donald Draper.

361
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,477
It's Dick Whitman.

362
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:11,251
I don't know who Donald Draper is,

363
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:14,620
but according to my friend Russ
at the Department of Defense,

364
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:17,125
Dick Whitman died in Korea in 1950,

365
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:19,525
and Donald Draper dropped off the map.

366
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,063
Although he's 43 years old,

367
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,633
in which case
you look remarkably good.

368
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:26,500
That's kind of elaborate.

369
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:28,572
Really?

370
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:31,140
I wish I knew more.

371
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,868
I bet a lot of people do.

372
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:36,242
Pete...

373
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:37,575
get out.

374
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,114
You're making a fool of yourself.

375
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:42,049
You can deny it.

376
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:43,619
But I know it's true.

377
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,018
I can see from your face.

378
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,948
You should leave.

379
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,152
Don...

380
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,128
you should think about
how Bert Cooper will react

381
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:55,630
when he hears this information.

382
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:56,665
What information?

383
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,634
You're not who you say you are,

384
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:02,501
and there's obviously a reason.

385
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:04,301
Come on.

386
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:09,573
I would like you
to reconsider my qualifications.

387
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,959
You said everything except "or else. "

388
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:33,064
Assuming this information
is true, which it isn't,

389
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,468
it sounds to me like
you're blackmailing me.

390
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:36,903
I'm not.

391
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:44,210
I'm hoping you'll realize
that this all can be forgotten.

392
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:49,181
It's not like you're a deserter, is it?

393
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:52,221
When you threaten someone
in this manner,

394
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,256
you should be aware of the fact

395
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,155
that if your information
is powerful enough

396
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,160
to make them do what you want...

397
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,464
what else can it make them do?

398
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:04,859
It's very simple.

399
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:07,960
And it's not a threat. It's just a job.

400
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,237
Think about it.

401
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,420
Whitman.

402
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:06,723
Yes, Sergeant.

403
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:11,126
What is this?

404
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,964
This is it.

405
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,235
One? I'm supposed to have 20.

406
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,400
This is going to take a month,
and it should take 48 hours.

407
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,035
Well, you're whining to the wrong guy, sir.

408
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:40,822
At ease.

409
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,226
Uh, this is for officers.

410
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:46,825
You can bunk next door.

411
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:48,905
I- I'd introduce you to the men,

412
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:52,533
but you're looking
at the complete company.

413
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:54,008
Where is everybody, sir?

414
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:56,705
They were gone when I got here.

415
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,475
I'm an engineer.

416
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:00,846
They're in some action
5 miles over that mountain.

417
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,714
You want to go?

418
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,152
The answer is no.

419
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:08,418
The locals stopped
showing up three days ago,

420
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:10,720
which, by the way, is not good.

421
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:13,262
You're going to be doing all the digging.

422
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:14,557
Digging what?

423
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:17,725
Well, this unit... that's you...

424
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:20,429
will be establishing a field hospital,

425
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:24,906
but first we're going to be digging
fighting positions on four sides.

426
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,405
What are you doing here?
Are you poor?

427
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,209
I volunteered.

428
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:34,409
You're kidding me.

429
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,509
Well, they got me with college.

430
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:41,886
But I'm three years,
six months nearly a civilian.

431
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:46,190
I'm supposed to be building
swimming pools, not latrines.

432
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:47,957
You any good with that rifle?

433
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:50,431
I wouldn't want you
to mistake me for Chinese.

434
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:53,264
As much practice as I've had, yes.

435
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,199
What misconception
traveled down the road

436
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:00,867
and made you want to be here?

437
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:01,876
A movie?

438
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:04,379
No. I just wanted to leave.

439
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:08,076
I'll bet you're reconsidering
if this was a step up.

440
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:41,544
<i>Miss Menken,</i>

441
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:44,246
<i>Mr. Draper is here to see you.</i>

442
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,952
Please hold my calls.

443
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,629
Did you run over? You're flushed.

444
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:17,447
Let's go away.

445
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:19,317
Really? Where?

446
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:20,754
Anywhere.

447
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:22,449
Warmer weather?

448
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,686
Sure.

449
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,126
How about Los Angeles?

450
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:28,424
Mexico? I have money.

451
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:31,296
I have money, but I have a store to run.

452
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:37,770
Don, are you well?

453
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:39,341
No, I'm not.

454
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:42,742
Did something else happen to Roger?

455
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,780
No.

456
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:47,782
Something happened, and...

457
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:50,045
I want to go, and I want you
to come with me,

458
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:52,212
and I don't want to come back.

459
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:53,380
What happened?

460
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,459
What does it matter?
Isn't this what you want?

461
00:29:58,161 --> 00:30:01,722
Of course. I've thought about it.

462
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:04,357
My God, we've talked about it.

463
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:05,765
I just...

464
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:08,497
I just didn't think it would happen...

465
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:10,766
I mean, especially this way.

466
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:16,473
I just... don't want to be without you,

467
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,946
and I don't want to be here.

468
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,983
I can't just leave.

469
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:27,520
Maybe this weekend...

470
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:28,591
Rachel.

471
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:39,960
No. This isn't how
I thought it would be.

472
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,435
What is the difference?

473
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:43,563
We'll go somewhere else.

474
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:45,607
We'll start over like Adam and Eve.

475
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,200
What, are you 15 years old?

476
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:50,074
My father...

477
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,772
Can't we be together here?

478
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:53,179
There's nothing here.

479
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,343
What about your children?

480
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:59,217
I'll provide for them.

481
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:01,483
And live in Los Angeles?

482
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:06,219
My God, you haven't
thought this through.

483
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:07,887
I feel sick.

484
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,625
You're wrong. I know exactly what I want.

485
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,133
You want your children
to go on without a father?

486
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,566
You know how that felt.

487
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,661
Are you having an attack
of conscience after all this?

488
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:18,240
No. I'm watching you talk

489
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:20,241
because I feel I don't know you.

490
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:25,006
You know more about me
than anyone.

491
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:27,675
You won't even tell me what happened.

492
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,054
Why are you doing this to me?

493
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,889
What kind of man are you?

494
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:43,022
Go away, drop everything, leave your life?

495
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,896
People do it every day.

496
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:51,166
- This was a dalliance, a cheap affair.
- Rachel, don't.

497
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:52,707
You don't want to run away with me.

498
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,777
You just want to run away.

499
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,880
You're a coward.

500
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:03,682
Please go now.

501
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:07,446
Get out.

502
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:45,658
Peggy, this is my office.

503
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:46,990
Does this door mean nothing to you?

504
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:48,689
I'm sorry, Mr. Draper.

505
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:50,425
I didn't know you were coming back. I just...

506
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:56,230
I just...

507
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,236
Calm down.

508
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,813
Stop it.

509
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:13,515
I didn't mean to yell at you.

510
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:16,251
Got to be some semblance
of privacy left here.

511
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,686
I had to get away from them all
for a minute.

512
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:25,598
Drink this.

513
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:40,475
Sonny from the elevator
and some janitor... I don't know his name...

514
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:42,313
they got fired.

515
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,444
That's why you're crying?

516
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:47,022
It was my fault.

517
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:48,920
I called security.

518
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:52,621
They weren't even here last night.

519
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:57,424
Peggy, I need to be alone right now.

520
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:59,263
I know.

521
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:03,733
I know.

522
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,207
I don't understand.

523
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:10,779
I try to do my job.

524
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,939
I follow the rules,

525
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:15,711
and people hate me.

526
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:19,220
Innocent people get hurt, and...

527
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,756
and other people...

528
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:24,656
people who are not good...

529
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:27,457
get to walk around
doing whatever they want.

530
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,832
It's not fair.

531
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,094
Finish it.

532
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:21,276
I've thought about what you said.

533
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:23,614
Glad to hear it.

534
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,517
And then I thought about you

535
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:28,022
and what a deep lack
of character you have.

536
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:35,731
I can understand your frustration, Don.

537
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:37,857
Believe me, I'm not enjoying this
any more than you are.

538
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,628
I'm hiring Duck Phillips.

539
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:42,568
Don...

540
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:45,038
don't make me go to Cooper.

541
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:46,972
I'm not making you do anything.

542
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,977
You haven't thought this through.

543
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,637
- I have.
- Really?

544
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:53,944
You're just going to go up to the office
and tell Bert Cooper.

545
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,109
If I have to. I don't want to.

546
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:57,686
Let me ask you.

547
00:35:57,787 --> 00:36:01,518
How do you think he'll react
when you tell him this story of yours?

548
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:04,684
You expect him to promote you
after the way you've behaved?

549
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:06,421
I think he'll appreciate the loyalty.

550
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:09,123
You haven't thought this through.

551
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:13,795
I don't know.

552
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:16,565
But I'm pretty sure
you won't be working here anymore.

553
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:31,047
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

554
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:33,054
I'm going to take care of this right now.

555
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:34,646
Is this like in the movies
where I have a gun

556
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:36,157
and you don't think
I'm going to shoot you?

557
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:37,487
I will shoot you.

558
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,255
I won't let you hold this over my head.

559
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:42,195
So you'd rather blow yourself up
than make me head of accounts.

560
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:54,837
Why can't you give me what I want?

561
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:56,241
I've earned this job. I deserve it.

562
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:58,041
Why? Because your parents are rich?

563
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:01,777
Because you went to prep school
and have a $5.00 haircut?

564
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,113
You've been given everything.

565
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,119
You've never worked
for anything in your life.

566
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:08,315
For gosh sakes, don't you realize
you're going to lose everything?

567
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:10,256
I'm giving you a way out.

568
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,691
Would it be so bad?

569
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:13,888
Why is this so hard for you?

570
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:27,867
You're really going to do this?

571
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,011
More bad news?

572
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,178
If you came here
to drown your sorrows,

573
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:40,256
I'm not really much of a drinker.

574
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:42,153
No. I just wanted to say...

575
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:45,551
I'm pulling the trigger
on Duck Phillips

576
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:47,152
as new head of account services.

577
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:50,699
Oh, good. Well done.

578
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:01,911
What?

579
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:07,644
I have to bring this up to you.

580
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,241
Only because I believe
if I kept it from you

581
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,685
in the end it would be
damaging to Sterling Cooper.

582
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,757
It has come to my attention,
completely by accident,

583
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,727
that Donald Draper here
is not who he says he is.

584
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:22,923
His real name is Dick Whitman,

585
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:27,093
but... Dick Whitman
died in Korea ten years ago.

586
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:32,903
It stands to reason
that he is a deserter at the very least

587
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:34,442
and who knows what else.

588
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:01,232
Mr. Campbell, who cares?

589
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:04,840
What?

590
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:06,499
Who cares?

591
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:09,442
Mr. Cooper, he's a fraud and a liar.

592
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:10,604
A criminal, even.

593
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:14,379
Even if this were true, who cares?

594
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:18,147
This country was built and run
by men with worse stories

595
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:20,415
than whatever you've imagined here.

596
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:22,753
I'm not imagining anything.

597
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:29,723
The Japanese have a saying:

598
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:32,630
A man is whatever room he is in,

599
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:37,297
and right now Donald Draper
is in this room.

600
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,773
I assure you,

601
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:43,812
there's more profit in forgetting this.

602
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:46,643
I'd put your energy
into bringing in accounts.

603
00:39:56,826 --> 00:39:58,191
Don,

604
00:39:58,294 --> 00:40:01,752
fire him if you want.

605
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:05,356
But I'd keep an eye on him.

606
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:09,063
One never knows how loyalty is born.

607
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:33,662
Shit!

608
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:37,592
Sir, what do we do?

609
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,632
Keep your head.

610
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:39,633
Don't shoot at anything

611
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:41,101
unless it shoots at you first.

612
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:46,664
What? What? What?

613
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,266
Shut up! Just stay down!

614
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:49,538
Shit!

615
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:51,238
Don't they know this is a hospital?

616
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:53,747
We're nuts if they know that.

617
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:05,294
Is it over?

618
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:06,657
I don't know.

619
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,808
- You think they'll be back?
- I don't know.

620
00:41:23,913 --> 00:41:25,881
We didn't shoot back. That helps.

621
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:32,545
You pissed yourself.

622
00:41:34,123 --> 00:41:35,852
What?

623
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,255
Did I?

624
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:40,860
Crap.

625
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:09,919
How are we doing, Lieutenant Draper?

626
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:21,632
On behalf of the President
of the United States

627
00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:24,605
and the citizens
of the United States of America...

628
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:31,474
I present you with
this Purple Heart medal.

629
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,276
The concussion was minor.

630
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:35,612
You'll feel like yourself in a week.

631
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:43,859
The colonel here
has some good news for you.

632
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,929
We're releasing you to the Reserves
for your last 80 days.

633
00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:48,929
You're going home.

634
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:59,299
That's good news.
You're going to be okay.

635
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:06,973
Lieutenant Draper,

636
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,914
Private Whitman.

637
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:12,112
You were the last person who knew him
in his chain of command.

638
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:14,519
We'd like you to take him home.

639
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,293
I think it would mean something.

640
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,335
Lieutenant Nelson, how you doing?

641
00:43:31,774 --> 00:43:33,765
On behalf of the President
of the United States

642
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:35,901
and the citizens of
the United States of America...

643
00:43:43,786 --> 00:43:45,048
Bunbury.

644
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:50,485
This is us, Lieutenant.

645
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:20,545
Lieutenant Draper?

646
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:24,686
Just go.

647
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:28,086
I can't.

648
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,062
Okay.

649
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:44,970
There he is! I see him!

650
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:46,343
Who?

651
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:47,882
Dick. He's on the train.

652
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:48,882
I see him.

653
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:50,680
No, he's right here.

654
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:52,310
But I saw him.

655
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:53,445
I saw him in the window over there.

656
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:56,548
Stop it. No more of that.

657
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:00,186
It must be hard for you.

658
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:01,558
Did you know him?

659
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:05,525
A little.

660
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:08,229
You got your whole life ahead of you.

661
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:09,929
Forget that boy in the box.

662
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,409
Look at you.

663
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:19,180
Let me buy a soldier a drink.

664
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,053
Dick!

665
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:24,638
<i>With that, I want to say again</i>

666
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:28,615
<i>my deep thanks
to all of you who are here</i>

667
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:32,210
<i>and those who have listened
on television and radio,</i>

668
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:36,348
<i>and again my congratulations
to Senator Kennedy</i>

669
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:39,292
<i>for his fine race in this campaign,</i>

670
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:41,886
<i>and to all of you...</i>

671
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:45,392
<i>I am sure...</i>

672
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:46,729
<i>I am sure his supporters</i>

673
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:48,599
<i>are just as enthusiastic
as you are for me,</i>

674
00:46:48,704 --> 00:46:50,569
<i>and I thank you for that.</i>
