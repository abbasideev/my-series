1
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,206
This will look good in your office.

2
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,848
What, take that thing on the train,
like some kid who won at the 4-H?

3
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:59,255
Besides, no one wants to look
like they care about awards.

4
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,087
But you do.

5
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:05,322
Isn't that sad?

6
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:08,793
Roger was very eloquent.

7
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:14,269
He likes to be recognized for selling.

8
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:16,864
Creative is less important.

9
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,967
Creative helps sell.

10
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:21,875
But he gave the speech.

11
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:26,175
Look at you in this tuxedo.

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,111
Say it for me.

13
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:32,690
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Draper.

14
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,315
Enchanted.

15
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,407
Hey.

16
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,269
It's 8:00.

17
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,241
Shit.

18
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,448
Oh, my Lord.

19
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:40,647
Mommy, Mommy!
Ethel's downstairs.

20
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,420
She's making us breakfast.

21
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:44,188
Sally, Mommy has a headache.

22
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,560
What's that thing?

23
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,189
Daddy's boss won an award.

24
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,063
Daddy won one, too.

25
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,897
An award for good horses?

26
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:55,131
Go downstairs and eat something.

27
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:01,244
I think there's Alka-Seltzer in the kitchen.

28
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:05,650
Are you okay?

29
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,275
Yeah, just do it in the kitchen.

30
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,445
I don't want to hear the bubbles.

31
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,693
Congratulations, Mr. Draper.

32
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:25,827
Thank you.

33
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:28,201
<i>I hear Advertising Age ran a picture.</i>

34
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,171
Fortunately, no one reads that.

35
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,441
That's really amazing.

36
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:38,413
I'll get Mr. Campbell and Mr. Kinsey.

37
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:41,042
They wanted you to know
they were waiting, but they left.

38
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,450
That's rude.

39
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:47,722
They said something about
the Newkie Award going to your head.

40
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:49,225
Congratulations, by the way.

41
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:50,555
Thank you.

42
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:51,890
Congratulations to you, too.

43
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:53,055
Thank you, Peggy.

44
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:56,157
Congratulations for what, being the only one
on time for this meeting?

45
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:59,294
Oh, I was just telling Peggy
I got a short story published.

46
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:00,962
Good for you.

47
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,438
<i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

48
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,169
Look at that.

49
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:06,608
Congratulations.

50
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:07,939
Thank you.

51
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:09,911
What does that have to do with you, Kenny?

52
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:13,178
"Tapping a Maple
on a Cold Vermont Morning. "

53
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:17,016
<i>Cosgrove here got a story published
in The, uh... The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

54
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,721
- Heavy.
- You're kidding.

55
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,622
I look forward to reading it.

56
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:22,988
Keep it. I've got copies.

57
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:27,053
Congrats, indeed. A thing like that.

58
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:30,134
You're a writer. You write.

59
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:31,497
Well, yes.

60
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,834
The weird thing is
short fiction is not my strong suit.

61
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,066
I have two novels.

62
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,472
Novels? About what?

63
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:41,410
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig

64
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:44,744
who has to move to Manhattan
because his wife's mother is sick.

65
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,545
The other one is, well,

66
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:48,312
a woman who's a widow...

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,684
she kind of got stuck
with this family farm.

68
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,381
No one will help her except this boy.

69
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,517
Those don't even sound stupid.

70
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:56,559
Thanks.

71
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,788
I mean, they both sound good.

72
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,422
- Want to read one?
- I do.

73
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:04,991
But I also want to talk
about Liberty Capital Savings.

74
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,003
Right.

75
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,336
Talk, one of you.

76
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,309
As you know, Jack Konig says
they want a new promotion.

77
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:14,878
Interest rates are level.

78
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,575
Some kind of irresistible fireworks
that bring people to the bank,

79
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:19,741
even if it's just to visit.

80
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,149
I hate it when they say fireworks.

81
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:23,778
Especially when they keep
talking about a toaster

82
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,517
with a warming tray on top, or a blender.

83
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,853
A blender's nice.

84
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,053
Jack keeps talking
about escalating the toaster wars

85
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,459
in order to lure women in,

86
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,691
which is silly when you think about it,

87
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,266
because other than a few working girls,

88
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:38,563
most women aren't
in charge of the banking.

89
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,637
Not in my house.

90
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:40,727
They visit the bank.

91
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,103
They do.

92
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,909
All we do is try to get the girls in.

93
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,981
Families.

94
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,912
But you know what?

95
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:57,884
Men need their own accounts,
beyond the family.

96
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,115
Men?

97
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,156
Oh, I can see that.

98
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:02,886
Discretion. Discretionary.

99
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:05,155
Statements sent to the office.

100
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:06,821
Yes.

101
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:10,390
Liberty Capital Private Account.

102
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,295
No.

103
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:18,405
Executive Account.

104
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:22,472
That's why he won an award.

105
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,110
Accounts won the award.

106
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,183
Yeah.

107
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,718
<i>There's a call for you
from Bix Beiderbecke.</i>

108
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,658
Hello, Mr. Beiderbecke?

109
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:43,325
It's me, and don't ask who,
or you'll spoil the mood.

110
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:48,533
Who's Bix?

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,540
The trumpeter.

112
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:53,338
I was thinking
about playing the horn this afternoon.

113
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,606
Where are you calling me from?

114
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,807
<i>I just had a phone put in.</i>

115
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:03,318
<i>Really. Instant connection,</i>

116
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:07,551
<i>just like that night
at the ticket booth in Grand Central.</i>

117
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,217
<i>Midge, I'm at work.</i>

118
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:10,453
<i>Just get down here.</i>

119
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,996
<i>I want you to pull my hair
and ravish me</i>

120
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,929
<i>and leave me for dead.</i>

121
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,710
I'll be back after lunch.

122
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,852
Kenneth Cosgrove.

123
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,223
I think I'm going to vomit.

124
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:45,853
Who the hell is Ken Cosgrove?

125
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:46,988
He's from Burlington, Vermont.

126
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:48,725
His father is a salesman.

127
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:49,993
What does that have to do with it?

128
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,193
I can't believe he got published

129
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,997
and didn't tell anyone until it came out.

130
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:56,267
No, he kept walking around
like the idiot he is.

131
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:01,742
I have this story
about this crazy night I had

132
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:05,043
where I ended up in Jersey City
with all these Negroes,

133
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,141
and we all got along.

134
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,982
Can you imagine how good that story is?

135
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,282
No.

136
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,256
It is.

137
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,554
It's a national magazine.

138
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,060
Yep.

139
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,597
That hurts, too.

140
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,507
That was it.

141
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,576
That's what I called for.

142
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,076
You can go.

143
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:40,509
You can't call me at work.

144
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:44,418
You scared of me
getting lonely all the time?

145
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:47,320
Start having conversations with you

146
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,359
and ring you all the time,

147
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,622
saying, "When are you gonna come over?"

148
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,726
This is working right now.

149
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:02,196
And it worked today.

150
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,473
Look, I'm sorry your life
is in a million pieces.

151
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,548
Be easier for you to have one less.

152
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:14,950
I hurt your feelings.

153
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:22,021
You didn't like my call a little bit?

154
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,924
I'm here.

155
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,221
And you waited until you were done

156
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:29,596
to make me feel bad
about the phone call.

157
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:41,101
I like that you come in here,
acting like somebody else.

158
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:46,711
It must be so intense above 14th Street.

159
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:50,414
Then you shoot down on the train.

160
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:56,160
That look when I open that door.

161
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,759
Sometimes you're preoccupied,

162
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,731
but then you always...

163
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,667
well, you always...

164
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,670
change gears.

165
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,972
I don't even think about it.

166
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,569
I know.

167
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:22,213
I like being your medicine.

168
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,413
Okay.

169
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:36,065
What's wrong with it?

170
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,032
Just tell me. I can tell you don't like it.

171
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,501
Oh, I do.

172
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:43,404
And I love that you're
sitting alone at your typewriter,

173
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:46,102
drinking a Scotch, thinking it up.

174
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,872
But you don't like it.

175
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,216
I mostly read the classics.

176
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:55,912
It seemed strange to me.
It's too modern.

177
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,419
Really?

178
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:02,322
Uh, that's kind of a compliment.

179
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,260
But I don't think you mean it that way.

180
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,661
I just think it's odd that the bear is talking.

181
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:14,468
The bear is not talking.

182
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:18,565
It's what the hunter imagines
the bear to be thinking.

183
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:23,872
Well, it's well-written.

184
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,973
Why don't you submit it?

185
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:29,349
I was going to when I
finished dickering with it.

186
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,388
You could run it by Charlie Fiddich.

187
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:35,755
He has one of those big
publishing jobs, doesn't he?

188
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,658
Your friend Laura kept saying
how he makes things happen there.

189
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:39,889
Why would I do that?

190
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,363
Because he can help us.

191
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,627
Call him. Ask him to look at the story.

192
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:44,929
Why now?

193
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,597
Do you know who Ken Cosgrove is?

194
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:51,470
He's an account executive, just like me.

195
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,567
Did you know that?

196
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,942
<i>My father reads the damn Atlantic.</i>

197
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,071
So what?

198
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,240
You don't want to be a writer.

199
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,510
I thought it was a hobby.

200
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:03,849
He's out there.
People know who he is.

201
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:07,186
Pumpkin, Charlie Fiddich?

202
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,085
I'm surprised.

203
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:14,126
You can tell what this means to me.

204
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,601
You said you'd do anything for me.

205
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:23,037
I don't understand you.

206
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,972
You were so upset when I told you.

207
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,475
Told me about what?

208
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:27,703
Peter.

209
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,677
Told me about what?

210
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,948
That he was my first.

211
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,121
Well...

212
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,360
this helps make up for that.

213
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,794
Let Charlie Fiddich...

214
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,739
see what he's been missing.

215
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:01,773
Okay.

216
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,183
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

217
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,123
Traffic meeting is starting
in the conference room.

218
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,496
Really.

219
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:21,622
Cosgrove, I'm serious.

220
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,030
I think it shows tremendous fortitude,

221
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:24,863
and I'd like to see more of it around here:

222
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,766
People finishing things.

223
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:29,601
I guarantee you that in the bottom drawer
of every desk in this place

224
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:32,175
- is the first ten pages of a novel.
- Five.

225
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,006
The story itself was not much to my liking,

226
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:38,241
but I think it showed
an uncanny understanding

227
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:40,146
of what most people like.

228
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,513
I guess so.

229
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,416
What did you get paid
for that, a hundred bucks?

230
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:44,579
About that.

231
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,316
Well, that'll keep you working here.

232
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:49,688
So, Miss Holloway,

233
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,386
would you like to take the reins?

234
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,726
Let's start with Maytag. Mr. Cosgrove.

235
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,628
Do you want to complain
about the copy,

236
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,327
now that you're a big writer?

237
00:13:58,436 --> 00:14:00,199
Production needs 50% up front,

238
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,601
and we're waiting on a check.

239
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,368
And when will you be calling
the client about that?

240
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:05,669
Well, I spoke with him last week,

241
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:08,769
and I'll check with him
again this afternoon.

242
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,142
Aren't you good?

243
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,182
Rio de Janeiro.

244
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:15,343
<i>The double-page spread
we ran in Life and Town & Country</i>

245
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:16,442
was so successful,

246
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,920
<i>they want to resize the ad
to run in Reader's Digest.</i>

247
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,081
Big ad.

248
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,351
Little magazine.

249
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,517
Sal's problem.

250
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,185
Lucky Strike?

251
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,284
Don?

252
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,524
Sales are great. Lawsuit is pending.

253
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,362
You're the one who's
supposed to keep an eye out

254
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:31,400
on what's happening in Washington.

255
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,901
After the election.

256
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

257
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,634
I'll take any excuse
to get out of this meeting.

258
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,513
His name is Adam Whitman.

259
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:52,220
Tell him, uh...

260
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,221
Where is he?

261
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,621
Reception.

262
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:59,653
I should, uh... I have to deal with this.

263
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,026
Sure, sure.

264
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:02,565
You better come back, now.

265
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,294
- I got this.
- Okay.

266
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:14,401
Can I help you?

267
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,347
Can I help you?

268
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:24,921
It's you.

269
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,557
It's really you.

270
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,320
Dick.

271
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,692
I can't believe it.

272
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,263
I don't know what you're talking about.

273
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,927
I know I'm grown up, but, Dick, it's me.

274
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:41,836
It's Adam.

275
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,304
Your little brother?

276
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:48,039
It's Don.

277
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:53,511
It says Donald Draper,
but I knew it was you.

278
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:00,689
Are you upset? Are you mad at me?

279
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,782
I don't even know who you are.

280
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:04,885
I know I look different.

281
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,794
I grew up tall, okay?

282
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,628
But it's me, Dick.

283
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:14,694
Look, I'm a janitor at American Calculator
in the Empire State Building,

284
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,534
and I found this is someone's trash.

285
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,972
I thought I saw a ghost.

286
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:21,670
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

287
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,308
You can't even look at me.

288
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,977
Okay. You're at work.

289
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,816
I can come back another time.

290
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:34,853
No.

291
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:40,061
There's a coffee shop
three blocks west of here.

292
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:42,257
Deelite.

293
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,958
I'll meet you there at noon.

294
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,160
That's swell.

295
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:36,775
And everything's all set
for the Liberty Capital meeting?

296
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,886
Yes, of course, all set.

297
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,928
Well, thank you all.

298
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:47,793
I'm glad everybody can make it sound
like they're working so hard.

299
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,365
I can't believe this.

300
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:26,493
It is really you.

301
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,847
What do you want from me?

302
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:40,781
I don't understand this.

303
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,319
You have nothing to say to me?

304
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,322
Nothing to ask me?

305
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:51,327
Dick, I thought you were dead,
and you're right here.

306
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,762
That's not me.

307
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,728
Can't you even say my name?

308
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,235
Adam...

309
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:06,209
that's not me.

310
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,743
It is.

311
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:10,770
What happened to you?

312
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,714
Why did you do that?

313
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,845
Why did you leave me?

314
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,849
I couldn't go back there.

315
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:27,291
Nothing for me.

316
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:31,692
I knew you weren't dead.

317
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:36,102
I knew I saw you that day
hiding in the window in your uniform.

318
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,471
I was only 8, but I knew it was you.

319
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,511
It was a long time ago.

320
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:42,579
I can't believe...

321
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,079
When I saw that picture in the paper,

322
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:48,777
I thought, "It looks exactly like him,
except around the eyes. "

323
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,480
Donald Draper?

324
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,217
What kind of name is that?

325
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:55,417
What difference does it make?

326
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:57,289
People change their names.

327
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:59,488
Yeah, I guess.

328
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,900
What happened to her?

329
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,401
Mom?

330
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,631
<i>She wasn't my mother.</i>

331
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,969
She never let me forget that.

332
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,906
She's gone.

333
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,139
Stomach cancer.

334
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,909
Good.

335
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,711
Uncle Mack took it pretty hard.

336
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:23,013
He passed, too.

337
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:26,818
Are you sure you don't want anything?

338
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,725
I know. I've got this lump in my throat.

339
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,390
I'd love to eat right now, but I can't.

340
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:44,964
Did you miss me at all?

341
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,942
Of course I did.

342
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:54,748
It's good to see you.

343
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,319
You look well.

344
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,388
Would have rather had lunch with you.

345
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,423
I know. But I have an appointment

346
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,583
with the decorator
for our new apartment.

347
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:05,355
Another time, I promise.

348
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,534
You said you enjoyed the story.

349
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:20,269
Yes, I did.

350
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:23,039
As much as anyone can
enjoy that kind of thing.

351
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:25,638
So you like it, or you didn't like it?

352
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:27,979
It doesn't matter.

353
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,814
It matters that I publish it, right?

354
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,684
Yes. It does.

355
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,321
Have you been seeing Laura still?

356
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:38,122
Yes.

357
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:39,389
She's terrific.

358
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:40,395
Fun.

359
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:42,159
She really is.

360
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,577
Trudy, I want to talk to you

361
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:57,044
about something that has
nothing to do with this.

362
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:59,707
Okay.

363
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,308
I miss you.

364
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:07,483
I miss being with you.

365
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:11,194
That's very sweet to hear.

366
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:14,753
I know you're married.

367
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:18,392
It doesn't have to be more
than just being with you.

368
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:23,439
I can't.

369
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,441
Charlie, I...

370
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:30,708
No. I can't. I'm a newlywed.

371
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:36,853
Maybe... like in some movie,

372
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:38,546
sometime in the future, when we're old.

373
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,714
Maybe then.

374
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:42,257
I want you now. I don't want you old.

375
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,849
I want you now.

376
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:47,925
I know you'll never leave him.

377
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,662
I can keep a secret.

378
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:58,204
No, Charlie.

379
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:00,140
Please.

380
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:04,545
Sally, don't run.

381
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:05,945
Okay!

382
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,278
Hello.

383
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:08,578
Hello.

384
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:10,847
My goodness,
you're Mrs. Draper, aren't you?

385
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:12,820
Hello. You must be Peggy.

386
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,220
I recognized your voice.

387
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,055
So nice to finally meet you in person.

388
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,653
This is Sally and Robert.

389
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:22,527
We're here for our portrait.

390
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,895
Of course.

391
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,969
I guess I knew that.

392
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,434
Is he in there?

393
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:34,238
Um, not right now, but please go inside.

394
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,344
I'll be right back.

395
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,274
Joan?

396
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:10,204
Oh, my God, Joan, I need your help.

397
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:11,212
Let go of me.

398
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:12,475
Mrs. Draper is here,

399
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,141
and they're having their portrait taken,

400
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:16,412
and he snuck out,
and I don't know who to lie to.

401
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,080
Calm down. Just breathe slowly.

402
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,486
Mr. Draper is out,

403
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,855
and I don't think I'm supposed
to know where he went.

404
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,757
- That happens.
- But they're taking their pictures today,

405
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:26,124
and I would have reminded him,

406
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,822
but he slipped out before I could.

407
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:30,092
It's his fault. He comes and goes
and never says anything.

408
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,189
Where is he?

409
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:33,633
I make an excuse to Mrs. Draper,
she could catch him in it,

410
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:35,261
especially if she just leaves.

411
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:36,430
Or even worse, then he'll know

412
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,701
that I know where he was.

413
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:39,833
Where is he?

414
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:42,905
I don't know.

415
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:44,207
You do know,

416
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,748
and you're going to tell me,

417
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,478
or I'm not going to tell you what to do.

418
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,713
- I can't believe you.
- Well?

419
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,485
He sees this woman.

420
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:58,185
He saw her the other day.

421
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:00,160
He came back all greasy and calm.

422
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:01,754
No.

423
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:02,889
Oh, God. Now I've told you.

424
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm the worst secretary in the world.

425
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,027
- Who is she?
- I don't care. Please hurry.

426
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:13,800
Peggy, use your noodle.

427
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:15,344
You're making this so complicated.

428
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,778
You go out there,
and you entertain her and her brats.

429
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,109
Get some Hershey bars from the cart

430
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:22,777
and tell her you don't know where he is
and you forgot to remind him.

431
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,354
It is the truth. And when he comes back,
let him have an excuse.

432
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,048
He'll have one.

433
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:28,419
And then you just start apologizing

434
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:30,288
for, well...

435
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,419
just how stupid you are.

436
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:36,625
It's probably what I would have done anyway.

437
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,894
Oh, God, now I really shouldn't have told you.

438
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:41,436
You shouldn't have told me.

439
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:43,933
I'm not gonna tell anybody,

440
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,441
but you shouldn't have told anybody that.

441
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:55,918
This isn't how I imagined it.

442
00:25:57,354 --> 00:25:58,252
I'm sorry.

443
00:25:58,355 --> 00:25:59,913
You keep saying you're sorry.

444
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,293
Where were you all this time?

445
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:07,029
Around. Here, mostly.

446
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:09,831
I'm not mad at you.

447
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,662
I just want to know.

448
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,334
I mean, look at you.

449
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,368
<i>Who is Donald Draper?</i>

450
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:24,010
I mean, do you have a wife?

451
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:25,877
Kids?

452
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,451
I'm going to go.

453
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:35,586
That's it?

454
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:38,126
Want me to pay for lunch?

455
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:39,422
- No.
- Let me.

456
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,792
You didn't have anything.

457
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:43,196
I don't understand
why you're being like this.

458
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,528
When I was little,

459
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:47,001
I used to imagine this day happening,
and here it is.

460
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:49,265
I don't understand. I'm family.

461
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:52,240
I just want to be a part of your life.

462
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,872
Adam, that's not going to happen.

463
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:58,680
I'm going to walk out that door.

464
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:00,511
That's it.

465
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:03,450
I'm not buying your lunch...

466
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,818
because this never happened.

467
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,928
I don't like black licorice, either.

468
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,903
Are you sure we should wait?

469
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,097
I think so.

470
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:25,835
I can't believe I forgot.

471
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,376
Oh, are you missing your lunch?

472
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:30,207
No. It's okay. I brought it.

473
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,305
Well, you'll probably
be going out tonight.

474
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,508
Might as well take it easy.

475
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:34,879
That's true.

476
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,958
Do you have a boyfriend or a steady?

477
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,255
Um, no.

478
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,296
I work a lot.

479
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:48,921
Some blind dates.

480
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,330
I remember those.

481
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:53,062
- The disappointments.
- Yeah.

482
00:27:58,976 --> 00:27:59,965
Mr. Draper's office.

483
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:01,408
How's it going?

484
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,046
No, thank you. I'm staying in.

485
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,945
- Mr. Draper treating you well?
- Yes.

486
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:13,852
He's been very patient

487
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:16,949
while I've been learning
the ropes around here.

488
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,995
Don't you just hate it
when his mouth runs on and on?

489
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:22,065
Excuse me?

490
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:25,157
I'm joking.

491
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:27,464
You probably know more
about him than I do.

492
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:34,871
You look so beautiful in that light.

493
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:36,468
You should take
the picture right there.

494
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:41,275
Well, I... I did want to look good.

495
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:45,445
Mr. Draper. I'm...

496
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,817
The portrait.

497
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:51,224
What happened? Where were you?

498
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,886
We were just about to leave.

499
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:55,157
I'm so embarrassed.
I forgot to remind you.

500
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:58,325
No, I forgot to check in
before I went to the printer.

501
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,596
I'm such a fool.
I don't know where my head is.

502
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:01,864
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Draper.

503
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,701
- Please forgive me.
- No, it's nothing.

504
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,298
All we need are some wet paper towels
to get the chocolate off

505
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,809
before we go in front of the lens.

506
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:09,276
We'll have to do that on the way.

507
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:10,971
They must be waiting
for us at the studio.

508
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,673
Come on.

509
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:13,750
Nice to meet you.

510
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:19,287
Don't worry about it.

511
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:20,549
Thank you.

512
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:28,631
They're terrible.

513
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:30,723
No, they're not.

514
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:31,732
Don was late.

515
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,132
It ruins the whole thing.

516
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:35,033
Oh, Carlton's always late.

517
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,865
You can see what's important to them.

518
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:42,742
We're very important to them. Stop it.

519
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:45,815
How'd you like to be
in Helen Bishop's family portrait?

520
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,781
There's a big hole there, believe me.

521
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:54,382
I want to take them again anyway.

522
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:57,221
Sally looks fat.

523
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,761
I don't think so.

524
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:01,888
The worst part is,
Don will think they're fine.

525
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,660
Here. Maybe this one.

526
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,132
Blow that one up.

527
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:07,328
It'll hold you until the Christmas card.

528
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:09,871
The color is off on these, too.

529
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:11,133
Am I wrong?

530
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:15,803
I really expect the royal treatment
when I go to Don's office,

531
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:18,904
and I seldom get it.

532
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:24,386
It's like walking into another country
where I don't speak the language.

533
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:26,854
At Carlton's, I feel like I'm stupid.

534
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:29,448
All that Manhattan talk.

535
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,529
Our husbands.

536
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:38,260
They are better out here, aren't they?

537
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,563
Infinitely.

538
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,197
We took your idea of product
and applied it directly to the bank.

539
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:46,935
Banking products,
not household products.

540
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:49,171
You said banking products
weren't sexy.

541
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,712
We went down
some really dumb roads,

542
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:52,873
like bank accounts for children,

543
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,746
and then Don, here,

544
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,581
had this Roman candle of an idea.

545
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:58,711
Don?

546
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:02,383
I think Paul has a handle on this.

547
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:14,232
The modern executive is a busy man.

548
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:17,101
He leads a complicated life.

549
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,971
He has business expenses, family, leisure.

550
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,910
How are you supposed
to keep all that straight?

551
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:26,949
Well, now Liberty Capital
is going to help you with that.

552
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,177
Okay.

553
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:30,617
What is this?

554
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,020
An account for a man that is private.

555
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,652
The statements come to the office,
not your home.

556
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:41,697
I see. For organizing your life.

557
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:42,958
If it needs it.

558
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,465
Liberty for the libertine.

559
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:46,365
That's good.

560
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,165
Does this say that to you?

561
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:50,796
It will if you put the word "private" in there
instead of "liberty. "

562
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:53,967
Executive Private Account.

563
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,804
What are you laughing at?

564
00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:01,247
A portion of our customers
are already, I believe, doing this.

565
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:02,818
There's just no name for it,

566
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,581
and we had no way to charge them.

567
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:06,781
I like the torch.

568
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,017
It says, don't get burned.

569
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,957
It could start some uncomfortable
conversations

570
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:13,928
in a lot of homes, but, uh...

571
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,930
it's better than a calendar.

572
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:17,897
Let's talk placement.

573
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,094
Hello.

574
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:24,071
I opened everything but that one.

575
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:56,598
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig

576
00:32:56,706 --> 00:33:00,540
who has to move to Manhattan
because his wife's mother is sick.

577
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,009
The other is about...

578
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:04,171
You know, I just finished reading it.

579
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,841
It's really a great story.

580
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,113
Thank you. That means a lot.

581
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,782
It's nice to see
someone's passion be rewarded.

582
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:16,017
You know what?

583
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:18,321
I don't have a copy of it,

584
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:24,594
and I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.

585
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,532
Hey!

586
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:29,935
You said you got, like,
50 more copies, right?

587
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,439
Maybe I do.

588
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:34,032
If not, it's on every newsstand in town.

589
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:36,339
Good to hear.

590
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:50,889
You're leaving?

591
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:52,962
Yes. For the day.

592
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:54,792
Oh, okay.

593
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:55,990
I'm going home.

594
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:58,431
You can reach me there if necessary.

595
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,268
I've always wondered
why he's ignored me.

596
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:07,866
Probably because he's so good-looking

597
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:10,173
he can go outside the office
for whatever he wants.

598
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,271
Most of these fellas can't.

599
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:15,613
He seemed different to me.

600
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,914
Well, either way,
you have to do your job.

601
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:20,455
Keep his record clean here and at home.

602
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:24,254
Honestly, if he sees that in you,
you are solid gold.

603
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,352
That's my job?

604
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:27,657
Yes.

605
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,891
That's his private life.

606
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,968
Private.

607
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:33,899
That's how these men are.

608
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,699
And it's why we love them.

609
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:36,931
I don't love him.

610
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,268
Fine.

611
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,809
Look, if you're even thinking
about passing judgment,

612
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,104
then you're in the wrong business.

613
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:44,442
Okay.

614
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:45,536
You need to relax.

615
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,014
I have never come over here

616
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:50,883
and not seen you with a look on your face
that said "I need a drink. "

617
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,818
This job is odd.

618
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:57,119
But it's the best.

619
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:00,295
Listen, Kenny.

620
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:01,625
What?

621
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:03,596
Listen, I know I've been a bear,

622
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,933
but I've been competing neck and neck
with people in this place.

623
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,200
I didn't know I was
competing with you, too.

624
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:16,109
You lost.

625
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,516
Hello, sweetheart.

626
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,490
Hello, dear.

627
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:46,704
Well... I have some good news.

628
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:50,571
Charlie Fiddich
came by the house this afternoon.

629
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,545
Did he? Here?

630
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,947
I guess your lunch did go well.

631
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:58,316
It wasn't lunch. I told you that.

632
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:02,416
So what did he say? Don't tease me.

633
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,550
He said he was going
to get you published.

634
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,652
That is incredibly swell news.

635
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:07,752
When? Where?

636
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,957
<i>Boys' Life magazine.</i>

637
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:11,260
What?

638
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,801
It's a $40 fee,

639
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:15,234
and a lot of people read it.

640
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:18,034
<i>Are you kidding me? Boys' Life?</i>

641
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:21,968
<i>That story was good enough
for The New Yorker.</i>

642
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:25,844
And don't act like those magazines
do everything on merit.

643
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:28,577
I thought you'd be happy.

644
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,744
For a year's work.

645
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:36,555
You don't want me to have what I want.

646
00:36:37,627 --> 00:36:39,788
You're going to be published.

647
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,729
<i>Boys' Life.</i>

648
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:47,792
Probably next to some ad for exploding cigars.

649
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:53,068
<i>I could have gotten you
in The New Yorker</i>

650
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:54,609
or in the Encyclopedia Britannica

651
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,474
if I wanted to.

652
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:00,209
So...

653
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:02,113
why didn't you?

654
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,645
Why would you do that to me?

655
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,418
Why would you put me in that position?

656
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:27,109
I talked to my father
about the house in Cape May.

657
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,541
He said our dates are good.

658
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,135
August won't be a problem.

659
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:31,577
That's good.

660
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,511
I wish it wasn't so far from the city.

661
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,677
Then we'd see more of you.

662
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:40,688
It's not that far.

663
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,817
Well, I hate you
spending August in the office.

664
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:47,294
Although I liked your girl Peggy.

665
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:48,364
She's fresh.

666
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:51,332
As the driven snow.

667
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:54,733
You sound disappointed.

668
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:57,329
<i>Did you read some terrible
article in Look magazine</i>

669
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,738
that I should know about?

670
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:01,401
I like her.

671
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:07,111
A woman can't just not remark
on her husband's secretary.

672
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,713
Don, are you okay?

673
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,483
No, I just might have
to go back to the office.

674
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:19,892
I haven't decided yet.

675
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:20,022
Phone!

676
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:33,093
Hello.

677
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:35,796
I need to see you tonight. Are you busy?

678
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:39,363
For you? Of course not.

679
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,807
Good. I'm leaving now.

680
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:44,675
<i>From where?</i>

681
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:45,805
25 minutes.

682
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:48,475
I don't even know what you drink.

683
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,315
Whatever you have.

684
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:58,252
I'm so glad you changed your mind.

685
00:40:58,354 --> 00:40:59,685
Come in.

686
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:02,223
Sit down.

687
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:06,326
I know it's terrible.

688
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:10,365
It's temporary, I... I hope.

689
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:13,231
Look at you.

690
00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:17,331
You look more like you now.

691
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:28,513
I came here because
I wanted to talk to you

692
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:30,142
and explain something to you.

693
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:32,517
You got to stop that kind of talk.

694
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:34,590
This isn't so hard.

695
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:38,060
Adam, listen to me.

696
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:41,590
I have a life,

697
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:43,928
and it only goes in one direction:

698
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:46,024
Forward.

699
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:50,233
What are you drinking?

700
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:51,499
Gin?

701
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:54,838
I found it in one
of the offices, under a couch.

702
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:56,536
Three quarts.

703
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:58,375
I figured I could take one.

704
00:41:58,481 --> 00:41:59,641
Coffee.

705
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:01,944
I can do that.

706
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:08,613
So no Abigail, no Uncle Mack.

707
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:09,953
Nobody, huh?

708
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:14,894
I know. It's strange.

709
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:17,625
Your office is really nice.

710
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:21,568
I figure from that award
you must be pretty important.

711
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:25,404
I don't know. I guess so.

712
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:30,707
Well, everyone always said
you were too smart for your own good.

713
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:34,579
Of course, Uncle Mack
thought you were soft.

714
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:36,879
But you're not, are you?

715
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:39,250
No, I'm not.

716
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:44,989
What are you doing?

717
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:52,492
That's $5,000.

718
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,898
That's all there is.

719
00:42:56,005 --> 00:43:00,169
I want you to take it,
and I want you to leave New York,

720
00:43:00,276 --> 00:43:04,178
and I don't want to see
or hear from you ever again.

721
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:09,483
That's not what I wanted.

722
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,612
That's not right.

723
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:16,453
That's all I can do for you.

724
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,160
You're serious, aren't you?

725
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:25,558
You thought I was dead.

726
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:28,000
Just go back to thinking that.

727
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:30,470
Where do I go?

728
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:38,943
Adam, it is $5,000.

729
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:43,152
Make your own life.

730
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:48,822
I have too much here.

731
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:23,921
It's going to be okay.

732
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:07,262
How'd it go?

733
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,838
Crisis averted?

734
00:45:09,939 --> 00:45:12,908
Yes. Papers were on my desk.

735
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,579
Do you want to go visit the kids?

736
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:21,583
No, I just want to go to sleep.

737
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,657
I want to talk to you about something,

738
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,729
and I don't want you to get upset.

739
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:43,530
I won't.

740
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:48,939
I know you hate going to my family's
house in Cape May,

741
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:50,637
and I know even though my father...

742
00:45:50,746 --> 00:45:54,477
No, it's great. It's great.

743
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,813
I'm looking forward to it already, I swear.

744
00:45:56,919 --> 00:46:01,322
But I know you don't like
that my father might be there for part of it.

745
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:04,825
I just don't like
the way he looks at me.

746
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:07,953
You took away his little girl.

747
00:46:09,131 --> 00:46:15,798
I was thinking maybe we should
just buy a summer house.

748
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:20,205
Something closer that's ours.

749
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:23,745
I know we had a good year.

750
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:28,873
I don't know, Bets.

751
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:33,922
I think Cape May will be fine.

752
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,191
We're not that flush right now.

753
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:42,354
There's nothing to be worried about.

754
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:45,764
I'd just rather wait till next year.

755
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:50,530
Good.

756
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:56,503
Because I like seeing my dad.
