Isn't that something?

- Bet they gave you a medal.
- They did.

But not for that. It was for drinking.

Can something be done
about this sadness?

Want to switch to gin?

Did you check the golf bag?

I have something out in the garage
left over from New Year's.

I don't care if it has ants in it.

Roger, please, the kids.

Sally will be happy
her cake was such a hit.

Make sure you tell her

I ate the "M" in "Mom. "

- Roger...
- I can't believe you've had two babies.

Don't do that.

You've been making eyes at me all night.

You can't tell me that I'm
not giving you hot pants.

You smell so good.

I can make more coffee.

I just want you to know
that when I go to sleep tonight,

I will be thinking all about you.

Where'd you go, to Russia to get that?

No, I ran down the street
knocking on doors.

Come on, you two. Come on out here
and wish me a bon voyage.

I was just saying
what a lucky man you are.

Beautiful children. Enjoy it.

One minute you're drinking at a bar,

and they come and tell you
your kid's been born,

next thing you know,
they're heading off to college.

Well, I should be on my way.

I'll take this for the road.

I'll walk you out.

Magical night.

That's my car.

There you go.

Lights!

- What was that?
- What?

That. Him.

Felt like someone turned the oven on
when I came back in here with that bottle.

- That's ridiculous.
- Bullshit.

Nothing happened, Don.

Other than your drunk boss
ruining our evening.

Can we leave it at that?

You seemed to be having a grand time.

I liked the wine.

You made a fool of yourself.

Why would you say that?

You were throwing yourself at him.
Giggling at his stories.

I was being friendly. He's your boss.

I don't like to be treated that way
in my own home.

I know what I saw.

You want to bounce me off the walls?

Would that make you feel better?

Sometimes I feel like
I'm living with a little girl.
