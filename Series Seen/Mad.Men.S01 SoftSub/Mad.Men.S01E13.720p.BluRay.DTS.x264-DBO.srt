1
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,172
I like this for the powder room,
but definitely not the bedroom.

2
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,332
It's a little busy.

3
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,773
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,344
It's not the curtains
I'm worried about, but the cabinets.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,006
Nixon didn't stand a chance.

6
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,347
The Browns trounced
the Redskins, 31-10.

7
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,080
The result of that last home game

8
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,646
has correctly predicted
the last six elections.

9
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,625
I wish someone would have told me that.

10
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,687
Of course, it's really
a 50/50 chance of being right.

11
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:15,469
I want to treat you like a son because...
I feel that way towards you.

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,668
Okay.

13
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,042
Trudy told us that you
were up for a promotion

14
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,172
and you didn't get it or something.

15
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,750
I wish she hadn't.

16
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,513
Now, she loves you.

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,110
And honestly,

18
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,089
I think you need
to take a little focus off your work.

19
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:35,354
This from one of the top
salesmen at Vicks Chemical.

20
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,758
When you started talking

21
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,990
about that Clearasil
company you bought...

22
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,759
Now, that was kind of
worth bragging about.

23
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,335
Did you know that there's a surge
in adolescence right now?

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,463
I'll tell you, Sterling Cooper
and yours truly

25
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:50,098
would love to help you
deliver that message.

26
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,336
See? Now that's what I'm talking about.

27
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,242
The only family and business
you should be mixing

28
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,815
is the production of a child.

29
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,009
And what did Trudy say about that?

30
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,142
About what?

31
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,984
Tom, loose lips sink ships.

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,024
I was just saying that work
isn't everything, you know.

33
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,583
It's like that song says:
Um, tend your own garden.

34
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,357
What song is that, Daddy?

35
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,396
Uh, I don't know.

36
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,465
People say it. It's true.

37
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,533
It is true.

38
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,862
Yeah. Tend to your own garden.

39
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:20,132
That means... you know,
start growing things.

40
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,604
Daddy!

41
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,936
You're embarrassing us.

42
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,272
It'll be the best Christmas present
this one ever had.

43
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,107
And hell, Thanksgiving's Thursday.

44
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:38,050
Oh, and I guess I should go to Keppler Farm
to get some acorn squash.

45
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,455
What am I doing?
They have squash there.

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,460
Ery good squash, actually.

47
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,631
I wish you would come.

48
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,363
Birdie, I'm a partner.

49
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,065
80% of my business
rolls out next week.

50
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,265
It just seems silly for me

51
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,503
to go down there
for a 12-hour Thanksgiving.

52
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,776
What about... Sally and Bobby's
childhood memories?

53
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:08,643
There was no reason
you couldn't have it up here.

54
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,655
You know my brother's
children are animals.

55
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,054
They can't make the trip up here,

56
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,683
and I don't want my dad to be alone.

57
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:20,833
I'll take a cab to the train,
and William will pick us up,

58
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,163
probably in some new car.

59
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,975
You know what? L...

60
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,504
I don't think you want to go.

61
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,475
I'm sorry. Was I unclear about that?

62
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,587
I don't understand

63
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,284
why you can't make
my family your family.

64
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:58,493
Ken is perfectly happy to have me here.

65
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,903
What do you think it's like?
He's a bachelor. It's dirty.

66
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,842
I'm not complaining.

67
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,680
I don't think it's a good idea
to spend money on a hotel right now.

68
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,754
If you're so worried about my well-being,
let me come home.

69
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,249
That's not what I meant.

70
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,290
I mean, I know how it sounded.

71
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,393
Jennifer.

72
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,208
Yes.

73
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,080
I'll quit if you let me come home.

74
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,148
I miss you...

75
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,123
so much.

76
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,409
Those the legendary
secret files of Bert Cooper?

77
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,637
No.

78
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,805
I got a call from Abraham Menken.

79
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,906
I'm sure you know
that his daughter will be unavailable

80
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,348
for the next three months,

81
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:24,583
taking some sort of ocean voyage
to Paris and whatnot.

82
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,487
I hadn't heard that.

83
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,456
But otherwise?

84
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,588
There is no otherwise.

85
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:37,135
Why is this man calling me?

86
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,137
I don't know. Is he unhappy?

87
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,538
As a partner, I do not expect
your personal preferences

88
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,611
to interfere with our business.

89
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,508
Who says they have?

90
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,240
It was the tone of his voice.

91
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,645
He's her father.

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,274
That's it, cowboy.

93
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,593
Francine.

94
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,664
I'm coming in. I'm freezing.

95
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,559
You're in your slippers.

96
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,398
I've been outside
waiting for you to come home,

97
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,268
just sitting in the car
hoping no one would see me.

98
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,806
What's going on?

99
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,239
Are your kids home?

100
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,607
No. What happened?

101
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,642
I'm so stupid.

102
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,681
So damn stupid.

103
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,686
You're not, Francine.

104
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,758
Whatever happened, you're not stupid.

105
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:36,453
My mind hasn't been so sharp
since I had the baby.

106
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,052
And Carlton gave me a stack of mail,

107
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,655
and honestly I think I just threw it away.

108
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,461
And four days later,
the phone was cut off,

109
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:47,437
so I had to go to the phone company
and pay it, or, you know, he'd have a fit.

110
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,236
And I had to do all this
without him knowing.

111
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,833
How perfect.

112
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,408
I don't understand.

113
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:58,949
They gave me the bill.

114
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,446
It was close to $18.

115
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,526
There were all these calls:

116
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,528
Long distance, MH.

117
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,030
MH? Manhattan?

118
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,662
So I called one.

119
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:22,405
A woman answered.

120
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,806
I had just...

121
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,710
I said, "I'm calling
from Carlton Hanson's office. "

122
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,475
She said, "Really?"

123
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,644
I said, "He wants to have dinner
tonight at the usual place. "

124
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,585
What made you say that?

125
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:46,923
What woman would he
be calling in Manhattan

126
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,524
who answers her own phone?

127
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,062
Married women.

128
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,573
Lots of women answer
their own phones.

129
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,873
So he's calling some married woman
from my house

130
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,107
while I'm upstairs sleeping?

131
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:05,513
Maybe it's a caterer.

132
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,280
Maybe he's throwing you
a surprise party.

133
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:18,392
Do you know he spends
two nights a week at the Waldorf?

134
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:21,489
I'm so stupid.

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,363
Assuming the worst...

136
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,240
The worst is that I'll poison him.

137
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,104
He's so stupid, he'd drink anything.

138
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,344
I'm going to have
a house full of people.

139
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,077
I'll poison them all:

140
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,645
His parents, my parents...

141
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,916
my kids.

142
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,423
Stop it.

143
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,789
Stop that, Francine.

144
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,460
You're emotional. It doesn't mean...

145
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,762
Damn it, Betty. I know everything.

146
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,597
What am I going to do?

147
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,898
I've been sitting outside in the car.

148
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,565
What do I do? I thought
you'd know what to do.

149
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:07,209
Me? L... Why?

150
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,574
I don't know.

151
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,124
I'm s...

152
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,528
so embarrassed.

153
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,560
He doesn't know you know.

154
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,001
I know that.

155
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,964
Go on upstairs.

156
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,475
I should go.

157
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:41,011
Come on, Bobby,
let's go play in my room.

158
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,138
No. Don't.

159
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,274
It'll be okay.

160
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,080
Mrs. Draper, sorry I'm late.

161
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,179
Oh. It's okay, Carla. You can go.

162
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,757
You want me to unpack the groceries?

163
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,156
I'll do it. Just go.

164
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,058
Good-bye.

165
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,673
First things first.

166
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,146
When I call a meeting,

167
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,774
if you arrive after me, you are late.

168
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,212
Boys, the stock in our stable:

169
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,814
Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Maytag.

170
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,383
No automobile, airline,
pharmaceuticals.

171
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,089
Tobacco is on that list.

172
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,756
You're Cosgrove, right?

173
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,769
The powerhouse
behind the Rejuvenator?

174
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,398
Actually, it's called
the Relax-a-Cizor now.

175
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:16,838
What the hell is it?

176
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,537
It's a weight loss device
with a female pleasure payload.

177
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,806
Really?

178
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,675
I'm offering a hundred-dollar bonus

179
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:29,743
to the first man who brings me
a meeting with a decision maker.

180
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,655
Gentlemen, here's a list of people
you should be having lunch with.

181
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,785
I want you to run into people,
go through old yearbooks.

182
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,865
This means everybody. Writers, too.

183
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,364
Bringing in business is the key

184
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,129
to your salary, your status,
and your self-worth.

185
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,828
I went to the Athletic Club today,

186
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,736
and I sat in the steam
for an hour and a half.

187
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,399
In that time, I lost 4 pounds

188
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,238
and learned that Kodak still isn't happy

189
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,244
with the campaign
for the new slide projector.

190
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,610
Is any of this sinking in?

191
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,745
"It's true that while simply relaxing,

192
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,620
"I can get all the benefits
of calisthenics.

193
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,126
"A simple regimen of three
20-minute sessions per week,

194
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,026
"combined with a sensible diet,

195
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,258
"will restore your youthful glow.

196
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,130
"I love the way it makes me feel.

197
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,669
"The Relax-a-Cizor.

198
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,864
It's my little secret. "

199
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,604
Thank you, Annie.

200
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,373
Uh, one more time... Rita.

201
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,616
"I never thought it would happen to me,

202
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,584
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

203
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,450
- Just ask my husband. "
- Todd?

204
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,580
I think we're both going
to agree on Annie.

205
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,022
Which one is Annie?

206
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,686
Believe it or not, I like Rita.

207
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,425
She's got that voice:
Randy and knowing,

208
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,932
like the Relax-a-Cizor.

209
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,526
Annie belongs on TV
with Rita's voice dubbed in.

210
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,231
Norma, thank you.

211
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,366
You can go.

212
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,040
Whatever the...

213
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:04,513
special properties
of the Relax-a-Cizor are,

214
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:08,950
what we are selling is confidence,
a better you.

215
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,715
That woman isn't a better anything.

216
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:16,284
Annie is a confident, beautiful woman,
and you can hear it in her voice.

217
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,863
I can't believe I'm in this argument.

218
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,693
Sorry about that, Rita.

219
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,790
Hi, Annie. We'll do this tomorrow.

220
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,300
Check with Peggy here
for your session.

221
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,730
If I get a hard time about this,

222
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm telling people it was your idea.

223
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,207
It was my idea.

224
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,318
Just a minute. I'll be right back.

225
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,198
Do you have to?

226
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,928
Peter.

227
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,438
That's risky business.

228
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,701
It is, isn't it?

229
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,375
What, honey?

230
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,609
You can say anything to me.

231
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:25,196
I can't provide for a child
on what I make.

232
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,630
Don't worry about that.

233
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:34,671
How could I not?

234
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,502
You can't.

235
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,069
Really?

236
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,773
You can't worry about that.

237
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,592
So stay here.

238
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,936
Oh... Peter.

239
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,755
Hi, Birdie.

240
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,660
It's 9:30. Why didn't you
just stay in the city?

241
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:35,290
Oh, I have work to do here as well.

242
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,665
Do you know where
the slide projector is?

243
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,034
So you're not going
to see us for four days,

244
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,903
and you're not going to see us now.

245
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,737
Bets, right when I walk in the door?

246
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:49,610
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:54,342
I'm sorry. I just... I had a terrible day.

248
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,617
Sit with me.

249
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,458
What happened?

250
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,765
Francine told me

251
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,704
Carlton has been having an affair.

252
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,771
Really?

253
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:23,905
She was in pieces, Don.

254
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,210
I didn't know what to say to her.

255
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,252
Well, what could you say?

256
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,911
I'm surprised she told you.

257
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,785
Why?

258
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,017
She's like a sister to me.

259
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,287
Of course she is.

260
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,794
I never liked Carlton.

261
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,962
He was never my favorite.

262
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,472
She should poison him.

263
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,203
Now you think she should kill him?

264
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,213
How could someone do that
to the person that they love?

265
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,512
That they have children with?

266
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,145
Doesn't this all mean anything?

267
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,955
Who knows why people
do what they do?

268
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
Come on.

269
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,099
Bring the wine.

270
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,554
It's actually a hell of a gadget.

271
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,626
It's continuous, doesn't jam.

272
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,127
They call it the Doughnut or the Wheel.

273
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,493
They're expecting something
along those lines.

274
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,065
Kodak reinvented the wheel.

275
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,758
They're going to hear that ten times.

276
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,998
They want you to use the words Research
and Development in the ads.

277
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,200
But if you could find a way
to put the Wheel and the Future

278
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,571
into something with some legs,

279
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,111
you could make me look good
my first month here.

280
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,724
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

281
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:18,125
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

282
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,027
"Just ask my husband.

283
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,535
"I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met.

284
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,467
"It's true that while simply relaxing

00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,004

286
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,869
I'm sorry. We have to get a level here.

287
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,636
No, we don't.

288
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,235
She doesn't sound very confident.

289
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,315
She just started.

290
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,043
Give her a direction.

291
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,820
Okay, Annie.

292
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,185
Confidence.

293
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,860
Okay.

294
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,724
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

295
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,197
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

296
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,790
"Just ask my husband.

297
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,531
I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met. "

298
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,731
Annie.

299
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,807
Yes?

300
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:03,932
Are you married?

301
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,532
No.

302
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,168
I could have told you that.

303
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:12,810
Well, try and imagine
you're you, Annie,

304
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,215
and now you have everything.

305
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,082
You're beautiful, you're slim,

306
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,624
you're the beloved prize
of a handsome man,

307
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,286
and you have everything when
you use the Relax-a-Cizor.

308
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,555
Okay.

309
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,632
It's too bad your voice is so annoying.

310
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,964
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

311
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,436
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,166
Just ask my husband. "

313
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:37,366
Hold on, Annie.

314
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,774
We have a problem
with the tape recorder.

315
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,571
Say something to her.

316
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,116
Make her feel beautiful.

317
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,083
You know, the confidence
that comes with beauty.

318
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,916
Pegs, a woman who looks like that
will never sound confident

319
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,489
because she never is confident.

320
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,717
Baloney.

321
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,520
Honey, it's God's gift to bachelors.

322
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,095
The juiciest gazelle
is the easiest to catch.

323
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:01,461
Can I... I have a bit of a cold in my throat.

324
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,557
Can I get some pineapple juice?

325
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,898
There's a glass of water in the corner.

326
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,562
It's great for your throat.

327
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,232
I didn't believe that, either.

328
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,338
Let's try it again, Annie.

329
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,813
Happy, confident, beautiful.

330
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,549
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

331
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,781
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,517

I swear, he looks at me
like the night we"...

334
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,749
Annie.

335
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,620
You're married.

336
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,598
Maybe you put on a few pounds,

337
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,827
but then you got the Relax-a-Cizor,

338
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:42,373
and you're back to being you, right now.

339
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:46,240
I don't know that I understand.

340
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:49,074
Annie, what don't you understand?

341
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,144
I am being me.

342
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,545
Just give me a second.

343
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,486
I'll get it the way you want it.

344
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,662
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"...

345
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,966
"I never thought this
would happen to me, but... "

346
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,468
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"...

347
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,305
Look, Pegs, you dangled her
in front of me,

348
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,573
and now you're ruining it.

349
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,773
Don't do that to me.

350
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,350
Kenny, be professional, would you?

351
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,577
This is not working out.

352
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,484
We're going to have to let you go.

353
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,884
You could have gone
in there and said that.

354
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:42,562
In this order,

355
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:46,660
I want you to go after her
and console her.

356
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:50,832
And after you make plans
or whatever you need to do,

357
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,034
call Rita.

358
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:53,838
The older lady you liked?

359
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,175
She's probably home
with the Relax-a-Cizor right now.

360
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,368
Can you get me the, uh...

361
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:58,203
the Brighton Hotel, Times Square?

362
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,505
Brighton.

363
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,479
<i>Yes. Uh, sorry to bother you so late.</i>

364
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,744
<i>I'm looking for someone.</i>

365
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:09,217
A tenant of yours

366
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,982
some... some months back.

367
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:11,987
A guest.

368
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,421
<i>Yes. Uh,</i>

369
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,119
I'd love to know if he left
a forwarding address.

370
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,785
His name is...

371
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,022
Adam Whitman.

372
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,860
Right. Can I ask what you want?

373
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,400
Just a forwarding address.

374
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,560
I'm trying to contact him.

375
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,104
He has red hair...

376
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,673
over 6 feet.

377
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,834
<i>Now listen. I know
who you're talking about.</i>

378
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:38,375
Jesus, I hate to be the one to tell you this,

379
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,711
but he hung himself.

380
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,245
What?

381
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,548
<i>Yeah.</i>

382
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,388
Adam Whitman.

383
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,925
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

384
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,052
Left the building a bunch of money.

385
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:52,288
The city took it.

386
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,024
<i>It was in the Post.</i>

387
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,963
Oh.

388
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,091
<i>Well,</i>

389
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,693
I hate to be the one to give that news.

390
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,404
Okay.

391
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,308
<i>Hello.</i>

392
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,180
Yes. Hello.

393
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,250
<i>Who is this?</i>

394
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,754
Who is this?

395
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,349
This is Dr. Arnold Wayne.

396
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:14,232
Mrs. Albertson, I have warned you,
this is inappropriate.

397
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,500
Are we on fire?

398
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,066
Don.

399
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,744
No. I, uh... dropped a cigarette
in my waste basket.

400
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,542
Harry, come here. I want to talk to you.

401
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,441
Okay.

402
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,600
Harry, I want to talk to you.

403
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:22,538
I can explain.

404
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,034
What is the benefit of that thing?

405
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,347
It sells projectors to people
who already have them.

406
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,819
Yeah, the wheel.

407
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,288
Stacks, you store your slides in it,

408
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,859
and it's ready to go.

409
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,929
I took pictures for the paper at Wisconsin.

410
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:47,395
The machinery is definitely
part of the fun.

411
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:48,522
It's mechanical.

412
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,430
What did you take pictures of?

413
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,628
Girls, mostly.

414
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,365
You could go up and ask them
their names afterwards

415
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,567
like you were going to put it in the paper.

416
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,166
And some other stuff.

417
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,303
Artsy-craftsy stuff.

418
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:03,812
They gave me hell about it.

419
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,109
Artsy, like what?

420
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,482
Like the reflection of a tree in a pond?

421
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,952
Uh, worse.

422
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:16,652
I did a whole series
that was just handprints on glass.

423
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,590
You know, the way
it fogs up around your heat.

424
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,132
Take it off, take a picture.

425
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,326
Black and white, I suppose.

426
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:25,527
Of course.

427
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:30,598
I was always fascinated
by the cave paintings of Lascaux.

428
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,609
They're, like, 17,000 years old.

429
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,305
The bison get all the attention,

430
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,872
but there are also
all of these handprints,

431
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,781
tiny by today's standards,

432
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,582
with paint blown all around them.

433
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,021
Signature of the artist.

434
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,591
But I thought it was like someone...

435
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:57,100
reaching through the stone
and right to us.

436
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,763
"I was here. "

437
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,376
Are you okay?

438
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,711
That'll be all.

439
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,237
Glen?

440
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,378
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

441
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,548
Who says... Who said that?

442
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:26,089
My mother and my father.

443
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,519
I don't care.

444
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,287
My mother's going to come out.

445
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,268
I don't care.

446
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,598
Glen...

447
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,543
I can't talk to anyone.

448
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,643
It's so horrible.

449
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,620
I'm so sad.

450
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:17,273
Don't cry.

451
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,870
Please...

452
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,616
Please tell me I'll be okay.

453
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,856
I don't know.

454
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,994
I wish I was older.

455
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,564
Oh, adults don't know anything, Glen.

456
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,666
I don't really know
how long 20 minutes is.

457
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,475
Of course, dear.

458
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:08,380
Don, I hope I'm not bothering you.

459
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:13,157
I just wanted to let you know
I took Duck's talk very seriously.

460
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,960
And without having to crack
my Deerfield yearbook,

461
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,126
I've brought in an account.

462
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,568
Good for you.

463
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:23,139
It's a piece of Vicks Chemical Company.

464
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,208
Clearasil.

465
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,503
Better potential

466
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,476
than any traditional
pharmaceutical, I believe.

467
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,207
That's a real account, Campbell.

468
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:33,112
How'd that happen?

469
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,616
I'm not embarrassed to say

470
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,688
my father-in-law's a former salesman,
now executive there.

471
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,551
That's generous.

472
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:43,149
He's interested in my future.

473
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,319
Congratulations.

474
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,920
I'm sure, with a little bit of lawyering,
you're entitled to that bonus.

475
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,693
I got the bonus.

476
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,360
And Cooper gave me
some book by Ayn Rand.

477
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,303
He seemed assured, as I hope you are,

478
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,000
that I have a significant
investment in this company.

479
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,442
Well, you do now, don't you?

480
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,750
It matters to me that you're impressed.

481
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,120
I am.

482
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,182
Self-worth and status.

483
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,226
You said it.

484
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,001
Thanksgiving.

485
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,803
It's very n-nerve-wracking,

486
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:13,077
having to deal with getting
the family together.

487
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,381
My m... My mother didn't...

488
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:20,617
cook last year
because she was so sick.

489
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,990
And now I'm going
to have to deal with Gloria.

490
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,996
But it is Thanksgiving, and...

491
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,436
I'm grateful for things.

492
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,174
Like this.

493
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:44,510
This has helped.

494
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,675
Don doesn't think so, but it has.

495
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,221
Being able to talk.

496
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:59,524
Just... Just me and you
and your little pad.

497
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,130
It has helped.

498
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,961
Still, I...

499
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:12,771
I can't help but think
that I would be happy

500
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,108
if my husband was faithful to me.

501
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,350
My brother's children are
very badly behaved, and...

502
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,861
he spanks them.

503
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:35,830
Don has never laid a hand on the kids.

504
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,265
He's kind inside.

505
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,398
But outside, it...

506
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,243
it's all there in my face every day.

507
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,506
The hotel rooms.

508
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,579
Sometimes perfume...

509
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:03,482
or worse.

510
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,826
He doesn't know what family is.

511
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,392
He doesn't even have one.

512
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,603
It makes me sorry for him...

513
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,137
when in fact I...

514
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,010
I should be angry...

515
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,641
very angry, you know?

516
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:34,189
But I put up with it, like some ostrich.

517
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,855
It's interesting, isn't it?

518
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,691
The way he m...

519
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,784
he makes love...

520
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,228
sometimes it's what I want.

521
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:23,630
But sometimes it's obviously
what someone else wants.

522
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,025
I suppose it means I'm not enough.

523
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,065
But maybe it...

524
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,503
it's just him.

525
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:10,046
Don Draper and Salvatore Romano,

526
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,782
this is Joe Harriman and Lynn Taylor.

527
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,255
No Eastmans today, unfortunately.

528
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,689
They're all back in the lab.

529
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,990
It's a wonderful facility,
but they don't take vacations.

530
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,121
What do they show,
slides of them working?

531
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,968
So have you figured out a way
to work the wheel into it?

532
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,197
We know it's hard

533
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:30,739
because wheels aren't really seen
as exciting technology,

534
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,240
even though they are the original.

535
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:38,213
Well, technology is a glittering lure,

536
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,510
but there's the rare occasion

537
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,019
when the public can be engaged
on the level beyond flash,

538
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:48,956
if they have a sentimental
bond with the product.

539
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:53,291
My first job,
I was in house at a fur company

540
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:57,128
with this old pro copyrighter,
a Greek named Teddy.

541
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:03,173
And Teddy told me the most
important idea in advertising is "new. "

542
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,936
Creates an itch.

543
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,738
You simply put your product in there

544
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,279
as a kind of... calamine lotion.

545
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:16,714
He also talked about a deeper bond
with the product.

546
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,152
Nostalgia.

547
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,419
It's delicate...

548
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,653
but potent.

549
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,127
Sweetheart.

550
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,206
Teddy told me that in Greek,

551
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:44,805
nostalgia literally means
the pain from an old wound.

552
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,981
It's a twinge in your heart

553
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,490
far more powerful than memory alone.

554
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,759
This device...

555
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:02,889
isn't a space ship.

556
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,264
It's a time machine.

557
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,273
It goes backwards, forwards.

558
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:22,616
It takes us to a place
where we ache to go again.

559
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,557
It's not called the Wheel.

560
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,359
It's called the Carousel.

561
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:43,136
It lets us travel the way a child travels.

562
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:48,338
Around and around
and back home again...

563
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,981
to a place where we know
we are loved.

564
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,383
Good luck at your next meeting.

565
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,390
Don, I have to warn you, I'm not alone.

566
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:41,930
It was beautiful.

567
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,557
<i>Congratulations, mein Kommandant.</i>

568
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,965
They called from the lobby.

569
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,800
They cancelled their other meetings,
including DDB.

570
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,237
Not just a victory for us.

571
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,466
It's a victory for civilization.

572
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,873
There's also more celebrating.

573
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:56,878
Mr. Campbell, here,
your father-in-law called.

574
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,811
He'll be in before Christmas.

575
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,747
I've got to get married.

576
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,247
No, thank you. I'm good.

577
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:10,424
Here's how.

578
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:11,585
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

579
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,996
You know what, Pete?

580
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,730
I've got a way for you
to turn this account into a home run.

581
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,170
He's on a roll.

582
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:24,638
Clearasil.

583
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,767
You know who buys that?

584
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,606
Young girls.

585
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,840
What a difference it makes in their lives
to be blemish-free.

586
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,746
I believe it does.

587
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,218
We have the perfect writer for that.

588
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,788
Peggy Olsen.

589
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,885
That's funny.

590
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,428
Freddy Rumsen and I were both
very impressed with her insight.

591
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,393
Freddy Rumsen.

592
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,828
- If I can weigh in...
- No.

593
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:49,398
Come on. That Belle Jolie thing.

594
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,525
Plus you should have seen her
in that booth yesterday.

595
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,227
She was like Kinsey but with balls.

596
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:55,928
Stop joking already, will you, Don?

597
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,336
Excuse me?

598
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,932
This is my father-in-law.

599
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:01,738
He's expecting the very best.

600
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,245
I'm expecting the very best,

601
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,977
not some little girl who'll walk away.

602
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,384
You'll have to give back
that copy of Ayn Rand.

603
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,513
Do you know how hard I worked
to get this account?

604
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,716
Who the hell is she?

605
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,656
Peggy is not even a copywriter.

606
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,818
She's a... a secretary.

607
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,895
Peggy!

608
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,657
Yes, Mr. Draper?

609
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,825
Miss Olsen, you are now a junior copywriter.

610
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:29,497
Your first account will be delivering
Clearasil to the spotted masses.

611
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:30,732
What?

612
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,502
Don't act surprised.

613
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:35,009
Is this really happening?

614
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,040
Yes, it is.

615
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,847
My goodness.

616
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:46,021
I will do my sincere best.

617
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,852
Good to hear.

618
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,691
Mr. Campbell, here,
will brief you after the holiday.

619
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,963
Of course.

620
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,662
That'll be all.

621
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,536
Thank you, Mr. Draper.

622
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:12,047
I said congratulations, didn't I?

623
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,845
Although sometimes when
people get what they want,

624
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,147
they realize how limited
their goals were.

625
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,552
So I guess I'll put you
in with Victor Manning.

626
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,556
David Steuben got fired.

627
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:22,920
Fired?

628
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:24,493
People hated his work.

629
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:27,093
Will I get business cards?

630
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,457
Please make all your
requests through Bridget.

631
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,500
Of course.

632
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,161
Peggy, I know you a little.

633
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,865
Remember, just because
you now have a door,

634
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,169
don't forget that once you didn't.

635
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,040
Think of the other girls,
or they won't think of you.

636
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:46,905
Vic Manning, I'd like you
to meet Peggy Olsen.

637
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,348
She'll be taking Mr. Steuben's desk.

638
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,851
Nice to meet you.

639
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,488
I don't feel so swell.

640
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,182
I think I should go home.

641
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,159
I have to stop eating off the cart.

642
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,230
If you're trying to find
a way to go out and celebrate,

643
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,797
you should ask your secretary
to cover for you.

644
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,127
Very funny.

645
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,263
Happy Thanksgiving.

646
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,359
You, too, Joan.

647
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,735
David and I had a deal.

648
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,432
No meetings in here, okay?

649
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,599
And no music.

650
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,884
What can we do for you today?

651
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,654
My stomach hurts really bad.

652
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,458
I think I had a bad sandwich.

653
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,429
Let's take a look.

654
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:46,308
Oh, my God.

655
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:50,847
Honey, you didn't mention
that you were expecting.

656
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,643
What?

657
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,478
You're going to be a mother.

658
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,517
That's impossible.

659
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,150
You want us to call your husband
or your boyfriend?

660
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:06,789
I don't understand.

661
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,330
Stop talking.

662
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,296
Now listen, we're going
to get you up to Maternity.

663
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,805
No. No, that's not possible.

664
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,314
Do you feel that?

665
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,888
My God!

666
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,295
We need a wheelchair.

667
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,798
It hurts!

668
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,765
It's going to be okay, all right?

669
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,427
We just want you to calm down.

670
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:48,435
You don't understand.

671
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,369
We need a wheelchair!

672
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:56,510
Call Dr. Wilson in Psychiatry.

673
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,581
Oh.

674
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,353
Hello, darling.

675
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:17,760
Oh, were they having
a party at the office?

676
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:18,892
Yes.

677
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,437
I think I should...

678
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,972
lie down.

679
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,634
That's a good idea.

680
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,802
Sure. Rest up.

681
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,005
But make sure you're awake later.

682
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,741
Daddy!

683
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,976
Would you like to try to feed him?

684
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,849
Don't you want
to hold him, sweetheart?

685
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,291
Hello?

686
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,231
Don?

687
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,009
What are you doing here?

688
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,477
Daddy! Are you coming with us?

689
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,981
No, he isn't. Daddy has to work.

690
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,949
But you can drive us
to the station.

691
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:17,417
I haven't called the taxi yet.

692
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,988
I'm coming with you.

693
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:23,255
Really?

694
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,225
You are?

695
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:26,852
I'll pack the car.

696
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,555
We'll be there before midnight.

697
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:36,961
Daddy's coming with you.

698
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:37,971
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

699
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,569
Oh, my goodness.

700
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,146
Hello?

701
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,887
Hello.
