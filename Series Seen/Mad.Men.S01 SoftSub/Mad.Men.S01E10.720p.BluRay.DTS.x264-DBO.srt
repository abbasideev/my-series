1
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,173
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
running in the house.

2
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:47,245
Grandpa's here! And Aunt Gloria!

3
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,447
If I leave, can you
keep your mouth shut?

4
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,355
Elizabeth, are you hiding
your sugar bowl from me?

5
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:07,125
Gene, I think I have some packets
from Howard Johnson's.

6
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:08,392
No, no.

7
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,129
Daddy, have a saccharine or nothing.

8
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:14,034
Where is your sugar bowl?

9
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:17,540
Do you want to wake up
with a cold leg like Grandpa Herman?

10
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:20,339
Diabetics don't live long,
and sometimes they lose their legs.

11
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:24,440
Grandpa!

12
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,744
Good morning.

13
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:28,376
Good to see you, Gene.

14
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,455
Don.

15
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,216
This is my friend Gloria.

16
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:33,757
I heard you might be joining us.

17
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:36,987
It's good to have another woman around,
give Betty a break.

18
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:38,528
Oh, I live to serve.

19
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,257
Hey, you heard that, right?

20
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:41,559
I have a witness.

21
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,295
She's a hell of a sport.

22
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,837
Don, will you help me with the suitcase?

23
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:48,929
We're only going for the weekend.

24
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,204
I can't get it out of the closet.

25
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,905
Honestly, it's unseemly.

26
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:56,480
I can imagine everyone at the club.

27
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:59,141
"Was she waiting at the funeral
unbuttoning her top button

28
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:01,082
like for some Sadie Hawkins dance?"

29
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:03,381
She seems like a perfectly nice lady.

30
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,185
What am I supposed
to do with this, fill it with hay?

31
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,623
How far do you want to go with this?

32
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:11,059
Oh, I'll say you talked me out of it.

33
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,597
She's a vulture.

34
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,894
Her husband was a failure.

35
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:19,528
When he died, they found out
he'd cheated on his income taxes.

36
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:21,606
And her kids...
Louise never married.

37
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:25,302
Two more years and she'll be
hanging out at funerals, too.

38
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,844
Huntley... he was my brother's age.

39
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:29,174
He was always "funny. "

40
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:33,274
Birdie, your father
was married, what, 40 years?

41
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:36,786
The man can hardly fix himself a cup of tea,
let alone do laundry.

42
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:38,753
All he needs is a housekeeper.

43
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:40,290
A housekeeper goes home at night.

44
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:41,518
Don.

45
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,287
Let him have it.

46
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,490
And that fake smile.

47
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:48,930
You've been looking
forward to the beach.

48
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,160
Let her cook.

49
00:02:50,268 --> 00:02:52,293
Let your father
put some stones by that wall

50
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,998
so we stop getting water
underneath the deck.

51
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:57,200
I guess I won't have to
worry about talking to her.

52
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:59,436
She never stops.

53
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,512
Just get through today.

54
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:04,104
I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

55
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,116
We'll go to that place
with the lobster rolls.

56
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,448
Just come now.

57
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:13,013
You hate the way I drive...
but my father taught me.

58
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,650
Half the office is cleared out.

59
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,026
<i>It's Kennedy, Kennedy,
Kennedy, Kennedy</i>

60
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,570
<i>Kennedy, Kennedy, Ken-nedy for me</i>

61
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,333
<i>Do you like a man
who has some spritz?</i>

62
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,341
<i>A man who's always fair</i>

63
00:03:31,443 --> 00:03:33,673
<i>We'll wager him against the others</i>

64
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,838
<i>And when you compare</i>

65
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:37,778
It looks like a Maypo ad.

66
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,578
It's incredible.

67
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:41,151
Happy days are here again.

68
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,153
I'm just wild about Harry.

69
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,655
It's light, it's fun,

70
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:49,557
it doesn't cloud the mind with,
I don't know, issues?

71
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:50,719
And it's catchy.

72
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,296
It's catchy like it gets in your head

73
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:54,388
and makes you want
to blow your brains out.

74
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,331
The president is a product, don't forget that.

75
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:07,973
<i>I would like to talk to you for a moment
about dollars and cents.</i>

76
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,979
<i>Your dollars and cents.</i>

77
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,811
<i>Now, my opponents want to increase
federal expenditures</i>

78
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,386
<i>as much as $18 billion a year.</i>

79
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:17,978
<i>How will they pay for it?</i>

80
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,852
<i>There are only two ways.</i>

81
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,585
<i>One is to raise your taxes.</i>

82
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:22,955
Turn it off.

83
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,323
<i>The other...</i>

84
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:30,329
An ad made by
a public relations team.

85
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,460
Message received and forgotten.

86
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:36,098
We should give this
to Franz for some music.

87
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,405
Nixon's campaign song in the key of E.

88
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:42,207
Ethel, go get the ice pick

89
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:46,416
That Nixon guy is on TV again

90
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,850
Should have never been this close.

91
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,685
I'd say we could run them again,
but I don't think you want to see them.

92
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:54,759
Oh, I've seen them.

93
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,658
Which reminds me, you people are not
watching enough television.

94
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,560
It is your job. The shows and the ads.

95
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:01,689
I was just wondering,

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,463
there must be any number of people
harvesting mud on Johnny Kennedy right now.

97
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,764
Have we heard anything?

98
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,339
We hear things. Nothing useful.

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,338
He's a womanizer.

100
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:10,840
That's not going to hurt him.

101
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:13,069
Women find out about that,
it'll push him over the top.

102
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,146
Nixon is still ahead in the polls.

103
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:18,114
Should have never been this close.

104
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:22,118
Why do we need to attack
when there is a story to tell?

105
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:25,416
Kennedy: Nouveau riche,

106
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,992
recent immigrant who bought his way
into Harvard.

107
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,789
And now he's well-bred? Great.

108
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,831
Nixon is from nothing.

109
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:37,060
A self-made man,
the Abe Lincoln of California,

110
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:38,795
who was Vice President of the United States

111
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:41,634
six years after getting out of the Navy.

112
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,469
Kennedy? I see a silver spoon.

113
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:47,204
Nixon? I see myself.

114
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,440
If we were to run a critical ad,
there are obvious benefits.

115
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,176
When you run an ad that's positive,

116
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:53,945
you're only convincing people
who are already voting for you.

117
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:55,212
But when you run an ad that's critical,

118
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,753
you get a shot
at the people on the fence.

119
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,914
There are a lot of people
on the fence.

120
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,084
Gentlemen, whether the Nixon campaign
wants it or not,

121
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:06,562
we have to produce a spot
that aims a Howitzer at Kennedy's balls.

122
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,860
I want to hear ideas.

123
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,298
After the long weekend.

124
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:13,997
I agree. Let's go down swinging.

125
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,475
If we can switch to a conversation
about paying clients,

126
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,738
Menken's is coming in today
to sign off on the roll out.

127
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,005
Father and daughter.

128
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:26,880
I get the feeling old Abe Schmenken
can kill this whole thing.

129
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,646
Of course, the checks
have cleared already,

130
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:32,689
but... Don, I want you to go in
and ride bare-back over Paul here.

131
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,190
Done.

132
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,226
And, uh, Don, I want you
on your best behavior.

133
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,231
Excuse me?

134
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,393
I know she bothers you.

135
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:00,250
Miss Holloway, may I?

136
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:07,184
I really need to get to the bottom of that.

137
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,587
Yes, I would like to get a look at those.

138
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,265
Margaret and Mona are off
to Block Island for Labor Day.

139
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:25,366
Gone for the weekend
along with every other wife in town.

140
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,705
We can go anywhere tonight.

141
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,369
We can see a Broadway show,

142
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,745
then sit at any table at The Colony
with our clothes off if we want to.

143
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,114
How about a movie?

144
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,709
<i>Have you seen The Apartment?</i>

145
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,879
I went last week
with Mona and Margaret.

146
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,820
I heard Shirley MacLaine is good.

147
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:40,891
Oh, please.

148
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,857
A white elevator operator?

149
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,292
And a girl at that?

150
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,125
I want to work at that place.

151
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:47,823
Oh, I bet you do.

152
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:49,559
The way those men treated that poor girl,

153
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,636
handing her around
like a tray of canapes.

154
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:54,170
She tried to commit suicide.

155
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,069
So you saw it, huh?

156
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,743
Ah, Red, that's not how it is.

157
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:00,742
Look, it was crude.

158
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,540
That's the way pictures are now.

159
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:05,343
<i>You see that ridiculous Psycho?</i>

160
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,611
Hollywood isn't happy
unless things are extreme.

161
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,653
It didn't seem that extreme to me.

162
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,779
Are we actually going
to get in a fight over a movie?

163
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,656
You know, Mona had a dream once
where I hit the dog with the car.

164
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,729
She was mad at me all day,
and I never hit the dog.

165
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,196
We don't even have a dog.

166
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:24,963
Why don't I call you later?

167
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,833
Uh, Joannie...

168
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,168
Call me soon,
because we can go anywhere.

169
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:32,835
The new atrium will make the store
brighter and more vibrant.

170
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,172
The aisles will be wider,

171
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,043
spotlighting these
new chrome display cases.

172
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,139
Over here will be a new restaurant...

173
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,478
An elegant tea room.

174
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:43,315
Modern classic signs
and champagne linens.

175
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:47,949
A tea room is nice,
but 30% of my ground floor

176
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,789
is devoted to the restaurant business?

177
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:54,353
Lunch and Shopping: A day of indulgence.
It's what ladies like.

178
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,230
Yes, I saw that in the chapter here.

179
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,633
It's much longer than the little schedule

180
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:04,107
that says we have to close our doors
while it's getting nailed together.

181
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,336
Three months of construction,

182
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:10,380
during which time
we build enormous anticipation.

183
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,245
Like a movie premier.

184
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,011
The New Menken's.

185
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,212
You will have a line that first day.

186
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,188
Even if you have to pay
people to stand in it.

187
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,382
We'll do whatever it takes.

188
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,689
Mr. Draper, my daughter's presence here

189
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:26,263
should let you know that
I am not against change.

190
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:28,559
And let us assume that this is the most

191
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,466
amazing idea in retail
since "buy one get one free. "

192
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:34,867
I still don't understand

193
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:38,602
why we have to throw out
the baby with the water.

194
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,907
Can't I keep what I have
and just build on it?

195
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:49,181
Well, honestly, the unpleasant truth
is you don't have anything.

196
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:53,053
Your customers cannot
be depended on anymore.

197
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,125
Their lives have changed.

198
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,659
They're prosperous.

199
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:01,596
Over the years,
they've developed new tastes.

200
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:03,894
They're like your daughter:

201
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:07,403
Educated, sophisticated.

202
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:12,533
They know full well what they deserve,
and they're willing to pay for it.

203
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:16,705
Why would I want to own a store
that I wouldn't want to shop in?

204
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,682
Mr. Menken, I don't know if that's true.

205
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:23,242
You had no problem abandoning
that second-floor hosiery store

206
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:25,151
on 7th Avenue
for your present location.

207
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:28,453
And that's a story you'll be proud
to tell your grandchildren.

208
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,461
The only problem is they won't care.

209
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:35,363
As much as Grandpa
likes that marble palace,

210
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,263
I can promise you, they won't.

211
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,700
They'll look at it and they'll say,

212
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,671
"Grandpa, it must have been hard
back in the olden days. "

213
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,708
And it was.

214
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,608
Everybody's jumping to forget it.

215
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:52,911
Excuse me, but this is not
some phony story

216
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:55,383
you people print in your
Fourth of July circulars.

217
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:58,614
My father actually started with nothing,

218
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:01,385
and he made it into everything
we're talking about.

219
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:04,552
Who here can say that?

220
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:06,391
I meant no disrespect, sir.

221
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:08,089
None taken.

222
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,795
This is the plan, Daddy.

223
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,098
As you can see,
it wasn't just thrown together.

224
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,696
It does seem very well thought out.

225
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,708
It is.

226
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,607
Pleasure to finally meet you.

227
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:28,015
I hope you two know
what you're doing.

228
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,487
Looks like we both get to keep our jobs
a little while longer.

229
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:35,923
Don't screw this up.

230
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,188
I think he likes me.

231
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:41,823
I guarantee you there is nothing
about you he likes.

232
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,696
What about you?

233
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:48,239
Daddy, can we?

234
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,101
This place reminds me
of a Czarist Ministry.

235
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,647
No matter what the decision,
you don't feel it was yours.

236
00:11:56,748 --> 00:12:00,878
Fortunately, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

237
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,419
He's very good. Persuasive.

238
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,886
Yes.

239
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:09,050
A little... dashing for my taste.

240
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,203
Carol, it's 10:30.

241
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:23,331
Did we have lunch,
because even I can't leave this early.

242
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,306
No, I needed to talk to you.

243
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,140
Why aren't you at work?

244
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,372
Don't tell me you're late again.

245
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,845
Do you need to see Dr. Emerson?

246
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,439
No. Good grief, Joan.

247
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,448
Then what?

248
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,246
You walked 12 blocks in a heat wave.

249
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:37,981
And I see you didn't take my advice
about the dress shields.

250
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:42,785
You know how Mr. Aldridge
has had me reading the slush pile?

251
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:44,384
Yes, writing the rejection letters.

252
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,520
You told me. It was depressing.

253
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:49,498
I'm so stupid!

254
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,728
This morning
in the submissions meeting,

255
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:56,136
the editorial director
asks why we haven't responded

256
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,731
to this poet from Yale, Marlon Rice.

257
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:02,006
Mr. Aldridge tells him we never saw it.

258
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:06,379
The the director asks me,
and I cover for Mr. Aldridge.

259
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:09,681
I said that I had read it and rejected it.

260
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:12,756
Then they made Mr. Aldridge fire me.

261
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,347
Oh, honey, that's awful.

262
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,086
He was really sorry about it.

263
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,754
- Of course. That SOB.
- I know.

264
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:22,026
I'm going to have to ask
my dad for more money again.

265
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,294
- It's humiliating.
- Stop it.

266
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:27,337
You shouldn't be embarrassed.
There's never enough money.

267
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,906
You always seem to manage.

268
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:30,997
These men.

269
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:33,202
We're constantly building them up.

270
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,573
And for what?

271
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,203
Dinner, jewelry.

272
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:37,872
Who cares?

273
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,813
We need to go out
and shake all this gloominess.

274
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:43,683
All I want to do is sit
in the movies and cry.

275
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,255
No movies.

276
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,586
Let's look for some actual bachelors.

277
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,250
Empty their wallets.

278
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,725
I hate Manhattan sometimes.

279
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,693
Don't say that.

280
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,765
This city is everything.

281
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,765
Where's Howdy Dowdy at?

282
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,306
What can I do for you?

283
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,899
I just got off the phone with Brett Rowley
at Dr. Scholl's.

284
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,741
Don't tell me they're coming in again
about the exercise sandals.

285
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:10,939
Did you tell them summer's over?

286
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,609
They're not coming in. Ever.

287
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:14,707
They're going to Leo Burnett.

288
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:16,719
What? Why didn't he call me?

289
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:19,790
Probably because they were
disappointed with the creative.

290
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,449
Rowley called it dull and humorless.

291
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,050
- And what did you say?
- What could I say?

292
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:25,459
I've never lost an account before.

293
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,531
Especially one that was here before I got here.

294
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:29,259
So you really put up a fight?

295
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,927
He had very strong feelings.

296
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,594
Said some unpleasant things.

297
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:36,571
Which you don't remember
or I'm sure you'd tell me.

298
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:43,837
The day you sign a client
is the day you start losing them.

299
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,379
Are you going to tell
Sterling or should I?

300
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:52,752
Unless you think it can wait
until after the weekend.

301
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,586
I'll take care of it.

302
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:08,330
Were you buzzing me?

303
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,771
My intercom was making
a funny sound.

304
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,336
Leave it.

305
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,673
Do you wear Dr. Scholl's inserts?

306
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,977
I thought we all had to.

307
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:21,676
Take them out.

308
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,453
Get rid of this, please.

309
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:37,266
We lost Dr. Scholl's.

310
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,461
Where?

311
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,468
Leo Burnett.

312
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:45,099
Campbell enjoyed telling me
it was something to do with creative.

313
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,233
I thought I should tell you.

314
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,811
Make sure the ink is dry on that raise.

315
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:50,278
That fat piece of shit.

316
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:51,939
He's a cigarette ash.

317
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,313
Chicago. What a joke.

318
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,147
Small time.

319
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:58,518
Sorry, maybe you're from there.

320
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:02,115
<i>Well, I know I didn't drop the ball on this.</i>

321
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,420
Sales were steady.

322
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:07,965
It probably didn't help that our billings
crept up for no apparent reason.

323
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:12,229
Eventually, an accountant
is going to read the mail.

324
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,236
If you're trying to cheer me up,
it's working.

325
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:17,466
The day you sign a client
is the day you start losing them.

326
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:18,701
You don't really believe that.

327
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,242
You know what my father
used to say?

328
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:23,040
Being with a client
is like being in a marriage.

329
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,808
Sometimes you get into it
for the wrong reasons

330
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,349
and eventually,
they hit you in the face.

331
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,715
Damn it.

332
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,154
Are we supposed to cry about this?

333
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:36,192
So we lost an account.

334
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:37,955
That means we'll just have to cut back.

335
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:39,393
Let's go fire somebody.

336
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,393
It's Labor Day weekend.

337
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:48,700
Between now and Monday
we have to fall in love a dozen times.

338
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,240
Betty's at the shore.
I'm headed down tomorrow.

339
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,139
What do we work so hard for?

340
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:55,474
To have enough money
to buy fabulous vacations

341
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,377
for our families so we can live it up here.

342
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,779
Give me tonight. You owe me that.

343
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,444
I can use you as bait.

344
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:05,613
There's a casting call at 4:00.

345
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,748
Double-sided aluminum.

346
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,018
If Freddie Rumsen's brain works

347
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,219
the way I think it works,
slow and obvious,

348
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,230
I think we should go down to casting
and see who's on the couch.

349
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,857
Remember, Don,
when God closes a door,

350
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:18,629
he opens a dress.

351
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,137
What do you have there?
Precious cargo?

352
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,907
Mr. Rumsen has me trafficking
the Belle Jolie pouch.

353
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,073
Aren't you a busy beaver?

354
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:35,710
Hey, I'm talking to you.

355
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:38,783
If you want to see the proofs,

356
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,652
you'll have to check with Mr. Cosgrove.

357
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:41,747
It's his account.

358
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,192
Look at you. Minister of Protocol.

359
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,287
So has Draper talked to Sterling yet?

360
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:48,729
You'll have to ask him.

361
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,822
I'm asking you.

362
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,300
You should talk to him.

363
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:53,700
What's wrong with you?

364
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:55,897
Excuse me?

365
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:58,976
I'm just trying to do my job
and you're making it very difficult.

366
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,043
Peggy, dear.

367
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:01,805
I think I understand what this is about.

368
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,642
But you're not being professional right now.

369
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,081
I cannot believe
I am in this conversation.

370
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:10,153
You think this is easy for me?

371
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,279
I don't know.

372
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,622
I don't know if you like me
or if you don't like me.

373
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,888
I'm just trying to get along here.

374
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:25,595
And every time walk by, I wonder,
are you going to be nice to me?

375
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,365
- Or cruel.
- Cruel?

376
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:30,633
What am I supposed to say?

377
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:32,766
I'm married.

378
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,208
Yes, I know.

379
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:38,009
And I heard all about
how confusing that can be.

380
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:41,915
Maybe you need me to lay on your couch
to clear that up for you again?

381
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,855
That's some imagination you've got.

382
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,117
Good thing you're a writer now.

383
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,785
What do you need me for?

384
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,464
It's incredible.

385
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,402
I mean, we're just hanging out
in the art department

386
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:03,871
and you two wander in.

387
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,032
We thought it was casting.

388
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,110
I wish it was.

389
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:08,701
I'd definitely pick you two.

390
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:11,111
I mean, you have
such an exquisite look.

391
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,113
The bones of your face.

392
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:15,151
And your sister, my goodness.

393
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:18,688
You two look very different
when you pay attention.

394
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:21,257
I have an older brother.

395
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,054
My neighbors growing up had a dairy,

396
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,492
and one of the cows
gave birth to two calves

397
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:26,858
that were attached at the back.

398
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:28,431
Then they cut them apart,

399
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:31,524
but they always wanted
to be together.

400
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,125
Is that what happened to you two?

401
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:37,766
Do you like Ukrainian food?

402
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,706
Let me ask you something, Draper.

403
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,539
Do any of these men
have anything else to do?

404
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:44,842
Just wanted to make sure
the girls were, you know...

405
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,576
Matching?

406
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,447
Exactly.

407
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,153
Well, there you have it, Draper...

408
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,196
double-sided aluminum
as envisioned by Sterling Cooper.

409
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,533
Look at you.

410
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,106
Roger Sterling.

411
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,641
Eleanor. Eleanor Ames.

412
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:16,671
What a great God that made two of you.

413
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:19,515
Oh, what a sweet thing to say.

414
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:22,017
Um, Mirabelle.

415
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,518
This is Donald Draper.

416
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,020
He's our creative director here.

417
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:28,489
What a pleasure to meet you.

418
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:31,425
Well, honestly...

419
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:33,554
I think we're going to send
everyone else home

420
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,996
and use our authority to say that you two

421
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,126
are the new faces of Cartwright
Double-Sided Aluminum.

422
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:41,227
Oh, my God. Thank you.

423
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,499
I think this calls for a celebration.

424
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:44,972
Come on upstairs with us.

425
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:47,600
One drink could be fun.

426
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,803
One last question.

427
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,403
How many birthdays have you had?

428
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,482
20.

429
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,481
How about her?

430
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:01,054
You're coming, aren't you, Don?

431
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,734
Aren't you two a pair of bookends.

432
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,399
What do you say, Draper?

433
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:20,739
Shall we cast them in bronze
and mount them on the credenza?

434
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:22,073
Oh, my.

435
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,704
Everything he says
means something else, too.

436
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,676
It did get warm in here.

437
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:29,218
They shut the air off at 5:00.

438
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,380
Oh, Rochester, get her
an extra ice cube or something.

439
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:39,696
So... Mirabelle,
what's your special talent?

440
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:43,961
Singing, dancing, baton twirling?

441
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,695
I ride. Mostly dressage.

442
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:49,068
She has a wall full of blue ribbons
back home in Winchester.

443
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,573
Huh. You know, I have
a few awards myself.

444
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:57,011
Look at your skin. It's translucent.

445
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:59,844
That's "see-through. "

446
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,645
Can I touch it?

447
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,082
I don't see why not.

448
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,419
After all, I do work here now.

449
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,892
That tickles.

450
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,524
Soft as a lamb's ear.

451
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:20,160
Mm, you've got to feel this.

452
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:22,102
I'm talking to you, Eleanor.

453
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:33,081
Do you love your sister?

454
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:35,117
Of course.

455
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:36,550
Why don't you show her how much?

456
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:37,916
Give her a kiss.

457
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,785
Right now.

458
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:46,688
Why do people always ask us that?

459
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:49,766
My God, because
it's a beautiful thing.

460
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:55,336
Well... I should be heading home.

461
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,771
<i>Wunderbar. Have a great night.</i>

462
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,740
You know what?
I think we should go, too.

463
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:00,775
Oh, come on.

464
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,278
Nobody's going anywhere.

465
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,007
Do you want to dance?

466
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,810
That's nice.

467
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,316
Dance for us.

468
00:23:10,754 --> 00:23:12,551
I don't dance.

469
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,687
Sure you do. Look at that.

470
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:23,030
I feel like I'm stuck
somewhere between Doris Day

471
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:26,034
<i>in Pillow Talk and Midnight Lace,</i>

472
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:29,162
when what I need to be is Kim Novak
in just about anything.

473
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:31,605
You're prettier than Kim Novak.

474
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:32,937
What a rut.

475
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:36,137
1960, I am so over you.

476
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:37,213
Zip?

477
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:43,784
Shalimar?

478
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:46,048
Too much?

479
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:49,250
You never say die, do you?

480
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,418
What's the point?

481
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,627
Oh, Carol, sweetie, it's not that bad.

482
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,497
Tomorrow is another day.

483
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,763
I know.

484
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,168
I'm okay, actually.

485
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:03,239
Good.

486
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,331
No waterworks. Mascara.

487
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,501
I'm just so happy right now.

488
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,408
Okay, are you on the Gilbey's already?

489
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:12,846
No. I just love this, you know?

490
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,440
Being with you.

491
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:17,281
We do know how to have fun, don't we?

492
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:20,653
Joan...

493
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,584
I love you.

494
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:27,459
I really do.

495
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:28,758
You.

496
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,200
That first week in college,

497
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,671
I saw you walking on the commons,

498
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:42,872
and I thought, "Who is she?"

499
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:48,607
Then college was over
and you came here...

500
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,913
and I followed you.

501
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:55,387
You needed a roommate.

502
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:57,255
I moved in.

503
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,891
Just to be near you.

504
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,969
I did everything I could to be near you.

505
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,369
All with the hope

506
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:14,775
that one day... you would notice me.

507
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:20,250
Joannie...

508
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:25,947
just think of me as a boy.

509
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:39,058
You've had a hard day.

510
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,661
Let's go out and try
to forget about it, okay?

511
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,736
Of course.

512
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:51,508
Good, because I'm starving.

513
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,857
They seem to be having a lot of fun.

514
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,613
Do you have any gum?

515
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:31,184
No. No, I don't.

516
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,489
Listen, I should get going.

517
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:39,187
Over to the left there. There ya go.

518
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:40,923
Don't make me use my spurs on ya.

519
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,464
Easy.

520
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:46,534
Right over there by the trough.

521
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,942
I really should go.

522
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:01,748
Eleanor.

523
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:04,719
I'll be right outside.

524
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:06,483
Let her go.

525
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,987
Listen... let me call you a car.

526
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,727
I should wait for my sister.

527
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:22,363
I mean, I've been around
the block a few times,

528
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:25,270
but her...

529
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,401
Now all you're thinking about
is going around the block, huh?

530
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:34,608
I don't even think I can
get out of the driveway.

531
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:37,881
Please, just wait with me?

532
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:45,954
I like your office. It's really fancy.

533
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,588
Mirabelle. Love that name.

534
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,196
Listen to that.

535
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:54,361
I haven't heard Margaret laugh
since she was 7.

536
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,063
Who's Margaret?

537
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,698
My daughter.

538
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,710
Yeah, I think I like Mirabelle
better than Margaret.

539
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:04,542
I wanted to name her
Margaux, like the wine.

540
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:06,377
Lost that battle.

541
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:11,318
I'm sure she would have hated Margaux
almost as much as she hates Margaret.

542
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:14,151
Why is she so angry?

543
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:15,987
You're only a little older than her.

544
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,185
You're not angry.

545
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:21,590
Don't be sad.

546
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,293
I just wish I could talk to her
without her rolling her eyes.

547
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:28,894
Of course, she's right.

548
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:30,303
I have nothing to say to her.

549
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:32,466
I'm sure that's not so.

550
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:34,601
Girls love their fathers.

551
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:37,373
You have such beautiful skin.

552
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:39,642
My God, I just want to eat it.

553
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:43,445
I want to suck your blood like Dracula.

554
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:12,005
Aren't you two the sweetest
for walking us up?

555
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,707
You should be roommates.

556
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:15,910
He seems to be a delightful young man.

557
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,919
Ralph, you don't teach at Fordham also?

558
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:20,182
No, we were just sitting
next to each other at the bar.

559
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,190
And it seemed to be working.

560
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,522
Carol, you know what we need? Ice.

561
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:27,791
Now where is that gin hiding?

562
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,095
Just so we're clear about what's what...
the redhead is mine.

563
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,795
So, Franklin, you're into language.

564
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:36,031
Yes, well, it's kind of a hobby of mine.

565
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:38,471
I do carpentry. I'm building a dry sink.

566
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:39,940
I love language.

567
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:42,978
Words and their ways.

568
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,275
Well, this is just bad speech.

569
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:46,940
I collect it.

570
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,985
There's this Polish janitor
in our building.

571
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,521
His name is Stash or Stanislaus.

572
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:56,456
He's locked me out of my office
on more than one occasion.

573
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,466
One time, he described his bride
as "not speaking real good English. "

574
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,133
I cherish that gift.

575
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:11,503
Put that in a book and sell it.

576
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:13,667
Well, this is a party, isn't it?

577
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,710
I was wondering if I could
impose on the professor

578
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:22,307
for one more teeny favor.

579
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,786
I never say "no" to a beautiful girl.

580
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:27,789
The light fixture in my room is out.

581
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:30,018
Could you change it for me?

582
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,322
I'm up to that task.

583
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:36,527
We don't have a lot of men around here.

584
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:43,803
Oh, it's not that dark.

585
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:51,113
Well... what are we going to do?

586
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,524
Whatever you want.

587
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:09,357
You're married, aren't you?

588
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:12,629
Yes. Yes, I am.

589
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:15,796
Yeah, you kiss like a married man.

590
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:18,340
Your own way, no talking you out of it.

591
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,273
Is that good or bad?

592
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:23,505
Oh, it's good.

593
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:27,276
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

594
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:34,813
Maybe it's this office,
but... you are selling too hard.

595
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,993
Eleanor! Hello?

596
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:41,155
Ellie, where are you? Something's wrong!

597
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:47,703
Your friend... Something's wrong.

598
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:50,170
I knew I shouldn't have asked him
to do it a second time.

599
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:52,935
Jesus.

600
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:56,638
L... I feel like
there's a tank on my chest.

601
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,946
Just call an ambulance, and then leave.

602
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:02,518
Is he okay?

603
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:05,446
Leave.

604
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:06,715
Right there!

605
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:23,630
Mirabelle...

606
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,435
Oh, Mirabelle.

607
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:32,408
Mona.

608
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:35,280
Your wife's name is Mona.

609
00:33:06,216 --> 00:33:08,013
How you doing?

610
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,618
All these years I thought
it would be the ulcer.

611
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:20,695
I did everything they told me.

612
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:24,096
Drank the cream, ate the butter,

613
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,192
then I get hit with a coronary.

614
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:33,933
Son of a bitch, it hurts.

615
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:37,013
Well, you're talking. That's good.

616
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:39,377
That's not what the doctors think.

617
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:44,882
Don...

618
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:47,320
do you believe in energy?

619
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:48,448
What do you mean?

620
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,860
Like the thing that
gives you get up and go?

621
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:56,660
No.

622
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,826
Like a human energy.

623
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:05,197
I don't know, a...

624
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:10,104
A soul?

625
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:13,307
What do you want to hear?

626
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:17,449
Jesus.

627
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:20,717
I've been living the last 20 years
like I'm on shore leave.

628
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:22,086
What the hell is that about?

629
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:23,921
It's living.

630
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:25,289
Just like you said.

631
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,257
God.

632
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:35,435
I wish I was going somewhere.

633
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:46,582
He's doing great.

634
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,275
Mona.

635
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,019
I love you so much, Mona.

636
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:00,460
Oh, God, I love you so much.

637
00:35:00,563 --> 00:35:03,361
I know. Sweetheart, I know.

638
00:35:16,913 --> 00:35:20,849
Listen to me, darling.

639
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,043
Margaret is outside.

640
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,518
- She needs to see you.
- No. No. No.

641
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,089
I can't let her see me like this.

642
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:33,592
Roger...

643
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:36,723
I'm getting her.

644
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,800
My goodness.

645
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:16,497
All this from selling toilet paper.

646
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:19,608
Mr. Cooper, where is everyone?

647
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:21,939
My roommate just
gave me the message.

648
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,171
Out.

649
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,008
It's the middle of the night.

650
00:36:25,115 --> 00:36:26,776
I'm not leaving you here.

651
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:28,578
You should go.

652
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,118
Thank you.

653
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,080
Suit yourself.

654
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:39,424
Miss Holloway, Roger Sterling
has suffered a heart attack.

655
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,622
What?

656
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:45,565
He survived it, and is currently
being hospitalized.

657
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,466
Now we need to immediately
send a telegram

658
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:50,471
to every one of our clients

659
00:36:50,573 --> 00:36:53,804
assuring them that business will not
be interrupted.

660
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,036
Of course.

661
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:58,637
This is the master client list...
names, addresses.

662
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:04,948
I'll read them out and you compose
the telegram, huh?

663
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:08,785
Carl McElroy.

664
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:11,918
President, Alpine Real Estate.

665
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,732
It's me, Bets.

666
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:21,030
Were you sleeping?

667
00:37:21,137 --> 00:37:22,502
<i>Not really.</i>

668
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:25,403
The kids are in bed with me.

669
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:28,409
Gloria and my father
made such a big deal

670
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:31,105
about having separate bedrooms.

671
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:33,808
Listen, Roger had a heart attack.

672
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,943
What?

673
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:38,111
Don, that's terrible.

674
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,416
<i>Is he going to be okay?</i>

675
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:43,686
The doctors basically
say they don't know.

676
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:45,658
Mona's with him.

677
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:47,423
<i>She must be a wreck.</i>

678
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,998
It's good that you're there.

679
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,535
<i>- About tomorrow...
- No, I understand.</i>

680
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:56,332
Well, what happened?

681
00:37:56,439 --> 00:38:00,500
He was at work.

682
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,271
He just keeled over.

683
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:04,869
<i>It was awful, actually.</i>

684
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,539
If the kids wouldn't be so heartbroken,

685
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:08,480
I'd come home now.

686
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,485
I don't want to be here.

687
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:15,956
You should have seen the two of them
in the kitchen tonight.

688
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:19,460
She was making some
pot roast with ketchup

689
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:24,090
<i>and my father started hovering
behind her, watching,</i>

690
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,328
<i>like he used to with my mother.</i>

691
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:29,962
How can he pretend
that she never existed?

692
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:32,837
I still pick up the phone sometimes to call her.

693
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,671
<i>I don't know, Bets.</i>

694
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,972
I know people say life goes on,

695
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:44,383
and it does.

696
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:46,819
But no one tells you
that's not a good thing.

697
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:50,484
<i>Why is that?</i>

698
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:54,051
I don't know.

699
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:56,290
Stop thinking about that.

700
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:59,163
I can't.

701
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,793
I try.

702
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:05,800
<i>Do you want me to come up there?</i>

703
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:10,070
No. There's nothing you can do.

704
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:14,240
<i>Okay. Give Mona my love.</i>

705
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,544
<i>And, Don...</i>

706
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:18,815
make sure you eat something.

707
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:25,988
How's he doing?

708
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,027
Not great.

709
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,529
What happened?

710
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,767
I don't know.

711
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:35,633
<i>Every Republican politician
wants you to believe</i>

712
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:39,469
<i>that Richard Nixon is, quote, experienced.</i>

713
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:41,908
<i>They even want you to believe
that he has actually</i>

714
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:43,911
<i>been making decisions
in the White House.</i>

715
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:46,481
<i>But listen to the man
who should know better:</i>

716
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,574
<i>The President of the United States...</i>

717
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:50,482
<i>I just wondered if you
could give us an example</i>

718
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:55,752
<i>of a major idea of his that you had adopted
in that role as the decider.</i>

719
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:57,587
<i>If you give me a week,
I might think of one.</i>

720
00:39:57,694 --> 00:39:58,956
<i>I don't remember.</i>

721
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:02,031
<i>At the same press conference,
President Eisenhower said:</i>

722
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:05,066
<i>No one can make
a decision except me.</i>

723
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:07,295
<i>For real leadership in the '60s,</i>

724
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:10,668
<i>help elect Senator
John F. Kennedy president.</i>

725
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:26,081
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

726
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:28,020
I got the telegram.

727
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:33,086
Let me in.

728
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,356
Are you okay?

729
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:37,262
No.

730
00:40:43,473 --> 00:40:46,840
You look terrible.

731
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:48,171
Can I get a drink?

732
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:49,676
Of course.

733
00:40:57,587 --> 00:41:00,579
Are you happy with the doctors?

734
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,954
I can have my father make a call.

735
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:06,254
I don't know. He's rich.

736
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:08,353
They seem to be taking care of him.

737
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:10,227
Is he okay?

738
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,733
You can tell me.
I'm not moving the account.

739
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:18,773
He's gray and weak.

740
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:25,778
His skin looks like paper.

741
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:29,181
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:32,152
He's your friend, isn't he?

743
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:33,517
What's the difference?

744
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:35,682
You don't want to lose him.

745
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,357
Don, don't.

746
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:43,830
What good is that going to do?

747
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:46,663
Is this, like, some solar eclipse?

748
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:49,567
The end of the world?
Just do whatever you want?

749
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:51,537
- I don't know.
- You do.

750
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,165
You're exhausted.

751
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:54,743
You need to sleep, that's all.

752
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:57,438
I just need to sit down.

753
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:06,920
Sit with me.

754
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:07,990
Why?

755
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:10,719
Because I feel like you're looking
right through me over there.

756
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:12,886
I'm not.

757
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:28,001
I don't like feeling like this.

758
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:30,045
No one does.

759
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:39,445
I remember the first time
I was a pall bearer.

760
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:42,990
I'd seen dead bodies before.

761
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:45,560
I must have been 15. My aunt.

762
00:42:47,663 --> 00:42:51,155
I remember thinking...

763
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:53,258
They're letting me carry the box.

764
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:55,303
They're letting me be this close to it.

765
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:59,670
No one is hiding
anything from me now.

766
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:05,078
And I looked over,
and I saw all the old people

767
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,378
waiting together by the grave.

768
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:10,611
I remember thinking, I've...

769
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,923
I've just moved up a notch.

770
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:21,593
I've never heard you
talk that much before.

771
00:43:21,697 --> 00:43:24,598
- Rachel...
- What do you want from me?

772
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:27,932
You know. I know you do.

773
00:43:28,037 --> 00:43:29,766
You know everything about me.

774
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:31,806
I don't.

775
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:39,908
You don't want to do this.

776
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:41,950
You have a wife. You should go to her.

777
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:43,985
Jesus, Rachel.

778
00:43:44,086 --> 00:43:46,316
This is it.

779
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:49,448
This is all there is,
and I feel like it's slipping

780
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,289
through my fingers
like a handful of sand.

781
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:57,323
This is it.

782
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:58,525
This is all there is.

783
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:03,367
That's just an excuse for bad behavior.

784
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:05,872
You don't really believe that.

785
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:30,387
No.

786
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:33,798
Not unless you tell me you want this.

787
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:40,767
Yes, please.

788
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:04,966
Miss Holloway, I know
it's none of my business,

789
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:07,968
but you could do a lot better.

790
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,594
He's just a friend.

791
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:12,265
That's not what I'm
talking about, my dear.

792
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,902
Don't waste your youth on age.

793
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:24,948
Could you? Lobby.

794
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:41,436
Do you want one?

795
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:43,402
No.

796
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,511
You told me
your mother died in childbirth.

797
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,282
Mine did, too.

798
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:06,287
She was a prostitute.

799
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:12,230
I don't know what my father paid her,

800
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:15,429
but when she died, they...

801
00:46:15,538 --> 00:46:18,837
brought me to him and his wife.

802
00:46:21,243 --> 00:46:26,442
And when I was 10 years old, he died.

803
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:34,151
He was a drunk
who got kicked in the face by a horse.

804
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:42,758
She buried him and took up
with some other man, and...

805
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:50,628
I was raised
by those two sorry people.
