1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,175
Things are
a little slow here.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,010
And there's only
so much cold-calling

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,804
you can do in a day.

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,847
Turns out there's no limit
to the number of cheese puffs

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,557
you can throw at
someone's face.

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,646
We're getting
pretty good at it.

7
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,624
Andy put down
a bunch of deposits

8
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,084
on stuff for his
wedding with Angela,

9
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,171
but then she was sleeping
with Dwight for...

10
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,548
Several years. Wait, no,
that can't be right.

11
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,592
No, timeline's messy.

12
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,886
Anyway, now we are
going bargain hunting

13
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,637
in the haunted graveyard
of their love.

14
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,349
This is my solo.

15
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,782
I'm confused.

16
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,118
Am I walking down the aisle
to You Can Call Me Al?

17
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,705
Trust me, you will not be
walking, you will be boogying.

18
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,542
I am extremely interested, so
how much will all of this cost?

19
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,295
Well, 12 guys, airfare,
three nights in hotel,

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,632
food per diem, table
upfront for merch...

21
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,051
$9,000.

22
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,096
I don't know, it seems like a
lot for an a cappella group

23
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,224
from a college
we never went to.

24
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,519
Did you even hear the music
I just played for you?

25
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,777
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,987
These sleeves are cutting
off my circulation.

27
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,823
There's not enough blood
getting to my hands.

28
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,282
I think you look nice.

29
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,035
Doesn't Charles know he's
compromising my attack readiness?

30
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,121
It's not a dress code.
It's a death sentence.

31
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,206
Looking good.

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,541
Okay, thank you.

33
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,420
It's a straightjacket! Okay.

34
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,093
When Michael was in charge, this
place was like the Roman Empire.

35
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,970
And the Wild West.

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,430
And war-torn Poland.

37
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,224
And Poland.

38
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,185
There was just
a lot going on.

39
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,856
So what you wore to work was the
least of anybody's worries.

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,316
And in that chaos,
I soared.

41
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,863
Hey.
Hey.

42
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,073
Ed's Tires. He's thinking
of making a change.

43
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,199
Is this good?

44
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,201
They have some
great kitchen ideas.

45
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,161
Okay, Ed's Tires, huh?

46
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,497
It's small, I know.

47
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,084
I really appreciate it.

48
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,461
Thanks, Michael, we...
What is this?

49
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,963
It's for your trouble.

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,882
I don't need $6
to help a friend.

51
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,009
No, no, listen,
as a friend,

52
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,886
I want you to have it.
You know I can't take this.

53
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,304
Yes, I do.

54
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,431
But don't forget,
you owe me $10.

55
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,557
That was four years ago.

56
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,143
Why don't you let it go?
Michael.

57
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,062
What was up with Pam being all
pushy and negative in there?

58
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,315
I think she just didn't
want a crucifix cake.

59
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,276
It scares me to see you going
down a road that I went down.

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,402
Am I going down a road?

61
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,905
When I see her bossing
you around like that,

62
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,993
it just makes me wonder if
this thing really has the legs

63
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,704
to go the distance.

64
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,750
It's so scary how right
the things you're saying are.

65
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,753
And you're coming at it
with almost no knowledge,

66
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,297
so of course I trust
your opinion on this.

67
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,674
I know a few things
about love.

68
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,262
Horrible, terrible,
awful, awful things.

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,515
I was gonna use today
to purge my inbox,

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,769
but now something much
more pressing has come up.

71
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,607
Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell
them that we have fewer clients,

72
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,610
so that we can spend more
time with each of them?

73
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,863
Also, try to discuss
it over Indian food,

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,783
and try to mention
how you distrust women.

75
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,201
I'm not gonna do that.

76
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,287
That is smart. That would
not seem genuine. Ryan?

77
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,330
I can get there.

78
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,665
Good. You take
the lead on this one.

79
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,293
Also, do not forget that he has
just gone through a messy divorce.

80
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,336
Awesome.

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,963
Bring it in.
Morning cheer.

82
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:07,014
U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi, you ugly.
U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi, you ugly.

83
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,850
You ugly! Your mama say you ugly, hey!
You ugly! Your mama say you ugly, hey!

84
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,980
Go Michael Scott Paper Company!
Go Michael Scott Paper Company!

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,858
I'm here.
I'm part of this now.

86
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,278
You needed to speak to me?

87
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,030
Dwight, take a seat.

88
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,408
I prefer to stand.
Less blood clots.

89
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,994
No, that's weird.
You can just sit.

90
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:33,958
Great. You know, Dwight, it has been
quite a transition for all of us.

91
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,253
Are you happy with the way
things have been running lately?

92
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,504
Why do you ask?
Do you mean

93
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,423
compared to the way things
ran with other bosses?

94
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,507
Comparisons are hard.

95
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,342
I've just been impressed
with your performance,

96
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,470
and I wanted to make sure good
work doesn't go unnoticed.

97
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,722
Your concern is noted.

98
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,432
Yeah, I like your work ethic.

99
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,559
You're so focused.

100
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,852
Like a wolf,
thank you.

101
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,522
I want to start giving
you more responsibility.

102
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,109
What do you say you and I
go out for a drink this week?

103
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,528
Really?
Definitely.

104
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,907
It's firm.

105
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,662
I need you to get me the prices
that you're charging Ed's Tires,

106
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,748
so I can undercut
Dunder Mifflin.

107
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,042
I don't know that
I can do that now.

108
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,752
You know,
something's come up.

109
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,462
Oh, no, is it Mose?

110
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,672
Did you put
the cover on that well?

111
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,716
No, Mose is fine.
I roped it off.

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,719
It's not about Mose. Listen,
things are changing here.

113
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,721
Michael,
they're changing fast.

114
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,139
I'm not following you.

115
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:36,395
Imagine someone has a personal
hero they really want to help.

116
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,231
But then there's
this new guy.

117
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,319
Very cool,
very Will Smith-esque,

118
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,572
who would not like it
if he helped his hero.

119
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,449
Personal hero,
cool new guy.

120
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,077
Okay, I think I'm
getting your drift.

121
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,745
Good, so you see
what I'm saying.

122
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,371
Crystal clear.

123
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,124
So is this for a movie
that you're writing? No.

124
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,292
Can I use it?

125
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,460
No!

126
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,721
Dwight, are you
talking about us?

127
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,307
It is possible that I could
be talking about us.

128
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,853
Someone could say it is like the
situation that we are in now.

129
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,606
It is the situation
we're in now.

130
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,734
So I would say
that the old boss

131
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,945
has always been
good to Dwight,

132
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,031
and he was there first,
so he has dibs.

133
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,950
You respect dibs,
don't you?

134
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,576
I'm not a barbarian.

135
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,953
Good.

136
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,747
Will you meet me in
20 minutes at the spot?

137
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,873
I will.

138
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,416
Dwight?
Yes?

139
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,294
Is the cool new guy Charles?

140
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,712
I've said too much.

141
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,297
Is it Stanley?

142
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,216
Hey, Andy.

143
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,260
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said...

144
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,262
Nice. I just don't
know if I can do it.

145
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,264
That's interesting, because
what I hear you saying

146
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,723
is that you do
want to do it,

147
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,392
which means
you can do it.

148
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,185
Believe me,
I broke up with Angela,

149
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,896
and I'm, like,
the happiest guy ever.

150
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,484
I mean, I'm so happy.
I'm so happy!

151
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,403
Like, total freedom,
you know?

152
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,947
It's just that Pam gets me
through the day, you know?

153
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,949
I really rely on her.

154
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,325
I'm pretty
emotionally needy.

155
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,244
And you know what?

156
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,705
I am here for you.

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,709
Let me be your
traveling pants.

158
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,339
What'd you do that for?

159
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,967
You know what
I was doing. Okay.

160
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,343
Totally.

161
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,431
Dwight?
What's with the shirt?

162
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,351
Are you all right?

163
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,728
I'm sorry, Michael.

164
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,688
Hi, Michael. Oh, my God, run, run!
It's a setup!

165
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,064
It's a setup!
Dwight, run!

166
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,357
No, Michael.
Michael, no.

167
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,484
Let's be cool, okay?
You be cool!

168
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,611
Yes.

169
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,529
Just... What's going on?

170
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,450
We need to talk about our two
companies and how we should behave.

171
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,245
Dwight tells me you've been
pestering him for company info.

172
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,707
Dwight would not...
He did.

173
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,501
I did, Michael. I was upset about
the shirtsleeves at first,

174
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,586
but now I'm okay with it.

175
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,713
Michael, I want you to stop
pestering my salesman

176
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,800
and I want you to leave Dunder
Mifflin alone. Do you understand?

177
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,846
I understand nothing.

178
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,435
Wow.

179
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,229
Wow.
Michael, are you all right?

180
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,563
It was a setup.

181
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,482
Dwight told Charles.
He told him.

182
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,608
Tell us what
you're talking about.

183
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,401
Yeah.

184
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,488
It's like a girl says
she'll make out with you,

185
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:37,451
but then her boyfriend is waiting around
the corner with a pee-filled balloon.

186
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,037
We can't help you if you don't
just tell us what happened.

187
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,749
I got hit in the face with a
pee-filled water balloon, Pam, okay?

188
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know
how they did it.

189
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,586
They filled the balloon with pee.
A funnel.

190
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,339
I don't know! Is that
clear enough for you?

191
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,677
Hey, Jim.

192
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,638
I just totally
blew a sales call.

193
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,932
Bro, I do that
all the time.

194
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,767
Yeah, well, with you
it's different, okay?

195
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,435
'Cause I just...

196
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,938
I just suck.
I just... I suck!

197
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,440
Tuna? Be nice to
my friend Jim, okay?

198
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,566
Why?

199
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,319
When I look in the mirror, I don't
like the face that looks back.

200
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,947
Well, so what?
Your body's a 10.

201
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,448
Just forget it.
Jim!

202
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,200
I said forget it!

203
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,209
Dwight Schrute.

204
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,544
Hello, traitor.

205
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,131
I think you have the
wrong number, Michael.

206
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,092
I want you to listen
to me, friend,

207
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,886
and I want you to
listen to me good.

208
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:43,559
I am going to come at you, and
I'm going to come at you hard.

209
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,146
I am going to steal
all of your clients,

210
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,690
and then I am going to
kill them in front of you.

211
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,650
Michael! Just getting
hardcore with him.

212
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,776
Finally.

213
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,903
Yes. And hear me, Dwight,

214
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,241
when I say I brought you into this
world, and I can take you out.

215
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,743
Bill Cosby.

216
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,497
- Mr. Schofield, please.
- He's in a meeting.

217
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,665
Damn it!

218
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,833
Is Mr. Schofield there?

219
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,668
If you'd like to
reach an outside line,

220
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,587
please dial 9 first.
Shoot.

221
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,007
So, you think Michael's
going after the whale, huh?

222
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,343
I have a long relationship
with HarperCollins Publishers

223
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,552
and Mr. Schofield.

224
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,678
I'm not worried.

225
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,846
You sound worried.

226
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,264
And you have bad skin.

227
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,142
Look, everyone, we're all
making observations!

228
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,689
Well, if you could do me a big
favor and tell Mr. Schofield

229
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,733
that Michael Scott
has tickets to the

230
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,527
Wilkes-Barre Penguins
game this weekend,

231
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,072
and if he would
like to join me...

232
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,408
Hello, Daniel,
how are you? Uh-huh.

233
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,786
I sure do. Yes.

234
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,580
Wanted to ask, did
Kathy ever make JV?

235
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,375
Look at that old dude
and his Rolodex go.

236
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,503
I spent a month putting that
Rolodex on his BlackBerry,

237
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,046
which he now uses
as a nightlight.

238
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,339
Wow. High score?

239
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,549
And, no, I cannot
lower my current prices.

240
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,427
Hold on.

241
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:04,264
Hello. Mr. Schofield, thank you so
much for taking the time to talk.

242
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,309
I wanted to discuss
your contract with us.

243
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,897
You're considering him.

244
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,735
I thought Michael Scott left the paper
business after his nervous breakdown.

245
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,654
Michael has been talking
to my biggest client.

246
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,116
Master and apprentice
pitted against one another

247
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,702
for the fate of the greater
Scranton area paper market.

248
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,665
So it's not exactly
like Highlander, but still.

249
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,880
Hello, Dwight. I've been expecting
your call. What do you want?

250
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,883
I would like to
arrange a truce.

251
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:44,263
So you heard Schofield is considering
a switch, and you want mercy.

252
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,639
Meet me in our spot
in four minutes.

253
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,765
No.

254
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,309
No, you think I'm going to fall for that?
There's no...

255
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,394
Michael.

256
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,645
Meet... Okay.

257
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,939
Go to the spot and
then walk 100 feet.

258
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,691
In which direction?

259
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,775
Toward the sun.

260
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,901
At what time?

261
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,070
Noon. You have two seconds.

262
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,869
Michael.

263
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,623
Sorry.

264
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
Dwight.
Michael.

265
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,753
I hope you're not recording
this conversation.

266
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,883
Good.

267
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,052
I cannot believe that
you sided with Charles.

268
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,929
You were making me do things
that were not all right.

269
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,139
So you just rat me out?

270
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,390
You could've said no.

271
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,850
And not come
through for you?

272
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,644
If you want a truce,
I will give you a truce.

273
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,563
I want a truce.
I do, too.

274
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,774
Let me take you and your whole
company out for lunch at Alfredo's.

275
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:38,942
Cooper's.

276
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,194
I had fish yesterday.

277
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,445
Damn it.

278
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,199
Dwight-a-licious.
Where you at?

279
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,993
Hi, Michael.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

280
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,661
I got stuck in traffic.

281
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,830
Really? That's weird.
We didn't see any.

282
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,665
I hit a bear.
What?

283
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,083
He's technically fine.

284
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,754
I imagine the true horror will
be when he wakes up in a zoo.

285
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,881
Hey, listen,
will you do me a favor

286
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,383
and order
the meatball parm for me,

287
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,344
with extra cheese?
Yeah, sure.

288
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,013
Good. I will see you
very soon, all right?

289
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,057
Okay. See you in a bit.

290
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,437
Dwight hit a bear.
He'll be here in a sec.

291
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,444
Oh, my God, I think
we've been robbed!

292
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,782
Yeah?

293
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,116
Did you enjoy your lunch?

294
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,118
Dwight, not now,
we've been robbed.

295
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,038
No, Michael.
You were sabotaged!

296
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,582
No, Dwight,
we were robbed.

297
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,502
How would you even know?
You're still stuck in traffic.

298
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,131
You?
Me.

299
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,217
What about our truce?

300
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,301
I broke it.

301
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,886
On purpose?
Yes.

302
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:48,971
Why?

303
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,055
You think this is
some kind of game?

304
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,559
No, this is a war, and I will
not stop, I will not rest.

305
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,061
You have no idea what kind
of enemy you've created.

306
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,146
You have unleashed a wolf!

307
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,606
Be that as it may,

308
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:04,361
I have your meatball
parm sandwich here,

309
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,280
and I am going to eat it.

310
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,864
And I knew that
you would do that.

311
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,993
Their meatball parm is
their worst sandwich!

312
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,497
Bastard!

313
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,252
Hi, there.
Dwight Schrute here.

314
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,754
I was just calling to see
if Michael Scott Paper

315
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,090
was meeting all of
your paper needs,

316
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:29,219
and how is Brenda, age four,
ponytail, and Simon, age seven?

317
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,681
You don't say.

318
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,850
Schrute comma Dwight.

319
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,104
And on the back he wrote, "Great
salesman, better friend."

320
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,901
"Tall" and "Beets."

321
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,113
And say hello to Shari,

322
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,033
who is your black wife.

323
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,750
So you're
begging for mercy, huh?

324
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,793
Well,
you will find none here.

325
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,003
Dwight,
do you mind if we talk?

326
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,422
Sure. That'd be fine.

327
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,592
If you keep coming after us, the
Michael Scott Paper Company

328
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,843
cannot succeed.

329
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,137
This is war and
that is what happens.

330
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,932
One more thing. I'm going
to have you listen

331
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,684
while I steal
your biggest client.

332
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,728
Oh, no. No, no, no, no!

333
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,606
Michael. Michael. Michael! I'm
turning you down right now.

334
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,316
You can hear me,
but I can't hear you.

335
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,901
Mr. Schofield's
ready to see you now,

336
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,985
Mr. Scott.

337
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,570
Great, Mr. Schofield's
ready to see me.

338
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,156
Thank you so much. Don't let
him in, he's a traitor!

339
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,407
Walking in the door.
Michael!

340
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,700
Michael.
Good to see you.

341
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,203
Mr. Schofield,
good to see you.

342
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,039
And I'm closing the door.

343
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,002
Now,
when Dwight tells you

344
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,755
that he will keep prices
steady for a year,

345
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,423
I think he is
speaking out of turn.

346
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,175
Really?
Yes.

347
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,427
He does not have
the authority to say that.

348
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,348
I, on the other hand, am the
president, the owner and the founder.

349
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,517
It is like you are buying
software from Bill Gates.

350
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,019
Are you saying
you invented paper?

351
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,689
Okay, okay.

352
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,191
God.
Okay, Tuna.

353
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,278
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

354
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,613
Hello.

355
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,532
Excuse me, can I have
your attention, everyone?

356
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,700
Here's the deal, everybody.

357
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,120
Jim Halpert is very
upset and disturbed.

358
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,788
I don't know if it
was something you did,

359
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,540
something you said,
a look you gave him.

360
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:25,711
Maybe it was nothing at all, but
here's the deal, okay? It stops now!

361
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,170
I guess I could be nicer.

362
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,297
Andy, I think Jim
is messing with you.

363
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,507
Really?

364
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:35,721
Okay.
Yeah, okay.

365
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,472
What the heck is
happening here?

366
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,099
Two things I need
you to understand.

367
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,560
One, Pam and I are
very happy together.

368
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,644
That's not what was...

369
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,979
And two,

370
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,940
that stuff that happened with
you and Angela is a bummer.

371
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,024
And I know that
you don't think

372
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,860
you're ever going to find
someone else, but you will.

373
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,863
I promise you, you will.

374
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,536
Man, he got me so good.

375
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,167
I learned something
about myself today.

376
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,334
Yeah.

377
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,753
I wish this was a sofa,

378
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,172
'cause I feel like I could
sit here and talk for hours.

379
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,175
What is that thing
that Dwight always says?

380
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,180
"Paper is the soil in which the
seeds of business grow..."

381
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,931
It's not the soil,
it's the manure!

382
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,641
Paper is the manure!

383
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,977
On-time delivery
is the soil!

384
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,282
Hello, Dwight.

385
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,492
Spin move!

386
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,288
April 13th, 2002.

387
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,706
Dwight! I'm in a meeting.

388
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,041
That's very rude.

389
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,793
I barge, because I care.

390
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,337
April 13th, 2002.
That is the date

391
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,589
when you tried to
switch paper providers

392
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,384
for an obscure sociology textbook,
but were hung out to dry

393
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,845
when the price of
glossy stock increased.

394
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,639
Maybe we should schedule a
meeting on another day.

395
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,643
Hey, hey! Continuing. Notice my
persistence and recall. Continuing!

396
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,814
You called Dunder Mifflin and your
order was filled within an hour.

397
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,067
I'm going to pull a date
out of the air right now.

398
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,110
April 13th, 2002.

399
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,031
That is the last day that you
evaluated your paper needs.

400
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,493
Is it not? We all know
that the economy is bad,

401
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,703
and bloated companies like
Dunder Mifflin... Come on.

402
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,872
...are going to
fall by the wayside.

403
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,875
Two of their branches have
closed within the last year.

404
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,086
The Michael Scott
Paper Company, however,

405
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,255
has opened a new
branch this very month.

406
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,758
What he's not telling you
is that he will abandon you.

407
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,302
Why don't you guys just
e-mail me your best offers,

408
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,512
and we can
finish it up that way?

409
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,056
That sounds like a great idea.
That sounds like a fantastic idea.

410
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,268
I will see you this weekend for
the Penguins, box seats as usual!

411
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,769
Okay, sure!
Good, good, good.

412
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,230
Thank you, Mr. Schofield,
for your time.

413
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,815
Much appreciated.

414
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,316
And tell me,

415
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,610
how's your gay son?

416
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,863
Excuse me?

417
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,492
I color-code all my info.

418
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,035
I wrote "gay son" in green.

419
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,831
Green means go, so I know to
go ahead and shut up about it.

420
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,126
Orange means, "Orange you
glad you didn't bring it up?"

421
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,253
Most colors mean,
"Don't say it."

422
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,214
How is Tom,
the homosexual sophomore?

423
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,719
I wanted to start
a company, not a war,

424
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:25,432
because, in a war, you always
fight those you are closest to.

425
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,894
And the great tragedy
of the Civil War

426
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,770
is that brother
fought against brother.

427
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,648
For what? What purpose
did that serve,

428
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,984
apart from
abolishing slavery?

429
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,945
In that case,
war was the right choice.

430
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,822
This doesn't feel
as important, though.

431
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,326
That's just how the
world works, I guess.

432
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,088
Michael Scott Paper Company.
