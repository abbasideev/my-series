1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,841
Pam, line three.
Okay, thanks.

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:13,346
New York, as it turns out, is very
expensive, and I ran out of money.

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,015
I thought about
selling a kidney,

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,352
but Michael offered to get me
a part-time job at corporate.

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,522
Hey.

6
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:27,735
Pamela!

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,238
Of course, now Michael
knows where to reach me

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,864
sixteen to 18 hours a week.

9
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:38,454
Hey, Michael.
Pamela!

10
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,377
Miss you, kiddo.
Miss you so much.

11
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,610
Hey.
Hello.

12
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,529
That was really fun last night.
Yeah, it was nice.

13
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,699
I'm actually thinking about getting
my own set of "putt-putt" golf clubs.

14
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,285
That would be great. You need that.
Yeah?

15
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,411
Yeah.
Really?

16
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,581
Yeah. It would help.
Well, I let her win.

17
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,082
No, he didn't.

18
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,253
So, when can I
see you again?

19
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,213
Tonight.
I'm free tonight.

20
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,674
Is that too eager?
No.

21
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,427
I don't care. I'm free tonight.
Okay.

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,014
Oh, wait.
Tonight's no good.

23
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,850
Because I am busy
taking you out.

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,395
I just remembered.
I can't tonight.

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,647
Why?
I'm going out with you.

26
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:48,775
Wow.

27
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,405
Wait a second.
I can't tonight.

28
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,782
No more. No more.
Tonight's so...

29
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,992
All right.
Too many times.

30
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,244
It's all good. All right.
So, good.

31
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,705
So have a nice day.
Thank you. You, too.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,790
You're welcome.

33
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:11,422
In my opinion, the third date is
traditionally the one where you have sex.

34
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,510
Does Holly feel that way?
I don't know.

35
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,137
I will probably
find out tonight.

36
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,058
If she starts having sex
with me, I'll know for sure.

37
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,561
That's for you, and...

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,149
I am right in assuming that
Dwight is short for D-Money?

39
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,611
'Cause that's what I wrote
on your "Save The Date."

40
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,112
You set a date?

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,408
J-Money. Or should it
be T-Money, for Tuna?

42
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,413
Receptionist-Money.

43
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,792
K-Money.

44
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,295
What are you making?
A knife.

45
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,381
You're making
a knife with a knife?

46
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,049
You got a better way?

47
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,179
You want to talk about it?

48
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,264
About what?

49
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,434
You know I know.
You know they know.

50
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,942
I know none of that. And if I
did, you'd be the last to know.

51
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,196
The mall could be fun.
Yeah!

52
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,740
We could go to the food
court, get different foods.

53
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,201
You could get chicken teriyaki,
I could get a hot dog.

54
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,538
Some of what we order depends
on if we're having sex after.

55
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,710
I can't... Oh, my...

56
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,045
Wow!
Elephant in the room.

57
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,758
Are we, do you think? Do you think
we're going to have sex tonight?

58
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,927
Hell, yeah.

59
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,222
Okay. So, we do
the restaurant thing

60
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,059
and then... Then we can do... We'll
just do the restaurant thing first.

61
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,561
Yeah, that's good.

62
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,816
Probably get soup,
or something light.

63
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,405
Hi.

64
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,033
She introduced me
to so many things.

65
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,620
Pasteurized milk,
sheets, monotheism.

66
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,957
Presents on your birthday,
preventative medicine.

67
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,500
It's nice to learn
new things.

68
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,794
I was talking to myself.
Okay.

69
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,506
I just don't get it.
What don't you get?

70
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,677
Why is she marrying Andy?

71
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,890
Angela's not really
a risk taker

72
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,768
and Andy's not
really a risk.

73
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,815
That's really fattening.

74
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,859
No, it's lettuce.

75
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,197
It's time to go?
No.

76
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,865
Oh, okay.
No.

77
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,243
Reservations are at 8:00 so we've
got an hour and 45 minutes.

78
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,453
Okay.

79
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,457
Crazy eight!
I'm crazy!

80
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,417
You're crazy!
Go crazy!

81
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,723
I forgot my keys.

82
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,309
Do you need them?
Yeah, let's go grab them.

83
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,435
All right.

84
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,815
After vous.
Thank vous.

85
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,992
What?

86
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,661
Oh!

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,455
I didn't
forget my keys,

88
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,834
I just didn't want to make out
with you in front of the cameras.

89
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,752
Do you think
they can hear us?

90
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,131
Not if we turn these
dials all the way down.

91
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,926
Now they can't hear us at all.
Oh, good.

92
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,511
We're totally alone.

93
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,103
Yes,
that's correct.

94
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,940
I need to cancel checks
from 10,001 to 90,000.

95
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,192
Great,
they stole my laptop.

96
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,279
Yeah, well, they stole
my surge protector.

97
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,613
How does that even compare?

98
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,283
Oscar, I'm now going
to be prone to surges.

99
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,118
Oh, my God.
What happened?

100
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,244
We were robbed
last night.

101
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,620
Bravo, Watson.

102
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,581
Looks like a classic
seven-man job.

103
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,291
Okay, security tapes
were stolen.

104
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,670
Motives. Financial, or possibly
vintage HP computer collectors.

105
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,549
Hank down at Security had clocked
out, and that's all we have.

106
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,385
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.

107
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,060
That wasn't us, right? I mean, you
remembered to lock the doors?

108
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,980
No, did you? Michael, I
think this is our fault.

109
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,192
Oh, no! Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Oh, no.

110
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,861
So much for sex
without consequences.

111
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,615
You are such a dork. Shot!

112
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,410
That's bad. So, apparently,
Pam went out last night

113
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,789
and accidentally called my work
phone at three in the morning.

114
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,415
So...
I am not drunk.

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,918
I am on minute six
of this message.

116
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,587
Okay, I do not
sound like that.

117
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,548
Take the girl out of Philly...
Scranton.

118
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,885
The future mother
of my children.

119
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,888
I never felt safe here.

120
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,223
You're always safe with me.

121
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,227
I'm a very good screamer. And
one day, we're going to move

122
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,356
to Disney's Celebration Village in
Florida and leave all this behind.

123
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,358
I would very much
like that.

124
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,818
Yeah?
Yeah.

125
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,695
Consider yourself at home

126
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,743
Get in.

127
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,872
Where are we going?

128
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,625
I know she loves me,
Phyllis. I am sure of it.

129
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,210
She practically told me so.

130
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,295
Then you need to
give her an ultimatum.

131
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,007
Tell her she needs to make a choice.
You or Andy.

132
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,052
If she picks you, great.
If not, you can move on.

133
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,679
Are you sure that's
going to work?

134
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:56,433
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking
to my sister on the phone so much.

135
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,896
Wait, this isn't our floor.
Dwight!

136
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,649
How's everyone doing?

137
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,153
My door is always open
if anyone wants to talk.

138
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,822
I don't want to talk.
I want my laptop back.

139
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,741
Nobody steals from Creed
Bratton and gets away it.

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,453
The last person
to do this disappeared.

141
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,788
His name?

142
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,081
Creed Bratton.

143
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,418
I'm going to make everything all right.
All right?

144
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,922
Conference room, 15 minutes.
Half an hour. All right?

145
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,511
To recoup their losses, I am
planning a little charity auction,

146
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,015
where people from all over
Scranton can come and bid

147
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,017
on our goods
and services.

148
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,270
I'm calling it Crime Aid.
It's like Farm Aid,

149
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,064
but instead of farms
fighting against AIDS,

150
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,359
it is us, fighting
against our own poverty.

151
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,029
I think it's a fun idea.
Thank you!

152
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,364
We could auction off things
that we do for each other,

153
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,076
like cleaning or tennis lessons.
My sorority did it all the time.

154
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,953
Okay. I'm going to have
to stop you right there.

155
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,373
Was this the sorority that you
didn't get into a real sorority

156
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,459
so you had to kind of
form your own?

157
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,127
Move on, Michael.
Okay.

158
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,254
Okay, well, come on! Let's have an auction!
Let's do this!

159
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,174
We'll auction off people,
like in the olden days.

160
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,303
So, in order to recoup
the value of items we liked,

161
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,972
we have to spend more money
on things we don't want.

162
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,642
- Who would ever come to this?
- I don't know.

163
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,686
It could be any number of people.
It could be a pedestrian.

164
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,565
It could be an old person.
It could be a lookie loo.

165
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,445
Or it could be
a Bruce Springsteen fan. What?

166
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,740
Who said that? I did.
Why did I say that?

167
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,492
Oh, I think
you know why I said that.

168
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,496
I think it is very apparent. I
think it goes without saying...

169
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,831
Bear with me.
There's a point there.

170
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,709
"But what is the point? I don't
understand what he's saying.

171
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,629
"It seems a little shady.
It seems a little foggy."

172
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,465
Well, it's not a little foggy. There's
really something going on here.

173
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,968
Do you need us for any of this?
Do I?

174
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,055
Michael scored the big-ticket item.
Springsteen tickets.

175
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,640
The boss scored The Boss.

176
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,934
Yeah, I think
that's pretty boss.

177
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,854
He knows how to
get things. He got me.

178
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,442
Whoa!
Sorry.

179
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,237
Twice.

180
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,532
Right?

181
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,830
Listen to me close, 'cause I'm
only going to say this once.

182
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,457
You either break off your engagement
with that singing buffoon,

183
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,376
apologize,
and then date me,

184
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,379
or you can say
goodbye to this.

185
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,217
I think you have me confused
with another person.

186
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,261
I said I was only
going to say it once.

187
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,138
You have until 6:14 p.m.

188
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,349
6:14!
I heard you!

189
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,059
Gonna have fun! Yeah!

190
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:51,275
I'll rock and roll you. Thank
you very much, everybody.

191
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,944
Thank you, Mr. Springsteen!

192
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,240
And welcome to Crime Aid.

193
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:06,040
"Crime reduces innocence, makes
everyone angry, I declare."

194
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:13,672
It is not known how many office
robberies occur every second,

195
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:18,510
because there is no Wikipedia entry
for office robbery statistics.

196
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,973
However, tonight, its victims
are standing together

197
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,977
and standing strong
in the form of song,

198
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,483
cooking lessons and hugs.

199
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,444
Really, Phyllis,
you're auctioning a hug?

200
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:40,449
Okay, so with no further ado,
lights, camera, auction!

201
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,035
Take it away, Bruce!

202
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,875
Mike gave me a list of his
top 10 Springsteen songs.

203
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,294
Three of them were
Huey Lewis and the News,

204
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,463
one was
Tracy Chapman's Fast Car,

205
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,341
and, my personal favorite,
Short People.

206
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,263
Okay, this is the moment that
you've all been waiting for.

207
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,725
Our first item up
for bids tonight

208
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,271
is something I consider
to be very boss indeed.

209
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,150
It is a yoga lesson
from Holly Flax.

210
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:21,240
Yoga! I'd like to start
the bidding off at $300.

211
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,201
$300! Do I hear $300?
$300.

212
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,079
Hey, batter, batter, batter. Hey,
batter, swing, batter! $300,

213
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,456
$300, $300. Anybody, $300?

214
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,377
$400. Who wants it for four? Four, four...
Hitter, hitter...

215
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,422
Do I see somebody in the back?
Is there somebody in the back?

216
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,050
Do I see somebody in the back?
$400! $450.

217
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,803
Sold! For $300 to me!

218
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,056
What the hell is that? It's
the only gavel I could find.

219
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,100
It squeaks when you bang it.
That's what she said.

220
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,394
Let's hear it for me, right?

221
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,772
A bargain at any price.

222
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,107
Hey, Mike,
do my thing.

223
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,192
Oh, yes, great, very good.

224
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,905
So, Darryl and the boys in
the hood in the warehouse

225
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,953
have graciously donated to "go out
for a beer with them right now."

226
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,081
You know what? I'm actually
going to bid on this.

227
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,416
I'm going to start the bidding

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,127
because this is something
that I've dreamt of.

229
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,963
Mike, you can't do this,
conflict of interest.

230
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,549
$5!
Sold to Jim!

231
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,468
Okay.
Okay, sold!

232
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,721
Have fun, you guys.

233
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,808
Well, this next item
is sure to spring steam

234
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,811
from your ears
if you don't win it.

235
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,607
It just says Creed.
Yeah, that's all inclusive.

236
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,153
She thought I was McNabb.

237
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,655
I can see that.

238
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,657
Yeah, what you going to do?

239
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,284
Another round, boys?

240
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,535
Great.

241
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,081
- Halpert?
- What's up, Roy?

242
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,250
Hey, man.

243
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,424
Relax, man. I'm not going to hit you.
Oh, I wouldn't...

244
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,261
You good? I'm good.
How you doing?

245
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,846
I'm good.
Good.

246
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,056
Hey, Darryl.
What's happening?

247
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,224
What's up?
How's it going, man?

248
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,308
Hey, what's up, guys?

249
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,392
Where you been?

250
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,937
Hi. I'm Kevin.

251
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,356
I'll do your taxes.

252
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,818
Let's hear an opening bid, everybody.
Who's first? Kevin doing your taxes.

253
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,113
He's the tax man!
Kevin the Tax Man.

254
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,866
Federal and state.
Federal and state.

255
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,207
Fine. Okay. All right.
Okay. You know what?

256
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,461
I would appreciate it if people
would stop storming off the stage.

257
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,868
Me and the blues

258
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,081
Just me and the blues

259
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,712
We are getting there,
folks, slow and steady.

260
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,090
Well, well, have we
been blessed today?

261
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,552
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. David Wallace!

262
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,721
Hey!
Thank you, Michael.

263
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,972
Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

264
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,434
I'd like to auction off a weekend
at my place in Martha's Vineyard.

265
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,019
Hey, hey!
$100.

266
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,937
$100. Great!
$125.

267
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,023
$125. $140.
$140.

268
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,067
Phyllis, someone let the air
out of your tires. Come quick.

269
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,485
- Oh, dear.
- Who else? Who else?

270
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,070
Keep it going! Hey, batter,
batter, hey. $160.

271
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,155
$160.

272
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,325
I had to get your attention.
This is an emergency.

273
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,744
Why couldn't you have just said it?
Why did you actually do it?

274
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,997
Listen! She ignored
my ultimatum. Now what?

275
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,957
Now you move on.

276
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,667
Okay, fine,
I've moved on.

277
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,211
Now how do I
get her back?

278
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,299
Dwight, I don't think you do. I
think you've got your answer.

279
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,927
What, that's it?
That's your advice?

280
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,139
I thought you had some
kind of big master plan.

281
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,894
Well, I just think we all deserve to be
with someone who wants to be with us.

282
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,437
Oh.

283
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,647
I get it.

284
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,150
You're trying to secure your place as
head of the Party Planning Committee.

285
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,235
You're just being selfish.

286
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,657
And you slap like a girl.

287
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,456
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll
tell you what Phyllis did wrong.

288
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,085
She stuck her nose into my
business and tried to help me.

289
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,674
What's going on with Pam?
She's good, actually.

290
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,510
Yeah?
She's in New York.

291
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,804
She's at an art school.
Really?

292
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,806
Yeah,
she's doing really well.

293
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,060
She's engaged

294
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,230
to me.

295
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,111
Congrats, man.
Thanks, man.

296
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,905
I appreciate that.

297
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,367
So Pam's happy?

298
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,202
Yeah,
I'd say she's happy.

299
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,330
I mean, she loves her
classes, loves the city,

300
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,585
and last night she was out with
her friends till, like, 8 a.m.

301
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,713
Wow.
What?

302
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,007
I thought you
were her friend.

303
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,561
I am going to see Pam
'cause I feel like I should.

304
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,694
When are you getting to Bruce?
Just a few more items.

305
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:54,656
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

306
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,075
All right! All right, all right, all right!
Here we go, here we go.

307
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,994
All right,
big-ticket item.

308
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,622
All right! In my pocket,

309
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,168
I have two tickets

310
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,421
to Mr. Bruce Springsteen.
Front...

311
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,841
Where are those?

312
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,051
Has anyone seen
an envelope

313
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,847
with Bruce Springsteen front row
tickets and backstage passes?

314
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,266
Anybody seen something,
like, lying around?

315
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:25,103
Do you want us to look for them?
No. I think they were stolen.

316
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,315
I think they were stolen and
they're gone forever, so...

317
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,694
That was
the last good item. So...

318
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,114
Good job, everybody.
I have my hug.

319
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:40,327
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody
really wants a hug, so...

320
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,246
I'll bid on a hug. She's
your wife, you idiot.

321
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,582
$100.
$200.

322
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,585
What the hell is happening?
$250.

323
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,628
What are you doing?

324
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,922
I need a hug, unless you're
going to give me one.

325
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,465
Not here.
$300.

326
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,885
$300! We have $300.
$300 going once.

327
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,972
$300 going twice.
$300 and one penny!

328
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,308
$300 and one penny!
$300 and one penny!

329
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,684
$325.
$325.

330
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:05,811
$350!
$350.

331
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,813
$350 and one penny!
$350 and one penny!

332
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,356
$400.
$400. Hey, batter, batter.

333
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,525
$400 and one penny!
$400 and one penny!

334
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,318
$500!
$500! $500.

335
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,861
Five...
$500 and one penny!

336
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,531
$500 and one penny!
One million dollars!

337
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,032
$700!
$700.

338
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,493
$700 and one penny!

339
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,455
$1,000!

340
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,542
It's not worth it.

341
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,627
$1,000 going once!
$1,000 going twice!

342
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,089
Sold for $1,000!

343
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,678
Nicely done.

344
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:59,614
No. You know what? No,
because I'm not that guy,

345
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,451
and we are
not that couple.

346
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,628
Hey, that looks good.

347
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,425
Listen, about the tickets.

348
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:23,471
It's sort of... Kind of a gray area
in terms of whether I had them.

349
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,893
The Springsteen tickets
seemed too good to be true.

350
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:32,480
But a lot of Michael
seems too good to be true.

351
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,983
So far it's all true.

352
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:40,488
But, yeah, those tickets really
seemed too good to be true.

353
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,339
No. I did not know that
Michael was dating Holly.
