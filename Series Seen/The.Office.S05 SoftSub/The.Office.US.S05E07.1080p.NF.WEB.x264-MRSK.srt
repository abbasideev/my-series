1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,003
Did you know that in Morocco

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,755
it is common to
exchange a small gift

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,049
when meeting somebody
for the first time?

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:12,387
In Japan, you must always commit
suicide to avoid embarrassment.

5
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:18,601
In Italy, you must always wash your
hands after going to the bathroom.

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,812
This is considered
to be polite.

7
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,063
Why are you telling us this?

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,484
I am jetting off on an
international business trip.

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,111
Where are you going?

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,445
To Canada.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,530
Where is it?

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,614
Canada.
Okay.

13
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,866
My boss is
sending me abroad

14
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,661
to do a presentation to
an international client,

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,790
and I have always been intrigued
by all things international,

16
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,961
the women, the pancakes,
the man of mystery.

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,923
Meredith, I would like you to pretend
that you are from Abu Dhabi.

18
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,007
Hello.

19
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,385
I am ashamed
at your naked face.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,346
I must cover it
with my jacket.

21
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,810
You are now sexy
in your culture.

22
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,928
T-minus...

23
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,346
6.5 days.

24
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,982
One more week.

25
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,072
Pam comes back from
New York next week,

26
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,784
and everyone here has just
been so excited for me

27
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,370
and involved
and intrusive and weird.

28
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,877
One more week.

29
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,256
Do you have your passport?

30
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,341
I have my passport.

31
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,467
Got your per diem?

32
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,135
I have my per diem.

33
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,180
I already know what I am
going to spend this on.

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,724
I'm going to buy a sweater.

35
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,392
Michael,
that's for your food.

36
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,853
Well, I'll just... I'll use
different money for that.

37
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,605
I was happy to send
Michael on this trip.

38
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,483
He's been feeling pretty down
since we had to transfer Holly

39
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,735
up to New Hampshire, and...

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,280
But this little perk really
seemed to turn him around,

41
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,825
and it's pretty tough
to find somebody

42
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,744
who wants to go up
to Winnipeg mid-November.

43
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:47,375
And business-class air, like a
five-star hotel in the sky.

44
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,586
Nothing but the best. Actually
better than a five-star hotel

45
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,588
'cause you get a big,
cushy seat

46
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,590
and you sit in
a row of people

47
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,885
and to eat whatever
the mind can imagine.

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,431
I think I am going to have
a fillet with mushroom sauce.

49
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,851
Well, I'm just glad
you're happy

50
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,018
because, you know,
I felt bad.

51
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,020
Well, that is all in the past.

52
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,400
And in terms of nightlife, when you
get there, just ask the concierge.

53
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,194
They have one of those?

54
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,071
Let's do this!

55
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,406
Wait, why do you
need three suitcases?

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,366
Two are empty.
For souvenirs.

57
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,450
You have your money belt?

58
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,535
I do.
It is right here.

59
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,619
Oh, no, no, no, no.

60
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,247
You wanna wear that puppy right
up on the breastbone like a bra.

61
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,332
No, I don't wanna wear a bra.
Here, let me help you.

62
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,458
Stop it! Stop it!

63
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,419
Do you want to get robbed
in a foreign country?

64
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,545
I wash my hands of this.

65
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,046
Okay, where's
my translator?

66
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,715
- Ici, monsieur.
- There he is.

67
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,219
I'm just bidding a bon voyage
à la mon petite fiancée.

68
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,181
Translation,
goodbye my petite fiancée.

69
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,893
Be good.
I will try.

70
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,019
Meaning what?

71
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,813
Meaning I will try to
get other dudes laid.

72
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,607
Yeah, baby. That's what
I'm talking about.

73
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,734
That could be you if you
hadn't forgotten French.

74
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,611
Where is my numbers man?

75
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,737
Here.

76
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,072
There we go!
Our town car awaits.

77
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,157
It's just a van.

78
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,408
It's not just a van.

79
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,160
Look, I know
my way around a van.

80
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,870
That is just a van.

81
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,539
Dwight, can you
get those, please?

82
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,254
Welcome to Cribs, the
business-class edition.

83
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,006
Check this out. Mimosa.

84
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,800
Sweet. Handed it to
me as I sat down.

85
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,762
This was my hot towel.
It is still wet.

86
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,097
Michael G. Scott
rolling like a pimp.

87
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,933
Take a sip of that.
Mmm-hmm.

88
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,184
Is that good?

89
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,770
Mmm! Don't drink all of it.
Give some to Oscar.

90
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,896
That's really good.
I'm good.

91
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,564
You want one of your own?
I can hook you up.

92
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,774
I'm sorry, you'll
need to keep moving.

93
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:39,946
Yes, this is Beth. This is my
personal valet/flight attendant,

94
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,739
and she will be
helping me this morning.

95
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,199
We need to keep
the aisle clear.

96
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,910
Yes. Get back. Get back.
Oh. All right.

97
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,120
Come on. Get back to the slums.
Here we go.

98
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,330
Oh, boy.

99
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,916
You guys, check it out.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,169
My own personal DVD
player and 20 movies.

101
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,712
Andy brought one, too.

102
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,797
Harry and the Hendersons.

103
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,549
Keep it down.

104
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,094
I made egg-salad sandwiches.
Do you want one?

105
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,263
Could you have picked something
stinkier to bring on a plane?

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,808
My God, Oscar, really.

107
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,686
Do you have a bag of baby poop in
there, too, to share with everybody?

108
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,479
No, I'll be ordering
my own food.

109
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,147
Thank you very much. Hi.

110
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,232
Hi.

111
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,692
I'd like to see a menu,
please.

112
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,195
Oh, I'm sorry, there are no meals
on flights less than two hours.

113
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,405
Okay.

114
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,954
Doesn't matter because I'm
going to take a nap.

115
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:35,292
I think I'm going to use
my complimentary blindfold.

116
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,589
I will don it and... Oh.

117
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,425
Look at that,

118
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,927
I can't see
because I am in...

119
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,512
God!

120
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,432
And what would
you like to drink?

121
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,769
Just checking out where
I'm gonna be pretty soon

122
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,604
when Pam gets back.

123
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,940
It's gonna be
close quarters.

124
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,942
Gonna be a lot of tension.

125
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,570
For you. I'm with Darryl.

126
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,450
This looks like where I'll
probably do my pushups every day.

127
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,123
Is that supposed
to impress me?

128
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,714
No, not gonna happen.

129
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,050
He has hurt me
too much and too often,

130
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,135
and I am in
a healthy relationship now,

131
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,888
so I'm not going to flaunt it,
I'm not going to hurt him,

132
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,973
but that door is closed.

133
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,226
What are we doing?
This is so wrong!

134
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,644
Yeah.

135
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,774
This is nice.
This is nice.

136
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,778
Move in here.
Very sweet.

137
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,741
- I'll check us in.
- All right.

138
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,409
Very cool.
Very cool.

139
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,453
We are going to find out where
the action is, my friend.

140
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,246
Okay.
Where's the concierge?

141
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,832
Yes, Wallace said there
would be one of those.

142
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,125
Bingo.

143
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,213
Follow moi, bro-sieur.

144
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,714
Wow.

145
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,424
What about
a nice sushi place?

146
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,051
Maybe a place
with a view?

147
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,097
Oh. Matsuki.
It's a good one.

148
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,766
You may walk there
if you wish,

149
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,937
or you may take the
number 17 bus until 9:00.

150
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,107
Other than that,
you can take the taxi,

151
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,775
and the number
is right there.

152
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,778
Wow. Wow, I'm blown
away by this.

153
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,822
I...

154
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,699
This is great.
Thank you.

155
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,910
One final question.

156
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,705
Where might you find yourself on
a Winnipeg night like tonight?

157
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,333
Oh. The Huntsman is good.

158
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,417
The Huntsman?

159
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,711
Down here,
the financial district.

160
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,966
A concierge is the Winnipeg
equivalent of a geisha.

161
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,510
This is a woman
who has been

162
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,971
trained in the fine art
of fanciness and pleasure,

163
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,641
and when you meet one,
it is intoxicating.

164
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,394
Just what
the doctor ordered.

165
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,939
I can't believe this.

166
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,194
Are you sure?

167
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,697
I just talked
to my advisor. Failing.

168
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,158
Wow. I thought you
were good at Flash.

169
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,203
I was. And then they switched to
Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.

170
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,913
I hate computers.

171
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,040
Okay, okay,
it's no big deal.

172
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,417
So you're not
a computer geek.

173
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,711
I have to stay and retake it.

174
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,007
Wow. Um...

175
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,260
Well, okay.

176
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,929
That means
another 12 weeks.

177
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,016
Can you do another
three months of this?

178
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,476
It's not...
It's not about me.

179
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,520
I mean, this is your dream.

180
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,566
And you went to
New York to do this.

181
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:51,030
So when you come back, you come
back the right way, right?

182
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,325
Right.

183
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,286
You okay?

184
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,457
My cell battery's low,
so I have to let you go.

185
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,751
Okay. All right.
All right.

186
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:04,835
Love you. Bye.

187
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,086
Love you, too.

188
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,480
Guys. She's in there.

189
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,607
Engaging wings.

190
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,236
I'm probably going to leave
after one drink. Let's do this.

191
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,655
Yeah, with a hot slab of
Canadian bacon in your hand.

192
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:37,326
Excuse me. Hello. Concierge Marie.
Michael Scott.

193
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,911
Good to see you again.

194
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,704
Hello. Good to see you.

195
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:46,835
This is my associate from
Dunder Mifflin, Oscar Martinez.

196
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,962
Nice to meet you.
Oscar.

197
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,421
Works in accounting.

198
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:55,052
This is Concierge Marie,
who works at our hotel.

199
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,889
You look, how you
say, radiant tonight.

200
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,017
Thank you.

201
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,396
And it is, how you say,
a beautiful night.

202
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:06,855
Michael, why?

203
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,774
She's foreign. I...

204
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,486
For madame et monsieur.

205
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,946
Thank you.

206
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,197
You're very welcome.

207
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,282
Thank you, Andy.

208
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,408
Thank you.

209
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,034
Let me get
a picture of you guys.

210
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,161
Everybody's going to
end up dying some day,

211
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,455
and I think
it's better to die

212
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,708
with some people
that you like,

213
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,295
like Oscar and Andy
and Concierge Marie,

214
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,047
than to know that there's
somebody out there

215
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,383
that you love
that you're not with.

216
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,305
All right, I've
scoped out the joint.

217
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,182
Those two dudes
are as good as naked.

218
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,230
How do you even
know they're gay?

219
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,067
Come on, it's Dandy Dale
and Foppy McGee over there.

220
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:58,824
Mademoiselle, beer me deux Long
Island Iced Teas, s'il vous plaît.

221
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,076
Bad decision in a glass.

222
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,038
I don't care if you're
gay, straight, engaged,

223
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,999
whatever,
a guy needs intercourse.

224
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,293
You will thank me
when they spank thee.

225
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,295
Don't do this.

226
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,672
You guys like apples?

227
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,757
What?

228
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,091
Do you like apples?

229
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,343
Sorry, what?

230
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,636
How do you like
these apples?

231
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,599
All right,
on a scale of one to 10,

232
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,685
how hot is that dude?

233
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,564
Is he your boyfriend
or something?

234
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:35,277
No, but he could be yours
if you play your cards right.

235
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,405
Dude, leave us alone,
all right?

236
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,909
Gentlemen.

237
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,456
What are you doing?
Dude, you struck out.

238
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,334
They're totally stuck up.
Here. Drink up.

239
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,796
How about this one. It's
Christmas Eve... Mmm-hmm.

240
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,800
...and everything is closed and you
need to get some dry-cleaning done.

241
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,718
12:00, midnight,
where do you go?

242
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,178
What do you do?

243
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,597
What do you do?
Come on, what do you do?

244
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,809
Uh... Astro Cleaners
on St. James Place

245
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,519
is the only place that
is open on that day.

246
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,646
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

247
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
If you don't
mind me asking...

248
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,858
Anything.
You can ask me anything.

249
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,735
Okay.
I'm your wingman.

250
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,362
It's just that I've
sat next to Angela

251
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,364
for a very long,
very long time.

252
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,407
Right-oh.

253
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,701
How could anyone
stand that woman?

254
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,037
What?
What do you see in her?

255
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,914
What do you see in Angela?
What do I see in Angela?

256
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,541
I wanna know.

257
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:35,546
I see through a hard exterior to
a little jelly in the middle.

258
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,550
She is teaching me
to be a better person.

259
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,011
She's working
really hard on that.

260
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,180
And she has the softest
skin I've ever seen,

261
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,142
and I can't wait to
have sex with her.

262
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,685
You haven't had sex?

263
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,769
No.

264
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,188
Are you guys waiting
to get married? Or...

265
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,316
Honestly, I don't know
what we're waiting for.

266
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,651
Andy, something is
wrong with that woman.

267
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,944
What is wrong with her?

268
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,654
I'd like to know. You should
call her and ask her.

269
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,905
I'd like to know
what's wrong with her.

270
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,575
I should call her and ask her.
What is wrong with her?

271
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,202
Do it. It's a...
Call her.

272
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,956
Oh, my God, don't call her.
Don't call her, Andy.

273
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,458
Andy! Oh, my God!
It's too late.

274
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,209
It's too late.
It's dialing.

275
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,003
Now it's ringing.

276
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,339
Hello? Hello?

277
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,632
What is wrong with you?

278
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,384
Why won't you do Andy?

279
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,635
What?
That's Oscar,

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,053
and he wants to know
why you won't do me,

281
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,472
and I think it's
a valid question.

282
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,806
Are you drunk?

283
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,099
This is Andy Bernard!

284
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,642
I know who this is.

285
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,311
I want to take
you to sex school.

286
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,395
What?

287
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Who is that, monkey?

288
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,023
Is somebody there?

289
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,357
Are you drunk?

290
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,026
I have needs.

291
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,486
We'll discuss this later.

292
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,070
Naked!
What?

293
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,198
We'll discuss it later naked.

294
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,033
I wanna see you naked.

295
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,118
Do you want to get some
breakfast or something?

296
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,953
I'm so tired.
Okay.

297
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,237
How does
everyone know already?

298
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,571
Know what?

299
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,698
Pam failed art school.

300
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,867
Wow. Doesn't surprise me.

301
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,911
Excuse me?

302
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,621
Have you seen
her painting, Jim?

303
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,083
The building? There are shadows
coming from two different directions.

304
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,167
Dwight, stop it.

305
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,919
What? Are there two suns?

306
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,796
- My God.
- Come on.

307
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,050
Last I checked, that's not an office
building in the Andromeda Galaxy.

308
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,136
All right. I'm gonna
grab a cup of coffee.

309
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,097
It's totally unrealistic.

310
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,140
There are no lines
in the parking lot.

311
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,352
Oscar!
Hey.

312
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,062
That was fun last night.

313
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,188
Yeah, it was.

314
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,940
You know,
it's true what they say.

315
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,568
Long Island Iced Teas
are way stronger in Canada.

316
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,320
Hey, thanks for
trying to hook me up.

317
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,324
Are you kidding me?
That's what I do.

318
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,326
Get the whole nine nards.

319
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,498
I can't believe
we called her up.

320
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,586
Totally.

321
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,422
It's crazy.
Wait.

322
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,715
Who?

323
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,174
I'm talking about Angela.

324
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,594
I can't believe we called
her up last night.

325
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,178
We called Angela?

326
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,347
You... You called her.

327
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,849
That was real?

328
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,519
I thought I dreamed that.

329
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,147
Oh, God. Oh, God!
All right.

330
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,065
Okay.
This is so bad.

331
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,108
Good morning, Michael.

332
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,318
Are you ready
for the meeting?

333
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,611
Slept like a baby.

334
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,489
This can't happen again.

335
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,782
This has to happen again.

336
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,493
Darryl can't happen again.
Look at me.

337
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,954
Do you want me to do more pushups?
Yeah.

338
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,707
Okay. You have to
break up with Darryl.

339
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,627
I already typed out
a text message for you.

340
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,837
All you have to do
is press send.

341
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,341
I don't know. I mean, it's
well-written and all, I just...

342
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,260
Has to be done. We'll
press send together.

343
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,222
Oh, my God,
he's gonna kill us.

344
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,642
I'd like to see him try.

345
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,396
Oh.

346
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,317
He says it's cool.
He said it's cool!

347
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,443
That's all he wrote?

348
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,486
That's all he wrote.

349
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,363
Can I see it?
Mmm-hmm.

350
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,866
Didn't you two date for,
like, a long time?

351
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,577
Mmm-hmm.
This is like a fairytale.

352
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,300
I'll be honest with you. We've
been talking with Catalyst Paper.

353
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,177
Their prices are
better than yours.

354
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,180
Look, people continue to come
back to us time and time again

355
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,641
because they feel
cared for here.

356
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,771
They feel respected, and they
feel that their needs matter.

357
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,109
They are treated
like human beings.

358
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,491
Everything okay?
Yes.

359
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,704
Oh, man,
she is so pissed.

360
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,956
She's taking us
back to first base.

361
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,792
What's first base
with Angela?

362
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,628
I get to kiss
her forehead.

363
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,509
I had a good time
hanging out this weekend.

364
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,469
I had a good time, too.

365
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,140
Wingman for life. W-M-F-L.

366
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,474
Thank you.

367
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,560
You up for a chest bump?

368
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,686
No.

369
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,105
Bro hug?

370
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,696
Back to basics. I like it.

371
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,031
I had to go
all the way to Canada

372
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,368
to get to know a guy who
sits 20 feet away from me.

373
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,746
And he's delightful.

374
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,708
Hey, I just heard
you guys made the sale.

375
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,376
Yeah, we locked
him up for two years.

376
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,753
Good. Very good!

377
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,964
See? I told you. Sounds like
somebody had a good trip.

378
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,967
No, actually,
the trip sucked.

379
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,093
Excuse me?

380
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,763
The trip sucked, David.

381
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,139
It blew chunks.

382
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,767
It was terrible.
It was a bad trip.

383
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,894
I did not like the trip.
What are you talking about?

384
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,772
Well, starting with
the airport shuttle,

385
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,775
which was
basically just a van,

386
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,318
and business class...
Okay.

387
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,862
...which was
basically just coach,

388
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,448
and the hotel,
which sucked big time.

389
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,574
The hotel. What...

390
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,784
It was not... It sucked. Okay.

391
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,951
I'm sorry to hear
the hotel was bad.

392
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,036
The Crestmore...

393
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,122
And thanks for the tip on the concierge.
That was great.

394
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,457
That was great.
That was a...

395
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,583
Okay.

396
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,751
...that was
a really good choice.

397
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,835
Hey, hey, hey. Michael.

398
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,128
Please listen for a second.

399
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,547
No, David, you listen to me.

400
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,301
Why'd you send her away?
That...

401
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:02,891
God. You knew I liked her and you
just sent her away, and that...

402
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,352
That was a sucky thing to do, man.
Michael.

403
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,312
That was a really
sucky thing to do.

404
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,147
Sometimes... Sometimes...

405
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,444
Why have I stayed
at Dunder Mifflin for so long?

406
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,030
Certainly not
because of the paycheck

407
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,824
'cause I could be making
more money as a doctor

408
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,076
or a professional athlete.

409
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,745
I think it's
because they respect me.

410
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,165
A boss that will not fire you

411
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,793
even though you
just tell him off

412
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,128
right to his face
over the phone,

413
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,089
that's respect.

414
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,051
You did it, man.
Day one.

415
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,512
Congrats.

416
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,930
Thanks, man.

417
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,443
I'm coming back
the wrong way.

418
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,739
It's not because of you.

419
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,117
I don't like graphic design.
That's it.

420
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,621
Stop smiling.
I really didn't like it.

421
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,167
It's just designing logos and
stuff, and I miss Scranton,

422
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,337
but it is not
because I missed you.

423
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,172
I just really
wanted to come home.

424
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,301
And I know you said
to come home the right way,

425
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,762
but you can't tell me
what to do. Got it?

426
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,431
I missed you.

427
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,266
I missed you, too.

428
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,771
You're back.

429
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:32,898
Yeah.

430
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,107
Good.

431
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,444
I need you to make
five copies of these.

432
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,321
I'm not going inside.

433
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,073
All right. First thing
in the morning, then.

434
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,494
Welcome back.

435
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,582
We're back
together again, baby.

436
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,708
We're back.

437
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,793
They tried to keep us
apart, but they couldn't.

438
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,587
It was like destiny.

439
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,756
I realized that,
for whatever reason,

440
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,300
I just couldn't do
better than Kelly.

441
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,593
Aw!

442
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,719
Yeah.
