1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,000
Don't move.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,960
- My mate Justin.
- Hey there.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,400
- Hey.
- I love him.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,560
All I want is what you want.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,600
To have these people locked up,
so they can't do any more harm

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
to anyone else.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,120
Justin, I think
I might have taken a wrong turn.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,256
Do you want to talk
about this properly?

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,680
- That's why I'm here.
- No, I mean... properly.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,200
I'm not sure what's
supposed to be going on here, um...

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm completely lost.

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
That's why we're here.
To help you understand

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,000
how lost you really are.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,320
How am I supposed to
trust you if you don't trust me?

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,000
I will be back.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm a copper.
We're on the same side.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,600
I don't think you're going to shoot me.

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,520
I warned you not to make me your enemy.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
I warned you!

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,000
No! Don't you...

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,800
Don't you... Hey!

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,160
Get up!

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Justin.

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Please!

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Oh, God!

26
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,680
You okay? You okay?

27
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Mary?

28
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,640
What did John say to you, exactly?

29
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
He said he... He said he was busy

30
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,360
and that I should meet him here,
at his place.

31
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
No.

32
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Erin?

33
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
Man down.

34
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,080
Justin Ripley.

35
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,400
So what is it with John Luther
and the people he loves?

36
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,880
John, I don't know what to say.

37
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,520
I don't have the words.

38
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,520
Where is Mary?

39
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,800
John Luther,

40
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,640
you're under arrest for the murder
of Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley

41
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
and the attempted murder of Mary Day.

42
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,240
Mary! Mary, Mary!

43
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,760
Hold on!

44
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,000
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

45
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,160
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

46
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,520
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

47
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,800
♪ She will love you like a fly
will never love you

48
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,960
♪ Again ♪

49
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,160
Okay, from this side of the table
it looks like...

50
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
there's two people who could
incriminate you.

51
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,560
One of which is now dead

52
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
by the hand of Tom Marwood.

53
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
And Mary Day would be,
had I not intervened.

54
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,760
And you're welcome, by the way.

55
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,200
You told her where to go, John.

56
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,800
You told her where and when.

57
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
And I think you did that
because you wanted Marwood...

58
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,560
to kill her for you.

59
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Yesterday, a few hours before
he shot and killed Justin Ripley,

60
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,920
you spoke for some time to Mr Marwood.

61
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Your report notes that,
during this conversation,

62
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,080
Tom Marwood asked for more time.

63
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,440
"Give me two days."

64
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
And then you let him go.

65
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,120
Which makes me wonder,
what was the quid pro quo?

66
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,360
Shut your mouth.

67
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
You let Marwood...

68
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,960
run free to kill his paedophiles
and his scumbags.

69
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,520
That's no skin off your nose.
No humans involved.

70
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,480
But then, in exchange,
does you a favour.

71
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
He cleans up your mess.

72
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,560
I loved him.

73
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,120
He's got too many friends.
We'll have to move him.

74
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,120
- What is this, John?
- I don't know, George.

75
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
Stay here.

76
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Erin!

77
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,280
Wotcher.

78
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,000
Detective Ripley has
been hailed a hero by his colleagues.

79
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,160
He has been shot
point-blank in the chest.

80
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
Vigilante Thomas Marwood
has been branded a coward...

81
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,600
Oh!

82
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,760
If you're gonna go on the run
you're gonna have to, uh, lose the coat.

83
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,520
It's my lucky coat.

84
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,480
"Lucky?" Right, well, I would take it
back to the shop if I was you.

85
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,840
Get your money back.
It's obviously defective.

86
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
This is a nice place.

87
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,200
- Is it yours?
- Don't be silly.

88
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,560
Alice, what are you doing here?

89
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,160
I saw the news.

90
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,000
- Where have you been?
- Berlin.

91
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,120
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, you should.

92
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,760
I assumed you'd need it eventually.

93
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Not yet.

94
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,960
After Marwood.

95
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,840
Then I'm done.

96
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,360
Why? Because he killed your puppy?

97
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh, that's why you're here?

98
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
To rub my nose in it?

99
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
No.

100
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,760
I came to help the people you love.

101
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,280
I'm sorry?

102
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,800
You assert a fabulous
moral conscience, John.

103
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,920
This adherence to unwritten law, yet,

104
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,680
time and again, it devastates
the people you claim to hold dear

105
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,760
but you don't stop.

106
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,640
Seems to me your conscience
has killed more people than I have.

107
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,120
You know, you say escape, George,

108
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200
but to me, this looks more like
the scene of a violent abduction.

109
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
By Marwood?

110
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,960
- Presumably.
- Why not pop him here?

111
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,160
The way he did Ripley?

112
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
Well, we won't know that
until we ask him, will we?

113
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,040
In the meantime, somewhere out there
there is a police officer

114
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,560
in the hands of a known police killer.

115
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,600
Well, either way, Martin,

116
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
we both want DCI Luther returned to us
at the earliest opportunity.

117
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,800
- A search is underway.
- Then widen it.

118
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,720
You know, George, the Tom Marwood
investigation is under my command.

119
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,880
God help you if you interfere with it
or question my allocation of resources.

120
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,640
DCI Luther does have some loyal friends,
doesn't he?

121
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,360
Oh, yes, he does.

122
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,880
One officer was shot dead,
another was badly injured.

123
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,560
In what the police say
may be a related incident,

124
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,040
Milan Knizac has been attacked
in Mortlake Prison.

125
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Knizac is serving a life sentence

126
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,240
for the murder of Caitlin Marwood,
Tom Marwood's late wife.

127
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,600
Mrs Marwood was raped and murdered
by Milan Knizac four years ago...

128
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,440
- What do you want?!
- Do not move!

129
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,920
- So where are we going?
- We're taking you somewhere safe.

130
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Just to be sure.

131
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,600
You can't honestly think
John would ever hurt me?

132
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,560
So, where did you go?

133
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh, here and there.

134
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,840
Got married.

135
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,800
- You got what?
- Married.

136
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,960
Why?

137
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,920
Does it add a tingle of the illicit
to the conversation?

138
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,720
It's adds a tingle of disbelief
is what it does.

139
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,120
- Where did you and...
- Bertrand.

140
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,320
A conference in Sao Paulo.

141
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
Oh, he was intensely intellectual.

142
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,040
- He "was"?
- Sadly, he passed away.

143
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
Some little girls grow up
wanting ponies.

144
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,400
I always wanted to be a widow.

145
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
So, what about you?

146
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,640
Have you found someone?

147
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,800
Hmm?

148
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,800
- Yeah, kind of.
- Is she interesting?

149
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,320
- To who?
- Me.

150
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,400
- I hope not.
- Well,

151
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,400
I imagine she wouldn't be, terribly.

152
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,120
She wouldn't be some
kind of Zoe surrogate.

153
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
You've got enough
self-knowledge to avoid that trap.

154
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Hmm.

155
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,800
So, she's a pixie.

156
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,280
- A what?
- A pixie.

157
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
A sprite.

158
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,680
A daydream of the life
you imagine you want to live.

159
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,720
- Oh, dear, I feel a bit sorry for her.
- You don't feel sorry for anyone.

160
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,280
Well, quite.

161
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,800
But, in principle, I pity her.
She's not what you want.

162
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,640
- She's what you want to want.
- What is it I want, exactly?

163
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,920
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about Pixie.

164
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,680
- Pix... Her name is Mary.
- I know.

165
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,560
Hmm?

166
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,160
7he officer shot dead
last night has been named as

167
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley.

168
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,960
Detective Sergeant Ripley
Is believed to have been killed

169
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,440
by Tom Marwood,

170
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,760
who first appealed to the public
in this video yesterday.

171
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,560
Four years ago,
she was raped and murdered

172
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,400
by a man called Milan Knizac...

173
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,760
This him?

174
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,280
This is him.

175
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,760
Mmm, goodness gracious me.

176
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,640
What a needy little fishy.

177
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
No, he's got a hero complex.

178
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,520
He needs public opinion
to justify his actions to himself.

179
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,440
So what's the plan, Stan?

180
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,160
I take away everything he wants.

181
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,680
- What does he want?
- To avenge his wife.

182
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,960
To be admired. To become a martyr.

183
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,760
All to make his wife's death
mean something.

184
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
You'd take all that away from him?

185
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah.

186
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,800
Well, that's cruel.

187
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,760
It's the cruellest thing
I could think of.

188
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,280
Okay.

189
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,920
But if any police
aren't out there looking for him,

190
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,680
they're out there looking
for you, so...

191
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,640
how do we even begin?

192
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,960
- Well, the first step...
- Hmm?

193
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,600
- You're Thomas Marwood...
- Mmm-hmm?

194
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,336
You want to kill the man
that killed your wife.

195
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,720
- Hmm.
- But Milan Knizac is in prison.

196
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,200
- Hmm.
- So, how would you do it?

197
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,760
With leverage.

198
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,400
Give me a lever long enough

199
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,160
and a fulcrum
on which to place it and...

200
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
I can move the world.

201
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,320
Nat?

202
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,360
Nat?

203
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,080
- Hello?
- It's not an easy thing, is it?

204
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,440
Having your wife taken from you?

205
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
Well, do as I tell you

206
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,160
and you'll get her back.

207
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,040
What is this place?

208
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Nobody knows we're here, Mary.

209
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,800
Not John, none of his friends.

210
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,240
So, as long as we stay here,

211
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
we're safe, okay?

212
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,520
Just try and make yourself comfortable.

213
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,000
Benny.

214
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,360
Schenk.

215
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,200
Well, never let it be said that you
are less than audacious, Miss Morgan.

216
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,080
Well, I've got an issue with
impulse control, Martin. It's...

217
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,480
in the genes, apparently.

218
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,600
You know, Miss Morgan, I must remind you
that I am a police officer

219
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,320
and you are a fugitive from justice,

220
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,200
and that, by walking in here,

221
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,680
you have, by default,
surrendered your liberty.

222
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,880
Well, you're entitled to send me back.

223
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,800
I wouldn't take it personally.
Besides, I'd only escape.

224
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,600
- I have no doubt.
- Meanwhile, John will be in prison.

225
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,440
Or dead, at the hands of Tom Marwood.

226
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,600
Now, me, I'm as guilty as sin.

227
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,240
Name it, I've done it. But
John's as innocent as I am culpable.

228
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,720
So I suppose the question I'm here
to ask is which matters more?

229
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,520
Punishing my guilt?

230
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,720
Or proving John's innocence?

231
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,080
Now, John...

232
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,080
has asked me to tell you
that Tom Marwood

233
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,640
won't allow himself to be arrested.

234
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
He intends to commit suicide by cop,

235
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,000
to die a martyr to his own cause.

236
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,920
Now, John knows
how to bring him in alive.

237
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,480
But he's going to need...

238
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,560
your support.

239
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,920
What exactly does he need?

240
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,880
For starters,

241
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,240
anything you have on Milan Knizac.

242
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,920
Oh, and I'm going to need
a personnel file.

243
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
Thank you, boys.

244
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,400
Why'd you come back?

245
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,200
- Beg your pardon?
- You heard.

246
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,240
I told you, I saw the news.

247
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,880
Alice, come on.

248
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,920
None of this Berlin bullshit.

249
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,560
- You've been in London for weeks.
- What makes you say that?

250
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,080
I saw the receipt for those boots.

251
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
- Ah.
- Ah.

252
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,360
I wanted something.

253
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,840
- What?
- You.

254
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,320
- Alice, Mary and I...
- Oh, do be serious.

255
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,960
You'll be bored silly
by the end of the week.

256
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,960
- You and I are...
- What?

257
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,840
Well...

258
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,216
- What do I do?
- Let me have it, please.

259
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,040
Erin, no, leave it. It's fine.
If it's him,

260
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,600
it's important we know
what he says, okay?

261
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
Answer it.

262
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,720
Hello?

263
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Mary, where are you?

264
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
I can't tell you that, John.

265
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,560
They...

266
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,360
They won't let me tell you.

267
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,240
All right, okay, of course they won't.
Um...

268
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,656
Look, I won't be long, okay?
I just want to tell you something

269
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,880
and I want you to hear me say it,
all right?

270
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,400
I haven't done any of the things
they're saying I did.

271
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,320
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

272
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,200
Hi, yeah, we've got a trace
on DCI Luther.

273
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
Well, look, don't be scared.
George Stark, he's a bit of a dick,

274
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,320
but he means well, I guess.

275
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,760
And Erin Gray, well, she's just...

276
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,280
she's just got me all wrong, all right?
But she's a good woman.

277
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,600
And push comes to shove, you can...
Well, you can trust her.

278
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,760
Okay.

279
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,320
Are they there with you now?

280
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,160
What about you? Are you, um...

281
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,000
okay?

282
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,800
Yeah.

283
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
Yeah.

284
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
Benny?

285
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,440
Guv, can I have a word?

286
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,440
- Huh?
- Now, please.

287
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,280
What the hell was that?

288
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,680
Letting her talk to him?
What if he traces the call?

289
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,360
Oh, my God.

290
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,800
You're trying to lure him here?
Are you mad?

291
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,000
- How is she?
- Safe.

292
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,640
Did you find anyone?

293
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,280
It'll be in one of these.

294
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,280
Okay, okay...

295
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,760
Oh, I'm bored of this already.

296
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Okay, Milan Knizac is in prison hospital
because someone cut his throat.

297
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,560
Joe Green has got access to him,
he's the prison doctor.

298
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
He's also married to Natalie Green,
who's pregnant, so...

299
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,600
that's who I'd go for
if I wanted Milan Knizac dead

300
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,320
and I needed leverage.

301
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,720
- Who are you?
- Police.

302
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,240
He said no police! You son of a...

303
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,640
Stay down. Stay down.

304
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,640
Alice, Marwood's gone. We missed him.

305
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,240
All right? He's long gone.

306
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,280
All right,
so what did he say, exactly?

307
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,400
That I should report to work tomorrow

308
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,520
and kill Milan Knizac
with a lethal injection.

309
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,240
And if you don't?

310
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,280
He'll make sure that what Knizac
did to his wife is done to mine.

311
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,200
- He said that if I called the police...
- I'm not the police.

312
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,216
- I was the police but I'm not any more.
- Who the hell are you, then?

313
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I'm the man that's gonna
bring Natalie back.

314
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,456
Where are you going?
You can't just leave me here!

315
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,760
If I take you with me,
you'll do something stupid.

316
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,920
You won't be able to help yourself.
You love Natalie, right?

317
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,240
Yeah?

318
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,856
What about him, Tom Marwood?
What about him?

319
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,960
He won't know what hit him.

320
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,720
Benny, small change of plans.

321
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,760
I need you to get a trace on the last
number to call this phone.

322
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah?

323
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,480
Hello.

324
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,800
This is Ryan Clark.

325
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,080
He was over the limit, high on meth.

326
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,920
He was banned from driving
and behind the wheel of a stolen car

327
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,360
when he ran over and killed

328
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,280
a 12-year-old boy.

329
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,760
Mr Clark then fled the scene.

330
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,080
And he was in prison
for less than five years.

331
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,240
This is not about Mr Clark's rights,
this is about our responsibilities.

332
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,000
This is about us doing for ourselves

333
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,600
what the state refuses to do for us.

334
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,600
People like me have tried to be
reasonable, we've tried to be reasonable

335
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,240
but nobody's listened.

336
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,360
Oh, my.

337
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,640
He really does need the world
to love him, doesn't he?

338
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,800
So now, a 12-year-old boy is dead.

339
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,920
My wife is dead.

340
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,560
Many other people are dead.

341
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
Well, no more.

342
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,120
I have made a list of people
like Ryan Clark.

343
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,360
And I will execute them
at a rate of one a day

344
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,160
every day, until the Prime Minister
agrees to hold a referendum

345
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,200
on the death penalty.
Now, that's all I'm asking for,

346
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,560
is for the people of this country
to be given a choice.

347
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,760
It's not like you gave Justin Ripley
a choice, is it?

348
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,000
- That man's death is on your head.
- I don't see how that can be right.

349
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,360
- I didn't ask you to kill him.
- I warned you to stay away.

350
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,720
You can't hold me accountable
if you choose not to listen.

351
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,000
See, the thing is,
I can hold you accountable,

352
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,720
me being a copper and all that.

353
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,936
- Give me that camera!
- Oh, I don't think so.

354
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,320
Give me that camera
or I will shoot him!

355
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,200
No, you won't, Thomas.

356
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,920
Not on camera.

357
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,240
Because people do hate a cop-killer.

358
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,920
And you so very much
want to be admired.

359
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,240
Which is a defect, really,
in @ multiple murderer.

360
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Do not move another step.

361
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,040
She's got a point there, Tom.

362
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,400
I mean, you're not gonna
shoot an innocent man, a cop.

363
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,880
- Not for the world to see.
- Turn off the camera.

364
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,360
- Turn off that camera now!
- Why don't you just

365
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,560
stop this, all right?

366
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,360
And tell us where you're keeping
Natalie Green.

367
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,120
Who has she ever hurt in her life?
No one.

368
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,120
Not to mention the fact
that she's pregnant.

369
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,520
Shut up!

370
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,056
- Come on, Tom. Come on!
- Shut up! Shut...

371
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,680
Just let her go!

372
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,320
You being the defender of the innocent.

373
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,040
- Tom, stop!
- Turn it off!

374
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,920
All right, whoever the hell you are,
turn off that camera.

375
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,680
Tell her to turn it off!

376
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,400
Look, look, just put it down.
Put it down.

377
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,256
Put it down and turn it off.
Do as the man says.

378
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,680
You hear me? Do it, do it, do it!

379
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Now, move away, move away.

380
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,440
What are you gonna do now,
DCI Luther?

381
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,120
What are you gonna do now, Tom?

382
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,376
- She's not gonna come back, you know.
- I don't care if she does.

383
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
- I've got the camera.
- Problem is,

384
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,880
the world is gonna see
that you're not actually a hero,

385
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,600
you're just a cop-killer

386
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,520
that would kidnap a pregnant woman!

387
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,560
I mean, come on, that's nasty!

388
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,760
She's gone, Tom! There's no point
running after her, she's gone!

389
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,680
Bingo!

390
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,520
You... You bring her back!

391
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,960
- Bring her back!
- Tom, it's not like I can actually

392
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,880
show the tape to anyone, really.

393
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,040
- Eh?
- Why not?

394
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,960
Let's say I did.
What do you stand to lose?

395
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,200
You still can kill Natalie Green.
I don't have her. You do.

396
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So, uh...

397
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,400
I've got what you want
and you've got what I want.

398
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,840
- So what do we do now?
- You take me to Natalie.

399
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,000
All right? We let her go.

400
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,360
What, then you...
then you give me back the tape?

401
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,080
Give it right back.

402
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
Liar.

403
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,680
See, you forgot...

404
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,400
that I...

405
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
stole...

406
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,880
I stole your phone, remember?

407
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,640
So I have heard all those lovely
intimate messages from...

408
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,440
Mary Day, was it?

409
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
So...

410
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,440
you get me that tape
and I give you back your Mary.

411
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,960
Okay?

412
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,984
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

413
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
I'm a police officer.

414
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,936
- Give us that phone. Sorry.
- What are you doing?

415
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,936
- Stay there. I need this phone.
- What... My phone...

416
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,120
Hello?

417
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,640
Put George on the phone now!
On speaker, just do it!

418
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,680
Okay. Okay, you're on speaker.

419
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,720
You have to get Mary out of there
right now!

420
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,160
- You understand me?
- I think we've had enough of that.

421
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Hey!

422
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,000
What are you doing?

423
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,800
- George?
- He's trying to lure us out of here.

424
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,360
Please. Trust me.

425
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,840
Boss, you need to get C019 down to
Paragon... Paragon Towers, right now.

426
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,920
Get them there!

427
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,480
Hello, Tinker Bell.

428
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,920
It's John.

429
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,880
There's nothing to worry about.

430
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,040
We need you to stay here, okay?

431
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,200
- Who the hell are you?
- Shh.

432
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,840
What's that?

433
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Proof you shouldn't need of the
kind of man John Luther actually is.

434
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,600
When Stark and the lesbian get back,
you show them this.

435
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,840
Oh, and if you ever...
betray him like this again...

436
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,240
I'll kill you and eat you.

437
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,280
How does that sound?

438
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,520
- What's your name?
- What?

439
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,280
What's your name?

440
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,320
Are you Mary?

441
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,080
- Are you Mary?!
- Yes, yes. Yes, I'm Mary.

442
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,760
- Did John send you to do this?
- To do what?

443
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,200
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- John Luther.

444
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,200
I know what Mary sounds like.

445
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,240
I've heard her voice.
You don't sound like Mary.

446
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,320
- I am. I'm Mary. I'm Mary. I'm Mary.
- Give me your wallet.

447
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,240
Now!

448
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,480
What are you doing?

449
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,160
So, I've got bullets but no gun.

450
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,120
That's quite Zen.

451
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,240
You're Erin Gray.

452
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,080
Don't!

453
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,920
- Find me a nail.
- What kind of nail?

454
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,400
A nail-nail. As in "a hammer and..."

455
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,800
Okay.

456
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,800
- Mary?
- Yeah?

457
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,640
Is the door locked?

458
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

459
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,640
Police officer. Open the door.

460
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,840
Come on! Come on! Get out!

461
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,480
Give me the nail.

462
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,120
Shh. Breathe, Tinker Bell.

463
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,160
- I don't know who you are.
- Shh.

464
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,360
Open the door.

465
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,000
- What?
- Gently.

466
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,320
Close.

467
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,880
Lean all your weight on the door.

468
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,800
Shh.

469
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,400
Shh.

470
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

471
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,000
Nice try. Nice try, Mary.

472
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,480
Tom! I think it's time
we knock this on the head.

473
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,920
Both of you, move! Move!

474
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,080
Both of you! Come on!

475
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,240
Get in there!
Come on, move it, move it!

476
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,200
Mary, it's gonna be all right, okay?

477
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,960
Tom? Where's Natalie Green?

478
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,200
Well, I'm gonna be dead in a moment.

479
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,616
So, I suppose you're gonna have
to live with the never knowing.

480
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,800
No, don't punish me by hurting Natalie,
okay? She's done nothing.

481
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,040
Who the hell do you think you are?

482
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,160
To have walked in here,
after what you've done to me,

483
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,720
and dictate what I can and can't do?!

484
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,800
Stop! Tom, don't!

485
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,080
Stop, don't.

486
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,720
You can choose. You can have one.

487
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,920
- Sorry?
- I said, pick one!

488
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,200
- Why?
- So you know what it feels like. Now...

489
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,440
Time's running out!

490
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,600
Please don't do this.

491
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,640
- It's your last chance.
- I can't.

492
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,920
I can't pick one.

493
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,600
Then you'll walk out of here alone.

494
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,360
Tom, please. Please.

495
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,440
It's ugly, isn't it? Being impotent!

496
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,240
Being degraded,

497
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,480
by a violent man
that you'll never get to punish!

498
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,480
Now, pick.

499
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,160
No.

500
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,760
- Fine.
- Stop!

501
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,040
Just stop pointing that gun
at her head. Stop!

502
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,000
- Then choose!
- I can't choose one!

503
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,280
Five!

504
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,920
- Four!
- Please!

505
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,720
Three!

506
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,600
Two!

507
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,200
- One!
- All right!

508
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,440
All right!

509
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,840
Have you chosen?

510
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,200
- Yes.
- Then say it.

511
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,160
Say a name.

512
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,760
Say it now!

513
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,920
Alice.

514
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Say it again?

515
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,680
- Shoot Alice!
- Say it again!

516
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,520
Alice.

517
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,120
No!

518
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,080
Oops.

519
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,520
Sorry. Couldn't resist.

520
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,040
Run! Run, run, run!
Get out of here! Run! Go on.

521
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Go!

522
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,960
Now, if I let this go, you'll die.

523
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,120
Which is what you want, isn't it?
Eh?

524
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,840
- But if I apply pressure just here...
- No.

525
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,040
- There's a good chance that you'll live.
- No!

526
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Please. Please don't, please.

531
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,760

- Ah, please.

00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,616
Come on, Tom. Come on, Tom.

533
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,376
The medics are coming,
they're gonna save your life.

534
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,680
No.

535
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,280
She's in...
She's in Cathal Street.

536
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,776
- How do I know you're not lying?
- It's true.

537
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,656
- How do I know? Is it true?
- It's true. It's true.

538
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,200
Please, just let go. Please. Please.

539
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,000
- You ready to go?
- Yeah. I'm ready. I'm ready.

540
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm ready.

541
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,240
Not on your nelly.

542
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,360
Medic!

543
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,680
- No.
- Medic!

544
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,920
No! No.

545
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,960
I need him alive!
Put pressure right here! Here. Push!

546
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,920
- Right, upstairs.
- Sir.

547
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,080
Natalie?

548
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,400
We're the police.

549
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,000
You're safe now.

550
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,040
Hold on. Hold on.

551
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,760
- Boss.
- What's happening?

552
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,640
They arrested Alice Morgan.

553
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,160
Where is she?

554
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,840
- And Mary?
- She sent you a message.

555
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,120
- She gave you this?
- She put it in my hand herself.

556
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,480
Benny, I appreciate it, man.

557
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,120
Where you going, boss?
She went that way.

558
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,080
I just want to say sorry to Alice.

559
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,040
There's been a mix-up
over who's who.

560
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,120
I expect they'll, uh...

561
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,240
they'll work it out
in a couple of hours.

562
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,600
I don't care what she's done.

563
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,200
John...

564
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,200
She saved my life.

565
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,640
So you should probably go.

566
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,840
Yeah.

567
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,720
Yeah.

568
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,840
