1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,760
I've seen something like this before.
The masks, the wigs...

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,416
I think he's trying
to recreate something.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
Do you remember the Shoreditch Creeper?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,400
A DCI Ronnie Holland
was the lead detective

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,520
on the Creeper murders.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,520
Found him dead in his hallway.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,520
I'll call you.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,840
I've been ordered to move you
to another case.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,640
- Jared Cass, cyber-activist.
- It was defaced.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,480
- Did you know who was doing it?
- No.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,320
How's life in the Judas division, ma'am?

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,560
I want to know exactly
how he handles that investigation.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,120
If he breaks the law...

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,296
Are you saying you'd fit me up?

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
I want his head on a stick.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,200
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,880
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,880
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,000
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you

20
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,000
♪ Again ♪

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,480
I can't remember
the last time I did this.

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Just stayed up all night talking.

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,040
I mainly stay up all night shouting.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
I find that hard to believe.

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,360
No, it's true. Honestly.

26
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,160
You're such a gentle man.

27
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Uh...

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,680
I don't know about that.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
Coffee?

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,240
Ah, Jesus.

31
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,240
Stop!

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,240
- What's on the trolley?
- Stuff for the incinerator.

33
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,680
- Where'd it come from?
- Where do you think?

34
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,280
Get this to Forensics double-quick.
They're waiting.

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,320
So, how are you doing?

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm all right. I'm good.

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
You look a little tired.

39
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,360
Yeah, I haven't exactly slept.

40
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
Listen, er...

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
I just want to make things right.

42
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,720
That's all.

43
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,840
Be careful, Justin.

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,720
DS Ripley.

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Sir.

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,800
Where's Luther?

47
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
He's not at home. I sent a car.
And he's not answering his mobile.

48
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
I don't know where he is, sir.

49
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,640
This is me.

50
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,280
- Blimey.
- I know.

51
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,160
That's what happens
when I turn my phone on.

52
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,480
- Victim's name is...
- Dani Lane.

53
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,400
Husband's Craig.

54
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,560
I was trying to call them
when you walked in and made your scene.

55
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,200
Obviously you and I have got a problem,
so why don't you just leave this to me?

56
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,320
Are you kicking me off?

57
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,320
Go nail Ken Barnaby.

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Justin, if Ken Barnaby
murdered Jared Cass,

59
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,640
he should go down for it.

60
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,920
I can't imagine why you'd think
I'd have an issue with that.

61
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,760
You found the bodies?

62
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,000
What do I need to know
about you and DS Ripley?

63
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,480
All it is

64
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,360
is Justin and Erin Gray
have been seeing each other.

65
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,360
- Seeing? As in...
- Apparently.

66
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,400
It's a well-known fact
that she's not my biggest fan.

67
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,640
So I think, you know, she's been, um,
filling his head with ideas.

68
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,080
And that's all this is?

69
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,800
- What else could it be?
- This is my house

70
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,200
and I don't want Justin outside,
pissing in.

71
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,240
Now, everything else gets put aside,

72
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,200
including any grubby little
fratricidal conflict

73
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,920
between you and DS Ripley. Clear?

74
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,080
- Yes, boss.
- Good.

75
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,360
You and I have to have
a very serious, grown-up chat.

76
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,960
Think I'd be too scared to show?

77
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,960
Are you coming for me?

78
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,560
- With relish, yeah.
- Good.

79
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,280
Can't be that much of a surprise.

80
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
- So what do you want?
- I want you to leave Justin out of it.

81
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,856
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- He's a good man, Erin.

82
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,016
He's a good man and he's
got a good heart. Don't break it.

83
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,800
Not as a way of getting towards me.

84
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,840
He deserves better than that.

85
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,560
Unbelievable, seriously.

86
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
- I am. I'm speechless.
- How serious is it?

87
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Do you think I'd ever tell you
in a million years?

88
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,840
Right.

89
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,200
The thing about love
is that it brings out the best in you

90
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,160
but it can also bring out the worst.

91
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,520
All your fears, rage, self-doubt.

92
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
Don't mess around with it.

93
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,360
It'll blow up in your face.

94
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,240
- Are you done?
- No.

95
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm having fun, though.

96
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,880
You?

97
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,280
No. I'm not done.

98
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,720
Morning, Paul. You're early.

99
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm a little bit worried
about Lee Harvey.

100
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,560
He's not happy, is he?
He didn't have dinner last night.

101
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
We'll see if we can get the doctor
in to see him tonight?

102
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,880
I'll pop in and see him.

103
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,840
- Mr Carney... Can you watch reception?
- Yeah.

104
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,320
Come on, Paul.

105
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,720
Good morning, Jodie, love.

106
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,360
So we know Ronnie Holland was killed
because he could connect

107
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,680
the Shoreditch Creeper murders
to the death of Emily Hammond,

108
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Dani Lane and Craig Lane.

109
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,680
Yes, but he was bludgeoned to death
in his own home,

110
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,680
so if he knew the killer
for what he was...

111
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,040
Why'd he open the door?

112
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,920
If we knew that,
we'd be laughing, wouldn't we?

113
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,280
We know Ronnie Holland
was fixated with the Creeper murders.

114
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,080
Yeah, well, you don't think he didn't
keep tabs on his prime suspect.

115
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,000
Benny, I need you to trawl through
his browser history, all right?

116
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,640
Phone records. Whatever.

117
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,296
- What am I looking for, exactly?
- Well, you ever get that feeling when

118
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,896
you know something's not quite right
but you're not sure what it is?

119
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,200
Look for that.
Call me when you've got something.

120
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
Okay.

121
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,120
Mr Barnaby? DS Ripley.

122
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,800
Yeah. I remember.

123
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,720
Mrs Barnaby, I'm sorry, I wonder
if I might have a word?

124
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Okay.

125
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,880
So, what can I help you with?

126
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,400
- Do you mind if I ask how it happened?
- How does anything happen?

127
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,480
You dredged it all up.
My mind was all over the place.

128
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,600
I was at sixes and sevens.

129
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,920
Did they tell you what happens
to the hand after they...

130
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,360
Cut it off?

131
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,920
Burn it, presumably.

132
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
They do.

133
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,280
Except I got to it first.

134
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,760
I know this must
be difficult to hear...

135
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,120
but, currently,
your hand is in our forensics lab.

136
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
So, Mr Barnaby,

137
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,920
if there's anything you need to tell me,
then now would be a good time.

138
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,120
Why would I have anything to tell you?

139
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,400
I know you're scared.

140
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,600
My wife has MS.

141
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,360
If she loses me, she's lost everything.

142
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,440
She dies alone.

143
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,800
So "scared" doesn't come into it.
Do you understand that?

144
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
I really am very sorry.

145
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,560
Yeah, well, you carry on being sorry,
DS Ripley,

146
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,640
and if you and your ghouls
find anything, come and see me again.

147
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,880
Till then, why don't you piss off
and leave me alone?

148
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,200
Sorry, just a thought.

149
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,920
My colleague, DCI Luther...

150
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,320
What about him?

151
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
- Did he say anything to you?
- Anything about what?

152
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,480
Did he...

153
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,800
suggest anything?

154
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,640
What suggest...
What are you talking about?

155
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,920
Nothing.

156
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,960
Thanks for your time.

157
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,680
I trawled
Ronnie Holland's phone records.

158
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Checked, double-checked,
cross-referenced.

159
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,080
Gave myself a migraine. He called
his daughter in Canada once a week,

160
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,080
the odd call to a few friends.

161
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,080
Then another number which stuck out.

162
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,320
What made you think that?

163
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,840
The time of the calls.

164
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,520
They were made after midnight.
And he does this four or five times

165
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,960
- over a six-month period.
- So who's he calling?

166
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,640
Winchford Care Home.

167
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,600
- Ex-wife? Family?
- After midnight? Nah.

168
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,560
- So I checked to see who lived there.
- And?

169
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,360
- William Carney.
- Was he in the cold cases?

170
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,920
Isn't he just!

171
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,320
William Carney. Born Billericay, 1948.

172
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,960
Two hundred miles away

173
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,440
and two years after the last Creeper
murder, Carney was convicted

174
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,160
of choking Sandra Cho to death.

175
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,080
- She was a working girl in Liverpool.
- Did he serve his full time?

176
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,720
Twenty-five years, every day of it.

177
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,920
Man's a born predator
and Ronnie Holland knew it.

178
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,120
Did you get hard?

179
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,680
She was a bit nice, wasn't she?

180
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,040
Good legs.

181
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,040
Looking for one of your residents.
William Carney.

182
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,920
- He's a popular lad this morning.
- Is he?

183
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
"Paul Ellis". Who's that? Family?

184
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,320
I don't think so. But I don't know.

185
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,600
- When did he leave?
- You just missed him.

186
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,720
- Just now?
- Yeah.

187
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,960
Benny, listen.
I need you to check out a white male.

188
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,040
He's about 40 years old.
His name's Paul Ellis.

189
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,360
William Carney?

190
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,320
I'm DCI John Luther.

191
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,440
Ronnie Holland sends his regards.

192
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,040
Does he?

193
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,960
What, from the land beyond?

194
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,520
Why would you say that, sir?

195
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Well, he's stopped calling.

196
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,120
He used to like to call me, you know,

197
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,160
when he'd had a few.

198
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,320
He was a devil for it.

199
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,600
You mind if I take a look at that phone?

200
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,920
I mean, if you like,
I could sit here and wait

201
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,040
for the warrant to be signed...

202
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,880
Her feet look lovely
in that one, don't they?

203
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,920
Do you see the arch of the instep?

204
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,840
That happens when they die, you see.
It... It sort of bunches up, yes?

205
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,480
Paul Ellis. Who is he?

206
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,520
Well, he's a fan, apparently.

207
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,840
Guv, I'm not comfortable with this.

208
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,920
Erin, you started this.

209
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,880
You got this ball rolling.

210
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,440
So now we have to control
the direction of its travel.

211
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
"The first principle
is that you must not fool yourself

212
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,880
"and you are the easiest person to fool.

213
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,440
"Richard Feynman.

214
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,360
"Meep, meep."

215
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,840
- We should really get a shift on.
- In a minute.

216
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,000
I just want to get a feel of the guy.

217
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,040
He underlines.

218
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,560
- So?
- We tend to underline observations

219
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,280
that confirm our view of the world.

220
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Give me a day with those books

221
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,760
and I'll serve him to you on a plate.

222
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,080
Give me a search warrant
and you can have it.

223
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,000
But where would be the fun in that?

224
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,440
Look at this.
What does this say about a man?

225
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
You know what?

226
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,320
I love this guy to bits.

227
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,200
Hello, it's Mary.
Leave a message.

228
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,760
Er, hello, Mary. It's DCI John Luther,

229
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
from last night.

230
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,240
Um, yeah, I, you know,
I just called to say hi and, um...

231
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,480
Yeah. Cheers, then. Bye.

232
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,000
These are cold case files

233
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,440
pertaining to the Shoreditch Creeper
murders, circa 1979 to1983.

234
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,320
Unsolved killings,

235
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,040
which we believe were committed
by William Carney.

236
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,080
We believe that these crimes
were connected to the subsequent murders

237
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,320
of Dani Lane, Craig Lane, Emily Hammond

238
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
and one of our own, DCI Ronnie Holland.

239
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,760
The connection goes by the name
of Paul Ellis.

240
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,040
Now, somewhere in these files,
there's a link to him,

241
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,920
direct or otherwise.

242
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,800
This thing with feet...

243
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,080
What's that about?

244
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,880
When I was a little boy,

245
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,840
I read a magazine article
about foot-binding in China.

246
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,440
Do you know how it was done?

247
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,040
They swathe a young woman's feet
in strips of cloth,

248
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
bending the toes under the foot,

249
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,080
breaking the bones.

250
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,880
The way the women were forced to walk
resulted in...

251
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,600
hypertrophy of the hip muscles
and the perineum.

252
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,280
It gave them very muscular vaginas.

253
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,560
Not very shy to talk about it,
are you?

254
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,840
Why should I be?

255
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,680
Well, there's this.

256
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,800
At the time of the murders,
you were a dustman.

257
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,360
They were on your route.

258
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
But you changed your pattern
once Ronnie had sniffed you out.

259
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,920
- Yes, he did, didn't he?
- No more breaking into houses.

260
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,480
No more middle-class women.
It was all working girls from there on.

261
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,720
Well, if you can't get steak,
you have to settle for hamburger.

262
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,800
Never quite
as satisfying, though.

263
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,280
Nice, tender cuts of meat.

264
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
How did you and Paul Ellis meet?
I mean, how'd you get together?

265
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,520
- Well, you tell me.
- Huh. Well...

266
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,800
How about this?
You spent 25 years in prison,

267
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,680
wanking into a dirty little sock,
thinking about the day you get out

268
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,520
and what you're gonna do
to the little girls that got away.

269
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,360
Dani and Emily from Crosswood Street.

270
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,640
But when the time
actually comes to it, well...

271
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,640
Look at you.
So, you look for someone else.

272
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,520
I think, you know,
you get on the internet,

273
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,480
S&M sites.

274
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,680
Someone that wants to do
what you used to do.

275
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,680
Someone who was younger,
I don't know, fitter, stronger.

276
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,280
- Am I making you laugh? What's going on?
- You really have no idea at all, do you?

277
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,800
Well, then tell me.

278
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,440
I didn't seek him out.

279
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
He came to me.

280
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,680
The boy is a pilgrim.

281
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,160
- Sorry.
- What is it?

282
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,560
- You want to see this.
- What?

283
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,560
What am I looking for?

284
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,200
Paul Ellis.

285
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,440
In 1984 you were convicted
of the murder of Sandra Cho.

286
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
But before that...

287
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,280
Ronnie Holland liked you
for another murder.

288
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,320
The murder of April Saunders.

289
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,880
April was a prostitute
working out of a council flat in Camden.

290
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,200
The killer strangled her with stockings,

291
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,280
bit her feet and stole her shoes.

292
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,680
April was arrested several times
and she used aliases.

293
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,840
April Edwards and April Simmons
in 1980.

294
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,120
But she was arrested twice

295
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,960
and used the alias of April Ellis.

296
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,400
Turns out Ellis was her maiden name.

297
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Ellis, Saunders,

298
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,760
whatever we want to call her,
April had a son,

299
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,720
aged 12, Paul.

300
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,640
And he was hiding in the wardrobe
when his mother was murdered.

301
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,400
He saw the whole thing.

302
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
Can you imagine that?

303
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,240
What that would do
to the mind of a young boy?

304
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,840
Watching you murder his mother?

305
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
We're on our way to his house now.

306
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:54,104
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

307
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,480
What do you want?
I'm not your performing seal. I'm busy.

308
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,040
Luther paid a visit to her.

309
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,520
Apparently, he's worried
I might break your heart.

310
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,240
What did he say?

311
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,160
- What did he say?
- He knows something's wrong.

312
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,560
He's just still trying to work out what.

313
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,280
Oh. Holy crap, though.

314
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,920
How did you get on with Barnaby?

315
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,960
I spoke to him
and he looked at me like I was mad.

316
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,560
- That hardly matters now.
- No?

317
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,680
No.

318
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,320
Luther's sniffing around,
so we need to move quickly.

319
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
Meaning what, exactly?

320
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,920
You've got to make a full statement,
on the record, today.

321
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Catalogue everything Luther ever did.

322
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,920
Every lie he told, every law he broke,
everything.

323
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,720
All right, then I need a deal.

324
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,560
- That can't happen, Justin.
- No, it has to.

325
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,400
I'm not losing me job for anyone.
Not him, not you.

326
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,800
I want proper assurances
and that means legal assurances,

327
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,640
or the deal's off.

328
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,280
- Yes, yes. John, this is...
- Joy Harris. Divisional surgeon.

329
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,080
- You understand this is a very sick man?
- Sicker than you know.

330
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,080
Which means he's under my duty of care.

331
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,960
He's fine.
He's had his meds. He's got oxygen.

332
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,800
But the stress of arrest
and interrogation...

333
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,320
Are you joking? You're going to use this
to shut me down?

334
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,040
The minute he becomes symptomatic,

335
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,616
I'm pulling him out of
the interrogation.

336
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,360
How long have I got?

337
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,360
I got the remains of the hand
to Forensics.

338
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,400
They reconstructed Barnaby's finger
well enough to get a match.

339
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,520
So nick him, then.

340
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
How'd you do it?

341
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,880
Come on. This little boy here, I mean,
he should really hate you, shouldn't he?

342
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,336
- I mean, you killed his mother.
- You think she was a good mother?

343
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,600
- Oh, I think she did her best.
- She was a deranged slut.

344
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,520
Do you know why Paul
was in that wardrobe?

345
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,080
Because it wasn't voluntarily,
I can tell you that.

346
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,920
He spent a lot of time in that cupboard.

347
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,880
Heard and saw more
than any young boy should.

348
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,000
Didn't take long
before he started creeping about,

349
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,200
breaking in, stealing shoes, underwear.

350
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,040
Peeping into bathrooms. And so
he did what any monster would do.

351
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,880
And what is that, hmm?

352
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,480
Find his creator?

353
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Well, his first stop
was dear old Ronnie Holland.

354
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,520
Of course, Ronnie remembers

355
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,360
the broken little boy
with the dead mummy.

356
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,880
So he takes pity on him.

357
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,120
He says "I know who did this to you.
I know who did this, son."

358
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,080
So Paul turns up on my doorstep
so full of rage he can hardly speak.

359
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,920
Don't try it.
Don't you keep trying that.

360
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Don't you keep sucking on that thing.

361
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
- I didn't make him what he is.
- You're playing with me.

362
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,040
- That was his mother.
- Don't play with me.

363
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,560
"Your mother did it, Paul,
your mother did it."

364
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,840
All I did was shape the clay.

365
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,040
I'll turn that oxygen machine off,
I tell you now.

366
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,680
All I did was give him
a sense of purpose.

367
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,480
Oh, yeah? And how?

368
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,920
How did you give him that, hmm?

369
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,640
I explained how much fun it was,
you see,

370
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
killing his mother.

371
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,720
How do you pick your next victims?

372
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,536
- Tell me how you do that.
- I like to think of it

373
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,120
as one for the road...

374
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,000
He's using his oxygen mask
far too often.

375
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,480
He's under too much stress.

376
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,520
- Who is she?
- She's lovely.

377
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,440
I can't wait for you to meet her.

378
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,480
Who is she?! Who?!

379
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,160
- This interview is over!
- Who is she? Where is she?

380
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,680
She should be at home
round about now, I imagine.

381
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,440
- Who is she? Who?
- Step out, please.

382
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,720
I know you like to win and you're going
to have your win but who is she?

383
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,640
- Feet like a princess.
- Who, actually, who?

384
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,040
- Tell me who she is!
- John...

385
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,200
Eve?

386
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,400
Hello!

387
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,280
Hi, babe. Yeah, I'm home already.

388
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,080
Oh, brilliant. Er, spag bol.

389
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,520
Yeah. Did you speak to Ayesha?
Did she tell you what happened?

390
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,320
I know! Okay.

391
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,080
All right, see you in a minute. Bye.

392
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,760
Jodie? Babes?

393
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,720
So I spoke to Ayesha... Jo?

394
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,600
Huh? I'm in the shower!

395
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,480
- Do you need a wee?
- No.

396
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,880
No, I'm all right.

397
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,560
- Hey.
- Hello, babe.

398
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,720
- Oh, God, I'm so tired.
- I know. What a day.

399
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,960
Hey, I got loads of food
and, um, and some wine. So...

400
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,240
- Great. I'll start chopping the onions.
- Yeah. I'll be down in a sec.

401
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,160
Benny?
Get me the Winchford Nursing Home

402
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,560
personnel office. Now.

403
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,680
Couldn't stand it, could you?

404
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,160
You couldn't stand it,
all these pretty nurses

405
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,920
thinking you were some weak man.

406
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,160
But you're gonna show ‘em
who you really are, hmm?

407
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,520
Nicely done.
But you may be a little late.

408
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,800
Get him outside. Get him out of here.
Get him out of here! Now!

409
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,080
- What, and you didn't even know?
- Not even.

410
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,560
- Ugh.
- Well, that's the thing.

411
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
You see quite a lot of dirty old men
and whatever.

412
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,800
You catch them glancing
at your boobs and stuff.

413
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,480
- Ugh.
- No!

414
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,000
With this bloke, it's like
he was looking through your skin.

415
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,400
Mmm. I'm just popping to the loo.

416
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,600
Jode?

417
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,520
- So what time's Ayesha home, then?
- Half an hour ago.

418
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,120
Do you think she's stopped off
to see what's-his-name?

419
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,120
- What, Steve?
- No, not Steve.

420
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,440
No, the weird-looking one.

421
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,400
- What weird-looking one?
- You know.

422
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,000
The one that looks like...
Who is it? Paul Daniels.

423
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,400
Jamal? Jamal does not look
like Paul Daniels.

424
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,560
- Jamal's fit.
- Mmm.

425
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,840
I don't know about "fit".
I wouldn't give him a "fit".

426
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,520
Did you actually hear that?

427
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,400
Ayesha? Are you home?

428
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,560
- You can't be serious. What...
- Ayesha?

429
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,920
- Ayesha?
- Babes, what are you doing?

430
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Well, it's not as if
there's actually anyone there.

431
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,040
No. It's just a thing.

432
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
- What?
- The house settling.

433
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,160
Hello?

434
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,360
Hello!

435
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,080
So not funny.

436
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,080
Evie! Stop it.

437
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,760
Right, that's it. You're in big trouble.

438
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Hello?

439
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,720
It's Paul, isn't it?
Oh, you don't have to do this!

440
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,800
Please. We won't say anything.
We won't tell anybody...

441
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,840
Hello?

442
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,120
Anyone home?

443
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,440
Hope you don't mind, Paul,
but I gave Ayesha a call.

444
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,160
Asked if I could sneak up here with her.

445
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,440
Hmm?

446
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,560
Well, go on, say something.

447
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Argh!

448
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,720
Hey. Stay down, now.

449
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,360
All clear.

450
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,040
Mr Carney!

451
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,560
I've got a message for you.

452
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,760
Dickhead.

453
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,520
Ken Barnaby, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Jared Cass.

454
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,960
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

455
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,440
if you fail to mention, when questioned,

456
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,000
something which you later rely on
in court.

457
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Hello, Ronnie.

458
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,840
DCI Luther. Leave a message.

459
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,680
Hi. It's me, Mary.

460
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,800
It's Mary Day, from last night.

461
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,640
So we seem to be
crossing messages. Um...

462
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,640
Anyway, cool. Speak soon.

463
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,360
Or not.

464
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,720
So...

465
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,200
You ready?

466
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,480
Yeah. I'm ready.

467
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,560
This is what you wanted.

468
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,000
- You called him a dickhead?
- Well that's what he is.

469
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,400
Yeah, well,
you won't hear me denying it.

470
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,960
Benny, that phone
I asked you to trace. Anything?

471
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,880
Yeah, it's been on the move a lot,
but it's made three long stops

472
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,640
- at Lasseter Avenue in Stepney.
- Oh, yeah?

473
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,600
What do we know
about Lasseter Avenue in Stepney?

474
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:55,600
You started working with DCI John Luther
in January 2009.

475
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,480
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

476
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,840
And what was the first investigation
you both worked on?

477
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,680
A home invasion. Murder.
Suspect's name was Alice Morgan.

478
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,080
I'll see to it.

479
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,080
- What are you doing, John?
- It's DCI Luther, actually.

480
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,600
All right, girls?

481
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,200
Well, well, well.
This is where it all goes down.

482
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,120
Secret Squirrel Central Station!

483
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,280
Hello.

484
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,560
Hello, John.

485
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,760
Do yourself a favour, mate.

486
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,680
- Get out of here.
- Or what?

487
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,920
- John...
- Shut up, Mr Ripley.

488
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,640
You might just spoil my good mood.

489
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,400
So, has my operation got a secret name?
Like a codename or something?

490
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,040
Mmm? No? That's not very covert, is it?

491
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,680
Do you remember that show
This Is Your Life?

492
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,080
It's like the big red book.

493
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,880
Except for all these people are dead.

494
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,800
Well, most of them.

495
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,320
- Don't make it any worse for yourself.
- And who are you, exactly?

496
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,280
Me?

497
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,080
DSU George Stark.

498
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,880
I tell you what, George.

499
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,840
You're a big man.

500
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,640
And I'm tired.

501
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,040
But if we are gonna take lumps
out of each other,

502
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,120
it won't be the first one
I've had tonight.

503
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,080
And someone's gonna have to find out.

504
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,120
Your boss. My boss.
And then they'll ask why,

505
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,960
how I just walked in on your...
operation.

506
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:33,200
And how I walked out of here with
all the evidence you've got against me.

507
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,600
What's that gonna do
to your reputation, eh?

508
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,080
Now, you can continue if you want.

509
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,520
Chase me down.

510
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,920
But if you take me down,

511
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,240
I'll take you down even faster
and even harder.

512
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,960
You started
working with DCI John Luther

513
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,080
- in January 20089, is that correct?
- That's right.

514
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,280
And what was the first
investigation you both worked on?

515
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,680
A home invasion. Murder.
Suspect's name was Alice Morgan.

516
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,440
She was the daughter of the victims.

517
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,240
Do you want me to go through every case

518
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,496
- we worked on?
- Course they do.

519
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,920
If you would.
I know it will take a while but...

520
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah. That's why I want
to get the big stuff on record,

521
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,080
- while my mind's clear.
- Okay. That's why we're here.

522
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,840
Right.

523
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,920
I just want to say, for the record...

524
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,680
- Yeah?
- That, in my experience,

525
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,800
Dd Luther
is an outstanding police officer.

526
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,280
I'm honoured to have worked at his side

527
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,120
and I consider this investigation
to be little more

528
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,600
than a fishing expedition
and a witch-hunt.

529
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,680
While, arguably, I've seen him
cut procedural corners,

530
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,800
DI Luther has never, to my knowledge,
broken any laws,

531
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,640
either in pursuit of his duty
or otherwise.

532
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,440
I've been honoured to work with him.

533
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,040
Justin.

534
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,280
What time do you call this?

535
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,040
- I'm sorry, did we, erm...
- No.

536
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,720
I'm sorry. It was a joke.
Kind of a bad joke.

537
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,280
It's just... I tried to call...

538
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,360
You know, you tried to call,
then I tried to call and...

539
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,720
Look, um... Okay, so last night,

540
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,200
it was...

541
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,120
I don't know what it was, um...
But it was, it was...

542
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,920
- Yeah, it was...
- Yeah.

543
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,056
And I don't want to play games.
You know, I'm too old for that.

544
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:33,600
I'm not like, well, old old,
but I'm too old for that.

545
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,680
- I'm not a game-player.
- Good.

546
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,040
‘Cause neither am I.

547
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,800
Shall we just stop talking?

548
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,000
Okay.

549
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,160
