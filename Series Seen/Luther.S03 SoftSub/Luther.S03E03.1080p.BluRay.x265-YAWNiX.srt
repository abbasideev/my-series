1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,840
You can come for me if you want to.
But if you take me down,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,720
I'm going to take you down
twice as hard and twice as fast.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,400
You've got to make
a full statement, on the record, today.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,440
- I need a deal.
- That can't happen, Justin.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,520
I'm won't lose me job for anyone.
Not him, not you.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,640
So, I'll call you.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,936
And that makes you think
coming here is a good idea?

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,320
No, but this does.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,560
Dd Luther has never,
to my knowledge, broken any laws,

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,840
either in pursuit of his duty
or otherwise.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,480
I've been honoured to work with him.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,880
I don't want to play games.
You know, I'm too old for that.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,440
- I'm not a game-player.
- Good.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,760
‘Cause neither am I.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
Ohh!

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, ready?

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,160
Take care. All right, see you later.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,640
- See you later.
- Bye-bye!

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,440
I was going to say, er,

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,800
- do you want a lift?
- Uh, yeah. That would be lovely, yeah.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, okay.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,480
Well, I'm just parked round here.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,800
- Okay, cool.
- Cool.

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,080
Right.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,240
So...

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
So...

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,840
You took your time.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,320
I was just picking my moment.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,840
For three years?

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,920
But, you know, this thing...

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,320
me and you, it's not just...

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,320
Get down!

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,880
- Smash it in!
- We're gonna do you now!

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,440
- Start the car.
- It's gonna be all right.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,560
- Come on!
- Get him out!

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
Leave her alone!

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Get off me!

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
What?

39
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,800
Hey, boys!
Hey, boys, help me deal with this.

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,920
Ah, nah, nah, stay there. Stay there.

41
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
All right, pass me it.

42
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,000
How can I help you?

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
What is it, fam?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
You're looking for something, yeah?

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,720
What? What are you, deaf?

46
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Hey, deal with him, man.

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,360
Oh, he's fully loaded! Run! Run!

48
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
- Go, go, go!
- Stop!

49
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
Put your hoods down!

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,360
Hoods down!

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,760
Run, run, run! Let's go!

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Please, please.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
Please just wait, Callum.
Please, Callum.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,320
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

55
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,280
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

56
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,400
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,000
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,880
♪ Again ♪

59
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,880
How old were you when you got together?

60
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,600
21, 227?

61
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
You've, um, still got love
in your voice.

62
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,360
Well, you don't
stop loving someone, do you?

63
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Is that a problem?

64
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,960
It's, um...
It's the opposite of a problem.

65
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,920
- She was very beautiful.
- She was.

66
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,920
Yeah.

67
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
- Duty calls.
- Mmm.

68
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,240
Justin! Come in.

69
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
Sorry?

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,160
Come in.

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,520
Why?

72
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,960
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, you never ask me in. Not ever.

73
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,120
Mmm.

74
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,680
Mary? Oh, sorry.

75
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,200
Uh, this is my mate Justin.

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,840
- Hey there.
- Hey.

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,520
Justin, this is Mary.

78
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,800
- All right, Mary?
- Hi.

79
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
He's my mate. And I love him.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Right. Work!

81
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,096
You gonna be all right?

82
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,440
- Fine.
- Yeah?

83
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,000
- Fine, yeah.
- Make yourself at home.

84
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,240
Will do. Totally.

85
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Well, come on, then, Justin.

86
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,320
Nice to meet you, Mary.

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,640
- Briefly.
- Yeah.

88
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,520
All right, boss?

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Victims are Steven Meredith
and Shaun Butler.

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,400
This is Meredith.

91
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,840
Murdered a young solicitor
six years ago.

92
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,240
It's in the file.

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,680
- Eyewitnesses?
- Dozens.

94
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,560
White male, 25 to 40.

95
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,320
Lightish to darkish hair,

96
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
short, possibly longish.

97
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,080
Nondescript clothes.

98
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,200
May ride a motorcycle.

99
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
Possibly a scooter.

100
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,400
Or a car.

101
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,320
- Where's the other one?
- Over here.

102
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,400
Shooter walks up during the affray,

103
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,120
puts the sawn-off to Butler's chest.

104
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
- Doesn't hesitate?
- Apparently not.

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,400
It's not an easy thing, that.

106
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,200
To put a sawn-off to someone's chest
and pull the trigger.

107
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Even if you hate 'em.
Let alone make this mess.

108
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
- So who's Caitlin?
- Oh, we turned up no Caitlin

109
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,600
in Meredith and Butler's ambit.

110
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,840
No family or known associates.

111
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,320
There's no Caitlin connection
to the solicitor.

112
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
That rules out a revenge attack.

113
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,560
And this is way too heavy
for a gang beef.

114
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,560
- So what's up with the website?
- Goes live in two hours.

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,240
Well, can't we just pull it down

116
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,120
or trace it to the source
or whatever you do with websites?

117
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,040
Apparently not.
It's being hosted from Uzbekistan.

118
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,680
Or Kazakhstan.

119
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,560
One of the Stans, anyway.

120
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,640
The upshot is, is that there's no way
we can pull it down in time.

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,320
Apparently there's hundreds
of these leaflets already in the wild.

122
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,880
People have been tweeting
the address since about 5:00 a.m.

123
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,520
So the chances of containing this,
essentially, are...

124
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,280
three-eighths of sod all.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
Hello, Mary.

126
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
Maxine, I'm DCI John Luther.

127
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,680
You all right?

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,800
This man, the killer.

129
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
He spoke to you?

130
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,000
- He did, yeah.
- What did he say?

131
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,360
He, um...

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
He told me not to be afraid.

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,120
Do you remember anything
about his voice?

134
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,120
- Maybe he had an accent?
- Um...

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,080
Uh...

136
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,960
It was nice.

137
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
In what way?

138
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,400
Kind. He, um...
he had a very kind voice.

139
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
He had a kind voice?

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
And then?

141
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,480
He...

142
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,680
He sat and he held Callum's hand

143
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,320
until the ambulance arrived.

144
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,800
Can you describe him?

145
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
- I'm sorry?
- Describe him.

146
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,080
The killer of these men.

147
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Why?

148
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,440
Maxine, they're dead.

149
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,200
Now, I know he seemed kind...

150
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,056
- but that doesn't give him the right...
- What,

151
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,656
give him the right
to save Callum's life?

152
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,000
Stop me from being gang-raped?

153
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,920
The way I see it, two people
were going to die last night.

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thanks to this man,
and no thanks to the police, by the way,

155
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,480
it wasn't me and it wasn't Callum.

156
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,360
And now you're asking me
to help you send him to prison?

157
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,920
I would rather go to prison myself.

158
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,760
So how did you and John meet?

159
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,520
Sorry, I'm just not very comfortable
having this conversation.

160
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,080
How much do you actually know
about John Luther?

161
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,160
Um...

162
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm not actually sure what that means.

163
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,360
Look, why don't...
Why don't we just give him a ring?

164
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,000
Put it this way. Try, if you like.

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
Does he ever talk about her?

166
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,960
Well, he doesn't not talk about her.

167
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,880
Okay, um, I've actually got to go.

168
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,600
Sit down.

169
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm late for work.

170
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,000
Did John ever mention how she died?

171
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,520
Um...

172
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm not actually sure that
that's any of your business.

173
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,640
She left him.

174
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,360
Shacked up with another man.
And not long after she was killed.

175
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,720
- Did he mention that?
- I'm sorry.

176
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm not sure what's
supposed to be going on here, um...

177
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm completely lost.

178
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,120
That's why we're here.
To help you understand

179
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
how lost you really are.

180
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,800
Oh...

181
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,280
You all right?

182
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,320
Yeah. Got it down to about 14 possibles.

183
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
It's just weird
seeing all these terrible things

184
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
happening to women with the same name.

185
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,040
Caitlin raped. Caitlin stabbed.
Caitlin drowned. It just seems...

186
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,800
I don't know.

187
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,440
Justin...

188
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,160
I think it's time you move on, mate.

189
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,160
I mean, you should be doing my job,

190
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,960
having little Ripleys of your own.

191
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Been meaning to tell you that for...

192
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
You need to get to Hamlyn Woods.

193
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
All right, guv.

194
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,960
Couple of dog walkers
found him, apparently.

195
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,120
- Do we know who he is?
- Yeah, Liam Glass.

196
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Why does that name sound familiar?

197
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,920
For a few months he was
the tabloid's favourite bogeyman.

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Because?

199
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,560
He lived in the spare room of the flat
where Lucinda King died.

200
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,280
Ah! The little girl.

201
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,160
Yeah, four years old.

202
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,320
Mr Glass was her stepfather's cousin.

203
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,920
Crack cocaine addict,

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,080
arsonist, career burglar.

205
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,320
He sat by and took no action
while her mother and stepfather

206
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,496
- starved and beat her to death.
- Yeah, what did he get?

207
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,600
Five years?

208
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
Four, with time served.

209
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,760
Four for four.

210
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
Our boy's killing predators, isn't he?

211
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,320
People the justice system spat out.

212
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,720
He's on a mission.

213
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,360
We'd better find him.

214
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
And find him fast.

215
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,760
It's going live now, boss.

216
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,240
By now, many of you
will be wondering who Caitlin is.

217
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,000
She was my wife.

218
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,360
This is Caitlin.

219
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,960
Four years ago...

220
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,440
she was raped and murdered

221
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,960
by a man called Milan Knizac.

222
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,320
Mr Knizac had been classified
as "medium risk" by probation staff

223
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,320
when he was released from prison

224
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,800
less than halfway through
a nine-year sentence

225
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,280
for robbery with violence.

226
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,400
Caitlin wasn't just taken from me.

227
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,040
She was taken from her friends.

228
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,280
She was taken
from her mother and father.

229
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
She was taken from the children

230
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,400
she will never have.

231
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,200
The criminal justice system
was created to protect us

232
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,400
from people who would do us harm.

233
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,640
But time and again,
it fails in that purpose.

234
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,560
For all the Caitlins

235
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,400
and for all their families,

236
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,720
it's time for that failure to end.

237
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,280
Okay.

238
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,800
I think we've got a big problem.

239
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,840
For all their families,

240
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,680
it's time for that failure to end.

241
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,960
Come on in.

242
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,600
Tom Marwood. Architect.
Pretty good one, apparently.

243
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,560
Caitlin dies, he's depressed.

244
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,280
Spends a bit of time in hospital.
Then, all of a sudden, boom.

245
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,480
He's energised.

246
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,160
Joins a gun club,
takes lessons in Krav Maga,

247
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,880
urban survival courses.

248
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,736
It's like he's training
for the zombie apocalypse.

249
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,080
Wow.

250
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,976
So before this all kicked off,
who was he talking to?

251
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Who was his confidant?

252
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,960
Uh, Alan Ramsey. Caitlin's brother.

253
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,600
- This one?
- Yeah.

254
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,160
Ramsey. All right, find him.
We've got to talk to him.

255
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,760
Guv, Marwood's been planning this
for a long time.

256
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,440
He's well prepared, he's off the grid

257
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,896
and we're not gonna find him
where he's at.

258
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,336
We've gotta find him
where he's gonna be next.

259
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,880
And how are we gonna do that?

260
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, he's making a play
for public sympathy.

261
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,680
Meaning he'll keep targeting
offenders that people hate the most.

262
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,600
- The worst of the worst.
- So?

263
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,040
So...

264
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,960
say we find the ten
most debased scumbags in London,

265
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,280
put a surveillance team on 'em,

266
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
see if we can't get to Marwood
before he gets to them.

267
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,960
Yeah, well, how do we
narrow down the possibles?

268
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,120
I mean, depravity is
hardly in short supply in this city.

269
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,480
We collate nature of offence
against the volume of press coverage.

270
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,280
It can definitely be done, boss.

271
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,360
All right. Let's do it.

272
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,840
Hey. Can we meet?

273
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,800
Yeah. You all right?

274
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,360
Yep. I just... really need to talk.

275
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,040
Okay. Seriously, are you all right?

276
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,480
Some people came round
after you'd gone.

277
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,240
What people?

278
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,600
A man and a woman.

279
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
Police.

280
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,040
I can't talk about this
on the phone. I can't.

281
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,520
- I need to see you.
- Mary, all right, listen.

282
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,000
Just tell me where you are right now.

283
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,720
- At work.
- At work?

284
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
- All right, good. I'll just come now.
- No, no, don't do that.

285
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,680
Mary?

286
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
Hey.

287
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
Should we get a cup of coffee
or something?

288
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah. In a minute.

289
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
- Um...
- You all right?

290
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,040
Yeah, um...

291
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,600
How did your wife die?

292
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,680
Zoe?

293
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,560
Uh, that's a long...

294
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,880
It's a long story.

295
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,120
She was, um...

296
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,320
taken...

297
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,720
by a friend of mine, someone I knew.

298
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,960
And if I'd asked you that question
this morning...

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,960
before that...

300
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,800
Glaswegian dick
had done his dirty business,

301
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
would you have given me
the same answer?

302
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,080
- Of course.
- Why?

303
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,920
Because it's the truth.

304
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,760
Hey, listen.

305
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,720
- Whatever they said, they were lying.
- They had a file on you.

306
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,800
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I did nothing.

307
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,960
Whatever they told you,
they were lying.

308
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,320
I... I think you should
stay away from me.

309
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
- Mary! Come on.
- Please!

310
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
Mary!

311
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,720
They were lying!

312
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,760
Justin. What?

313
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,200
We're down to 263 potentials.

314
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,976
Well, you'd better move faster
than that then, eh?

315
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,640
We'll get there. Where will you be?

316
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
Oh, I'll be checking out
the brother-in-law.

317
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
Okay.

318
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
- Hello.
- George.

319
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,360
John Luther!

320
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,400
How the devil are you?

321
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,400
I'm fair to middling.
Have you got two minutes for me?

322
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
I'll put the kettle on.

323
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,800
What?

324
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,840
What are you scared of, Erin?

325
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,360
I'm scared of what
this is turning into.

326
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,384
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

327
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,640
- So0?
- So here's the thing.

328
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,080
You come for me, I'm fine with that.

329
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,360
I'll match you bite for bite

330
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,280
and, in the end,
we'll see who's still standing, right?

331
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,440
But you need to keep away from Mary.

332
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,000
She's off limits.

333
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,840
But what's the point
of knowing your weak spot...

334
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,560
if I don't get a chance to...

335
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,760
poke it a bit?

336
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,680
See, here's the thing, John.

337
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,520
This isn't some pre-match symposium.

338
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,760
There are no rules of play.

339
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,440
- George, if you sow these seeds...
- Then what?

340
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,920
I reap the whirlwind?

341
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,960
Is that right?

342
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,760
You know your problem?

343
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,000
You've spent your life
thinking you're the whirlwind.

344
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,880
Well, you're not.

345
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,280
Because I'm the whirlwind, John.

346
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm the whirlwind.

347
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,440
We'll see.

348
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,600
A big police search
is underway in London,

349
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,120
trying to find vigilante suspect
Tom Marwood,

350
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,000
after he posted an online video...

351
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,560
Who is it?

352
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,440
It's Lee from downstairs.

353
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,440
Um, courier dropped
something off for you.

354
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
I signed for it.

355
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,840
What is it?

356
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,480
Uh, it's... I don't know,
a book or something?

357
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Please.

358
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,760
Hello?

359
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,200
Alan Ramsey?

360
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,280
- Speaking.
- It's DCI John Luther.

361
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,240
This'll be about Tom, I take it?

362
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,920
Yes, it is. Do you have
a couple of minutes to spare for me?

363
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
Sure.

364
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
I'll see you there.

365
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,600
Alan Ramsey?

366
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,480
Alan? DCI John Luther.

367
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Don't move!

368
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,040
All right.

369
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,600
Stop, stop, stop!

370
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
Stop!

371
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,840
Do me a favour.

372
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,000
And throw me
your phone and wallet, please.

373
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,280
One out of five murders

374
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
are committed by men on bail.

375
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,000
- You know that?
- Every copper knows that.

376
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
Then why does nobody
do anything about it?

377
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,240
Because it's complicated.

378
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,600
No, it's not.

379
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,160
No, it's not.

380
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,840
You've got me there.

381
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,320
Listen...

382
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Detective Chief Inspector John Luther.

383
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,480
All I want is what you want.

384
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,720
To have these people locked up
so they can't do any more harm

385
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,280
to anyone else.

386
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,256
Now, look me in the eye
and tell me you disagree with that.

387
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,520
Not the motive, maybe.

388
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,680
But I seriously dispute the means.

389
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,320
What, you've never been tempted?

390
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,400
To administer
a bit of personal justice?

391
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,680
I don't have the right to do that.

392
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
Nobody does.

393
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,160
Two days.

394
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,800
Give me two days. That's all I need.

395
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,000
- For what?
- To make things better.

396
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,200
- You know I can't do that, Tom.
- Yes, you can.

397
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,440
If you chose to.

398
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,480
Tom...

399
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,720
you know they're going to kill you.

400
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
This is how all these things end.

401
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,880
I died the day I came home
and found my wife's corpse

402
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,360
stuffed into the airing cupboard.

403
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,120
Don't make me your enemy, John.

404
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,920
We're on the same side.

405
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,800
I'm sorry you think that.

406
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,440
Tom, listen to me.

407
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,880
Tom!

408
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,240
Um, DCI Luther?

409
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,560
- He's not here, ma'am.
- Oh, okay.

410
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,840
Then, um, I wonder if you
could spare me a minute, DS Ripley?

411
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,080
Thank you.

412
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,880
So what is this,
like a Derren Brown thing?

413
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,800
- Who?
- Mindreader. Mentalist. Reads minds.

414
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,640
Oh, right.

415
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,680
No, you don't
want to read my mind right now.

416
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,280
Full of scorpions.

417
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,520
Right.

418
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,200
He's long gone.

419
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,440
I didn't know he'd be here.
Swear to God.

420
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,656
I didn't call him or anything.

421
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,040
He cloned your SIM.

422
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,680
He's a clever boy, your brother-in-law.

423
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,040
I'm beginning to like him.

424
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
- You all right?
- Yeah.

425
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,280
Yeah, I think so.

426
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,920
Justin, I think
I might have taken a wrong turn

427
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,840
- somewhere along the way.
- Surely not.

428
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,440
Well, that wasn't exactly
the disarmingly gallant reaction

429
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,720
I was hoping for

430
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,760
- in my heart of hearts.
- What were you hoping for?

431
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,760
In your heart of hearts?

432
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,520
DS Ripley.

433
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,160
Boss.

434
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,440
Yeah, on my way.

435
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,200
Got to go.

436
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,840
- And fight the good fight?
- Listen, we'll... we'll put it right

437
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,120
- but I really do need to go.
- Sure.

438
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,920
Do you want to talk
about this properly?

439
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,720
That's why I'm here.

440
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,560
No, I mean... properly.

441
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,760
As actual human beings.

442
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,160
- Like a drink or something?
- Oh...

443
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,080
- Okay.
- All right, well, I'll give you a bell.

444
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,480
Okay.

445
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,520
- This got my numbers on it?
- All six of them, yeah.

446
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,040
Who needs more
than six numbers? Marwood?

447
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,040
Had it on his toes. Long gone.

448
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,840
So, I had a visitor. Erin Gray.

449
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,760
Oh, yeah? She had problems
parking her broomstick?

450
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,440
She wasn't a happy flower.

451
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,760
- This about Stark?
- I think so.

452
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,120
- I get the impression...
- He's not playing with a straight bat?

453
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,880
Yeah. I get that impression, too.

454
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,200
Why, what's happened?

455
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,360
Nothing.

456
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,480
Listen, I've got to go. Cover for me!

457
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,560
You have one saved message.

458
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,800
Wow, you were right
by your phone. So, anyway,

459
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,960
it's me. Hi.

460
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,600
That's Mary.
Mary Day from last night?

461
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,720
So, yeah, anyway, cool.

462
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,640
Speak soon!

463
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,200
I know, I know you said
to leave you alone, don't talk to you

464
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,840
and I will, I'll just...

465
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I just wanted to say one thing.
And then I'm gone.

466
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,200
Say it.

467
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm really sorry
that you saw what you saw.

468
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,720
I can only imagine
how it made you feel.

469
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,960
It made me want to throw up
is how it made me feel.

470
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,840
It made me want to...

471
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,080
vomit.

472
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,160
- I didn't do those things.
- So,

473
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,800
why did they say that you did?
Was it for a laugh?

474
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,200
Look, I'm not gonna say
I haven't done stupid things,

475
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,080
I have. I've done stupid things.

476
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,400
Really stupid...
But I was trying to help people.

477
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,400
And I... You know, it just got...

478
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,080
It's kind of like
when your car goes into a skid.

479
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,360
And they tell you, you know...

480
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,400
Turn into the skid and then
you'll find yourself coasting.

481
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,640
Trying to hang on
and hoping that somehow

482
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,640
you'll straighten out before you...

483
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,800
get to the edge. I...

484
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,120
None of what they said was true.
None of it.

485
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,720
So you need to tell me what is.

486
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,360
I don't know if that's a good idea.

487
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,480
Oh, well, how am I supposed to
trust you if you don't trust me?

488
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,920
I need to know, John.

489
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,560
Okay.

490
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,120
All of it?

491
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,080
All of it.

492
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,080
Every last drop.

493
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,560
I've got to take this. I'm sorry.

494
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,000
I've got to take...

495
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,640
Yeah.

496
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,160
- Boss?
- Good news.

497
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,760
The proactive strategy
seems to be working, in principle.

498
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,520
In principle? Wow.

499
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,680
A sex offender, Terence Corran,
was abducted from his flat

500
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,616
a little more than two hours ago.
He's on the list

501
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,320
- but we were too late.
- Oh, I had him, I had him!

502
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,600
I had my hands on him.
I just let him go.

503
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,856
Well, he had a gun to your head

504
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,840
so I think it's more a case
of him letting you go.

505
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,280
All right, look, just have Benny
send me the, um...

506
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,920
address.

507
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
All right.

508
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,880
- I'm having a horrible day.
- It's okay.

509
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,560
But, um...

510
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm gonna be back late tonight.

511
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,440
But later than usual, I mean.

512
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,040
I will be back.

513
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,880
You know where everything is.

514
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,840
Yeah, I think so.

515
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,880
- I'll be there.
- All right.

516
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,160
You all right?

517
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,880
Corran's a paedophile.

518
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,640
Did 15 years
for false imprisonment and rape.

519
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,600
Bit of a tabloid nightmare.

520
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,280
Went on to self-publish
poems and essays

521
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,400
about inter-generational love.

522
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,560
Sees himself as a champion of freedom.

523
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,520
Ungoverned by religion or law.

524
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

525
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,640
Lack of conscience
dressed up as philosophy.

526
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,920
- It's not right, is it?
- What's not?

527
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,120
Well, Marwood
walks up to Butler and Meredith...

528
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,360
Blam.

529
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,800
Doesn't do the same with Corran.
Why is that?

530
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,320
You find any keys?

531
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,560
Not that I'm aware of, no. Why?

532
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,800
That's what you do, you know?
You walk in,

533
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,920
big bag of books in one hand,

534
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,040
plop 'em down,

535
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,600
put your keys on the table,

536
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,840
fish out your wallet and your phone.

537
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,080
Yeah, okay.

538
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,800
So who took his keys and why?

539
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,440
- My name is Terence Corran.
- Boss!

540
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,120
I'm a paedophile.

541
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,040
I spent 15 years in prison for
the heinous violation of young children.

542
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,200
I've shown no contrition

543
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,440
because I don't believe sex between
adults and children to be wrong.

544
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,440
Statistics suggest that,
having been released,

545
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll go on to commit
many further offences

546
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,560
against many other children.

547
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,960
But still,
the criminal justice system set me free.

548
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,320
So what should be done with me?

549
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,960
No...

550
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,320
- Do you understand social networking?
- No.

551
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,920
Good. Then I'm not alone.

552
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,120
Apparently, people are climbing
over each other

553
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,320
to incite Terence Corran's execution.

554
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,080
Bread and circuses.
Nothing new under the sun.

555
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,400
If Tom Marwood gets his wish, and people
vote to hang the paedophile -

556
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,920
and they will, for who would
suffer a paedophile to live? -

557
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,056
then there's no telling
where this is going to end.

558
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,800
Riots, copycat murders,

559
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,360
lynchings, pogroms.

560
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,200
Gangs of vigilantes kicking to death
people whose faces don't fit.

561
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,960
Where's your head at?

562
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,000
Well, we're not gonna find
Tom Marwood before midnight.

563
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,480
But if you're right,

564
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,800
if he executes Corran
this all gets very ugly very quickly.

565
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,160
But we know
he's monitoring the media.

566
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,000
And you're right. There's nothing more
potent than private pain made public.

567
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,440
Please.

568
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,120
Upstairs has signed off.

569
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,440
Having made it perfectly clear that,
if this goes lopsided,

570
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,240
it's you and me
who will swing from the gibbet.

571
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,120
It won't go lopsided.

572
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,320
Benny?

573
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,440
If this goes lopsided I need you
to find every bit of intel on Corran.

574
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,200
Haunts, associates, anything
that makes your nose twitch, all right?

575
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,280
- Come on.
- Go, Blue Leader.

576
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,800
- Cheers, Ben.
- Cheers, Justin. Look after yourself.

577
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,560
- Excuse me, mate, Kiera Mills?
- Over there.

578
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,120
Kiera?

579
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,480
Kiera Mills?

580
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,560
Do you know what that man did to me?

581
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,920
Terence Corran?

582
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
I say "man".

583
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,280
Do you know what he did?

584
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,120
Yes.

585
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,400
I was a little girl. I was 11.

586
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,400
- And he...
- Kiera, I should explain to you

587
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,800
that I have no sympathy
for Terence Corran.

588
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,600
All right? Not one bit.

589
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,720
And I don't get to choose who
should live and who should die.

590
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,800
Even if I hate them myself.

591
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,800
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to ask someone to do.

592
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,560
What do you want?

593
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,520
I want you to plead
for Terence Corran's life.

594
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,040
- Benny Boy?
- So I've been trawling the list

595
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,200
of Corran's known associates.

596
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,320
Nothing solid.

597
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,320
But about a month back,
a parole officer got a tip-off

598
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,880
that a nonce, a Gordon Murray,

599
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,000
was in breach of his parole,
associating with known sex-offenders.

600
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,760
Corran's not been named but him
and Murray were known to be BFFs.

601
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,720
Right, and where do we find Murray?

602
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,880
All right, Gordon?

603
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,640
We're the filth.

604
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,120
Which is funny, really,
considering who we're talking to.

605
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,800
Shall we try that again?

606
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,640
I'll have a lemonade, please.

607
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,160
What do you want?

608
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,736
7hey say Marwood
could be unpredictable and dangerous.

609
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
Everyone wants him dead.

610
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,680
Your mate, Terence Corran.
King Nonce.

611
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,400
He's got less than an hour.

612
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,336
- I think you know where he is.
- How could I?

613
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,840
I think Marwood's been following you.

614
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,800
I think he's taken Terence
back to your... clubhouse,

615
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,840
where you and your dirty little mates
have your social gatherings.

616
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,600
So where is it? Back of someone's pub?
Dirty little shop somewhere?

617
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,016
- Come on.
- No, you've got it wrong, mate.

618
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,160
I'm not your mate.
I'm far from your mate.

619
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,536
The sight of you makes me
want to wash my skin with Domestos.

620
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,560
The terms of my parole
forbid me from using the internet

621
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,800
or mixing with other sex offenders.

622
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,600
- Is that right?
- Boss...

623
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,456
Can you turn that up, please, love?

624
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,600
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

625
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,160
I know you're all aware
of how urgent this situation is.

626
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,320
So Kiera will now make
a short statement.

627
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,520
My name is Kiera Mills.

628
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,080
You don't know me,
because I was never named in the press.

629
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,480
But 18 years ago,
when I was a little girl,

630
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,600
Terence Corran stole me
from the back of my mum's car.

631
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,280
She'd just popped to the shops
to get some milk.

632
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,160
Terence Corran kidnapped me
and raped me.

633
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,000
He ruined my life.

634
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,520
This morning, a man
kidnapped Terence Corran

635
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,520
and threatened to kill him
for all the terrible things he has done.

636
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,160
Not just to me
but to other little boys and girls.

637
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,720
So I have come here today...

638
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:36,720
to send a message to the man
who has Terence Corran in his keeping.

639
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,400
And that message...

640
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,400
That message is kill him!

641
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,880
Right, you tell me where he is

642
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,080
or when they come for you,
I'll let you just hang.

643
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,680
- Don't look at me, mate.
- Come on!

644
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,720
- All right! There's a lock-up.
- A lock-up? Where is it?

645
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,000
We use it for meeting, socialising...

646
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,840
- You disgust me! Come on.
- If I tell you,

647
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,360
you might find some materials.

648
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,040
- Shut up, shut up! Where is it?
- None of it's mine!

649
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,800
- Where is it? Tell me now!
- I want it in writing.

650
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,920
Horsemonger Lane, the railway arches.

651
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,960
You just... All you do
is cross the estate.

652
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,360
Benny. Corran's got a lock-up.

653
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,840
Railway arches, Horsemonger Lane.

654
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,640
Scramble ARV now.

655
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,840
Don't! Don't! Please.

656
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,160
Please, no!

657
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,240
Please just let me go.

658
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,200
Please, no!

659
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,120
Oh, God. Oh, God!

660
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,080
Shh, shh, shh.

661
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,240
CO19 are en route. ETA 13 minutes.

662
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,240
Local units should be there in nine.

663
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,600
Wait, boys, he's tweeting the address!

664
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,280
We're on our way.
We'll be there in two, three minutes.

665
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,240
Watch out!

666
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,560
Move, move, move!

667
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,280
Stop right now!

668
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,840
Thomas Marwood! Enough!

669
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,560
Move!

670
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,960
Come on, move!

671
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,360
Come on!

672
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,280
Let go! Let go!

673
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,520
- Get back, get back!
- Get Marwood!

674
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,600
Get him off!

675
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,720
He's still alive. Grab them!

676
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,520
Tom Marwood! Stop!

677
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,520
Okay, enough.

678
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,360
We're done, Tom. All right?

679
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,600
- What's your name?
- DS Ripley.

680
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,400
- Justin.
- What I need you to do, Justin,

681
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,440
I need you to back away.

682
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,400
I can't do it.

683
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,400
Of course you can.

684
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,680
No, I can't. Sorry.

685
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,080
You've already done enough tonight.

686
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,360
I saw how you waded into that mob.

687
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,400
That was brave.
Nobody could ask any more of you.

688
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,160
So just...

689
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,680
back off.

690
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,520
Let me go.

691
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,520
Let's say I did that,

692
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,960
yeah, and all this carries on.

693
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,840
Someone innocent gets hurt.

694
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,880
- How am I supposed to live with that?
- It won't happen.

695
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,480
It'll happen.

696
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,560
You've made your point, Tom.
People are talking.

697
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,560
You're all over the internet.
All over TV.

698
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,000
- You've done what you needed to do.
- I don't want to do this.

699
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,720
I'm a copper.

700
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,000
We're on the same side.

701
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,920
I don't think you're going to shoot me.

702
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,080
Now, please.

703
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,720
