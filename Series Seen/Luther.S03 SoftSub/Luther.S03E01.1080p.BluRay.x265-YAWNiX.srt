1
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,320
Got him.

2
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,280
Are we done?

3
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,280
Bar what I suspect
will be a lengthy debriefing.

4
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
- But tomorrow, yeah?
- Tomorrow.

5
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,520
You all right?

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,360
I think he's pushed some bone
into me brain.

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,000
Excellent.

8
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,360
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

9
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,440
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

10
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,400
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

11
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,200
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you

12
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,000
♪ Again ♪

13
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,440
Victim's Emily Hammond.
Edits technical manuals.

14
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,360
Divorced, no kids.

15
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Comes home around 11:00.
No sign of forced entry,

16
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,056
so it looks like she might have
known her killer, let him in.

17
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,240
- Comes home from where?
- Speed dating.

18
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
What, she's brought him home and...

19
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,920
- It doesn't sound right, does it?
- No.

20
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,200
Women don't go speed dating for sex,
they go for a relationship,

21
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,320
but check 'em all out.

22
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,840
- Um, ex-husband?
- Lives in Bristol.

23
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,440
- Run it?
- Being done as we speak.

24
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,760
There's nothing to suggest
she was into S&M.

25
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,176
No fetish gear in the wardrobe,
nothing on her browsing history.

26
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
No, no.

27
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,040
Our boy has brought this stuff with him.

28
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,640
- You reckon?
- Hmm.

29
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,240
Look, it's a very specific look.

30
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,480
The wig, the make-up.

31
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,736
There's a bit of a Siouxsie-and-the-
Banshees thing going on here.

32
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,600
- Who and the what?
- '80s.

33
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Post-punk.

34
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,480
- Oh, uh, goths.
- Post-punk.

35
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,560
Oh, it's definitely not her wig.

36
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,400
Dirty old thing.

37
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,840
She's not wearing shoes.

38
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,520
You can see the, uh, strap marks.

39
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,800
She was wearing the shoes
when she was strangled.

40
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,080
So where are the shoes?

41
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,480
I've seen something like this before.

42
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,000
- Yeah, where?
- Photograph. Something.

43
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,400
So he's, what?
Re-enacting an old murder?

44
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,680
Maybe he's a fan.

45
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,280
Paying homage.

46
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Back door was point of exit,
front door was deadbolted.

47
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,120
All right, well...

48
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,480
Check that back door again.

49
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,280
Chances are it's probably the way
he let himself in.

50
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,400
DCI Luther.

51
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you have a moment?

52
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,760
How was it?

53
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
Fetish killing.

54
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,160
Whatever he's doing, looks like
he's been planning it for a long time.

55
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,000
So now that he's started...

56
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Be hard for him to stop,
even if he wanted to.

57
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,320
I, uh...

58
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,800
I've been ordered to move you
to another case.

59
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
What other case?

60
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,640
Jared Cass.

61
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Sickness beneficiary.

62
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Cyber-activist, whatever that might be.

63
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,600
Found dead in his flat this morning.

64
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,200
This was filmed on Cass's smartphone.

65
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,080
- I didn't do anything...
- Distributed to his contacts list.

66
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,040
I'm... I'm sorry.

67
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,440
This was how it ended.

68
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,960
What a day. Okay, but why us?

69
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,120
Not us.

70
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
- You.
- Me?

71
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,880
Personally? Why?

72
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,800
- Murder's murder, John.
- Oh, come on, boss. Seriously.

73
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,920
This is a revenge killing.
Meat and potatoes.

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,320
The man who killed Emily Hammond
is organised but not sane.

75
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,200
- He's gonna kill again and very soon.
- It's out of my hands.

76
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,040
You know this smells funny, right?

77
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
Can you handle both?

78
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,800
I can handle both.

79
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
Don't make me regret it.

80
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,640
What's that?

81
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,640
I've got another thing.

82
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,400
You're kidding. What other thing?

83
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,320
Animal cruelty.

84
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,040
Listen, I need you to brief Benny.

85
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,160
Tell him to go over cold cases,
anything pertaining to Emily's death.

86
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm talking strangulation,
burglary, shoe theft...

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
- Masks and wigs.
- Yeah, don't rule out anything.

88
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
You know what? The mask, the wigs,

89
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,016
I think it's part of something else,
you know,

90
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,520
he was trying to recreate something.

91
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,480
Staging something,
it's not part of the fetish.

92
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,120
- Right, how far back are we looking?
- 1979 or something. Oi...

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,960
Meet me at the Jared Cass crime scene
on Hawksmoor Estate.

94
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,920
Hello?

95
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,360
Why? What's it about?

96
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,120
Do I have any choice?

97
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,920
I'll be there.

98
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,280
Detective Sergeant Ripley.

99
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,120
Detective Chief Inspector Gray.

100
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
Just "ma‘am" will do.

101
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,440
How's life in the Judas division, ma'am?

102
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,800
Rooting out dirty coppers?

103
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,920
Satisfying.

104
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
The way you stitched me up to
save your boss, I owe you a favour.

105
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,480
You've given me a vocation.

106
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,400
So what am I doing here?
You going to waterboard me?

107
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,960
Get in.

108
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,080
DS Ripley.

109
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,560
George Stark.

110
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Of what division?

111
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Retired.

112
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,040
They unretired me.

113
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,360
For a special project.

114
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
Come with me.

115
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,760
Oh, come on,
you've got to be kidding me.

116
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,200
Have a seat.

117
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
Zoe Luther. Dead.

118
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,240
Ian Reed. Dead.

119
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,920
Henry Madsen. Dead.

120
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,800
Toby Kent. Dead.

121
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,800
Alice Morgan.
Missing, presumed, well...

122
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,880
Who knows?

123
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
Common denominator?

124
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,480
So...

125
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,640
There was a park ranger.

126
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,200
In America, that is.

127
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,360
He was struck seven times by lightning.
Seven times.

128
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,440
Actually made 7he Guinness
Book of Records

129
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,240
for being the unluckiest guy
in the world.

130
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,520
Or maybe the luckiest guy in the world,
depends on how you look at it.

131
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,440
And...

132
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,520
Do you really think he's innocent,
your boss,

133
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,000
of this murder?

134
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,480
Of this?

135
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,920
Of this one?

136
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,720
Think he's just, uh,
some kind of lightning rod?

137
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,840
Somebody who just gets struck again
and again and again and again?

138
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,360
Carpet underlay from one of the holes
that your boss used to live in.

139
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,280
It's got this man's blood on it.

140
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,600
Toby Kent.

141
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,080
Never heard of him.

142
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,520
Our witness says that Luther killed him.

143
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,720
Put a knife
through the back of his skull.

144
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,120
That place was disgusting,
you could find anything on that carpet.

145
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,520
Are you a homosexual?

146
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,680
Like that's any of your business.

147
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,320
It is my business
if your romantic yearnings

148
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,760
are clouding your judgement
as a police officer.

149
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,616
If you're trying to touch a nerve,

150
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,400
then you're touching me
in the wrong place.

151
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,480
Then you're either a donkey
or you're an accomplice.

152
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,040
And I don't think you're a donkey.

153
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,200
I won't answer any more questions
without my union rep.

154
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,280
Well, then your career ends here.

155
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,360
Because you'll be charged
as an accessory after the fact.

156
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,680
What fact?

157
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,320
If you had any proof of wrongdoings,
then you'd show it.

158
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,600
- What, I'd show you my hand?
- Yeah.

159
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,720
Yeah. Right.

160
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,160
Fine.

161
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,320
You think I don't know a liar
when I see one, son?! Huh?!

162
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,640
You're lying to me!

163
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,160
Now, talk to me!

164
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,960
Tell me!

165
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,800
It's not very nice, is it?

166
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,200
Somebody who's supposed
to be representing the law

167
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,040
and yet operates
in his own sense of justice.

168
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,760
Just read it.

169
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,040
- Benny, what you got?
- Do you remember the Shoreditch Creeper?

170
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,760
Er, yeah, dim, distant memory.
Go on.

171
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,120
Okay, '78 to '81, he assaults eight
women in an escalating pattern.

172
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,480
Breaks in, ties them up,
masturbates while sucking their toes.

173
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Then steals their shoes.

174
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,960
Graduates to killing three times.

175
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,240
Theresa Johnson in '81
and Vivian Leavie,

176
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
plus Sheryl Moody in '82.

177
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,720
Then he just stops, drops off the grid.

178
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
Not of his own accord, he doesn't.

179
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,920
I mean,
not if he's escalating like that.

180
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,480
- How old is he?
- Mid-30s when the offending began.

181
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,440
Well, that puts him in his 70s now?

182
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,360
Doesn't sound right, does it?

183
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,520
Benny, do me a favour.

184
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,576
Sign off on the cold cases
and have them sent to me.

185
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,016
Right, on the way.

186
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
Oh.

187
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Sir?

188
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,880
Come on. Come on.

189
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,440
You all right?

190
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,160
I think so. Uh, yeah.

191
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,056
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm sorry.

192
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,240
You know what? You need to sit down,
just for a second.

193
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,600
Just need to sit down there.

194
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,480
- Yeah.
- You all right, yeah?

195
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,520
Oh, your poor car.

196
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,080
No, don't worry about that.
It always looks like that.

197
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,600
- Is it like a classic?
- Yeah. Probably.

198
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,760
Do you mind if I just take a look?

199
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,800
Er, just look left. Right.

200
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Up, down.

201
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,880
Any dizziness?
Did you bang your head, did you?

202
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,360
No. No, what, are you a doctor?

203
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
No, I'm a copper.

204
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,600
- DCI Luther.
- Luther?

205
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,960
It's a good name.

206
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
- Well, can't take the credit for it.
- It's an unusual name.

207
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,240
Not in my house.

208
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,200
Look, don't worry about any of this.
Um, it really was my fault.

209
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,000
You know, um,
I'm not totally sure it was.

210
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,960
- I...
- No, honestly. It was my fault.

211
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,560
So I'm gonna get your information
for the insurance ‘cause I've got to...

212
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,896
- Be somewhere, of course.
- Yeah.

213
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,616
You're, like, rushing
to the scene of the crime.

214
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,440
- I am, actually.
- Right.

215
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,440
Sorry, um...

216
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,016
- I haven't got my, um...
- It's all right.

217
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,760
I'll just write my... My name's John.

218
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,520
All right?

219
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
So, I'll call you.

220
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,840
- Now, go. I'm fine.
- All right.

221
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
If you had any real evidence,
you'd be talking to John, not me.

222
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,720
If you really believe he's so spotless,
then prevent an injustice.

223
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,360
Help him. Prove it.

224
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,200
And how do you suggest I do that?

225
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,160
DCI Luther will be taking on a case

226
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,920
of a waste of semen called Jared Cass.

227
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,920
Squalid little business.

228
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,640
Small cheese for big bad John.

229
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
It was you?

230
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,440
You had him assigned
to the Jared Cass murder?

231
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,360
I want to know exactly
how he handles that investigation.

232
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
And I mean every move by move,

233
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,040
breath by breath.

234
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,640
If he breaks the law,
I want his head on a stick.

235
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,800
He doesn't know it,
but his good fortune ran out

236
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
the day that I heard his name.

237
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,600
Stand clear of the doors.

238
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,520
Sir.

239
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,200
All yours.

240
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,000
You'll read anything, you.

241
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,560
Wotcher.

242
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,840
- What's it say?
- Gang tags, mainly.

243
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,080
Territorial pissing.

244
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
The killer signed the body,
that's handy.

245
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
Huh.

246
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,440
Post-mortem, apparently.

247
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,000
They've walked in here,

248
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,800
nicked the stuff,

249
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,080
tagged the walls, tagged him,
spat on him, pissed on him.

250
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Still, I suppose
it's what he would've wanted.

251
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,400
You know, we're under the cosh
to clear this up quickly.

252
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,096
Yeah, but we're gonna do it right,
though, yeah?

253
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,376
What is wrong with everyone today?

254
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,656
Of course we're gonna do it right,

255
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,360
we're just gonna do it quickly,
that's all.

256
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,320
- So, where do we start?
- Oh...

257
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,640
Enemies.

258
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,680
Apparently, he had quite a few.

259
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,160
Guess he liked to sit in a room
and slag people off on the internet.

260
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,560
Guy was a troll.

261
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,960
See, here's what I don't understand.

262
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,560
Is why did they loot the place?

263
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,720
Because it's here?

264
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,640
Yeah, but you loot somewhere when
it's got stuff worth looting, don't you?

265
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,560
Iraqi National Museum, JD Sports.

266
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,040
Yeah, but not Jared Cass.

267
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,760
He was on sickness benefit,
never left the place.

268
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,880
So what did he have
that was so expensive?

269
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,200
Where'd you get the money, Jared?

270
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,360
Okay, John, listen.

271
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,600
The Shoreditch Creeper case
was a massive investigation.

272
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,040
It's not so much police work
as archaeology.

273
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,560
Who was senior?

274
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,320
Er, DCI Ronnie Holland.

275
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,160
Good copper, Ronnie.
Long since had his clock.

276
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,600
Let's find DCI Holland,
see what he remembers.

277
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,816
In a case like this, he must have known
who he liked for it,

278
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,000
even if he couldn't prove it.

279
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,480
So let's find out who, yeah?

280
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Yep. I'm going straight there now.

281
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,960
There's a Sean Beamish at 67

282
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,800
and that gentleman thinks
he might go by the name of "Beanie".

283
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,560
Sean Beamish?

284
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Sean "Beanie" Beamish?
It's the police, open up.

285
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,400
- What?
- Jared Cass.

286
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,280
- What about him?
- Well, he's dead, isn't he?

287
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,920
What, still? Lazy sod, innit?

288
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Well, it took us all of two minutes
to find out he borrowed money from you,

289
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,256
to buy all that stuff
he really couldn't afford.

290
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,400
60-inch LCD, Blu-ray library, laptop.

291
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,096
I mean, what's a loan shark
supposed to do?

292
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,280
Can't pay his bills,
so you threatened him

293
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,480
and you threatened him again
and then...

294
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,240
Oops, he's dead.

295
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,600
Funny, that.

296
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,600
- 0i!
- 0i!

297
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,920
Come here!

298
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
Don't...

299
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,520
Help!

300
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,960
Boss. Boss!

301
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,440
Shush. You're making me very jumpy.

302
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,120
Boss, stop!

303
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,320
Erin, whatever's happening,
I want eyes on it. Now.

304
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,440
On my way.

305
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,120
I got a very nasty man

306
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,280
doing very nasty things to people.

307
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,920
And I want to get off this grubby case
as fast as I can.

308
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,920
Boss! Boss!

309
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,120
- Can you see him?
- You wanna help me or what?

310
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,160
Help! Yeah!

311
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,600
Do you see him?

312
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,280
Oh, dear.

313
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,640
Nothing.

314
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,200
How many convictions have you had?

315
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,040
I don't... I don't know. A few.

316
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,840
- Yeah?
- Bit of this, bit of that.

317
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,640
Ever been done on a murder charge?

318
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,960
- No.
- No? Why not?

319
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,800
Because I never killed no one.

320
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,880
Except for Jared Cass.

321
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,440
Except no, I didn't do him.
So you've got no evidence.

322
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,920
Evidence?

323
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,600
Come on, a man of your experience,
you're talking about evidence?

324
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
This is how it actually works.

325
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,040
Murder investigation, three pillars.

326
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,440
Means, motive and opportunity.
I've got means and motive down.

327
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,656
Yeah, but you haven't got the other one.

328
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,720
Oh, opportunity?
Yeah, well, that's seasoning.

329
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,600
And when it comes to seasoning,
I'm like Jamie Oliver,

330
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,120
I just rummage around the cupboard,
just see what I can find.

331
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,720
Are you saying you'd fit me up?

332
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,480
Come on, you dirty bastard, say it.

333
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,360
What is this? Nazi Russia?

334
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's Nazi Russia.

335
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,320
Stand up!

336
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,096
You put yourself at the crime scene,
didn't you?

337
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,000
You made yourself
prime suspect number one,

338
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,840
so I don't need to fit you up, do I?

339
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
- Bollocks.
- I heard he was dead, all right?

340
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,120
Everyone did.

341
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
So I... I went to get back
what he owed me, while I had the chance.

342
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
He was dead when I got there.

343
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,480
He was a funny colour and everything,
I totally swear.

344
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,000
Completely and totally.
On my sack, blood.

345
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,160
I'm not your blood.

346
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,360
So who did it, then?

347
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Anyone, really. Throw a brick.

348
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,600
Is that supposed to help me?
'Cause it really don't help me.

349
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,080
Look, the bloke never went out.
All he did was sit in that flat.

350
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,640
He... He slagged off
loads of people online.

351
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,560
Any one of them would have killed him.

352
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,880
- We want his laptop and his phone.
- Just give me the laptop.

353
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,960
How it got there, I don't really care.

354
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,040
In my lockup, downstairs.

355
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,696
You shouldn't joke around like that,
you know.

356
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,920
Like what?

357
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,720
About fitting people up. One day
the wrong people could be listening.

358
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,640
- Who said I was joking?
- Seriously, you shouldn't joke.

359
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,200
What are you, my dad?

360
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,680
- Right, I'll get it to the lab.
- How long's that gonna take?

361
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,200
Dunno, a week?

362
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
- Can't you fast-track it?
- Yeah, that is fast-track.

363
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,120
Well, you do it, then.

364
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
- Um...
- Come on,

365
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,880
do you want this cleared up
quickly or not?

366
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,560
All right.

367
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm going as fast as I can.

368
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,960
- Did I say anything?
- You were thinking it.

369
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Well, I...

370
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,640
- Yeah?
- I've been looking up your name.

371
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,360
Do you know what it means?

372
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,320
- Tired and grumpy?
- No.

373
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,200
Um, well, it's derived from the German.

374
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,680
Liut meaning "people"
and Aseri meaning "army", so...

375
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,320
It means "people's army".

376
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,000
Oh, okay.

377
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I felt bad about earlier.

378
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,320
So you call me to tell me
what my name means?

379
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,520
Thought you might like to know.

380
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Okay.

381
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,000
So...

382
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,680
It was my fault.

383
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,920
I was retuning the radio.

384
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,200
And I let you think it was your fault.

385
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,120
And I feel bad.

386
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,080
There.

387
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,920
- Said it.
- No, listen, honestly,

388
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,640
don't worry about it. Um...

389
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,880
The AA have got my number on speed dial.

390
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,200
So, what, you're happy
to just take the blame?

391
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,160
"Happy" is a strong word.

392
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,840
Seriously?

393
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,360
No, honestly,
don't worry about it. Really.

394
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,480
Well, can I... Can I buy you
a drink or something, make it up to you?

395
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,560
- Yeah, sure. Why not?
- Okay.

396
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,760
When?

397
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,920
Listen, I've got to go.
Can I call you later?

398
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,520
Okay.

399
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,280
Motive, maybe?

400
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,280
- Ken Barnaby?
- Yes.

401
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,400
DCI John Luther, DS Ripley.

402
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,040
- Can we come in?
- Yes.

403
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,400
Thank you.

404
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,520
- It's just downstairs.
- Yep.

405
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,720
Her name was Cathy.

406
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,160
She was in the sixth form.

407
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,160
Four A-levels.
She wanted to go to Oxford.

408
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,960
She was a very, very clever girl.

409
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,200
Brilliant, really.

410
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,040
Very beautiful, very kind.

411
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,680
She'd been managing the epilepsy
since she was seven.

412
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
And she... she never let it
frighten her, never let it stop her.

413
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,800
She was amazing. She was my little girl.

414
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,160
And then... Well...

415
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,920
I'm very sorry.

416
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Um, I hate to keep dragging this up

417
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,680
but, um...

418
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,880
Her memorial site.

419
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,640
It was defaced.

420
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,360
It started with someone
impersonating her online.

421
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,360
Sending messages,
"Help me, Daddy. It's so hot in Hell."

422
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,840
Pictures of corpses

423
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,480
with her...
her name written on them.

424
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,880
Messages on Father's Day.

425
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,080
Photos of a graveyard...
"Wish you were here."

426
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,040
And then...

427
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,520
he started sending pictures.

428
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,320
Cathy's face,

429
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,320
photoshopped onto obscene images.

430
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,880
My little girl.

431
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,160
Images where men were...

432
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,640
And did you know who was doing it?

433
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,640
No. No, we'd... we'd complain.

434
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,760
Er, the site would get taken down,
but another would spring up.

435
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
It just... It didn't stop.

436
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,640
Er... The taunts, the emails,
the pictures... Horrible things.

437
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,680
Who could do it to us?

438
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,720
I hadn't been very well and...

439
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,320
Well, since Cathy died,
it was very tough.

440
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,160
It was very hard for Ken and me.

441
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,480
Could I offer you a glass of water?

442
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,800
- No, thank you. We're fine.
- Yes.

443
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
We'd love some water, Ken, thank you.

444
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:12,904
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

445
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm sorry to be so...

446
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,360
Don't worry, got a job to do.

447
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,920
I wonder...

448
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,920
Could I ask you where Ken was
three nights ago?

449
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,240
You okay, boss?

450
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,080
No.

451
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,720
- You okay?
- Not really, that was horrible.

452
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,680
You like him for it? Barnaby?

453
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,840
No.

454
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,160
- Boss.
- Well, his wife alibied him.

455
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
What, he was home all night and
here's some texts to prove it? Come on.

456
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,960
Got any evidence?

457
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,840
No, but we've got motive.

458
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,880
I don't know what you want me to say.

459
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,960
What, look, I've got a fetish killer
on the loose, all right?

460
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,520
This is important
but it's not my priority.

461
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,840
Ronnie? Ronnie Holland?

462
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,840
- Think we'd better take the door down.
- Sir.

463
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,880
I'll follow you in.

464
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,520
All right.

465
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,536
What the hell are you doing?
Do you think he's stupid?

466
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,736
No, but I think he's already noticed
something's not right.

467
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,880
You're not a very good liar, Justin.

468
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,680
And that makes you think coming here
was a good idea?

469
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,680
No, but this does.

470
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,160
If he thinks you're acting weird
and sneaking around

471
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,320
because we're seeing each other,
he'll be in his element.

472
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,960
Thinking he's got one over on you.

473
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,040
You do know Ken Barnaby
killed Jared Cass?

474
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,600
- I know, yeah.
- And so does Luther.

475
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,400
But he's gonna let Barnaby walk.

476
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,840
His mind's on this other thing.
Emily Hammond.

477
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
- That's all it is.
- So push him.

478
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,320
Force him to make a decision.

479
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,056
If he comes down the right side,
orders Ken Barnaby arrested,

480
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,880
you've proved your point.
And if he doesn't...

481
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,360
Well, I don't know
what's going to open your eyes.

482
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,720
You don't have to
enjoy this so much, Erin.

483
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,200
You're better than this.

484
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,360
No, what I am is better than him.

485
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,240
And so are you.

486
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Hmm.

487
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,800
The clothes and the wig
date to the early '80s,

488
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,760
but whoever's face is on that mask,

489
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,360
she's not in the cold case files.

490
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,200
It all fits the MO,
but she's just not in there.

491
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,320
Okay, so if she's not a known victim,

492
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,080
then why is the killer recreating?

493
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
What am I not seeing?

494
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,760
Boss, I've had an idea
about the other thing, Jared Cass.

495
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,160
Mind if I shoot off and look into it?

496
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, you go.

497
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,480
How'd it go with Ronnie Holland?

498
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,840
Found him dead in his hallway.

499
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,000
He'd been there for months.

500
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,840
The neighbours thought the stink came
from the communal bins.

501
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,600
Cause of death?

502
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,040
Blunt force trauma to the skull.
No sign of struggle.

503
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,840
John, where's all this going?

504
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,560
I don't know.
It's all mixed up, past, present...

505
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,520
Can't get my head around it.

506
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Okay, back to Emily Hammond.

507
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,320
- Emily, because...
- Emily, because

508
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,360
Emily has some particular quality
which reminds the killer...

509
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,000
Of this woman.

510
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,480
Right. But what connects her
to a series of murders

511
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,480
that happened 30 years ago?

512
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,280
What ties them together?

513
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,000
What do they have in common?

514
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Everything. They've got
everything in common.

515
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,776
We've been looking at this
the wrong way round.

516
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,920
Emily was the fantasy, specifically her.

517
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,016
- It's always been about her.
- Yeah, then why cover her face?

518
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
Why the mask and the clothes?

519
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,960
That is not another woman,

520
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,400
‘cause that's Emily.

521
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,720
He's making her look the way she used to

522
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,080
back in 1982.

523
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,400
These bins have definitely
been emptied and searched?

524
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Yes, guv.

525
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,640
How about upstairs
where the garbage chute is?

526
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,280
There's loads of piles of bin bags.

527
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,640
They weren't there this morning.

528
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,800
Give me the torch.

529
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,240
It's blocked.

530
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,640
I want this chute emptied and searched.

531
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,680
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

532
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,000
That was really, really lovely.

533
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,760
Did you hear a...

534
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,720
Okay.

535
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,960
Smokie!

536
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,520
Benny was right.

537
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,280
Emily is absolutely not
in the cold case file.

538
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,680
However, I know
how Ronnie's mind worked.

539
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,920
He would have kept a subset
of "possibly related” files.

540
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,080
Is she in there?

541
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,920
1982.

542
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,160
Emily Hammond's 14 years of age,

543
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,680
she's living with her mother
at 148 Crosswood Street, Shoreditch.

544
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,800
Oh.

545
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,400
On the evening of March the 12th,
Emily's alone at home, asleep,

546
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,920
when the lodger comes home
from a CND rally.

547
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,840
The lodger discovers
a man in Emily's room.

548
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,960
However, the lodger isn't alone,
she's got six other people with her,

549
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,880
who are all fired up from this rally.

550
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,000
So the men get stuck into the intruder,

551
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,040
who makes a break for it and gets away.

552
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,176
- That's him.
- Ronnie seemed to think so,

553
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,000
but his bosses didn't agree.

554
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,520
MO was different.

555
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,800
The other victims were older,
in their 20s, lived alone.

556
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,176
How many people lived at that address?

557
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,080
Oh, Emily and her mother.
A Claire Hammond, since died.

558
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh, and the lodger, a Dani Shahi.

559
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,680
Dani Shahi? We need to speak to her.

560
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,576
And the other six people
that were at the house that day,

561
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,536
see if anything in their memories...

562
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,920
that we can use.

563
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,120
Justin?

564
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,800
I'm back
at the Hawksmoor Estate.

565
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,160
The killer filmed Jared Cass begging
for his life, then threw the phone away.

566
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,000
Well, first he removed the SIM card,
and you can't do that with gloves on.

567
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,840
We've got a clean print.

568
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,160
Good, great work.

569
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,600
So, do we bring Barnaby in?

570
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,400
No, come on, it's late

571
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,440
and we ain't even got
his fingerprints on file.

572
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,880
No, but he did it.

573
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,576
What do you want me to do,
call in the SAS?

574
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,696
I've got a dead copper here.

575
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,616
I've got a dead copper
and a woman strangled in her bed.

576
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,520
- Barnaby's a vigilante killer.
- All right!

577
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,680
I'll take care of it.

578
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,640
Jeez, who beat him with a grumpy stick?

579
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,600
I have no idea.

580
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,440
Get me Ken Barnaby's number, please.

581
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,240
Can you sign this, boss?

582
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,920
- Come on, Benny.
- All right.

583
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,600
Cheers.

584
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,840
- Hello?
- Mr Barnaby, it's DCI John Luther

585
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,120
from Serious and Serial,
we spoke earlier.

586
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,920
Yes. Hi, how can I help?

587
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,160
Nothing to worry about at all.
Just, your fingerprints are not on file

588
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,120
and I'd like to, um, well...
take a record of them

589
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
just to eliminate you from the enquiry.

590
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,240
Absolutely. No problem.
What time shall I come?

591
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,400
Just after 9:00. Any time after 9:00

592
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,280
and just give your name
to the desk sergeant.

593
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,920
Excellent. Okay, then,
I'll see you in the morning.

594
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,080
All right.

595
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,600
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere, I'm staying here with you.

596
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,880
How is he?

597
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,280
He's going to lose his hand.

598
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,640
That fingerprint's no good without
a finger to compare it to, is it?

599
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,976
His fingerprints are all over the house.

600
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,440
Go and find them.
Dust everything he ever touched.

601
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,080
You've still got to prove

602
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,920
that print belongs to a finger
that doesn't exist any more.

603
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,000
- Oh, we can do that.
- Maybe.

604
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,160
But if I was on the defence team,
I'd argue it into the ground.

605
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,720
And if I was in the jury,
looking at poor Ken Barnaby,

606
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
I'd look for any excuse not to convict.

607
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,480
The fingerprint on the SIM card,

608
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,640
that's got Barnaby bang to rights.

609
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,760
All this...

610
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,160
looks like someone trying to give
himself a chance at reasonable doubt.

611
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,920
Dani Shahi, the lodger,
er, married, divorced,

612
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,320
remarried again, is now Dani Lane.

613
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,000
Think it's too late to call?

614
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,680
Smokie!

615
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,360
Smokie. Smokie!

616
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,000
Did you warn him?

617
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,320
Warn who about what?

618
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,840
- Who's that calling so late?
- Hello?

619
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,776
- Did you warn him?
- Sorry, who are we talking about?

620
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,040
- Ken Barnaby.
- Hello?

621
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,656
Yeah, I told him to come in
and get his prints done.

622
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,560
And did you know what'd he'd do?
‘Cause you know people, don't you?

623
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,560
You know how they think.

624
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,960
Mate, I'm lost.

625
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,416
Whatever's happened, I promise you,
I had nothing to do with it.

626
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,440
- Again.
- Sorry?

627
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,816
No matter what it is,
it's never you, is it?

628
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,216
Justin, I don't know
what you're talking about.

629
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,520
There was blood on the ceiling.

630
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,640
- What are you doing? Mmm?
- Right.

631
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,640
- Whatever this is, it ends here and now.
- Huh?

632
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,520
- What is wrong with you, Justin?
- I want you both out of my sight.

633
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,040
Back here tomorrow morning
with this resolved

634
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,320
or you're both suspended.

635
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,880
- John?
- Yes, boss.

636
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,000
Justin?

637
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,480
- Oh. Cold, cold, cold.
- Hmm.

638
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,960
- Your feet are freezing.
- How's the headache?

639
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,200
I haven't got a headache.

640
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,680
Excellent.

641
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,800
- It's too cold for any of that malarkey.
- It'll warm you up.

642
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm reading.

643
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,440
Oh!

644
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,400
- What was that?
- I don't know.

645
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,280
I thought I heard it before.
I thought maybe it was...

646
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,440
What?

647
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,160
It sounds like a cat.

648
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,840
What the hell is that?

649
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,480
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

650
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,616
And tell them what?
Our cat's stuck in the attic?

651
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,160
It's weird.

652
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,840
Godforsaken cat.

653
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,640
How did it get up there?

654
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,960
There must be a loose tile

655
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,120
and he's climbed in and can't get out.

656
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,600
Ahhh!

657
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,040
You son of a...

658
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,120
Craig?

659
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,440
The name Luther

660
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,120
comes from my granddad.

661
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,480
- He chose it.
- Why?

662
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,960
- For love.
- That's got to be just about

663
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,840
the best reason
to do anything, doesn't it?

664
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,560
So, uh...

665
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,080
Is it too late for that drink?

666
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,200
Help! Help!

667
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,320
No, seriously, you must...

668
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,600
You're right.
Somebody needs to stop him.

669
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,240
♪ I've got a thing, you've got a thing
