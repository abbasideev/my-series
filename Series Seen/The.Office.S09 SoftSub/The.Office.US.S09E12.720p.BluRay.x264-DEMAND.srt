1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,529
We've got to clear out
this cabinet, people.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,841
A lot of these
are dead accounts.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,610
Scranton Mimeograph Corp?

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,603
I don't think we're doing
business with them any time soon.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,691
That's odd.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,443
A letter from Robert Dunder.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,923
"A valuable artifact has come
into my possession.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,686
"I have hidden it
until such time as a person

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,604
"of strong intellect
may safely recover it.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,844
"This golden chalice
is of immeasurable

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,962
"historical and
religious significance."

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,086
The Holy Grail.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,641
Did you send Dwight on a
quest for the Holy Grail?

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,363
I think I'm a little too
busy these days to send...

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,129
Oh, my God, I did send Dwight on a
quest for the Holy Grail.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,204
The Dunder Code!

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,847
I completely forgot
about that prank.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,521
That had to be, like,
six or seven years ago.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,405
Stayed late every
night for a month.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,769
Had a lot more
free time back then.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,888
I don't get it.
Ah-ha!

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,485
A light bulb.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,525
A light bulb?
A light bulb!

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,689
Okay, Okay-

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,485
Invisible ink.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,365
Whoa.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,163
- The ceiling above accounting!
- Dwight!

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,011
Down, Dwight! Dwight!

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,525
Man, I wish I was there to see
his face when he gets to the end

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,445
and finds the fake grail?

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,803
No grail?
You don't remember?

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,927
I don't.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,966
An X?

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,925
Annex. it must open
something in the annex.

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,449
Oh.
Oh.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,921
"Seat of entrance."

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,407
What?

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,045
That's a flush.

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,200
The warehouse!

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,530
- There's nothing down here.
- Oh.

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,769
I expected more
from Young Halpert.

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,249
This just...
Forget it, forget it.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,803
So, how are we getting on with our
grand social media initiative?

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,281
Well, we created
a fake profile

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,847
for a really cool guy
named Derek McBlack. Wow.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,249
It's just Pete in sunglasses.
Oh.

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,209
And then we had him
like Dunder Mifflin.

48
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,891
Then we created a bunch
of fake friends for Derek,

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,611
and we had all of them
like Derek's likes.

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,001
So far we're only popular
with imaginary people,

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,686
but we think this is the
start of something big.

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,921
You two are geniuses.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,011
And I am a genius for
putting you two together.

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,241
Well, all right.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,805
Pete and I work
well together.

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,406
Not that there's anything
special about Pete.

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,403
It could be any guy.
Or girl.

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,925
Not that I'm into girls.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,401
Not that I'm into Pete. Ah!
What was the question?

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,241
Hey.
Hey, Jim.

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,601
Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital
requested a meeting at lunch.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,240
Okay-

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,765
Can we keep it on
the early side, though?

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,291
I've got that thing
in Scranton later.

65
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,966
Oh, sure.
No problem.

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,568
Cece's ballet recital
is today! I cannot wait!

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,325
I've been working
with her on her move.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,925
It's called
the Cece Spin and Kiss.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,650
Do you want to see it?
It's kind of like this.

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,726
It's pretty cute, right?

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,206
"Athlead."

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,807
Please. They're too lazy
to call it Athletes Lead?

73
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,682
Jim should just call
it Stumpany for stupid company.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,968
There's nothing stupid
about working for yourself,

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,405
hanging out
with pro athletes,

76
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,767
getting free tickets to the games.
That's why I'm doing it.

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,605
You're working
for Stumpany, too?

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,047
Yeah. Just weekends for now, but
pretty soon I'm switching over.

79
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,685
What?
Yup.

80
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,564
Hey, Halpert,
what's the big idea?

81
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,769
First you jump ship, now you're
stealing Darryl, too? When will it end?

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,930
Well, take your worst fear
and multiply it by infinity.

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,010
You won't stop until you've
poached us all. Yeah.

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,050
Even you.
No!

85
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,566
I'll be damned if I'm
going to let us lose me.

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,005
Bye, Dwight.

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,964
How are you? Good to see you.
Thank you.

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,530
Hey, Angela, did you hear about the
Irish-American Cultural Center mural?

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,444
Ooh, I haven't heard it!

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,320
So, what about the Irish-American
Cultural Center mural?

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,764
Potato? Oh, no. Kevin,
it's not a joke.

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,003
Angela's husband put me up for a...
Um. Just never mind.

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,050
I have no information.
But I'm sure

94
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,645
as soon as they
know they'll call you.

95
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,123
Senator Lipton
helped me submit my design

96
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,089
for a new mural on
a building downtown.

97
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,442
Now I'm just waiting to hear
from the selection committee.

98
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,602
But, you know,
let's be realistic,

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,366
there are a ton of great artists in
Scranton with way more experience.

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
I mean, who are
they going to go with,

101
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,202
some nobody like me, or a
big name like Tracy Fleeb?

102
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,646
Well, I'm heading out
to Cece's dance recital.

103
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,960
Aw.

104
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,481
Hey, Cece! Daddy's going to
have dinner with us tonight,

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,961
after he comes to your recital.
Are you excited?

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,121
Yeah!

107
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,321
Let's call him!

108
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,089
Hey. I was just
about to call you.

109
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,003
Hey, hon! Are you close?

110
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,128
I am still in Philly,
actually.

111
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,891
What'?
It's insane.

112
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,082
This huge
investor got cold feet,

113
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,924
so I'm stuck here trying
to keep him on board.

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,122
Hon! I wish you would
have told me an hour ago

115
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,964
when you knew you
weren't going to make it.

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,244
Pam, I couldn't get out! I barely made
it out just to make this phone call.

117
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,885
I want Daddy!

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,325
You're going to do great.

119
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,131
And you know what? Mommy's going to
record it, so we'll watch it together.

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,361
Do you mind
doing that, Pam?

121
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,487
Of course.

122
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,524
Okay, are you sure you know
how to do video on the phone?

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,161
Yes, Jim, I think I know how to
point a rectangle at something.

124
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,084
Okay, okay. Just sometimes you're
not the best with the phone.

125
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,568
I know how to operate my phone, okay?
Listen, we're getting close.

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,684
We will talk to you later.
Say bye, Daddy!

127
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,603
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.

128
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,568
Yeah, see? You've still
got to press end, Pam.

129
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
Press end.

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,769
Oh, check it out,
this is our first real like!

131
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,001
Oh, my God!

132
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,401
Alan Olifson
from North Dakota.

133
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,687
He also likes Hammermill
and Georgia Pacific.

134
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,201
Wow, that guy's really into paper.
Yeah.

135
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,566
Well done, you two.

136
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,846
We did it!

137
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,804
Youth Task Force forever!
Yes!

138
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,450
Bap, bap, bap-

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,002
And then... Oh, wait.
No, you go...

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,043
Did I... Is that you? No, you
go first, and then it's a left.

141
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,565
No, you go... Okay, all right.
No, I didn't...

142
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,607
All right,
okay, start over.

143
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,370
You always mess that part up.
Oh, no, no, no.

144
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,120
Oh, God! Andy has just
started to be nice to me

145
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,531
and now I've
sent his girlfriend

146
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,170
into the arms
of a younger man!

147
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,483
And I cc'ed him
on every incriminating memo.

148
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,848
"Pete and Erin,
don't hold back.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,764
"Our social media
presence should be

150
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,649
"hot, hot, hot.
Go at it vigorously."

151
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,486
I did everything but unzip
their pants for them.

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,009
Oh, God, Nellie!

153
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,050
Hey, everybody, uh, a coffee
order is going around.

154
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,851
On me! Just sign your name below.
Hmm.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,081
You're welcome.

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,208
Wait, this says "Dunder
Mifflin Loyalty Pledge."

157
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,247
This? Oh, what?

158
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,442
Double mocha latte, please?
You got it.

159
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,329
Just sign your name below.
Whatever you want.

160
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,640
WWW Wedge?

161
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,245
Come on, Dwight.
Stop overreacting.

162
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,885
I'm getting all
my work done here.

163
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,361
No customers have complained,
nobody even knows.

164
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,886
Yeah, we'll see about that.

165
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,125
Bust out
your complaint files.

166
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,804
I need everything
you've got on Darryl since

167
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,729
he started working for Jim
in the last few weeks.

168
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,081
Break it down
by keyword, okay?

169
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,969
Infuriating,
irresponsible...

170
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,008
They've got us set
up with Windows 95,

171
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,088
so you're kind
of dreaming here.

172
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,130
Okay, I'm going to
need you to print it out.

173
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,450
Customer loyalty.
What is it?

174
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,890
Can you hold
it in your hand?

175
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,568
Can you nudge it with your finger?
Can you dump it on a woman?

176
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,248
No! Why? Because it's an idea.
But what does it mean?

177
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,801
Oh, it's when you
get a free sandwich

178
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,247
after you've already
eaten 10 sandwiches.

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,890
Not even close.

180
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,770
Mr. Romanko has been
a client for 20 years.

181
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,683
He came in today
in a rage.

182
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,205
Why? Because of Darryl,

183
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,606
because Darryl was focusing
on outside projects

184
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,845
and needs to remember his
first priority, the client.

185
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,441
I wouldn't say a rage.

186
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,524
Mr. Romanko, we were a day late
on one of your deliveries,

187
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,523
but two of our trucks
were down for repairs.

188
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,204
It's very unlikely
it will happen again.

189
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,249
Thank you,
thank you.

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,288
No, you're not
going anywhere, okay?

191
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,011
You are angry and we are
going to hear you out!

192
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,731
All right? Because business
is about relationships,

193
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,041
and the key to relationships
is what, Darryl?

194
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,561
L...

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,051
It.
LoYa V Loyaw

196
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,884
"Loyalty" is exactly right!

197
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,850
Thank you. Yes, I
mean, it is everything.

198
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,170
Let's all ask ourselves, have we
been faithful in our relationships?

199
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,044
Mmm. That's none of
your damn business.

200
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,882
Darryl is
"dating" Dunder Mifflin.

201
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,169
Darryl is dating Val.
Still.

202
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,891
But he's flirting with
Jim's company on the side.

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,610
And we all know what
flirting can lead to.

204
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,087
I'm sorry, do I still
need to be here? Yes.

205
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,410
I'm still having a bit of trouble
understanding the importance of loyalty.

206
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,251
So, let's use an example.
Take Erin.

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,291
Erin's boyfriend, Andy,
is away across the ocean.

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,487
Yeah.

209
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,162
So is it all right for her to
flirt with Creed, for example?

210
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,730
Let's try it out.

211
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,049
No, let's not say Creed.
Let's say Mr. X.

212
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,171
Well, I think it would be immoral
for Erin to cheat on Andy.

213
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,244
Oh, I'm sorry,
didn't you cheat on Andy?

214
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,329
Yes, and he didn't like it.

215
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,365
Does Mr. X know that
Erin has a boyfriend,

216
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,444
or did Erin keep
that from Mr. X?

217
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,445
Okay, this is
really hard to follow.

218
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,763
Can we just say Pete, 'cause that's
the guy that Erin's flirting with?

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,606
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Little Ladybug Ballerinas!

220
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,964
Plié. One, two, three!

221
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,642
Really?
I'm sorry. Sorry.

222
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,040
Hello?
Yes, this is Pam Halpert.

223
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,047
I got the mural! Oh, my God!

224
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,249
Um, I'm sorry, I have to go.
My daughter is a ladybug.

225
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,929
I know that doesn't make any sense.
Um, thank you, thank you!

226
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,483
You're very rude.
Yes. Very rude.

227
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,449
Kids are dancing!

228
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,125
Thank you
so much for coming!

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,804
Darryl and I will
be here to serve you

230
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,369
for years and
years and years and years.

231
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,089
So, should we go call Jim and go
tell him to go screw himself?

232
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,042
Dwight, look. I'm sorry you're
having a hard time with this, okay?

233
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,249
Athlead is my future.

234
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,364
No disrespect
to Dunder Mifflin,

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,329
but if I can have fun
at work, I want that.

236
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,927
It can't be more fun than selling
paper and paper products.

237
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,288
It can. Are you
pretending to be crazy?

238
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,601
Huh?

239
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,329
Well, Andy's cute,
but he's too vanilla.

240
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,687
Whereas Pete,
he's just one sick dude.

241
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,842
I mean, you know this
guy likes to get weird.

242
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,645
I'm just going to
say this one more time,

243
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,643
Pete and I
haven't done anything.

244
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,006
It's true!
Yeah, right.

245
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,890
With slamming bods like that?
They ain't playing checkers.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,482
People, it's 2013. Erin is a
strong, independent woman.

247
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,644
Who says she has to
end up with any man?

248
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,803
Okay, can everyone
please stop speaking for me?

249
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,770
Andy is my boyfriend,
Pete and I are just friends.

250
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,205
And that is the end of it!
Right, Pete?

251
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,521
That is correct.

252
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,644
Come on, guys. Where is
this even coming from?

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,970
Your feelings for Erin?
Probably your heart.

254
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,290
And a little bit your penis.

255
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,169
Kevin, really?

256
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,369
Nellie, you have to shut down
Youth Task Force.

257
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,643
I'm not sure if you need to start
a new task force to do that,

258
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,324
but please just do
whatever it takes.

259
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,767
I suppose that will
be all right. Yeah.

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,890
Most relationships
eventually die on their own.

261
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,442
But sometimes they just need a
little pillow over the face.

262
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,411
You're welcome, Andy. And
you're welcome, my own ass.

263
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,687
Listen, I appreciate
you taking the time with me.

264
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,526
Peter, please, we completely
understand your concerns here.

265
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,001
Let us just show you
the latest projections. Jim?

266
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,690
Wade actually has those,
on the road,

267
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,125
but he's going to be
calling in with those

268
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,407
numbers any second.
So just hold on one...

269
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,721
Actually...

270
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,251
Ah, nope.

271
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,402
That is my wife.

272
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,289
Again, he'll be
calling in any second.

273
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,887
Hey, give me a call back
when you get a chance.

274
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,170
Cece did great and I want
to tell you something.

275
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,523
Hey, boss, you've got
to jump on a delivery.

276
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,122
I don't do that anymore.
That's what they told me.

277
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,450
All right,
let's get this over with.

278
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,211
You looking for fun?

279
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,680
It just found you!

280
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,001
Whoo!

281
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,045
Here we go! Yeah!

282
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,044
Yes, we will be delivering
a shipment of paper today,

283
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,251
but I will also be delivering
you a big shipment of fun!

284
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,484
How far is this place?

285
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,401
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along
the way we could play some sports!

286
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,881
Fun.

287
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
Hey, really nice job
in that meeting in there.

288
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,446
Oh, thank you. I don't
know, I still thought...

289
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,567
Yeah.

290
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,165
I'm so proud of you, hon.

291
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,447
Oh, I don't know. Okay.

292
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,683
Just curious, though, what do
you have against Pete and Erin?

293
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,081
Well, Andy wrote me a really
nice recommendation letter

294
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,208
for the adoption agency,

295
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,850
so I just felt
like I owed him one.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,331
Pete's a pretty
cool guy, though.

297
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,205
And Andy was
a terrible lover to Erin.

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,763
He basically ignored her,
and then left on a boat.

299
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,963
I didn't really
think about it like that.

300
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,563
Em, well, not everybody
has what we have.

301
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,090
What we have?
Hmm.

302
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,560
I just remembered.

303
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,524
I kissed that man.

304
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,323
Oh, no. Oh, no.

305
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,722
Yes! Fast food.

306
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,762
I'll take a burger over a gross
Philly cheese-steak any day.

307
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,041
They have
fast food in Philly.

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,201
Not like this.

309
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,641
Exactly like this.

310
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,366
And your milkshake.

311
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,441
Thank you.

312
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,602
It's 30 degrees out,
you're drinking a milkshake?

313
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,206
Nope.

314
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,880
Fire in the hole!

315
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,689
Yeah!

316
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,971
Now that's what working at a
paper company is all about!

317
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,041
Wait, what are you doing? No, I
need the keys! We have to go!

318
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,806
You just threw a milkshake into a
restaurant where they make minimum wage.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,651
It's a YouTube thing! Let's go, let's go!
Come on. They're coming!

320
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,042
Anyone want to see the video
from Cece's recital?

321
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,363
Oh, I would love to,
but I am swamped.

322
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,006
That.

323
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,130
I'll watch it.
Let's get this over with.

324
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,204
All right,
you don't have to...

325
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,801
Let's get
this over with, Pam.

326
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,086
Okay-

327
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,090
Wait, what?

328
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,443
Sorry, I'm in a rush
to get back to work.

329
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,850
Oh, no! I took a phone call
in the middle of taping

330
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,685
and then when I went to turn it
back on, I must have turned it off.

331
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,491
User error. I've heard it
happens to other people.

332
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,607
Oscar,
don't rub it in.

333
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,409
I'm sure Pam is
already kicking herself

334
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,881
for choosing a phone
call over her child.

335
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,687
Well, it was
an important phone call.

336
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,327
I haven't told anyone here
about the mural yet.

337
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,243
I want Jim
to be the first to know.

338
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,931
Whenever I tell him good news,
he's always like "Beesly!"

339
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,604
I love that.

340
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,489
The only thing better
than getting the job.

341
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,210
"Beesly!"

342
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,050
Hey.
Hello, Peter.

343
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,410
This barely even feels
like a prank anymore.

344
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,809
You missed a spot.
Fire in the hole!

345
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,086
Go, go, go!

346
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,809
Ha-ha, yeah,
joke's on you, buddy!

347
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,163
They make you come
back and clean it up.

348
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,163
I am sorry that that was so awkward
for you two in that meeting,

349
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,608
but I am going to have to
reassemble the Youth Task Force.

350
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,844
Oh, no, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

351
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,969
Well, that is not your call.
I made the decision.

352
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,209
You have no
choice in the matter,

353
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,051
and everybody knows it.

354
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,280
Well, okay then.

355
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,646
I guess we
don't have a choice.

356
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,801
Nope.

357
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,211
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

358
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
Lady“.

359
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,281
You never
stop surprising me.

360
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,885
What?

361
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,485
What was that?

362
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,291
Did I just hear you
laughing with glee?

363
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,280
No. I was just
clearing my throat.

364
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,608
Good night.
Good night.

365
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,327
Night.

366
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,401
Night, Creed.

367
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,129
- Hey!
- Hey.

368
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,160
So, how's it going?

369
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,687
We lost Bridgeport Capital.

370
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,841
I have no idea
what happened.

371
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,207
It's like everything I did,
he just wouldn't go for it.

372
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,645
PAM". I'm so sorry.

373
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,882
I have no idea where we're going
to come up with this money.

374
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,327
We have to work insanely hard
over the next few weeks.

375
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,445
I'm sorry. I feel like you've
already been working insanely hard.

376
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,128
Can you figure out how to
upload Cece's dance recital?

377
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,851
I definitely could
use a pick-me-up.

378
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,323
Actually, funny
story, I didn't get it.

379
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,324
I shouldn't have been so cocky about
my rectangle-holding skills after all.

380
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,008
You're not serious,
are you?

381
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,044
You didn't get
any of the recital?

382
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,164
No, I got the teacher
introducing them,

383
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,969
and then
the applause afterward,

384
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,280
but not so much
of the middle part.

385
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,642
Come on, Pam. Pam!

386
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,245
I asked you if you
could use the phone

387
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,810
and you swore
that you knew how.

388
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,724
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sure we can get a copy.

389
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,131
A lot of people
were taping it.

390
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,768
Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's
kid with Cece in the background?

391
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,884
I mean, it's really not
that hard to film a video.

392
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,890
Is there... Um.

393
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,165
You want to ease
up a little bit?

394
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,483
Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you.
I mean, what do I do?

395
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,040
It's gone, that moment's just gone.
I missed it.

396
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,368
I don't know, Jim. Maybe you
should have been there.

397
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,483
You're not serious,
right?

398
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,562
I mean,
how is that fair?

399
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,844
I'm in Philly, these are my days in Philly.
You've agreed to this.

400
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,571
You know what?
I don't think

401
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,005
you want to start
a conversation with me

402
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,366
about what's fair, okay?

403
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,762
This is way more
intense than I ever...

404
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,808
Pam, I'm not
explaining this to you.

405
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,081
Pam, I'm not going over this again.
Jim?

406
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,248
I don't know how else to...
We need you.

407
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,323
I don't know how
else to tell you, okay?

408
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,920
I'm doing everything
I can, every week

409
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,530
to bring home something for our family.
lam... lam...

410
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,171
lam trying to make everything
perfect here, okay,

411
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,726
so that you can have
everything that you want.

412
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,207
I'm doing this just for me?
Is that what I'm doing?

413
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,441
I'm doing it just for me?

414
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,521
If that's what you think, then
this is a really sad night.

415
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,409
You know what?
I got to go.

416
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,970
Okay?
Yup

417
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,764
We'll talk tomorrow?

418
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
Yup. I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

419
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,726
All right, great.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

420
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,606
Bye.

421
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,284
Hey, are you okay?

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,923
What am I doing wrong,
Bflan?

423
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,525
Nothing. You're doing
the best you can.

424
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,085
Brian.

425
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,889
Give her a minute.

426
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,411
It's just a tough
situation, all right?

427
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,889
It's getting tougher.

428
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,325
I just didn't know that
it was going to be this hard.

429
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,481
Yeah.

430
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,005
Let's turn the cameras off.
Seriously, guys? Enough. Enough.

431
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,885
Thank you.

432
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,602
Fire in the hole!

433
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,124
Go! Go! Go!

434
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,009
I nailed that guy!

435
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,369
And replay.

436
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,931
Fire in the hole!

437
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,325
Go! Go! Go!

438
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,089
I nailed that guy!

439
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,451
I'm going to miss
the paper business.
