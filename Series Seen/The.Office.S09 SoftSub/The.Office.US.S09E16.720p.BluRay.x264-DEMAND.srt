1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,684
No. You lied to me,
Andy!

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,888
You pretended to be in this
office for three months,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,849
and you were
sailing on your boat!

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,524
I resent that.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,443
I never lied to you.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,368
Really? "Hey, David.
All is good in Scranton, PA."

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,001
And all was good in
Scranton, PA, that day.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,610
"By the way,
Oscar says hi."

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,126
Oscar says hi
all the time.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,404
He says all kinds of greetings...
Hi, hello, hola.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,010
You're telling me you've
never heard Oscar say hi?

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,809
Andy...
You're calling me a liar?

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,291
Andy...
By the way, that reminds me.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,727
I want to ask you about some of the
lies you've been telling me lately.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,801
Watch it, Andy.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,121
Oh, here we go.
January 7, 2013.

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,084
"Hey, Andy, all's well.
Been meaning

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,804
"to make it down there,
but my wife's sick."

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,161
Well, which is it?

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,090
Is all well,
or is your wife sick?

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,770
Busted!
My wife?

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,248
This has been a really tough time.
Yeah?

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,407
Yeah.
Has it?

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,606
Erin just dumped me,

25
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,843
and I can't remember any of the
"aha" moments I had on the boat,

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,284
and I know it sounds weird to
say, but I really miss my beard.

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,881
Shh. It was like a
security blanket.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,610
Andy... Shh.

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,524
I'm not gonna fire you.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,567
You're not?

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,764
No.
That's awesome.

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,490
I wouldn't own the company
if it wasn't for you.

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,325
So I owe you that.

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,002
David,
I'll be there for you.

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,963
These five words
I swear to you.

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,765
When you breathe, I want
to be the air for you.

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,530
I'll be there for you.

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,962
That's a poem by JB Jovi.

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,442
I want you to have it.

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,688
We are even now.
Understand?

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,801
Got it?
Crystal.

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,450
And you are on very...

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,841
Hey. Very thin ice.

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,846
Vanilla.

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,210
Vanilla Ice.
He was a band.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,444
Good morning.
Good morning.

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,090
And how are you
on this fine...

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,480
Okay.

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,606
We ready?

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,086
Don't use that part.

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,846
Last week, Erin told me that our
relationship will be proceeding without me.

52
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,327
Now I have to see
her every day at work,

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,801
which is brutal.

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,008
When people say office
relationships are a good idea,

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,289
they never talk about what
might happen if you break up.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,289
He sounds like
a wounded animal.

57
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,770
Should have put him out of
his misery and just fired him.

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,650
I can't be around sad people.
It makes me sad.

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,883
I'm the same way
with horny people.

60
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,321
Okay-

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,204
Yes, Pete and I have
started seeing each other,

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,805
and Andy still doesn't know.

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,443
We thought that keeping it secret
was more considerate to him.

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,009
And hot for us.

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,006
I mean, I saw Pete's butt.

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,521
It's sick.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,006
Oh. That's mine.

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,525
I'll just... I'll get it out
of the way for you.

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,041
Jim set up a job interview
for me today in Philly.

70
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,485
It's with a real estate company,
which is a great fit for me,

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,327
because I live in a house
and I know what a bathroom is.

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,402
I'm sorry.
lam just very nervous,

73
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,568
because, honestly, this is
all moving a lot faster

74
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,168
than I expected, and because my
resume can fit on a Post-it note.

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,966
No, don't just let her eat the grass.
She'll puke it right up.

76
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,162
Okay, just put out two bowls and
see which feed she prefers.

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,964
I'm sorry to be taking up so much
of your precious time, Mose,

78
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,724
but she's your aunt, too.

79
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,691
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,961
I need you.

81
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,081
Dwight.

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,491
And you should take
breaks more often.

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,931
I've been waiting
there for 45 minutes.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,809
What? What is it?

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,724
It's my Aunt Shirley.
She's on her last legs.

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,410
Dwight, that's awful.
You have no idea.

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,166
I mean, her hair, her clothes,
it's all falling off

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,083
in great, big clumps.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,801
And we need someone to
go out there and clean her up.

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,962
We had a nurse,
but she quit, because

91
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,128
she was
"poisoned" by Aunt Shirley.

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,090
What do you
mean by "poisoned"?

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,488
Probably nothing.
Or strychnine.

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,209
Or lemonade and strychnine,
which is actually what it was.

95
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,691
Okay, well, I'm very
sorry about your aunt.

96
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,165
Thank you.

97
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,242
But I don't see how
this is my problem.

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
Angela, you owe me one.
Remember?

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,480
Now, please.

100
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,689
She's an old woman, Angela.
She needs a woman's touch.

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,410
It's all hanging out.

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,687
And there's parts of her
I don't even recognize.

103
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,326
There's this one
hanging part in particular

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,046
that's some sort of flap.

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,281
It's fine.

106
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,441
It's like a prehensile
wing or something.

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,567
I don't know.

108
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,687
Oh, God. All right.

109
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,006
I can't... Okay.

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,566
I'll help you.

111
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,011
There's a divot where it was,

112
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,208
and it needs...
Uh!

113
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,761
Where are you going?

114
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,089
Noton
a three-month boat trip.

115
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,169
Oh, burn.

116
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,124
Uh, excuse me, what, everyone can
just leave whenever they want now?

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,201
How dare you?

118
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,961
I'm still the boss.

119
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,245
Hi.
The answer is yes.

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,481
I have some messages for you.

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,121
Are they from you?

122
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,401
Well,
no, they're from clients.

123
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,324
Well, then, I don't want them.

124
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,841
You can keep them.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,085
In fact you can keep that
big, blue Nautica sweater.

126
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,491
I know how much you love it...
I can't.

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,604
No, I insist upon it.
It's an awesome sweater.

128
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,768
Some great memories
tied up in that thing.

129
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,081
These are messages from clients
who want to buy paper.

130
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,003
I don't want to talk
about work right now.

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,128
Well, I only want to
talk about work right now.

132
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,929
Then I want my big
blue sweater back.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,048
Well, I gave it to
the Salvation Army.

134
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,806
I've got this seat
adjusted just right.

135
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,041
Perfect. Yeah.

136
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,245
She got rid of it.

137
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,926
My blue sweater.

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,849
What is that about?

139
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,363
I was just leaving.
Stay.

140
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,884
We are in the brozone layer.

141
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,248
Okay, Nard Dog,
Plop and Clarker Posey,

142
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,766
aka Clarkwork Orange.

143
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,367
Here's the sitch.
Erin dumped me, natch,

144
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,046
but she got rid of my blue
sweater, which was her favorite.

145
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,607
Is she moving on a little fast,
or am I being a total psycho?

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,806
Plop, you go first.

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,843
I don't know. Women do tend to
move on quicker than men.

148
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,884
Survey says...

149
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,402
Doesn't make me
feel better at all.

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,004
Zero Clark Thirty,
what do you got?

151
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,522
Well, look at it this way. Being
a bachelor is not all bad.

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,090
I mean,
you got your freedom now.

153
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,924
Last night I
ordered a pizza by myself,

154
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,769
and I ate it over
the sink like a rat.

155
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,201
There you go. Good for you.

156
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,281
No.

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,602
You're just letting it all hang out.
That's what...

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,809
it may not seem like it,
but this really helped.

159
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,769
- So thank you.
- Cool.

160
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,766
I'll give you $100 to wear
that sweater to work tomorrow.

161
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,604
Aunt Shirley,
hello, it's me, Dwight.

162
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,922
Oh, looky here.
It's big city Dwight.

163
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,964
Careful you don't
get mud on those

164
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,650
fancy town shoes,
big city Dwight.

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,166
Hello, Aunt Shirley.

166
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,520
Who's this
little kitchen witch?

167
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,888
She's so tiny,
like a little kitchen witch.

168
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,487
This is Angela, and we brought
you some new clothes.

169
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,925
New clothes? What for?

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,889
Dear God. Okay.
Oh, my God.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,090
You know what, before you
put the new clothes on,

172
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,561
Angela's gonna get you
cleaned up a little bit.

173
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,602
Yes. How would you
like a nice, warm bath?

174
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,247
How would you like a
mean, cold slap? Ow!

175
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,569
Okay, Aunt Shirley, dear,

176
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,406
can I get you a nice
crisp liter of schnapps?

177
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,563
I could do that.
Okay.

178
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,846
No. No.
Yeah, trust me.

179
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,206
No.
It keeps her docile.

180
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,291
Go to the kitchen, get the
largest receptacle you can find.

181
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,845
Step on it.

182
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,050
Why doesn't Erin seem sad?

183
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,288
Has she found
someone new or something?

184
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,809
And, if so,
why hasn't she told me?

185
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,129
Is she trying to
spare my feelings?

186
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,681
During breakups, the mind goes
to some crazy dark places.

187
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,126
Andy, don't.

188
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,529
No good can
come from snooping.

189
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,251
I'm not snooping. There's
just some crud on her screen.

190
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,442
- You're clearly snooping.
- That's kind of uncool, man.

191
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,363
Oh, come on.
That's her private property.

192
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,361
Hello?

193
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,365
Who's snooping on who now?

194
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,571
What does that even mean?

195
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,045
Everyone, just please...

196
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,246
Put it down.

197
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,765
Come on, Andy.
Put it down.

198
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,171
That's her
private property.

199
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,326
Oh, my God.

200
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,687
See?

201
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,761
That's what nosy'll get you.

202
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,841
Told you so.

203
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,051
Darryl, Clark, Kevin,
Toby, Plop, take a knee.

204
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,210
All right, you guys are gonna
think I'm psycho again.

205
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,521
Couldn't shake this feeling

206
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,001
that Erin's dating someone,
so I looked at her phone.

207
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,561
Man,
you can't do that stuff.

208
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,245
You'll only find pain.

209
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,365
When my ex-wife got into my e-mail
account, she was devastated.

210
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,766
Too late.

211
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,362
I found out she's been texting
a guy named Pete.

212
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,244
Does anybody know a Pete?

213
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,284
Pete. Hmm.

214
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,441
Pete what?

215
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,410
It just occurred
to me that Andy

216
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,045
has been calling
me Plop for so long

217
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,724
he forgot my real name.

218
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,771
Which is Pete.

219
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,086
Hello.

220
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,440
Hey. There she is.

221
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
How you doing?
Hi.

222
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,805
Hey, do I look okay?
You look great.

223
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,006
Okay.
Yeah.

224
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,200
What's that? Is that a...

225
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,523
Okay, I know where you're going with
this, and this is who I am now.

226
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,807
I'm a douche. But look what
I can do with my hands.

227
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,246
Gotta go. VIP just
walked through the door.

228
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,567
How are you, Isaac? You
have something in your ear.

229
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,641
It's a phone.

230
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,404
Yes, it is,
and thank you so much

231
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,284
for setting up
this opportunity.

232
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,441
I really appreciate it.

233
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,170
Of course.
Anything for team Halpert.

234
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,366
You're gonna crush it, Pam.

235
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,561
Thanks.

236
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,687
You are gonna crush it.

237
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,126
Wow, I missed you.

238
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,567
Wait, are you saying that into the
phone or are you saying that to me?

239
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,210
Call you right back.
What were you saying?

240
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,281
Ha ha.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,331
Hey, Jim.

242
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,164
We got Trent
Edwards on the line.

243
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,401
L gotta go.

244
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,006
But, you know what,
team Halpert, okay?

245
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,401
You're gonna crush it.
You're gonna smash it.

246
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,648
Okay. Good luck.

247
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,721
Bye.

248
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,284
God, she drank so much.

249
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,691
And so quickly.

250
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,361
In her prime, Shirls could
put away homemade schnapps

251
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,930
morning, noon and night.

252
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,849
Now all it takes
is half a liter.

253
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,449
She's dreaming. All right.

254
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,921
Let's get her out to the yard
so you can spray her down.

255
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,610
Spray her down?
No.

256
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,489
It's a lot
better than it sounds.

257
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,846
There's a private shower area,
very tasteful and very rustic.

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,321
Hey-

259
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,521
Come on in. Have a seat.

260
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,761
Thanks for coming in. I just got
to get something off my chest.

261
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,761
I just got some
really weird news,

262
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,571
and I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

263
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,968
I just got off
the phone with my doctor,

264
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,891
and turns out I contracted
chlamydia from Erin.

265
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
And it's incurable.

266
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,881
Pretty lame, huh?

267
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,721
Yeah.

268
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,561
You were gone...

269
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,681
I knew it!

270
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,921
...for a long time, Andy.

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
You and Erin are...

272
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,408
Fu...

273
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,683
Andy, just so you know,
there was no overlap.

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,004
No overlap? Great.
Good. Wow.

275
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,691
This is suddenly so easy.

276
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,001
Guess what? You're fired.

277
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,161
What?

278
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,090
Yeah. You are fired.

279
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,529
One of the perks
of being boss.

280
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,483
I can fire anyone who
steals my girlfriend.

281
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,127
And, wow, that turns
out to be you.

282
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,281
Yup, sorry.

283
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,527
So you had a bad day

284
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,681
The camera don't lie

285
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,761
Andy. I'm trying to...

286
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,366
You're a big idiot
Get out of my office

287
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,490
Turns out you're fired
because you suck

288
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,130
And you're fired

289
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,851
If you want to talk to me, I'll
be in the annex, all right?

290
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,405
I'm gonna be in the annex.

291
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,281
Toby.

292
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,371
Toby.

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,924
You can't fire Pete.
You understand why, right?

294
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,361
No.

295
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,803
Andy, we had this
exact same conversation

296
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,928
when you wanted to
get rid of Nellie.

297
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,806
You can't just get rid
of people over grudges.

298
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,804
Nellie was
a professional grudge.

299
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,564
This is a purely
personal grudge.

300
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,402
All right, well, look,
while I have you,

301
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,405
this is a relationship disclosure
form for Pete and Erin.

302
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,690
They already have a contract?

303
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,329
"Mutually agree to..."

304
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,566
Every phrase is like
a dagger in my crotch.

305
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,163
It's just boilerplate.
You don't have to read it.

306
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,605
Well, I'm not
signing away my rights.

307
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,691
I already signed it.
I was just showing you.

308
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,087
Okay,
well, we'll see about that.

309
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,650
Andy, that's not
the original.

310
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,684
And destroying it will not
stop them from dating.

311
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,209
It's the original.

312
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
If they're
talking ChesterAvenue

313
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,166
Talking triplex

314
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,129
Talking converting...

315
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,043
Is that her? Hey, guys.

316
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,761
Say something. I said...
Hello.

317
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,887
Hi, I'm Mark.

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,047
Hi. Pam. Hello.

319
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,521
I'm the horrible
boss around here,

320
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,041
but please don't hire
Jamie Foxx to kill me.

321
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,482
Dlango!

322
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,090
I don't agree with the use
of the N word in that movie.

323
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,326
It's too soon.

324
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,804
I'm Pam Halpert.
Oh. Hi.

325
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,450
They call me Marky
Mark around here,

326
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,003
because here at Simon Realty,
we are one funky bunch.

327
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,250
Come on, you guys. Raise
the roof when I say that.

328
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,809
What are you,
all temps again today?

329
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,443
Let's go, Gangnam-style.

330
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,444
He's heard Gangnam Style.
He knows it.

331
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,967
Right? That's 'cause
he's American.

332
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,406
This is Carl.
Hi.

333
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,324
He's from here. He's from
our neck of the woods.

334
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,922
But Gangnam Style
is great, isn't it?

335
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,170
Oh, my God.
He's Michael Scott.

336
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,481
Time to get clean.

337
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,726
It's hosing time,
Aunt Shirley.

338
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,848
Have a seat. You're
gonna have a hard time

339
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,729
hearing her over
the roar of the hose.

340
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,290
We have to do chains?
Oh, you'll see.

341
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,170
Here we go.
Get this show on the road.

342
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,765
Let's do it. Ready?

343
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,129
Here's a box cutter
to get her clothes off.

344
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,641
Dwight!
Let's get to it.

345
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,121
Give it a whirl.
No. No.

346
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,568
Dwight, I'm not gonna hose your
aunt down like some animal.

347
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,523
Stop your bellyaching
and hose me.

348
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,926
I need you to hose my aunt.

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,001
No, Dwight.
Okay, you are useless.

350
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,127
No, no.
Give me the hose.

351
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,201
Dwight, I won't do it.

352
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,202
I'm gonna give your aunt a proper
bath and a haircut like a lady.

353
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,442
And you two are
gonna shut up about it.

354
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,840
Do you have a bathtub?

355
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,450
Yes, ma'am.
Good.

356
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,605
This is not so much
an office

357
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,321
as it is a rec room with
a bunch of computers in it.

358
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,562
And, frankly,
if I had my way,

359
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,246
I'd toss the computers
in the garbage,

360
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,530
but unfortunately we use them for
practically everything we do, so...

361
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,640
That ain't gonna happen.

362
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,366
He's a temp.
Don't worry about him.

363
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,721
Alice!

364
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,010
All right.
Stay awake, okay?

365
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,971
Hey, Nellie.

366
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,163
I am so sick of February.

367
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,211
It's the shortest month, but
it sure doesn't feel that way.

368
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,441
We should catch up.

369
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,603
You know, I've been going
over my notes from the trial.

370
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,920
Oh, no, Toby, no.
No, no, no.

371
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,486
I feel like I might have glossed
over a few minor points.

372
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,171
No, Toby, you cannot keep blathering
on about this Scranton Strangler.

373
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,005
Do something about it. Get it out
of your system, whatever it takes.

374
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,406
I've been drafting a letter.

375
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,760
For two years!

376
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,683
Then what? Another year
picking out a stamp?

377
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,240
Another six months before you
decide to lick it? Just...

378
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,405
I don't want to hear it.

379
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,641
My Aunt Joan.

380
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,202
Oh, well, she worked
here before I did,

381
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,408
so there's no nepotism involved.
In fact,

382
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,168
to be honest with you, I'm
probably a little harder on her

383
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,044
than I am on
the rest of these people.

384
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,650
Can you not work on this?

385
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,485
Work on this month's.
Okay, Nana?

386
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,931
When I say, "Chillax," people chillax.
Watch this.

387
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,405
Hey, Roger, chillax.

388
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,770
He must not have heard me.

389
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,123
No. I heard you.

390
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,880
Step this way for
the Spanish Inquisition.

391
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,887
Kids in the Hall.

392
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,087
Uh, just...
It's not high pressure.

393
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,242
It's just
a little coffee talk.

394
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,450
Okay? Like butter.

395
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,363
Come on in here.
Mike Myers.

396
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,771
Oh, my God.

397
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,321
Thank you.

398
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,328
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Really appreciate it.

399
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,801
You guys were supposed
to have my back, okay?

400
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,129
Instead, you let a guy named
Plop steal my girlfriend.

401
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,049
Hey, boss,
I did everything I could.

402
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,210
I invited Pete out for drinks. I
e-mailed him shots of myjunk.

403
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,327
Ugh!

404
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,209
Kid doesn't have a
romantic bone in his body.

405
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,770
Come on, Andy.
They're a good match.

406
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,365
That doesn't matter, okay?

407
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,284
What matters is
that I am hurt.

408
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,800
Deep hurt inside of me.

409
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,961
I don't care if they're Romeo
and freaking Juliet.

410
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,329
I feel like the guy that
Juliet dated before Romeo.

411
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,370
Probably her boss.

412
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,810
And guess what? Juliet's
boss also had feelings.

413
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,207
Hey, Andy.

414
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,367
What?

415
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,486
You got a booger
bubble going on there.

416
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,681
Sorry.

417
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,401
It's okay.

418
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,968
My whole life is
a booger bubble.

419
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,488
This is a tiny resume.

420
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,560
Papa Smurf.

421
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,770
Come back to the mushroom.

422
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,241
It's from The Smurfs movie.

423
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,361
Yeah.

424
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,091
I've seen that with my kids.
It is tiny.

425
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,403
But I've actually
been commissioned

426
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,488
by the city of
Scranton to paint a mural...

427
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
What does this
say here?

428
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,841
What language is this?

429
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,769
Swahili? Oh, wait a second.

430
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,280
Now I can read it.

431
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,686
Oh. 'Cause it was upside-down.

432
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,531
You're a good audience.

433
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,881
So, uh...

434
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,007
Unlike some of these
people around here.

435
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,845
Yeah. The city
commissioned me to do...

436
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,810
Yeah, we don't have a lot of
call for doodling around here.

437
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,044
But I like this resume,
and here's why.

438
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,688
It shows that
you stick around.

439
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,810
Yeah, you don'tjump ship easily
like a lot of these people.

440
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,606
I mean, they worship me, you
know, but do they like me?

441
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,400
I mean, do you
think they like me, Pam?

442
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,405
Yes.

443
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,241
What if Bob
Dylan was your boss?

444
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,489
I'm gonna do Dylan.

445
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,803
Pam Halpert is my name

446
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,531
I've been at
Dunder Mifflin for...

447
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,211
Seven years? Eight years.

448
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,209
Eight years, man

449
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,728
Got the Dunder Mifflin blues

450
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,643
Got the Pam Halpert blues

451
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,961
Got Pratt...
Went to Pratt Institute

452
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,166
You have children?

453
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,481
Two children, yes.

454
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,369
And you do art
and painting?

455
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,001
Kind of the same thing.

456
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,650
Kind of the same thing

457
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,927
Sometimes I repeat myself

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,446
But that's just being Pam

459
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,363
Well, I'm kind of cute

460
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,728
And I'm...
But I'm married, so...

461
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,525
Leave that be

462
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,891
Hey. You got
a sec to talk?

463
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,531
Kind of painful to
chat with you, Pete,

464
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,291
ever since the ol' one-two
punch to my scrotum pole,

465
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,569
translation, penis,
translation, my manhood.

466
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,770
Yeah, look...

467
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,125
I understand
breakups are tough.

468
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,644
You know, it happens to all
of us at some point in life.

469
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,604
But you gotta move on.

470
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,210
Great advice.

471
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,489
Thank you.
You can leave now.

472
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,801
Listen to him, Andy.

473
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,247
He's trying to tell you something
that you really need to hear.

474
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,766
Awesome perspective.
Thanks for butting in.

475
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,202
Well, I've been
where you are now.

476
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,049
I dated this girl Alice,
and it was an ugly breakup.

477
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,010
She worked at a marketing
agency right next to my house.

478
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,925
I'd run into her every day, but I
had to grow up and deal with it,

479
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,331
and I did.

480
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,281
We're even
Facebook friends now.

481
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,526
See?

482
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,841
We can all be friends.

483
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,086
Yeah.

484
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,969
Just get over it.
It doesn't have to be awkward.

485
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,288
I do think we
can have a fair...

486
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,727
Yeah,
so life gives you lemons,

487
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,286
you just gotta eat 'em,
rinds and all.

488
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,409
And, if you don't want to
eat 'em, your ex-girlfriend

489
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,811
will shove them
down your throat

490
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,331
with the help of her
hunky new boyfriend.

491
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,650
So that's fun.

492
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,608
Nothing to see here.

493
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,365
Boss at work.

494
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,527
This will be your desk,
right up front.

495
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,284
Best seat on
the roller coaster.

496
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,170
You must be this
tall to ride this ride.

497
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,241
No pregnant women allowed.

498
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,370
Are you? I'm not
allowed to ask, so...

499
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,125
I am not...
You're not pregnant.

500
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,726
I didn't ask her
if she was pregnant.

501
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,046
She just offered it.

502
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,442
The last three girls
here all got pregnant.

503
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,646
Wow.

504
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,921
Don't be afraid.

505
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,411
It's a different chair.

506
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,730
I don't want a guy up here.

507
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,170
I want to, you know, see a woman
come in and do a great job.

508
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,608
Something I have to
look out this window...

509
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,170
I'm sorry,
I thought this job was

510
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,725
for the position
of office manager.

511
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,725
It is. Yeah.

512
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,683
You'd manage this office.

513
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,485
You'd answer the phones
and forward the calls,

514
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,086
and, you know, go for a
coffee run now and again.

515
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,169
So kind of like
a receptionist.

516
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,685
Yeah. Like a receptionist,

517
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,608
but we call you the office manager,
because it's less demeaning.

518
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,447
By the way, how long are these cameras
gonna be following you around?

519
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,446
Because I think
this is pretty cool.

520
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,004
Pretty, pretty cool.

521
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,884
Larry David,
Curb Your Enthusiasm.

522
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,610
Do you like that show?
Yes.

523
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,002
Well, I think they indulge
themselves a little too much.

524
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,401
I like scripted.

525
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,289
I spent 10 years as a
receptionist to Michael Scott.

526
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,570
And I have kids now.

527
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,282
And I just... I can't.

528
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,561
Ow!

529
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,244
The braid is
too tight.

530
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,601
Oh, hush.

531
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,441
Loose braids reflect
a loose character.

532
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,325
Now stay still.

533
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,121
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,489
I think your hair is much too
long for your age, by the way.

535
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,170
Okay.
There.

536
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,241
Thank you, Angela.

537
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,442
I'm going to
the prison this afternoon

538
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,608
to go and talk
to the Strangler.

539
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,325
Probably best to use his real
name rather than Strangler.

540
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,887
Don't use
his real name.

541
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,490
George Howard
Skub?

542
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,686
That's a devil name.

543
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,163
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm doing it. I'm going.

544
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,411
He's doing it.

545
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,810
Hey.
Hey, how'd the interview go?

546
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,484
Oh, my gosh.
Wait until I tell you.

547
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,291
This guy was unbelievable.

548
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,647
Okay, so...

549
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,721
I can't wait to
hear about it later.

550
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,245
Do you want to
come in at 8:00?

551
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,289
And don't eat,
because I'm ordering in.

552
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,566
8:00? Really?

553
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,928
I'll make it worth
your while, I promise.

554
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,762
Sure. I mean, it's Philly.
I can kill four hours.

555
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,604
So,
yeah, I'll see you at 8:00.

556
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,563
All right. Love you.
Love you.

557
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,447
Hi.
Hi.

558
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,842
I'm here from B.C.l. Marketing
Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.

559
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,649
Oh, yes, the consultant.

560
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,200
Andy said you can
start right away.

561
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,930
So I will take
you to your desk.

562
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,684
Okay, great. Thanks.

563
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,163
Fresh meat.
Fresh meat!

564
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,044
Just keep walking. Don't give her anything.
She'll take it and run.

565
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,690
I'm Erin, by the way.
Nice to meet you.

566
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,285
Cute sweater.
Oh, thanks.

567
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,568
Your shoes match.
I'm bad at small talk.

568
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,681
I'm Kevin.

569
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,401
Pete?

570
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,441
Alice.

571
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,601
Oh, man.

572
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,841
It's, uh, been awhile, huh?

573
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,605
Oh, do you two
know each other?

574
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,250
Yeah. We, uh, have a history.

575
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,401
Oh.

576
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,245
History. Wow. Okay.

577
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,205
We dated for two years.

578
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,161
That's so random.

579
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,970
Well, is it?

580
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,645
Andy also hired a management
consultant today.

581
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,447
Oh, no.

582
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,327
Hey, Erin, look who's back.
The Birdman.

583
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,167
Hello, beautiful.

584
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,250
Didn't you two
used to do it?

585
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,011
We absolutely did. Thank
you for remembering that.

586
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,851
She's looking good.

587
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,731
Hi. I'm Toby Flenderson. I'm
here to see George Howard Skub.

588
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,526
This is the prison.

589
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,571
I am not going in there
with expectations, per se.

590
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,446
I will meet
George Howard Skub.

591
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,490
I will tell him that I
believe he is innocent.

592
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,169
I would understand if he
felt motivated to hug me.

593
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,048
I would understand
if a friendship began.

594
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,323
How did Bogart put it?

595
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,848
I think this is
the start of my first friendship.

596
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,684
So Pete was a librarian?

597
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,047
He worked as
a librarian freshman year.

598
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,681
Was he,
like, the sexy librarian?

599
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,001
Okay-

600
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,481
ls there somebody who's
in charge of marketing?

601
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,164
Maybe I should
sit near him or her.

602
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,045
- Hi.
- Hi.

603
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,406
Hi, how's it going?

604
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,244
Hi. Good.

605
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,444
Pdloveto discuss strategy with
you if you have a marketing...

606
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,851
Wow, this sure is intense.

607
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,125
Having to share a workspace with
someone you used to get it on with.

608
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,481
Andy, that is really
inappropriate.

609
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,688
Awkward!
It is awkward.

610
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,170
This is a really uncomfortable
situation that you've contrived.

611
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,291
Really
uncomfortable situation.

612
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,283
Yeah. This...

613
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,923
That's all right, Pete.
You can handle it.

614
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,043
I mean, we all just
gotta move on.

615
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,963
Ain't that right,
Professor Lecture-much?

616
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,643
Uh, question.
How's that medicine taste?

617
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,765
Your own-flavored?

618
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,451
Is it just me,
or have these tables turned?

619
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,041
Hmm.

620
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,641
Hmm.

621
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,845
So there's no
marketing department?

622
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,770
No.
No.

623
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,805
You know, times were tough.

624
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,366
I was unemployed. I was
still heartbroken over you.

625
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,450
I've lost a good 50 pounds.

626
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,206
But as you can see I put
all that weight right back on.

627
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,250
Feel how fat my buttocks are.

628
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,764
Yeah. It's crazy.

629
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,564
Touch it.
It's like a warm pumpkin.

630
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,966
So Andyjust called
you up out of the blue?

631
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,241
Yeah.

632
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,965
He told me you two broke up.

633
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,041
Yeah.

634
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,760
You must be pretty horny.

635
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,002
Well, the good news
is, no more guilty conscience.

636
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,408
At least you know
he is the Strangler.

637
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,285
The proof is in the grip.

638
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,127
Did they say when
the vocal cords would heal?

639
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,720
One week?

640
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,089
Okay. Two weeks?

641
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,571
Okay-

642
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,564
You offered your neck
in search of the truth.

643
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,720
"The proud neck of justice,"
isn't that the expression?

644
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,088
Well, anyway, itwas...
it was very brave.

645
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,968
It really was quite brave.

646
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,930
I feel like a show pony.

647
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,969
And you look like one, too.
Thank you, Angela.

648
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,448
You're welcome.
Would you like some stew?

649
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,444
By all means. And I will
carve the roast skunk.

650
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,489
Angela.

651
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,085
Would you like
the stink sack?

652
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,124
Is it any good?
No.

653
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,043
You don't eat it.
It's a toy, like a wishbone.

654
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,122
You know, prettiest
girl gets the stink sack.

655
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,685
Thank you.

656
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,327
So when's the wedding?

657
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,330
Um, actually,
we are just friends.

658
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,081
That's what Mose said
about his lady scarecrow,

659
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,208
and look what he did
to that poor thing.

660
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,521
Hello?

661
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,046
Hey. Back here.

662
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,001
Wow. Seriously?

663
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,882
Oh, my gosh.
Is that champagne?

664
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,081
Si, sefior.

665
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,041
Oh.

666
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,926
Jim, I should have told you
I didn't get the job.

667
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,045
Oh, man. I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

668
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,964
Oh. Yeah. I'm more than all right.
There's just nothing to celebrate.

669
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,204
Are you kidding? You're in Philly.
We're having dinner together.

670
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,488
And this is just
consolation champagne.

671
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,411
It's from the part of France that
immediately gave up to the Nazis.

672
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,647
Here.

673
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,245
You're very
quick on your feet.

674
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,121
I remember you. Funny.

675
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,004
All right. So...

676
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,801
Tell me all about it.

677
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,361
Okay. Well, gosh, thank you
for your help today.

678
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,041
Your perspective was
very useful. Thank you.

679
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,921
It was not an unpleasant way
to spend an afternoon.

680
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,050
Dwight, Dwight.
Right.

681
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,845
Not outside. The horseflies.

682
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,761
You know what, my farm is only
a few acres east of here.

683
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,491
Or we could use
the slaughterhouse.

684
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,249
No, Dwight, the Senator.

685
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,401
Leave him. He probably won't
even notice that you're gone.

686
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,000
Be with me, monkey.

687
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,287
I can't be your monkey,
Dwight.

688
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,881
I'm not talking about some
frisky romp in the warehouse.

689
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,686
We have wasted too much
of our lives ignoring the fact

690
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,649
that we belong together.

691
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,966
The 80 or 90 years that
I have left of this life

692
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,244
I want to spend with you.

693
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,889
I made a vow.
I gave my word.

694
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,488
Stand by your man.

695
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,202
It's what I would
want if you were mine.

696
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,961
Good night, D.

697
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,162
How are you doing?
Is it really rough?

698
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,164
It is so unpleasant.

699
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,290
You?
Hey, love turds.

700
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,371
Conference room now.

701
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,562
Thank you all for coming in.
Just wanted to check in.

702
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,005
How was everyone's day?

703
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,081
Honestly,
it was a little weird.

704
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,886
Really?

705
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,965
Hmm. That's interesting,
because Erin and Pete

706
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,811
thought it
wouldn't be weird at all.

707
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,089
Why do you think
it was weird, Gabe?

708
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,527
Maybe because you and Erin
used to be an item?

709
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,649
I still wear Erin's button-downs
around the condo sometimes,

710
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,371
so it feels to me like we're
still in a relationship...

711
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,851
Gabe.
...a lot of the time.

712
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,569
And, Alice, I understand
you once dumped Pete. Ouch.

713
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,803
It was
an amicable breakup, Andy.

714
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,003
Okay, while we're
rewriting history,

715
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,009
you never had
a drinking problem.

716
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,567
It was college.
That is what you do.

717
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,361
Dude, you're also supposed to
go to classes, so there's that.

718
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,761
Hey, Andy,
is this at all work-related?

719
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,005
We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin
ever tell you that she loves you?

720
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,205
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

721
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,686
She wouldn't
even let me say it.

722
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,331
It was adorable. She'd plug her
ears and scream her heart out.

723
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,640
Gabe, can you stop talking?

724
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,449
Because every word
out of your mouth

725
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,289
is like the squawk
of an ugly pelican.

726
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,490
I got a tattoo for you.

727
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,928
I didn't ask you to
get that Nike swoosh.

728
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,610
Nobody did.
You did that for you.

729
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,091
Just do it.

730
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,088
You were the "it"
that I was just doing.

731
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,124
So you're dating
a secretary now?

732
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,925
Moving up in the world, Pete.

733
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,566
She's nice to me.

734
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,809
How's that P.E. degree coming?

735
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,001
That's what he wanted to be.

736
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,684
His dream in college
was to be a gym teacher.

737
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,001
Well, guess what, he could
still be a gym teacher.

738
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,525
In fact, we could all
still be gym teachers.

739
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,409
So let's...
I technically cannot.

740
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,761
I don't have the lung capacity
to blow a whistle.

741
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,171
Oh, my God.

742
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,204
What kind of music
are you into, Peter?

743
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,401
Uh...

744
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,324
I like all kinds
of music, Gabe.

745
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,084
Really? All kinds?

746
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,925
So you like
songs of hate written

747
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,610
by the white knights
of the Ku Klux Klan?

748
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,165
No! Erin, are you
even hearing this?

749
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,401
Gabe, he didn't even say that.

750
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,561
He's not a very
sophisticated man.

751
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,450
I mean,
he can't use chopsticks,

752
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,170
so do I need to
say anything else?

753
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,205
Erin, I've been
to Japan.

754
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,601
I know how to use
chopsticks so well.

755
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,441
Come back.

756
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,081
One night. Give me
one night with you.

757
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,361
What is that
supposed to be?

758
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,363
I have shaved everything.
I don't want you to shave...

759
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,011
I wasted two years of my life on you.
You realize that, right?

760
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,209
I just want to be real clear that
chopsticks is not the measure of a man.

761
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,601
I am as smooth as
a porpoise for you.

762
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,806
Why didn't you say
at the beginning,

763
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,086
"This isn't really
going that well"?

764
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,004
Shovel his sashimi
into his mouth as a sport.

765
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,568
All right, all right, yes,
that is a legitimate question.

766
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,804
Does making Erin and Pete
feel bad make me feel better?

767
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,122
Yeah. Yeah.

768
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,766
It does.

769
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,722
So imagine,
like, the real estate version

770
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,042
of Michael Scott,
and that was this guy.

771
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,607
He did half
the interview as Ace Ventura.

772
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,165
Tell me about the cologne.
How much?

773
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,563
Oh, entire bottle at least.

774
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,091
You're definitely
hoarding this, by the way.

775
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,050
Guess what poster
he had on his wall?

776
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,725
Austin Powers.
Mmm-mmm.

777
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,040
Ferris Bueller.
Mmm-mmm.

778
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,806
You're getting colder.

779
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,604
Not Night at the Roxbury.
No.

780
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,762
The Odd Life of Timothy Green.

781
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,606
I'm sorry. How did you think
I was expected to guess that?

782
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,806
I don't know.
But it's interesting, right?

783
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,046
It's fascinating.

784
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,288
He said he can't
help but tear up

785
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,930
when he looks at it, and
it's right next to his desk.

786
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,042
He must look at it,
like, 20 times a day.

787
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,686
That's amazing.

788
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,962
Well, listen,
you can't win 'em all, right?

789
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,162
So the next
interview has to be better.

790
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,481
I don't know.

791
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,681
What do you mean?

792
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,283
Of course it will.
You're amazing.

793
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,082
I know. It's just, even if it was
a great boss and a great job,

794
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,208
I just... I don't...
I don't know if I...

795
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,602
If I want to...
I don't know if I want this.

796
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,881
Huh.

797
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,450
This is a little
out of left field.

798
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,081
Is it?

799
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,927
I just...
I liked our life in Scranton.

800
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,847
And I have started a business in
Philadelphia.

801
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,201
Little did my
grandfather know,

802
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,368
mahjong would be here to stay.

803
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,924
Hobbies of the east
continues in a moment.

804
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,004
You could all be doing this.

805
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,360
Just saying.

806
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,683
I watch way too many ads online,
and I don't do enough sit-ups.

807
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,601
So I bought these.

808
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,962
Now every time
an ad pops up online,

809
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,282
I get 30 seconds
of ab-blasting.

810
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,644
I call it ads for abs.

811
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,969
Ironically, I learned about
the boots from an ad online.

812
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,482
Why can't you just
do regular sit-ups?

813
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,920
I'll tell you why.

814
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,645
Because

815
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,921
the floor

816
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,641
is

817
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,126
disgusting.

818
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,331
Yeah. My trainer said,

819
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,121
"Everybody fails working out."

820
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,526
That's how you win.

821
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,802
Okay. All right.

822
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,645
Okay.
Kevin, a little help, buddy.

823
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,001
Oh.

824
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,489
Why don't your famous
stomachs help you now?

825
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,881
Can someone please help me?

826
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,289
Ow. These teas are hot.
Can someone help me, please?

827
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,841
Thanks.

828
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,690
- Okay.
- Just...

829
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,441
Just“

830
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,361
People,
I'm not going anywhere.

831
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,648
Soon my core will
get strong again,

832
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,922
and, when that happens,
I'll be able...

833
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,281
Head rush!

834
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,561
Ah!

835
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,680
Can someone please help me?

836
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,041
I... Hey.

837
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,085
I'm not going anywhere.

838
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,251
I'll be right here.

839
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,406
Oh, that's not good.

840
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,525
Hey, guys, I've got 20 bucks
for anyone who will help me.

841
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,011
Kevin, would you like a pizza?
