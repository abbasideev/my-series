1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,731
I'm having second thoughts about
one of the shirts I packed,

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,091
the blue one
with the stripes.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,889
I'm sure it's fine.
It's a blue shirt.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,248
Yeah, but I'm wondering
if it's too blue.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,809
Like, am I making a statement
with the blueness?

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,365
I am leaving early
today for Philly,

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,164
because tomorrow is the
first day of my new job.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,722
So, I figure I get in at 5:00,
check in to a hotel about 6:00,

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,600
so I can get a real good night of
restless sleep and nervous puking.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,964
Excuse me!
Trying to get work done.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,806
Some people don't care about Jim's
new sports job in Phila-whatever.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,406
So you know my job has
something to do with sports,

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,051
but you don't know the end
of the word "Philadelphia"?

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,408
Philadelphia. From the Greek
philia meaning "love,"

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,768
and "adelph" meaning Adolf.
"The City that Loves Adolf."

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,490
Good luck with
your new enterprise.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,571
And don't wear
the blue-striped shirt.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,642
It makes your neck look
like an old mop handle.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,723
Oh! Hey, guys,
the Christmas party is today.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,365
Merry Christmas, everyone!

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,971
No.
Is it?

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,283
I mean, it says "X-mas party," but I
think we all know what that's code for.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,647
So we're not going to have a
Christmas party this year?

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,163
Angela, how could
you do this to us?

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,004
Right. Like, I'm responsible

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,048
because I'm in charge of
the Party Planning Committee.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,451
Well, you are
the one in charge of the...

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,602
Don't blame me for
something we all forgot!

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,365
Yeah, let's not blame her
for something we all forgot!

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,967
I didn't realize how many of
Angela's opinions I agreed with

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,681
until she tried to have my kneecap
shattered for sleeping with her husband.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,842
She makes a lot of
very sound points.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,921
I knew the party was today, but
nobody asked me to plan it,

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,246
so I didn't. Hmm.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,126
Funny how that works.

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,249
We're out there, sweating
our balls off every day,

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,606
busting our balls.

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,125
We deserve a Christmas party.

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,125
Well, then why don't we just get
some liquor and those mini-cupcakes?

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,725
Mini-cupcakes?

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,326
As in the mini-version
of regular cupcakes,

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,966
which is already
a mini-version of cake?

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,566
Honestly, where does
it end with you people?

44
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,041
What about an authentic
Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas?

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,684
Drink some gluhwein,
enjoy some hasenpfeffer.

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,721
Enjoy Christmas
with Saint Nicholas'

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,207
rural German companion,
Belsnickel.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,329
Yes! That! That! That!

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,243
Definitely doing that.
Are we all in agreement?

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,607
No!
ALLI No.

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,806
Done, right?
No.

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,564
I want Tropical Christmas.

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,846
Topless Christmas!

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,086
Tapas Swiss Miss!

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,570
Spanish tapas and Swiss Miss hot cocoa.
What's so hard to understand?

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,124
Or, who was it that suggested an
authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas?

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,770
I think it was
someone really popular.

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,650
We already said no.
No!

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,721
- No, no.
- Too weird.

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,644
This is me and my family celebrating
Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,085
in 1982 on the farm.

62
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,050
There's me and my brother Jeb
breaking the ceremonial pig rib.

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,729
He doesn't come back
for Christmas anymore.

64
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,324
The sepia tint is
from an app on my phone.

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,482
This is the same
photo Matrix-style.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,090
I'm not understanding
the confusion.

67
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,367
Am I the only one
who wants to try hufflepuffs

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,250
and schnauzer-hosen and
meet this Glen Pickle guy?

69
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,326
Party Planning
Committee, emergency meeting. Now.

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,283
- I'm on it.
- Great.

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm just hoping
German terrorists

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,126
don't take over
this Christmas party,

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,328
make me go all
John McClane on their asses.

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,846
Wait, German terrorists?
That's oddly specific.

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,521
And I think...
I think you mean John McCain.

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,248
Die Hard reference.
I haven't seen it.

77
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,483
You haven't seen Die Hard? No.

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,164
Why haven't you
seen Die Hard?

79
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,970
I don't know!
I just haven't!

80
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,646
Come on. You had to have
at least seen some of it.

81
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,721
Nope.

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,408
"Now I have a machine gun.
Ho, ho, hoT

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,848
"Come out to the coast, we'll get
together, have a few laughs."

84
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,127
None of this makes
any sense to me.

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,682
Oh! Yeah, and when he takes the
gun off his back and he's like,

86
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,250
"Yippee-ki-yay, mother..."

87
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,402
Actually,
he doesn't say that there.

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,450
He says it earlier, when
he's on the radio with Hans.

89
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,367
Yes. You are right.
Forgive me.

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,609
That's okay, bud.
Nope.

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,091
Common mistake.
No, it's not.

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,165
Nerd!

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,969
Do you know every
line of the movie?

94
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,084
My brother dared
me to memorize it,

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,686
and I did it,
and I loved doing it.

96
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,360
Okay, let's hear it.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,084
Hear what?
Die Hard.

98
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,202
Every line. Go.

99
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,851
"You don't like flying,
do you?"

100
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,684
Don't change the subject.

101
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,046
No, that's...

102
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,440
The movie is starting.

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,525
We're thinking of
collaborating with

104
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,051
Mike Schmidt on some
of his charity work.

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,407
I love Philly.
Dirty town.

106
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,684
Whoa!

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,645
Philly!
Exciting stuff, man.

108
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,966
Whoo!

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,122
So, are you sure you remembered
everything for your trip?

110
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,361
Yeah, I think so.

111
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,966
Think that through
for a sec.

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,769
Yeah, Jim's going
to Philly tomorrow.

113
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,571
He said he was going to take me with
him, but that was two months ago

114
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,484
and I haven't
heard anything since.

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,688
I mean,
he said that, right?

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,041
What else could you
possibly be forgetting?

117
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,089
Things, people?

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,444
Do you know who's not
going to get to work

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,164
on some exciting
new startup this year?

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,041
George Howard Skub, aka the
alleged Scranton Strangler.

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,170
Because he's in prison for
something he may not have done.

122
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,561
I'm sorry,
the Scranton who?

123
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,440
The Scranton Strangler.
George Howard Skub.

124
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,807
Have I not told you about the jury
I was on a couple of years ago?

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,166
Oh! What happened?

126
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,605
I mean, if you can
talk about it, obviously.

127
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,125
Because if you can't,
I understand.

128
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,090
I could.
I could talk about it.

129
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,001
See you next Christmas.

130
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,764
I could, sure.
Have a seat.

131
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,080
I would start
at the beginning,

132
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,883
but I think I need
to go farther back.

133
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,482
We're the Party
Planning Committee.

134
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,484
And we did not get where
we are by playing it safe.

135
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,961
We got here by
being risk-takers!

136
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,131
And yeah, Dwight's party is
going to be terrible, maybe.

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,928
Maybe it's not.

138
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,081
Maybe it's going
to be great.

139
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,605
And if it's great,

140
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,769
I think we all know
what that would mean to us.

141
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,481
Let's do it.
Yes! Phyllis!

142
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,882
No. I don't want my name
attached to this party.

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,928
What does that even mean?
Where would your name appear?

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,889
Please just take
my name off of everything.

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,644
Just take her name
off of everything!

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,640
The Party Planning
Committee, minus Angela,

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,371
has decided that
we're all going to do

148
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
Dwight's Christmas.

149
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,369
Yes! Yeah!
Yeah! Okay! Yes!

150
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,842
It's a Christmas miracle!
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

151
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,087
Dwight?
Yes.

152
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,845
There is one rule that you
need to take very seriously.

153
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,921
And that is...

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,331
That there are no rules.

155
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,603
You have
never been cooler.

156
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,008
Best Christmas ever.

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,609
You're welcome.
Thank you.

158
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,887
And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas
has officially begun!

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,529
Ugh! What is
this stuff? Lava?

160
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,524
That is gluhwein,
also known as "glow wine,"

161
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,568
also used to sterilize
medical instruments.

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,247
And, interesting factoid,

163
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,244
this is the very spoon
that guided my soft skull

164
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,368
through the birth
canal when I was born.

165
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,925
Enjoy!
What is it?

166
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,686
Don't touch it!

167
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,365
Somebody's found
the hog maw! What?

168
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,762
It's a Pennsylvania Dutch
specialty, hog maw.

169
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,966
That's a beauty,
isn't it?

170
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,805
I don't even want to tell you what
it's made of until after you try it.

171
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,848
Ugh! I'm not eating
mystery meat.

172
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,888
It is stuffed pig stomach.

173
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,327
And after we finish it,
we get to break the pig rib.

174
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,811
- Can't wait.
- Weird.

175
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,486
Where're the sugar cookies?
Where's the karaoke machine?

176
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,767
This is austere,
Meredith.

177
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,765
This is celebrating Christmas
for all of the right reasons.

178
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,242
The cookies and toys and
sweets are mere distractions.

179
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,482
I mean, most people
don't even know

180
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,484
that a candy cane represents
a shepherd's crook,

181
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,369
which I assure you, does
not taste like peppermint.

182
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,124
It tastes like sheep feces.

183
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,361
How would
anyone even know...

184
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,771
Have you ever tasted
a shepherd's crook?

185
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,129
I don't know.
Is it what you expected?

186
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,290
I feel like Dwight is holding
a candle and reading a poem.

187
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,404
So happy right now.

188
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,444
Wait, what is that I hear?
Someone on the roof?

189
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,885
How strange.

190
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,367
Excuse me, I have to run
to my car to take a dump.

191
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,848
Wish my car had a bathroom.

192
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,049
"Let Heinrich
plant the detonators

193
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,049
"and Theo prepare the vault. After that.

194
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,729
That wasn't the line.
I'm sorry, Pete.

195
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,247
That is transcribed by some fan.
They make mistakes.

196
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,971
I don't know.
This looks pretty legit.

197
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,009
Oh, my gosh.

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,684
I just got
an e-mail from Andy!

199
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,285
That means they hit land.

200
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,802
"Wuddup, shorty! We got in
last night, sold the boat.

201
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,565
"Went out, got drunk,

202
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,362
"saw Life of Pi, got super
depressed and introspective.

203
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,250
"Gonna hang out
here awhile,

204
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,769
"maybe a couple of weeks, figure
this whole life thing out,

205
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,571
“maybe see Hobbit. Lakes.“

206
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,489
Hey, everything okay?

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,407
So what comes next?

208
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,603
Right, okay.

209
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,489
So he says,

210
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,080
"After we call the police, they'll
waste hours trying to negotiate..."

211
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,924
We should just
watch the movie.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,081
That makes much more sense.

213
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,924
Or we can just sit
and talk, though.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,765
No. No more talking.
It's movie time.

215
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,444
I mean,
are you sure? Um...

216
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,921
Yeah. I probably have
a copy or two in my car.

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,129
Great, great. So we're
watching Die Hard now.

218
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,884
Good! This is a good plan.

219
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,291
Okay-

220
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,562
Here's the thing about moonlight.
It's not sunlight.

221
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,169
I love this hog mama.

222
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,049
Dwight said it's hog "maw."

223
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,725
What is maw?

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,802
It's the lining of
the stomach of the...

225
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,881
Oh!

226
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,965
Judgment is nigh!
For der Belsnickel ist I!

227
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,883
Yes! He is finally nigh.

228
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,964
I am nigh!

229
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,726
Every year, my grandfather would
dress up as Belsnickel at Christmas.

230
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,043
He was okay at it.

231
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,407
I am great.

232
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,323
You know how they say some
people are born to be bad?

233
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,370
Well, I was born
to be Belsnickel.

234
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,842
Belsnickel has traveled
from distant lands

235
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,082
to discover how all
the boys and the girls

236
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,328
have been behaving
this last year.

237
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,323
Oh!

238
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,447
Too much strudel!

239
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,000
So he's kind of like Santa?
Except dirty and worse.

240
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,766
No! Much better! No one fears Santa
the way they fear Belsnickel!

241
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,167
Wow!

242
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,844
It's my favorite part of Christmas.
The authority.

243
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,921
And the fear.

244
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,041
Yes, exactly!

245
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,088
Come on, Dwight.
You're making this up.

246
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,969
- No.
- This is a real thing.

247
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,771
"Belsnickel is a crotchety
fur-clad gift-giver,

248
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,161
"related to other companions
of Saint Nicholas

249
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,163
"in the folklore of
southwestern Germany."

250
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,685
Okay, great.
Seriously, you guys?

251
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,444
Now you believe in
Dwight's traditions

252
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,648
when some Democrat
looks it up on Wikipedia?

253
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,324
"His partner Zwarte Piet,
or Black Peter,

254
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,281
"a slave boy often portrayed in
colorful pantaloons and black face."

255
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,125
Uh-uh. No, Dwight, no.

256
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,531
Oh! Come on.

257
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,321
We don't blindly stick to every
outmoded aspect of our traditions.

258
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,131
Come on! Get with
the spirit of it, you guys!

259
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,523
Karl was actually a ballet
dancer in real life.

260
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,650
Isn't that crazy?
Mmm.

261
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,243
Jim, that guy.

262
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,209
You got to stick
to your word,

263
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,171
like when you say something
to a buddy, a real buddy.

264
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,481
What are you going to do?
Lie to your buddy?

265
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,607
That's awful.

266
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,609
Take the bowl,
pass it down.

267
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,245
Thank you, Dwight,
these are nice.

268
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,731
No, these are gift bowls.

269
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,882
When you receive a gift,
it will go in the bowl,

270
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,928
but the bowls must be returned at the end.
They're a set.

271
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,726
Now, hold your
bowls forward,

272
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,442
the Belsnickel will decide if
you are impish or admirable.

273
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,284
It's like naughty
or nice?

274
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,362
No, impish or admirable.

275
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,761
Quick question, do you just decide
who gets what in the moment,

276
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,921
or did you make a list?

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,365
I decided earlier.

278
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,090
Oh! Nice.
Did you check that list?

279
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,127
Of course I checked it.

280
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,770
But more than once? Because
you could've made a mistake.

281
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,887
Icheckedit
more than once.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,650
Okay, so you made a list,
you checked it twice,

283
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,006
and now you're going
to find out who's...

284
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,360
impish or admirable.

285
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,521
Damn.

286
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,841
Phyllis Vance!
Cheer or fear,

287
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,925
Belsnickel is here,
I judge your year as

288
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,201
admirable.

289
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,006
There you are.

290
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,645
Hmm. What are these?

291
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,961
It's a set of rubber
gaskets for canning jars.

292
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,166
I'd rather have the bowl.

293
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,730
You can't have the bowl!

294
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,720
Oscar Martinez,
cheer or fear,

295
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,724
Belsnickel is here,
I judge your year

296
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,809
- as impish.
- Ow!

297
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,245
You hit people
with that thing?

298
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,449
No, I'm carrying around a
stick in order to look cool.

299
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,090
For the kinder.
Ooh!

300
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,810
A mousetrap.

301
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,922
In a head-to-head
contest, people prefer

302
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,048
Belsnickel over Santa,
every time.

303
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,406
There aren't as
many songs about him,

304
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,562
but I attribute that
more to rhyming difficulties.

305
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,049
My brother and I
wrote one once.

306
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,645
It was about
a fickle pickle salesman

307
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,250
who would tickle
you for a nickel.

308
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,646
Oh! You know what?
I got to go.

309
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,921
Stop giggling.

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,331
Oh! Really? Already?
Yeah. Sorry.

311
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,249
It's a punishment.
Hey, where are you going?

312
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,330
I have to go to Philly.
But this was amazing. Okay?

313
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,811
But you work tomorrow.

314
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,848
Yeah, I know, I'd like to settle
in, get a good night's sleep.

315
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,365
But we were going
to break the pig rib.

316
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,006
Oh! That's right.
Remember?

317
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,008
No matter! Belsnickel
cares not about this.

318
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,809
Off with you.
Perfect.

319
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,006
Merry Christmas, everybody.

320
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,246
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

321
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,209
Don't you want to
know your present?

322
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,123
You know what?
Yeah. Have at it.

323
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,842
Jim Halpert, cheer or fear,
Belsnickel is here.

324
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,127
I judge your year as impish.

325
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,770
Oh! Are you nuts? Ow, ow!
I judge you impish!

326
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,646
Okay, that is three, and you
didn't hit anybody that hard.

327
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,846
They're not
abandoning the party.

328
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,121
Hey!

329
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,565
That's enough!
I'm done, okay?

330
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,491
Impish!

331
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,566
Belsnickel, I've got
to run out early, too.

332
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,211
Oh! What was that?

333
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,529
Now I'm going to be all whipped
for my first day of work.

334
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,966
God.

335
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,011
One second.

336
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,041
Well, this is it.

337
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,890
I'm probably never
going to see you again.

338
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,481
Shut up,
I'm trying to be serious.

339
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,841
Okay, sorry, sorry.

340
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,804
I can't believe this
is actually happening.

341
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,441
Listen, thank you so much for
putting that all together.

342
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,966
That was the perfect
last Christmas party.

343
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,845
All right,
wish me luck.

344
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,610
Good luck.
You're going to be great.

345
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,681
I'll call you
when I get in.

346
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,046
Okay.
All right.

347
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,330
Love you!
Love you!

348
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,404
What's going on?
Party's over.

349
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,051
You quit on Christmas,
Christmas quits on you.

350
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,961
And guess what, kids?
Belsnickel isn't real.

351
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,844
It's me. Dwight!

352
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,244
We found some old
decorations in the warehouse.

353
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,891
Oscar ran to the store
for some food and drink.

354
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,042
And I dipped into
my stash of eggnog.

355
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,849
I guess they
needed me after all.

356
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,684
It's like in
It's a Wonderful Life,

357
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,081
when Jimmy Stewart
realizes that all those people

358
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,767
at the Building and Loan are
justjerks and he was the real hero.

359
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,526
Kevin! Stop it!

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,209
Oh! it sounds like the party's
starting up out there.

361
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,320
Yeah. So anyway, the entire
jury wants me to vote guilty.

362
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,528
But that night, I did a
little research on my own,

363
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,127
and forget everything you thought
you knew about fingerprinting.

364
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,726
Meredith is a little cute.

365
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,087
I'm just realizing.

366
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,208
She got, like,
a Emma Stone thing.

367
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,282
Boo!

368
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,726
For what it's worth,
I liked your party better.

369
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,882
Everyone thought
the food was gross

370
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,531
and that Belsnickel was
some darkly erotic freak.

371
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,285
I don't think
anyone thought that.

372
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,569
Jim couldn't even stay
to the end of the party.

373
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,881
Well, that didn't have
anything to do with you.

374
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,166
I don't care.

375
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,208
Guess how much I care
on a scale of one to 10.

376
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,486
Zero.
Damn it!

377
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,246
I'm going to tell
Jim to go himself.

378
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,849
Do you think Andy
would everjump off

379
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,889
an exploding building
tied to a hose for me?

380
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,526
Yeah. Definitely.

381
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,886
What's...

382
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,887
Oh, no. Come here.
Hey, hey. Come on.

383
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,408
I'm still
Andy's girlfriend.

384
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,528
Yeah, of course. I know.

385
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,210
But you can
leave your arm.

386
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,564
Dwight, do you want me
to get you some eggnog?

387
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,325
No, thanks, I'll just
have another Dumatril.

388
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,088
Jim taught me this
really cool way to take it.

389
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,481
You crush it into a powder,
and you snort it up your butt.

390
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,484
Yup, I did say that.

391
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,086
Jim!

392
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,361
What's going on?
Where's the Belsnickel?

393
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,331
Ah! Oh, my God!

394
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,605
What are you doing?

395
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,248
The last time I saw you, you were
whipping me out of the building.

396
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,607
Shh. Let's not
speak of that.

397
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,288
The pig rib! We can
totally break the pig rib!

398
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,010
I'm going to dig
it out of the trash!

399
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,689
What happened?
Did you miss your bus?

400
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,082
No, I just missed my wife.

401
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,321
I found it.

402
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,408
And I found out that
there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.

403
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,285
Oh!

404
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,805
Damn it!

405
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,443
Jim got the bigger half.

406
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,771
Back for more, huh?

407
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,527
Nog it!
I'm going to get some nog.

408
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,680
YOul

409
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,884
Hey, man! You know what?

410
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,566
Before I forget again, I talked
to the guys about hiring you.

411
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,449
They're going to bring
you in for an interview.

412
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,166
That's great!

413
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,720
Right?

414
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,689
Thanks, man.
Yeah, of course.

415
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,610
I shall come by
at your convenience.

416
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,887
Thank you, sir.

417
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,130
Go get 'em! Oh!

418
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,645
Oh!

419
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,531
Very impish.

420
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,529
Two dimes, seven
nickels and one, well, okay.

421
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,610
No, that doesn't add up. It
was one quarter and... Shh!

422
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,601
What? I was just explaining...
What? Shh.

423
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,170
But why would...
Shh.

424
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,410
What are you doing?
Why? Shh.

425
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,529
No more talking.

426
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,842
Are you going
to kiss me?

427
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,851
Yes.
