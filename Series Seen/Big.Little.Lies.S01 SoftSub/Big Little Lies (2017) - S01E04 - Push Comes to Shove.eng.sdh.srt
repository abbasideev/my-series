I do not think Ziggy is a bully.

704
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:20,403
I brought up the incident that
you had mentioned at orientation,

705
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:22,739
and he made it very clear it wasn't him.

706

And I'd be surprised if he's lying.

707

If so, he's the most
accomplished liar I have ever seen.

I definitely would like to see
him for another appointment.

I think he's suffering
from a lot of anxiety,

717
00:42:58,112 --> 00:43:00,323
and I believe that there is…

718
00:43:00,615 --> 00:43:03,118
There's a lot he didn't
share with me today.

00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:07,485

he himself is being bullied at school.

I could be wrong, but
I wouldn't be shocked.

My guess is that it's verbal,

723

has found his weak spot.

you talk much about his father.

00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:39,324
He said it upset you.

732

733
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,330
Yeah, it's very complicated, so…

734
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:50,753
He said that, "Be aware that if
we're talking to my mom about my dad,

735
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:54,383
"that, uh, she's gonna get
