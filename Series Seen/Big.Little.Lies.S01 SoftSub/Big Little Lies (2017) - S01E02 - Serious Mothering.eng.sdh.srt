00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,648
JANE: You know, that's really…
That's super sweet of you, Madeline,

514
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,359
and as much as I appreciate
that, I feel like, you know, if…

515
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:23,029
If this birthday party is
ruined because of him,

516
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,072
then it's only going to
make things worse for him.

517
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,075
Sweetheart, everyone just assumes around
here I'm the root cause of everything.

518
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,201
Don't worry.

519
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,828
JANE: <i>I'd prefer it if you just let
Chloe go to the birthday party…</i>

520
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:34,262
Let me call you right back.

521
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,708
Chloe, get in the car.

522
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,380
-Chloe, get in the car right now.
-What?

523
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:44,507
I need to talk to you.

524
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:48,886
Now.

525
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:53,682
[SIGHS]

526
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:00,312
-I'm not having sex, I promise you.
-What are those pills?

527
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:02,606
They're just for in case,
you know, the day comes.

528
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,317
Not that it's coming any
time soon, but I just have 'em…

529
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:07,278
You are 16 years old.
Where did you get them?

530
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:09,739
-From a doctor.
-Dr. Ennis?

531
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:12,115
She wrote you a prescription
without calling me?

532
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,099
Not her. I went to Planned Parenthood.

533
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:17,996
Please don't make a big deal about this.
I'm not sexually active, okay?

534
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,414
Who took you there?

535
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:21,792
-What?
-Planned Parenthood.

536
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,959
Did you take a car, an Uber?
Did somebody give you a ride?

537
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:26,087
It's in Seaside. How did you get there?

538
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:34,929
Here you are.

539
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:37,097
-Love you, Mama. Bye.
-Love you. Bye.

540
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:38,222
Have a good day.

541
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:39,640
-Stay in the car.
-[BLOWS WHISTLE] Ma'am!

542
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,601
I'm just gonna be a minute.

543
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:42,769
Bonnie?

544
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:44,478
Bonnie, can I talk to
you for just a second?

545
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:46,012
-Of course.
-Couple of things.

546
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:49,233
First of all, I'm happy that Abigail
has bonded with your mother.

547
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:51,985
Thrilled about the communal
potato-peeling thing.

548
00:31:52,236 --> 00:31:55,155
But when it comes to my
daughter's social recreational life,

549
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,573
particularly as it concerns to medications

550
00:31:56,657 --> 00:31:59,785
that will permanently affect
her reproductive organs,

551
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,995
will you just kick that little
can of worms over to me?

552
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,370
-Do you understand?
-I do.

553
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,706
And should Skye come to
me ten years down the road

554
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,666
and ask for a little lift
to Planned Parenthood,

555
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,877
I would give you that courtesy call first.

556
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,003
Thanks.

557
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:15,757
-Ma'am!
-MADELINE: I'm dropping off my kid!

558
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:17,592
Come on, Chloe.

559
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:21,471
My daughter. It's my daughter.

560
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,890
Next time you wanna
do something like that,

561
00:32:23,974 --> 00:32:25,524
why don't I take your daughter?

562
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:29,687
Your daughter.
Do whatever you want to her. [SCOFFS]

563
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,522
Are you fucking kidding me?

564
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,024
MADELINE: <i>And what I don't understand is</i>

565
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:36,026
<i>why my own daughter
wouldn't come to me first.</i>

566
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,195
JANE: <i>I couldn't talk to
my mom about birth control.</i>

567
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,279
MADELINE: <i>Really?</i>

568
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:41,263
If I were you, I would just let it go.

569
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:44,408
I would. With Bonnie, Abigail.
I'd ride it out.

570
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:47,411
I love my grudges.
I tend to them like little pets.

571
00:32:47,495 --> 00:32:49,872
-All right, I'm just saying.
-I do the same thing.

572
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:51,666
I'm not into forgiveness either.

573
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,341
Really? Who do you not forgive?

574
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:56,003
No one. Just in general, you know?

575
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:57,836
"Never forgive. Never forget."

576
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:01,014
That sure sounds like a motto to live by.

577
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:03,593
-Good morning, Maddie. How are you?
-Hi, Tom.

578
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:06,054
-Everyone's making me angry.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

579
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:08,347
-Except for you. And you guys.
-And me.

580
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:10,140
Oh.

581
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:12,685
Marv Hermano, he runs
the muffler shop on Kentner,

582
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,646
and I hear that he's in need of
some bookkeeping assistance.

583
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,814
Great. Thank you!

584
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:19,982
And actually maybe some legal assistance,
too, if the zoning board stays on him.

585
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,109
I'm retired.

586
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:22,568
Unless you're defending
the First Amendment.

587
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:23,695
You never give up.

588
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,988
Oh, I heard about this.

589
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:27,115
-Ridiculous.
-I mean, I can't.

590
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,324
-Where are we living, girls?
-It is ridiculous.

591
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:29,992
It's obscene. What can I get you, Maddie?

592
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:32,204
I'll have a cappuccino. And a shot.

593
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:34,788
I'm sure you have one back there.

594
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:37,082
-I'll see what I can do. [LAUGHS]
-Thank you.

595
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,126
Yeah, I guess Shakespeare got it wrong.

596
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,961
"The play's the thing,
unless it has puppets."

597
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:43,172
Exactly! See? He understands me.

598
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,049
Unfortunately, gay.

599
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,383
-Really?
-Hmm.

600
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,176
-Come on.
-Yes!

601
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,610
-You're sure about that?
-All the best ones are.

602
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,519
-ED: Hey.
-Hey, Ed.

603
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:00,938
-What's up?
-Hey, man.

604
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:04,441
Love the look.
Especially the mirror, it's…

605
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:06,985
You gotta respect a man
who has his own back.

606
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:08,737
Well. Standard stuff.

607
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,964
-Yeah. How's the computer business going?
-Oh, great.

608
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:15,243
Kinda like landscaping, I guess.

609
00:34:16,035 --> 00:34:19,539
-Growth business.
-[LAUGHS] That's clever.

610
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,959
-Um… Hey, Thanks for meeting me.
-Yeah, yeah.

611
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:27,462
Yeah. I just wanted to discuss
this whole thing with, like…

612
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:30,339
That happened with Bonnie and Abby.

613
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:31,466
Sure.

614
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:35,845
You know, as far as I can tell, there
was no undue influence or interference.

615
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:38,013
Like, Abby asked Bonnie some
questions about Planned Parenthood,

616
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:39,147
Bonnie answered them,

617
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:41,365
Abby then asked Bonnie to drive her there.

618
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:45,104
There was no parental usurping
of any kind, I promise you that.

619
00:34:45,938 --> 00:34:48,190
But I can discuss that
whole thing with Maddie,

620
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:50,324
but what I wanted to take up with you is,

621
00:34:50,984 --> 00:34:53,194
I think you can probably
appreciate that it's

622
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:55,572
a bit of a delicate
balancing act with my ex.

623
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:01,160
So, you know, I kind of
expect her to be rough on me,

624
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:04,288
but I think it's…
Like, you can't punish Bonnie.

625
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:07,981
Well, I believe she's
being nice to Bonnie,

626
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,264
or at least trying, under
the circumstances.

627
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:14,339
What circumstances would those be?

628
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,425
Nathan, come on.
It was pretty tough when you left.

629
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:20,970
What? That was like 15 years ago.

630
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,392
It's difficult for Madeline to see you
at every school function, so involved,

631
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:31,271
when you weren't there for Abigail.

632
00:35:31,855 --> 00:35:34,505
It's difficult to run into you
at yoga when you never…

633
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:36,901
You know what?
Maybe I'm talking out of turn here.

634
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,862
No. I was young. You know?

635
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:41,655
And maybe a bit of a shit.

636
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:45,448
And I made some real mistakes
with both Maddie and Abby.

637
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:48,578
But should I be required to make the
same mistakes with Bonnie and Skye?

638
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:50,668
No. But, you know, it doesn't hurt to be

639
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:53,208
mindful of other people's
feelings sometimes.

640
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:55,668
Oh, yeah, yeah. Mr. Sensitive.

641
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:57,879
Excuse me?

642
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:00,340
No, actually, I meant
that as a compliment.

643
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:04,927
You're kind of like today's
standard bearer for the evolved man.

644
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:06,553
Like you work at home, and you…

645
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:08,972
And you do almost 50-50 of the child care.
You even cook.

646
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:13,101
So you're the guy who likes
to fish and hunt, and I'm…

647
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:14,894
-Mr. Girly-man?
-That's not what I meant at all, man.

648
00:36:14,978 --> 00:36:17,146
Listen, I thought it'd be indelicate
to bring it up with Maddie.

649
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,180
That's why I'm bringing it up with you.

650
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:23,349
Well, that sounded like a threat, Nathan.
Are you threatening me?

651
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:26,238
No, but actually, I feel like
you're starting to threaten me,

652
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:28,372
which I don't think you want to go there.

653
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,039
You know, this thing with that
Ziggy kid, all the talk of bullying?

654
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,209
I was bullied.

655
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:40,793
Sixth grade.

656
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:43,880
And I always turned the other cheek,

657
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,799
thinking that was the
more mature thing to do.

658
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:52,179
Some 30 years later, it still haunts me

659
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:56,058
that I didn't beat the
shit out of that kid.

660
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,477
So much so, I find myself fantasizing

661
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:04,315
that somebody will come along one
day and say or do something to me,

662
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:08,442
that'll offer me the
chance to redeem myself.

663
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:14,606
You've always treated
me quite well, Nathan.

664
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:16,868
It's too bad.

665
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:22,374
Too bad.

666
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:29,171
[SCOFFS]

667
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,841
The first thing I said,
the very first thing I said,

668
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:34,275
it wasn't just the mothers.

669
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:38,679
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass,
you fuckin' talk to me like that again,

670
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:40,015
you fuckin' little shit.

671
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:44,102
Ed and Nathan hated each other's guts.
Are we all afraid to say that?

672
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:46,827
<i>There's clearly a lot of
bad blood in this community.</i>

673
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:58,198
MADELINE: <i>What did he say?</i>

674
00:37:58,282 --> 00:38:01,159
JOSEPH: <i>The mayor refuses to
authorize funding for the production.</i>

675
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:02,475
MADELINE: <i>Well, it should be a legal</i>

676
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,203
<i>matter and we could
make it a legal matter.</i>

677
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,830
The funding is discretionary.
He could deny it on whatever grounds…

00:49:02,685 --> 00:49:04,562
I never threatened to beat him up.

851
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:08,816
I did let him know I wouldn't
be intimidated by him,

852
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,692
which, I think, was his intent.

853
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:13,195
So how did you two leave it?

854
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:15,238
We left it…

Can I just say one thing?

860
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:34,215
You never leave it at one thing.

861
00:49:37,092 --> 00:49:38,426
You're the one, okay?

862
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:43,598
You're my only one.
