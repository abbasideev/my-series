339
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,012
Hi, guys.

340
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:06,390
Hi.

341
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:09,310
Mm, I missed you. Oh!

342
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:11,428
MADELINE: Now, where is the Chloe?

343
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,771
Chloe. Of course, she's networking.

344
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:15,567
Hi.

345
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,360
Okay.

346
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:21,781
I just want to introduce you to Juliette.
This is my Amabella's nanny.

347
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,282
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

348
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,617
She's French.

349
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,327
It's good for them to learn
a language, you know?

350
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:28,788
I just thought it was nice for the
nannies to get to know each other,

351
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:31,374
-have your own little support system.
-Renata, Jane is not a nanny.

352
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,292
She's a mom, just young.

353
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,754
-Like you used to be.
-Oh. Like we used to be?

354
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,130
-Sorry, I…
-Maddie, hi.

355
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:39,925
BONNIE: I heard you're
working at the community theater.

356
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,159
I wanted to talk to
you about the petition.

357
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:43,970
About the play.

358
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,390
There's been some concern
about it being appropriate.

359
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,225
There's a petition to stop the play?

360
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,312
That play was kind of
like a lifeline for Madeline.

361
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:53,647
It tethered her to a purpose.

362
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:54,982
I signed it.

363
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:56,441
MS. BARNES: Excuse me!

364
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:57,567
-You signed it?
-I did.

365
00:18:57,651 --> 00:18:58,735
I didn't know you were involved, though…

366
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:01,196
MS. BARNES: Excuse me, could I
have everyone's attention for a moment?

367
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,322
She grew up wanting to be Betty Grable.

368
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,699
MS. BARNES: <i>All my first-grade kiddos…</i>

369
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,158
Ended up Betty Crocker.

370
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:07,160
-Chloe, come on.
-…and their parents, please.

371
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:09,121
-I'm here.
-Hi, Chloe.

372
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,414
Wonderful.

373
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:16,504
Okay.
We have had such a wonderful morning.

374
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:20,759
But we need to have a little chat,
and it's a little bit serious, okay?

375
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:24,345
Someone hurt Anabella.

376
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,014
-Oh.
-MS. BARNES: Excuse me. Amabella.

377
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:31,477
And I would like whoever it
was to come over and apologize,

378
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:35,190
okay, because we don't hurt
our friends at school, do we?

379
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,941
-No.
-MS. BARNES: No, we don't.

380
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:40,570
And if we do, we always say…

381
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,740
-KIDS: Sorry.
-Sorry. That's right.

382
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:46,118
Because that's what big
first-grade children do, right?

383
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:48,412
Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,498
Baby, someone hurt you?

385
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:53,876
Amabella, do you think it
was an accident maybe?

386
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,463
An accident? Look at her neck
for God's sake. It has marks on it.

387
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,425
Amabella, sweetie, can you
tell me if it was a boy or a girl?

388
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,970
-It was a boy.
-It was a boy?

389
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,306
-What was his name?
-Maybe she doesn't want to say.

390
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,989
Mrs. Klein, my problem
is that the children

391
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:12,269
don't know one another's names yet,

392
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,439
so Amabella cannot tell me who…

393
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,317
-We're not gonna just let this go.
-Absolutely not.

394
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:21,613
Mrs. Klein, I'm so sorry.

395
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,282
Is she okay?

396
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:26,574
I don't know. They're gonna find out.
Just give her a second.

397
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,538
-Did you see what happened?
-No.

398
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:31,372
-RENATA: You're her teacher.
-MS. BARNES: You know what.

399
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,333
-You should be doing something.
-Um… Uh,

400
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:37,713
Amabella, sweetie, could you
maybe point to the boy who hurt you.

401
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:39,882
Come on, really?

402
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:50,351
-This boy?
-No.

403
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:52,020
Him.

404
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:56,149
-This boy?
-AMABELLA: Yes, he tried to choke me.

405
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,026
-What?
-ZIGGY: It wasn't me.

406
00:20:58,318 --> 00:20:59,360
AMABELLA: Yes, it was.

407
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:02,279
MS. BARNES: Ziggy, sweetie,
we just need you to say sorry.

408
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:03,698
I didn't do anything.

409
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,243
[WHISPERS] I didn't.

410
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,830
Are you sure that it was
this little boy, sweetie?

411
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:14,774
Could she have got it wrong?

412
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,796
Can you say you're sorry to Amabella?

413
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,923
-She's hurt quite badly.
-ZIGGY: It wasn't me.

414
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:21,550
Ziggy, look at me.

415
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:24,094
-Promise.
-RENATA: We don't have to lie.

416
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:25,778
We just want to say we're sorry.

417
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:28,265
-Ziggy doesn't lie.
-Right.

418
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,308
I can assure you,
Amabella's telling the truth.

419
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:32,278
If my son says he
didn't do it, I believe him.

420
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:33,019
Of course.

421
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:37,148
You know what? I don't know if this
is the best way to deal with this, so…

422
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,234
I agree, but now we are,

423
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:42,488
so maybe the child needs to
take responsibility for his actions.

424
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:45,615
And he needs to see
there are consequences.

425
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:49,871
Little boys don't get to go
around anymore hurting little girls.

426
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:52,206
And none of us want to raise bullies, so…

427
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,709
We don't have to pretend we didn't do it.

428
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,836
It's okay. I believe you.

429
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,240
Jane, can you just
make your son apologize?

430
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:00,339
MADELINE: Renata.

431
00:22:00,423 --> 00:22:01,758
Stay out of it.

432
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:04,844
I can't make him apologize for
something that I know he didn't do.

433
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:05,642
Of course you can't.

434
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,513
We will schedule a
meeting for another time.

435
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,766
-We can handle this later.
-RENATA: Okay.

436
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,768
This is unacceptable.
Let's go, baby. Let's go, sweet pea.

437
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,186
MS. BARNES: All right,
everyone, thank you.

438
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,979
I'm so sorry, honey.

439
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:17,106
Not that there's a right
little girl to strangle,

440
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,275
but he picked the wrong
little girl to strangle.

441
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,986
Ziggy.

442
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,738
Do you see her neck?

443
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:27,701
If you ever touch my little girl like that
again, you're gonna be in big trouble.

444
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,453
-Excuse me.
-Well…

445
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:31,371
Now you owe him an apology.

446
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:32,831
-Madeline!
-Renata!

447
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:35,084
The battle lines were drawn right there.

448
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:39,630
We've never had a Trivia
Night end in bloodshed before.

449
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,330
MADELINE: How dare she
speak to a child like that?

450
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:45,385
I mean, isn't there some
sort of students' bill of rights?

451
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:47,721
Celeste used to be a
lawyer, a very good lawyer.

452
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:50,849
I mean, isn't there due process
for a first grader? Am I wrong?

453
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,727
Well, he's not being punished, so…

454
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:54,812
Well, he's being stigmatized
as a bully, and that's worse.

455
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,731
I think we should not make
a big deal out of this. Just…

456
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:58,066
Madeline.

457
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,193
Harper Stimson, hi.

458
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:01,577
Jane just didn't fit here.

459
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:04,787
Kind of like a dirty old Prius
parked outside of Barneys.

460
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:11,537
It was a mistake to let people compete,
but that is not what got someone killed.

461
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,271
HARPER: Hi, Celeste. How's Perry?

462
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:15,584
Oh, uh. He's good. Thank you.

463
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:19,902
-HARPER: If it'll help…
-MADELINE: You didn't ask me how Ed was.

464
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:21,923
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,134
Listen, Renata happens
to be one of my best friends,

466
00:23:24,218 --> 00:23:27,680
so if there's any way I can play the role
of peacemaker in all this, just please…

467
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:29,515
Thank you, Harper.
That's very sweet of you to offer.

468
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,249
And I'll make sure and let everybody
know that Renata is your best friend.

469
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,523
I'm only trying to help.

470
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:39,124
MADELINE: I'm sure you are.

471
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:43,278
This could get ugly.

472
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:44,780
We could just let it blow over.

473
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:48,034
Things never blow over
once Madeline gets involved.

474
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:49,660
<i>They blow up.</i>

475
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:50,745

full-thickness scalp laceration</i>

00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:22,694
<i>located on the superior
occipital portion of the scalp.</i>

479

have handled it worse.

"Point out the suspect, Amabella."
Are you kidding me?

00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:49,180
I take it this Jane is kind of damaged.

00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:50,473
Why do you say that?

489
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,768
-You're drawn to damaged people.
-I am not.

Even Celeste, there's something
wounded about her, if you ask me.

491

that's not a character flaw.

-MADELINE: I see that look.
-Hmm.
