172
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:02,857
I don't think I would
have shot him, but I had it.

173
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:05,527
Okay.

174
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,990
Well I'm not gonna lie,
that gives me pause.

175
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:13,285
Yeah, it gives me pause, too.

176
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,706
Like I think I'm going insane.

177
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:23,503
Like I still hope, that
whoever he is, is a nice guy.

178
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:26,465
That like, maybe that night
was just a bad misunderstanding,

179
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,217
or a night gone wrong,

180
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:32,388
or he had a bad day, or his
parents got in a car crash.

181
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,224
And like, I make up these crazy excuses

182
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:38,729
because I'm so desperate to believe that
Ziggy's father is actually a good person.

183

Well he's been very, um…
[CLICKS TONGUE] Affectionate.

184
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,082
Very clingy.

185
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:02,588
Which usually means
he's feeling insecure, or…

186
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,423
Or what?

187
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,760
Or it means I have the power.

188
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:13,932
Sometimes he has it.
Sometimes I have it. It's like a seesaw.

189

When do you get the power?

190
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,940
After he hits you?

191
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,862
Yeah, when he hurts
me I get the upper hand.

192
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:32,620
The more he hurts me, the
higher I go, the longer I stay. Until…

193
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:42,171
He's been, um, ahem,
very loving the last few days.

194
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:46,133
-But at some point he gets the power back.
-Mm.

195
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:52,224
Usually when my bruises fade…

196
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,144
…and he doesn't feel as guilty.

197
00:12:56,228 --> 00:13:00,064
He feels insecure, and
then it all happens again.

Where is he now?

for, have the beds set up for the kids.

I'll get you the number of the Better
Business Bureau, you can report me.

218

In the meantime, start
documenting the abuse.

219
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:10,014
Write everything down,

220

keep doctor reports.
