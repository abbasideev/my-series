1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,462
I'm telling you, Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,465
She barely knows me.
We just live in the same building.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,051
- Any contact?
- She lent me an egg once.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,469
You're in.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,097
Oh, right.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,599
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,899
Come on, Ross. You gotta get back
in the game here.

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,279
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you...

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,115
I don't think we need a third.

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,577
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
over here, still in the shell?

11
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,828
An egg?

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,958
Yeah. Go up to her and say, "Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg."

13
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,169
I think it's winning.

14
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,255
- I think it's insane.
- She'll love it.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,426
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Here.

16
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,514
Go with the egg, my friend.

17
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,311
Go, go, go.

18
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,566
- Think it'll work?
- It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

19
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,119
- You cannot do this.
- What? Do what?

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,912
Roger wants to take her out.

21
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,165
No. Pheebs. Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

22
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,334
Because he was creepy.

23
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,254
And mean. And a little frightening.

24
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,048
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day.

25
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,259
- Hi.
- Hi.

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,137
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

27
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,097
I know I do.

28
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,269
What are you doing tomorrow night?

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,813
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,192
- Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight...
- No, no, don't you dare bail on me.

32
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,904
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

33
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,990
But her friend sounds like such a...

34
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,450
Pathetic mess. I know, but...

35
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,246
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable. I'm thinking:

36
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,253
Thanks.

37
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,008
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

38
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,135
- Hi.
- Hi.

39
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,304
- She said yes.
- Ahem.

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,889
Yes! Way to go, man.

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,143
- Still got the egg, huh?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,909
- How do I look?
- Oh, um...

43
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,452
...I don't care.

44
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,582
There's Lorraine.

45
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,584
Now, remember, no trading.

46
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,128
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

47
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,881
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

48
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,676
Well, well.

49
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,511
Look what you brought.

50
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,222
Very nice.

51
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,225
And what did you bring?

52
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,645
She's checking her coat.

53
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,190
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

54
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,236
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,411
Janice?

56
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,956
Oh...

57
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,415
...my...

58
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,875
...God.

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,173
Hey, it's Janice.

60
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,765
Okay, I'm making a break for it.
I'm going out the window.

61
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,645
No, don't, please. I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine.

62
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,064
- Just calm down.
- Calm down? Calm down?

63
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,109
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months.

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,694
Hey.

65
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,156
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous...

66
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,745
...and I can't go when I'm nervous.

67
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,456
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

68
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,547
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

69
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,969
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,096
- Which one was he?
- Pete the Weeper?

71
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,017
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

72
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,020
"Oh, was it good for you?"

73
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,401
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.

74
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,695
"I win. I win."

75
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,491
I went out with him for two months.
I didn't get to win once.

76
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,495
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

77
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,582
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

78
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,336
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,215
There's more beer, right?

80
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,471
Oh. You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

81
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,767
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle...

82
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,311
...you can do a cleansing ritual.

83
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,650
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

84
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,528
Yeah.

85
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,740
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

86
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,825
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

87
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,453
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

88
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,749
Okay, we can, um, burn the stuff
they gave us.

89
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,293
Or?

90
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:23,340
Or we can chant and dance around naked,
you know, with sticks.

91
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,677
- Burning's good.
- Burning's good.

92
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,471
I've got stuff to burn.

93
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,564
You know...

94
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,194
...ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

95
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,072
Yeah? Good for you.

96
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:53,120
Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?

97
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,421
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

98
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,133
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

99
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,177
That's okay.

100
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,598
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

101
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,352
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty.

102
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,606
We can't do that.

103
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,860
What? What can't you do?

104
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,323
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

105
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,583
Uh, we might be leaving now.

106
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,377
Tell me it's you and me "we."

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,883
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

108
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,802
I'm not even sure what slathering is.

109
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,930
But I definitely want to be
a part of it.

110
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,018
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

111
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,730
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

112
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:06,234
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

113
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,403
I'm out of here.

114
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,533
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.

115
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,369
I hope she throws up on you.

116
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,873
Thanks.

117
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,961
- So...
- Just us.

118
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,631
Ugh, what a crappy night.

119
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:32,093
Although I have enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out...

120
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,222
...of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

121
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,478
Excuse me.

122
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,274
How you doing?

123
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,116
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

124
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,702
Joey's not a friend. He's...

125
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,958
...a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

126
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,088
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

127
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,923
I will go for that drink.

128
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,716
You got it. Good woman.

129
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,641
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

130
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,518
- Each.
- That's right. Each.

131
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,687
Oh. And a, uh, Rob Roy.

132
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,523
I've always wanted to know.

133
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,503
Happy Valentine's Day.

134
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,888
Oh, I miss you already.

135
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,975
Can you believe this happened?

136
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,685
No, no.

137
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,605
And yet it did.

138
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,774
- Goodbye, Janice.
- Kiss me.

139
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:17,532
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

140
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,870
- Hey, Janice.
- Hi, Monica.

141
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,998
Okay. Well, this was very special.

142
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,127
Rach, come see who's out here.

143
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,505
What's going on...?
Oh, my God.

144
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,883
Janice. Hi.

145
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,053
Janice is gonna go away now.

146
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,056
I'll be right back.

147
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,268
Oh. Joey. Look who it is.

148
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,103
Whoa.

149
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,982
Oh, good. Joey's home now.

150
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,568
This is so much fun.

151
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,154
This is like a reunion in the hall.

152
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,035
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

153
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,747
He just happened to call.

154
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,417
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right.
It's me. How did you know?

155
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,303
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then...

156
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,849
...because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing...

157
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,395
...that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles...

158
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,774
...he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half.

159
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,780
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

160
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,710
What?

161
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,256
Who are they?

162
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,758
The, uh, blond is my ex-wife.

163
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,053
And the woman touching her is her...

164
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,472
...close personal friend.

165
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,768
You mean they're lovers?

166
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,104
If you want to put a label on it.

167
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,399
Wow. Heh.

168
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,485
- Anything else I should know?
- Nope. That's it.

169
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,364
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

170
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,412
I always forget that part.

171
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,623
Hello.

172
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:42,093
Okay. So now we need, um,
sage branches and the sacramental wine.

173
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,473
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

174
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,516
Um, that's okay.

175
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,979
- Ooh.
- Okay.

176
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,941
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

177
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,783
Huh. Okay, Pheebs, if we had that...

178
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,160
...we wouldn't be doing the ritual
in the first place.

179
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,332
- Can we start throwing things in?
- Um, yeah, okay.

180
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,210
Oh. Okay. Um...

181
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,587
Okay. Barry's letters.

182
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,633
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

183
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,135
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with:

184
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,353
- A picture of Scotty Jared, naked.
- Let me see.

185
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,188
He's wearing a sweater.

186
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,398
- No.
- Ew!

187
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,906
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

188
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,658
Wait. Isn't it almost pure...?

189
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,707
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

190
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,919
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

191
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,967
Oh, man. In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

192
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,304
Hello, funny valentine.

193
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,057
Hi, just Janice.

194
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,519
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

195
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,605
I could just kiss you all over,
and I'm gonna.

196
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,901
Oh. Okay, heh. Ha, ha, okay.

197
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,321
If you don't do it, I will.

198
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,379
So, um, what do you do for a living?

199
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,922
Well, um for the past few years...

200
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,176
Oh, no. You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

201
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,428
I thought they could.

202
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,931
- Working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

203
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,393
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

204
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,938
So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science, heh...

205
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,942
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

206
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,956
Now, that is funny.

207
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,502
Hey, do you think...?

208
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,715
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

209
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,051
Because she's alone now.

210
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,386
And pregnant. And sad.

211
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,014
- I guess.
- Are you sure?

212
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,682
Thanks. Carol.

213
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,185
Wanna come over and join us?

214
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,645
Oh, no. I'm fine.

215
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,981
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down. Come on.

216
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,401
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

217
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,655
Let's try scooching. Come on.

218
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,990
- Come on.
- Thank you.

219
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,204
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

220
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,915
- Carol, Kristen.
- How do you do?

221
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,417
Um... Oh, uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.

222
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,170
And, uh, Kristen...

223
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,842
Kristen does something...

224
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,096
...that, funnily enough...

225
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,391
...wasn't even her major.

226
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,188
What do we got there?

227
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,441
A piece of silk boxer shorts...

228
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,694
...some greeting cards...

229
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,364
...what looks like a
half-charred picture of...

230
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,534
Wow, that guy's hairier
than the chief.

231
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,499
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

232
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,501
It's all right. Don't explain.

233
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,838
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of control.

234
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,843
- You're our third call tonight.
- Really?

235
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,179
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

236
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,226
I brought you something.

237
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,936
Is it loaded?

238
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,234
Oh, little candy hearts.

239
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,280
"Chan and Jan forever."

240
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,824
I had them made special.

241
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,871
Okay, Janice.

242
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:21,998
Janice.

243
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,751
Hey, Janice.

244
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,214
Look, there's no way for me
to tell you this.

245
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,009
At least, there's no new way
for me to tell you this.

246
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,931
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

247
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,852
That's fine.

248
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,357
- It is?
- Mm-hm.

249
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,195
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

250
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,741
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

251
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,827
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

252
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,537
Don't you know it yet?

253
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,957
You love me, Chandler Bing.

254
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,755
Oh, no, I don't.

255
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,258
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

256
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,344
New Year's, who invited who?

257
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,472
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

258
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,141
- I did, but...
- You seek me out.

259
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:27,522
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn.

260
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,651
Janice. Janice.

261
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,237
You want me. You need me.

262
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,698
You can't live without me.

263
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,575
And you know it.

264
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,830
You just don't know you know it.

265
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,335
See you.

266
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,510
Call me.

267
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:10,106
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

268
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,859
You did so. I swear.
I swear to...

269
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,157
How long has she been in the bathroom?

270
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,244
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

271
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,580
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,169
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

273
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,921
- That could be it.
- Oh, God.

274
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,633
You know, this is still pretty hot.

275
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,472
Mushroom.

276
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,017
Smile.

277
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,980
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

278
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,483
- I'm sorry. That's not funny.
- No, it's just...

279
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,738
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

280
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,032
Well, do I have to?

281
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,329
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

282
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,623
...and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

283
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,750
But there's...

284
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,169
That's it.

285
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,133
And, uh, then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

286
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,844
And I don't have to...

287
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,846
- I know.
- You know?

288
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,145
Here's a wacky thought. Um, ahem.

289
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,107
- Let's say you and I give it another shot.
- Ross.

290
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,568
No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

291
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,575
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

292
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,328
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

293
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,456
Because we're great together,
you know?

294
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,750
You can't deny it.

295
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,170
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

296
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,173
- I mean, how perfect is that?
- Ross...

297
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,343
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

298
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,552
I love you.

299
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,604
I love you too.

300
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,941
- But...
- No "but." No "but."

301
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,113
You know that thing
we put over here with the pin in it?

302
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,618
It's time to take the pin out.

303
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,457
Yeah.

304
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,004
You'll find someone. I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

305
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,090
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

306
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,470
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

307
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,934
Not her.

308
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,489
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

309
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,366
- Okay.
- Great.

310
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,703
So, um, will you bring the truck?

311
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,708
- I'll even let you ring the bell.
- Wohoo!

312
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,836
- We'll see you later.
- Bye. See you later.

313
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,755
Thanks. See you.

314
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,256
Oh, my God.

315
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,092
See, there you go.

316
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,720
- The cleansing worked.
- You're right.

317
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,430
They're nice guys.

318
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,058
They're firemen guys.

319
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,020
- You tell them you're married?
- No way.

320
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,439
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them.
