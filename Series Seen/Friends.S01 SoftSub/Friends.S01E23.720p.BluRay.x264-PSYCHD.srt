1
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,048
Dr. Johnson, you have a call on line 7.

2
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,385
She's not here yet.
She's having my baby and she's not here.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,471
- Everything's fine. Has her water broken?
- I don't know.

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,766
But when I spoke to her, she said
she'd already passed the mucus plug.

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,272
Do we have to know about that?

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,816
What are you gonna do
when you have a baby?

7
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,737
I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

8
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,866
Yes, Joey's made arrangements
to have his baby in a movie from the '50s.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,121
Aah, I don't believe this. I mean,
she could be giving birth in the cab.

10
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,414
Oh, Ross, relax.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,750
It's only like $2 for the first contraction...

12
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,086
...and then 50 cents
each additional contraction.

13
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,673
What, it's okay when Chandler does it?

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,676
You have to pick your moments.

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,555
- Hi. Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
- No, she's not even here yet.

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,515
- Oh.
- What's with the guitar?

17
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,561
I just thought we might be here for a while,
so, you know, things might get musical.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,732
- Hey, where the hell have you been?
- We stopped at the gift shop.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,651
I was looking at stuffed animals,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

20
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,697
Susan wanted a... You're having a baby.
A baby. You don't stop for Chunkys.

21
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,617
- I used to have that bumper sticker.
- Ha, ha.

22
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,494
You see what I mean?

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,795
- "Stopped for a Chunky."
- Let it go, Ross.

24
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,005
I got an extra one. You want this?

25
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,466
No.

26
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,011
Hey, how's my favorite
parenting team doing?

27
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,805
Dr. Franzblau. Hi.

28
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,933
So I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

29
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,309
Wow.

30
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,062
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

31
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,649
- How you doing with your contractions?
- Oh, I love them.

32
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,360
Each one's like a little party in my uterus.

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,572
Ha, ha. They're every four minutes
and last 55 seconds.

34
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,824
Fifty-nine seconds. Quartz. Ha.

35
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,368
Swiss quartz. Ha, ha.

36
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,123
- Am I allowed to drink anything?
- Ice chips, just ice chips.

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,458
- They're at the nurses' station.
- I'll get them.

38
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,795
- No, I'm getting it. Be right back.
- No, I got it. I'm getting it.

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,675
Hi. Thought you might like
some ice chips.

40
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,218
Thanks.

41
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,554
And if you need anything else, I...

42
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,639
...do not believe we have met. Hi.

43
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,642
I'm Rachel Green.

44
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,104
I'm Carol's ex-husband's
sister's roommate. Ha, ha.

45
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,024
It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau.

46
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,652
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

47
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,656
Oh, that's funny.

48
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,456
I want a baby.

49
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,751
Hmm. Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

50
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,503
Get up. Come on, let's get some coffee.

51
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,049
Oh, okay, because we never do that.

52
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,927
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

53
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,137
Or just fall down. That's good too.

54
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,306
- Knick fan?
- Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,643
- Oh, boy, do they suck.
- Hey, listen, lady, I...

56
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,144
Whoa.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,440
Look. Look at your man Ewing.
Nice shot.

58
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,443
You know, he couldn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,111
Oh, yeah? And who do you like?

60
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,530
- Celtics.
- Celtics? Ha!

61
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,617
They couldn't hit a boat if... Wait.

62
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,537
They suck, all right?

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,374
Shut up.
You know, it's a rebuilding year. You...

64
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,875
- Aah! Aah!
- Oh. Aah.

65
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,543
Uh, let me get the father. Hey!

66
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,004
We need a father over here!
We need a father!

67
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,506
There's no father.

68
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,424
Oh. Oh.

69
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,676
Oh, sorry.

70
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,553
Oh, that's okay. I'm fine. I'm...

71
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,430
- Oh!
- Oh, uh...

72
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,099
Okay. All right. Uh, right this way.

73
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,768
All the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

74
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,228
Okay.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,196
They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

76
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,033
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

77
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,039
Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why

78
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:58,505
And you cry and you cry and you cry

79
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,841
- Thanks, Ross.
- Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.

80
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,176
Okay.

81
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,432
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.

82
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,520
No fair. I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

83
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,481
- You'll get one.
- Oh, yeah? When?

84
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,025
I'll tell you what.

85
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,569
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,613
...what do you say you and I have one?

87
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,574
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?

88
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,952
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,122
Okay, hypothetically,
why won't I be married when I'm 40?

90
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,541
- No, no, no.
- No, no, what is it? Seriously.

91
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,210
Is there something
fundamentally unmarriable about me?

92
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,630
- Uh... Uh...
- Well?

93
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,343
Dear God. This parachute is a knapsack.

94
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,513
- Hey.
- Hey. Ooh.

95
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,682
- Look at you, dressy-dress.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,726
Did you go home and change?

97
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,229
Yeah, well, it's an important day.
I wanna look nice.

98
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,066
Um, has Dr. Franzblau been by?

99
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,818
No, I haven't seen him.

100
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,988
Well, where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

101
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,159
What if the baby needs him?

102
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,453
Rachel, what is the deal
with you and doctors?

103
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,624
- Is, like, your father a doctor?
- Yeah. Why?

104
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,834
No reason.

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,963
Mom, we've been through this.

106
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,758
No, I am not calling him.

107
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,886
I don't care if it is his kid.
The guy's a jerk.

108
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,973
No, I am not alone. Joey's here.

109
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,643
What do you mean, "Joey who?"

110
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,103
Joey who?

111
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,606
- Tribbiani.
- Joey Tribbiani.

112
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:44,528
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

113
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,072
- She wants to talk to you.
- No.

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,032
Take the phone.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,951
Hi. Yeah, it's me.

116
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,997
Oh, no, no, no. We're just friends. Yeah.

117
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,125
Yeah, I'm single.

118
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,335
Twenty-five.

119
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,753
An actor.

120
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,505
Hello?

121
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,804
- She's not much of a phone person.
- Yeah.

122
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,808
So, uh, what's the deal
with this father guy?

123
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,854
I mean, if someone was having my baby
somewhere, I'd wanna know about it.

124
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:23,233
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? Um, no.

125
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,321
Okay. Uh, look, maybe I should just go.

126
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,199
- Maybe you should.
- Good luck.

127
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,703
And, uh, take care, huh?

128
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,379
Know what the Celtics' problem is?
They let the players run the team.

129
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,755
Oh, that is so not true.

130
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,716
- Oh, it is. It is.
- It isn't. Isn't.

131
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,427
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

132
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,512
You're gonna kill me!

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,475
- Fifteen more seconds. Fourteen, 13, 12...
- Count faster.

134
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,811
It's gonna be okay. We're doing it for Jordy.
Keep focusing on Jordy.

135
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,104
Who the hell is Jordy?

136
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,398
- Your son.
- Whoa, whoa whoa.

137
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,858
I don't have a son named Jordy.

138
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,152
We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.

139
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,113
Well, Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...

140
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,574
...so we went back to Jordy.

141
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,992
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,703
What do you mean, "back to Jordy"?
We never landed on Jordy.

143
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:22,125
We just passed by it
during the whole Jesse/Cody/Dillon fiasco.

144
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,376
Ow, ow, ow!

145
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,212
- What? What? What?
- Leg cramp, leg cramp.

146
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,422
- I got it. I got it.
- I got it. I'm doing it.

147
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,008
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.

148
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,343
No, you don't.

149
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,803
- That is it. I want both of you out.
- What?

150
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,430
- She started it.
- He started it.

151
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,640
I don't care.

152
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,059
I'm trying to get a person
out of my body here...

153
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,687
...and you're not making it any easier.
Now go!

154
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,608
- Thanks a lot.
- See what you did?

155
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,152
- Yeah. Listen...
- Out.

156
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:55,742
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

157
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,702
Oh, no.

158
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,080
Ew.

159
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,667
What is that? Something exploded.

160
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,169
It's just her water breaking.
Calm down, will you?

161
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,714
Water breaking? What do you mean?
What's that, water breaking?

162
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,510
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

163
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,557
- Oh, please. This is so your fault.
- How? How is this my fault?

164
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,685
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

165
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,480
Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did
before I came along.

166
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,568
- Are you trying to be clever?
- You are so threatened by me.

167
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,779
- Everything I say is a problem.
- Hey, hey, hey. Okay. All right.

168
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,447
That's it. Get in here. Come on.

169
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,410
My God, you guys. I don't believe you.

170
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,746
There are children coming into the world
in this very building...

171
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,458
...and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should be hearing.

172
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,086
So just stop all the yelling! Just stop it!

173
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,714
Yeah, Susan.

174
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,593
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!

175
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,225
Okay, who wants to hear
something ironic?

176
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,565
Help!

177
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,108
- Come on!
- Help!

178
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,902
- I'm having a baby in there!
- Hello?

179
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,238
- Help!
- Okay, everyone stand back.

180
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,785
Ow.

181
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,332
Are they here yet?

182
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,917
No, honey, but don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

183
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,254
And until we do,
we are all here for you, okay?

184
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,839
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

185
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,509
Anyway, you were telling me about Paris.
It sounds wonderful.

186
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,138
It really was. There was this
great little pastry shop right by my hotel...

187
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,601
There you go, dear. You...

188
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,770
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push.

189
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,148
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

190
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,609
Push him out, push him out. Way out.

191
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,612
Let's get that ball and really move.
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

192
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,863
Let's get...

193
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,242
I was just... Yeah, okay.

194
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,703
Push, push, push.

195
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,416
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,381
- Help! Help! Help!
- Help!

197
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:18,677
And they found their bodies
The very next day

198
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,764
And they found their bodies
The very next...

199
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,517
La, la, la, la, la, la

200
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,477
Help!

201
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:32,190
No, Mom, everything's going fine, really.
Yeah, Ross is great. He's, uh...

202
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,945
He's in a whole other place. Yeah.
No, he's gone.

203
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,281
No, no, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

204
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,575
What do you mean,
this might be your only chance?

205
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,120
Oh. Would you stop? I'm only 26.

206
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,122
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.

207
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,347
- Where have you been?
- Oh, I just had a baby.

208
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,684
Mazel tov.

209
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,982
I don't know.
It could be an hour, it could be three.

210
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,109
But relax, she's doing great.

211
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,864
So, uh, tell me,
are you currently involved with anyone?

212
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,075
No. No, not at...
At the moment, no, I'm not, no.

213
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,035
- Are you?
- No, no.

214
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,079
It's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

215
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,167
Heh. Right, yeah,
I've heard that about cute doctors.

216
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,877
No, no, really.

217
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:38,548
I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

218
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,341
...where I do.

219
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,012
- Oh.
- Mm.

220
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,892
I try not to let work affect my personal life,
but it's hard when you do...

221
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,770
...what I do. It's like, uh...

222
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,189
Well, for instance, what do you do?

223
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,983
- I'm a waitress.
- Okay, all right.

224
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,320
Well, aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day...

225
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,949
...and you're just like,
"If I see one more cup of coffee..."

226
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,831
Ahem. Yeah. Gotcha.

227
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,754
- I'm gonna check up on your friend.
- Okay, that's fine.

228
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,390
- So how did you know I was even here?
- Your mom called me.

229
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,726
So is this her?

230
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,645
No, this is a loaner.

231
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,899
Listen, I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.

232
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:43,988
Oh. I wasn't by myself.
I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.

233
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,242
So did you see who won the game?

234
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,954
Yeah, Knicks by 10. They suck.

235
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,915
Eh, they're not so bad.

236
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,730
Come on. Come on.

237
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:24,070
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.

238
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,948
This is supposed to be, like,
the greatest day of my life.

239
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,076
My son is being born,
and I should be in there, you know?

240
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,161
Instead I'm stuck in a closet with you.

241
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,665
I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have.

242
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,002
Believe me, no one has been waiting
for this as much as I have, okay?

243
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,879
And you know what the funny thing is?

244
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,631
When this day is over,
you get to go home with the baby.

245
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,217
- Where does that leave me?
- You get to be the father.

246
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,138
Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day.

247
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,599
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

248
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,226
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

249
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,814
This is so great.

250
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,570
You wanna explain that?

251
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,532
I mean, well, because when I was
growing up, you know, my dad left...

252
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,744
...and my mother died,
and my stepfather went to jail.

253
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,664
So I barely had enough pieces of parents
to make one whole one.

254
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,336
And here's this little baby
who has like three whole parents...

255
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,256
...who care about it so much that they fight
over who gets to love it the most...

256
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,842
...and it's not even born yet.

257
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,553
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

258
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,433
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

259
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,020
Where are they?

260
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,190
- I'm sure they'll be here soon.
- They wouldn't miss this.

261
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:47,362
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

262
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,575
Okay, you are really frightening me.

263
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,580
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

264
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,210
Uh... Oh, that's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?

265
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,464
All right. Ten centimeters. Here we go.

266
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,926
- All right, honey, time to start pushing.
- But they're not here yet.

267
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,220
Sorry, I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

268
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,223
Oh, God.

269
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,228
Okay, got the vent open.

270
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,813
Hi, I'm Ben.

271
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,359
I'm hospital worker Ben.

272
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,361
It's Ben to the rescue.

273
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,947
- La, la, la
- Okay, okay, okay.

274
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,198
- Ben, you ready?
- Yeah.

275
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,033
- All right, give me your foot.
- Okay.

276
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,204
- Okay, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Unh.
- Ooh.

277
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,583
- Come on, Ben. Okay. That's it, Ben.
- Okay. Uh-huh.

278
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,460
What do you see?

279
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,381
Well, Susan,
I see what appears to be a dark vent.

280
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,882
Wait.

281
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,594
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

282
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,891
Pheebs, it's open! It's open!

283
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,231
Wait! You forgot your legs!

284
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,026
- Push. Push.
- We're here!

285
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,822
- We're here.
- Where have you been?!

286
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,115
Long story, honey.

287
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,451
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing.

288
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,411
I need... Excuse me, can I have this?

289
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,246
Oh, sorry.

290
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,664
All right, all right.

291
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,917
There's too many people in this room.
There's about to be one more.

292
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:29,464
So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian life partner, out you go.

293
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,340
- Come on, out.
- Okay, good luck.

294
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,676
- Bye, bye, bye.
- Good luck, you guys, good luck.

295
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,805
Let me ask you, do you have to be
Carol's lesbian life partner?

296
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,515
Out.

297
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,227
All right.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.

298
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,230
Let me see. I gotta see, I gotta see.

299
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,066
Oh... Oh.

300
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,319
Oh! A head.

301
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,489
Oh. It's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?

302
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,825
Not helping.

303
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,952
You're doing great. You're doing fine.

304
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,121
- Hello?
- Oh, sorry.

305
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,248
What do you see? What do you see?

306
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,959
We got a head, we got shoulders,
we got arms, we got...

307
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,171
Oh, look at the little... The fingers.

308
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,672
Oh, a chest and a stomach...

309
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,759
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

310
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,262
All right. Okay, legs, knees and feet.

311
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,514
Oh, oh.

312
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,687
He's here. He's...

313
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,439
He's a person.

314
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,690
Oh!

315
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,859
- Look at that.
- What does he look like?

316
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,030
Kind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

317
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,032
Really?

318
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,743
You guys, he's beautiful.

319
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,329
Aw, thanks, Pheebs.

320
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,673
No shouting,
but we still need a name for this little guy.

321
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,717
How about Ben?

322
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,011
I like Ben.

323
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,557
Ben.

324
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,935
- Ha, ha. Ben's good.
- Yeah?

325
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,187
How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

326
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,440
- We, uh, just cooked it up.
- Ha, ha.

327
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,777
That's what we were off doing.

328
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,029
- Hi.
- Hey.

329
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,782
- Can we come in?
- Yeah, come in. Come in.

330
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,749
I know. I know.

331
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,752
Everybody,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

332
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,921
Yeah. This is Ben.

333
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,673
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Ben.

334
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,634
- Ben, this is everybody.
- Hey, Ben.

335
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,637
Susan, he looks just like you.

336
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,808
Thanks. Ha, ha.

337
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,312
Oh, God, I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

338
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,981
I know. I still am one of these.

339
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,818
- Ross?
- Yeah?

340
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,528
Can I?

341
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:03,034
Okay, the head, the head. You gotta...

342
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,374
Hi, Ben. Hi.

343
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,336
I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes, I am.

344
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,255
I'm your Aunt Monica.

345
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,508
I...

346
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,054
I will always have gum.

347
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,268
Ben...

348
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,772
...I want you to know
that there may be some times...

349
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,650
...when I may not be around...

350
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,401
...like this.

351
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,949
But I'll still always come back...

352
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,576
...like this.

353
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,539
And sometimes I may be away longer...

354
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,375
...like this.

355
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,464
But I'll still always come back...

356
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,843
...like this.

357
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:09,016
And sometimes I'll want you to steal third,
and I'll go like this.

358
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,610
Oh, he is so amazing.

359
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,238
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

360
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,950
Ben.

361
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,785
Hey, Ben.

362
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,664
Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

363
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,876
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.

364
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,921
Oh, look, he's opening his eyes.

365
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,551
He doesn't do much, does he?

366
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,554
Nope, this is pretty much it.

367
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,981
- You guys wanna get some coffee?
- Yeah.

368
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,984
All right, I'll see you guys later.

369
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,703
Hi, Ben.

370
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,789
- I love you.
- Hi, Ben.

371
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,561
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
