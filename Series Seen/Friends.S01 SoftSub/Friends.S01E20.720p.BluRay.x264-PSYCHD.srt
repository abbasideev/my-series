1
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:06,338
I can't believe
you would actually say that.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,842
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,053
No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right?

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,848
He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,769
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,022
They're crazy.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,568
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,778
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.

9
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,992
I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,453
Oh, that is so sick.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,371
I feel violated.

12
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,290
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,083
How can people do that?

14
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,505
Oh, you guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

15
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,521
I'm telling you, years from now,
school children will study it...

16
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,690
...as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,734
It was unbelievable.

18
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,904
We could totally be ourselves.
We didn't have to play any games.

19
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,533
- So have you called her yet?
- Let her know I like her? Are you insane?

20
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,576
Guys. It's gross.

21
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,454
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

22
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,039
I'm right. Right?

23
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,791
- Let her dangle.
- Yeah, definitely.

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,042
Oh.

25
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,753
I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me...

26
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,839
...to find one of you people.

27
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,716
God. Come on. Just do it.

28
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,387
Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.

29
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,307
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

30
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,232
- I got her machine.
- Her answering machine?

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,776
No, interestingly enough,
her leaf blower picked up.

32
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,740
So, um, why didn't you say anything?

33
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,827
Oh, no, no, no. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...

34
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,580
...I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."

35
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,460
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
No, no, don't everybody look at once.

36
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,714
- Okay, okay. What's going on?
- Okay, they're just talking.

37
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,549
Yeah, well, does he look upset?

38
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,260
Does he look like
he was just told to shove anything?

39
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,639
No. No, actually, he's smiling.

40
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,100
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

41
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,268
What? What? What?

42
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,813
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

43
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,357
Oh.

44
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,361
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

45
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,946
Oh.

46
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,451
- See? Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

47
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,286
How'd it go?

48
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,332
You know, it was, uh...
It was actually really great.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,417
Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,004
I had that chicken, you know,
where you poke it and butter squirts out.

51
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,256
Not a good day for birds.

52
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,175
And then we took a walk to Bendel's.

53
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,137
And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.

54
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,725
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...

55
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,313
...to stop calling, stop sending you flowers
and to generally leave you alone, huh?

56
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,651
Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

57
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,946
Oh, it was just so nice to see him again,
you know? It was...

58
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,491
It was comfortable and it was familiar.

59
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,201
It was just nice.

60
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,995
That's "nice" twice.

61
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,331
Rachel, what's going on?

62
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,959
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?

63
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,835
Duh. Where have you been?

64
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,714
Yeah, but it was different with him today.

65
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,759
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy,
you know?

66
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,680
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

67
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,266
Yes.

68
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,978
- Why?
- I have my reasons.

69
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,066
Okay, how about the fact that
he's engaged to another woman...

70
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,318
...who just happens to be
your ex-best friend?

71
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,571
All right. All right, all right, all right.
I know it's stupid.

72
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,075
I'll go see him this afternoon
and I will just put an end to it.

73
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,910
Wow.

74
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,455
- Wow.
- Ha, ha.

75
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,040
Yeah.

76
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,544
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

77
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,422
No, it wasn't.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,678
Oh. It was so nice
having this little sink here.

79
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,394
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,274
Give me a call when you get a chance."

81
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,320
Bye-bye.

82
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,363
Oh, God.

83
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,535
That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,871
Hey, I've been honing.

85
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,998
What was with the dishes?

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,168
Oh, uh, I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant...

87
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,463
...you know,
I might have some kind of life.

88
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,966
Like I haven't been sitting around here
honing for the last two hours?

89
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,552
He's doing it again.
The guy with the telescope.

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,429
Oh, my God.

91
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:52,934
Oh. Go away.
Stop looking in here!

92
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,729
Great. Now he's waving back.

93
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,815
We gotta do something
about that guy.

94
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,318
This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment.

95
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,112
It creeps me out. I feel like I can't do stuff.

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,240
What kind of stuff?

97
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,870
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...

98
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,664
...but, like, when I'm cooking naked.

99
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,377
You cook naked?

100
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,713
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

101
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,719
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

102
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,640
What's the matter?

103
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,060
Oh, I just...
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

104
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,188
No, it was. It was very, very good.

105
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,942
- What about Mindy?
- Oh, way better than Mindy.

106
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,947
No, not that.
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

107
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,492
Oh. If you want,
I'll just break it off with her.

108
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,993
No. No, no, no.

109
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,621
No, don't do that. Not for me.

110
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,375
Dr. Farber,
Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

111
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,127
Thanks, Bernice.

112
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,879
Let's go away this weekend.

113
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,340
Oh, Barry. Come on. This is all way too...

114
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,134
No, we can go to Aruba.

115
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,096
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...

116
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,266
...it was, uh... It was really nice.
You would've liked it.

117
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,645
I had a bra.

118
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,991
Hey, Dr. Farber.

119
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,411
All right, Miss Green,
everything looks fine.

120
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,956
Yep, I think we're starting to see
some real progress here.

121
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,880
- What?
- I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

122
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,100
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

123
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,895
Uh, but for future reference,
um, that thing in your hand...

124
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,189
...can also be used as a phone.

125
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,569
Yes, it's working.

126
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,281
Why isn't she calling me back?

127
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,366
Maybe she never got your message.

128
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,995
You know, you could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...

129
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,998
...that means she probably
didn't get her messages yet.

130
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,960
- You don't think that makes me seem...?
- Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

131
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,422
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.

132
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,011
- How many beeps?
- She answered.

133
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,183
You see, this is where you'd use
that "hello" word we talked about.

134
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,186
I'm not going to.
She obviously got my message...

135
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,232
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

136
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,985
God, I miss just being needy.

137
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,404
Hey.

138
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,198
So how'd he take it?

139
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,784
Pretty well, actually.

140
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,831
Uh, Rach. How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

141
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,668
Oh, do I?

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,548
We ended up having sex in his chair.

143
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,050
You had sex in his chair?

144
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,558
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?

145
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,936
You had what?

146
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,814
Sex in his chair.

147
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,609
What?

148
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,194
What were you thinking?

149
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,489
I don't know.
I mean, we still care about each other.

150
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,742
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

151
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,953
No. No, no.

152
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,706
It's nothing like me and Carol.

153
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,918
Please. If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...

154
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,379
...right here, right now,"
what would you say?

155
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,967
If it helps I could slide over.

156
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,972
It's a totally different situation.

157
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,559
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians...

158
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,269
I gotta go.

159
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,814
- Where are you going?
- I just have to go, all right?

160
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,359
Do I need a reason, huh?
I have things to do with my life.

161
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,695
I have a jam-packed schedule.

162
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,949
And I am late for keeping up with it,
okay?

163
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,912
Hello? Hello?

164
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,794
Hello?

165
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,006
Huh. Mindy.

166
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,426
Hi. Hey, how are you?

167
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,597
Yes, yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.

168
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,141
Really, oh, God...

169
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,018
Okay.

170
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,645
Okay, I'm working tomorrow...

171
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,148
...but if you want,
you can come by if you'd like.

172
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,858
Okay.

173
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,487
Great.

174
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,863
All right.

175
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,574
So I'll see you tomorrow.

176
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,951
Okay. Bye.

177
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,705
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

178
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,292
So how's Mindy?

179
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,754
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow.

180
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,799
Oh, she sounded really weird.
I gotta call Barry.

181
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,430
Hi, it's me. I just... Ha! Mindy.

182
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,600
Mindy. Hi.

183
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,352
No, I figured that's where you'd be.

184
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,371
Hell is filled with people like you.

185
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,209
He's back. The peeper's back.

186
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,129
- Get down.
- Get down?

187
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,880
And boogie.

188
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,344
Thanks, but I gotta go to work
and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

189
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,221
Relax. She may not even know.

190
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,850
Please, I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.

191
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,102
I mean, what else is it about?

192
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,312
She was my best friend, you guys.

193
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,231
We went to camp together...

194
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,651
...she taught me how to kiss...
- Yeah?

195
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,197
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.

196
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,284
- Ugh, I feel so...
- Naughty.

197
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,788
- I'll see you guys later.
- I'll walk out with you.

198
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,458
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp...

199
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,753
...and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or...?

200
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,715
That's fine, yeah.

201
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,343
Okay, I'm gonna go the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

202
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,471
- Why don't you just take it with you?
- Hey.

203
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,682
We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?

204
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,517
Why don't you just call her?

205
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,896
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.

206
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,898
- Do you?
- No.

207
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,947
Danielle, hi.

208
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,158
Hi, it's Chandler.

209
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,619
I'm fine. Ahem.

210
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,370
Uh, listen...

211
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,249
I don't know if you tried to call me
because, uh, idiot that I am...

212
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,044
...I accidentally shut off my phone.

213
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:22,425
Ahem. Oh, okay. That's fine.
That's great. Okay.

214
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,762
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

215
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,725
She's on the other line,
gonna call me back.

216
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,228
- Don't you have to pee?
- That's why I'm dancing.

217
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,819
- Mindy.
- Hey, you.

218
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,987
Hey, you.

219
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,159
So, what's up?

220
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,579
Um, we should really be sitting for this.

221
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,039
Hmm.

222
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,124
Sure we should.

223
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,303
- So...
- Now, I know things have been weird lately.

224
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,682
But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer...

225
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,350
...who I don't talk to anymore...

226
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,103
...because she's bitter
that she lost the weight...

227
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,772
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

228
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,236
Okay, I'm gonna just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

229
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,946
Okay.

230
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,825
Will you be my maid of honor?

231
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,873
- Of course!
- Oh, that's so great!

232
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,875
It is! It is!

233
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,837
- Is that all you wanted to ask?
- That's all.

234
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,551
What? What?

235
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,219
That's not all.

236
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,557
- Oh, sure it is.
- Oh, no, it isn't. No.

237
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,227
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

238
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,772
What would make you think that?

239
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,984
Well, ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.

240
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,821
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.

241
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,700
Really?

242
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,621
Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better...

243
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,333
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.

244
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,835
Oh, God.
You see, that's what I was afraid of.

245
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,923
- What? What's what you were afraid of?
- Okay, okay.

246
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,928
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I...

247
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,890
...kind of had a little thing on the side.

248
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,060
- What?
- I know, I know.

249
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,479
When he proposed to me,
everyone said, "Don't do it.

250
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,524
He's gonna do to you what he did
to Rachel." And now I feel so stupid.

251
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,443
Ha, ha.

252
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,821
Hmm. Oh, Mindy.

253
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,490
Oh, you are so stupid.

254
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,119
Oh, we are both so stupid.

255
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,663
What do you mean?

256
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,709
- Smell familiar?
- Oh, no.

257
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,211
Mm-hm.

258
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,380
Oh, I'm so sorry.

259
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,341
Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.

260
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,843
No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.

261
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,401
Oh, my.

262
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,989
Four letters, "circle or hoop."

263
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,532
Ring, damn it, ring.

264
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,242
Thanks.

265
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,788
You know our phone's not working?

266
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,456
What?

267
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,419
I tried to call you from the coffee shop.
There was no answer.

268
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,212
I turned it off.

269
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,965
Mother of God, I turned it off.

270
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,633
Just like you told her you did.

271
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,220
Just pointing out the irony.

272
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,433
So listen, I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.

273
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,394
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

274
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,481
Can I use your phone?

275
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,904
Yeah, the number
for a Sidney Marks, please.

276
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,823
"Heating device."

277
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,200
Radiator.

278
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,994
Five letters.

279
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,829
"Rdtor."

280
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,627
Yeah, is Sidney there?

281
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh, this is?

282
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,966
- Sidney's a woman.
- So she's a woman, so what?

283
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,469
Yeah, yeah, so what?

284
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,345
Look, I live across the street...

285
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,806
...and I know all about you
and your telescope.

286
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,933
And I don't appreciate it, okay?

287
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,895
Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?

288
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,190
Look, if I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear...

289
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,276
...I shouldn't have to feel like...
Thank you.

290
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,073
That's not really the point.

291
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,866
The point is, that...

292
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,911
- Mostly free-weights, but occasionally...
- Joey.

293
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,665
Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette.

294
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,753
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

295
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,507
The green dress? Really?

296
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,343
She said you looked like Ingrid Bergman
that day.

297
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,054
Heh. No.

298
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

299
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,270
- You got a second?
- Sure, sure.

300
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,897
Come on...

301
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,357
...in.

302
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,817
Hello, sweetheart.

303
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,405
- What you guys doing here?
- Uh, we are here to break up with you.

304
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,908
Both of you?

305
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,329
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

306
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,126
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.

307
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,753
I'm an idiot. I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

308
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,006
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

309
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,761
Uh, which one of us
are you talking to there, Bar?

310
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,555
Um...

311
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,932
Mindy.

312
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,810
Mindy, of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

313
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,479
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

314
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,358
I swear, look, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

315
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,402
Oh, please.

316
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,947
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

317
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,198
You did it twice?

318
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,827
Well, the first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

319
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,704
Oh, right.

320
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,831
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look...

321
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,916
Just give me another chance, okay?

322
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,128
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

323
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,298
What do you say?

324
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,426
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.

325
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,220
Jason Castalano's
choking on his retainer.

326
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,265
Oh, God. Uh, I'll be right there, Bernice.

327
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,726
Look, please,
please don't go anywhere, okay?

328
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,062
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

329
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,232
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.

330
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,153
See how he was sweating
when he walked out of here?

331
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,697
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

332
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,576
...and take a couple of punches.
Because I'm telling you, this feels great.

333
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,622
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

334
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,917
What are you talking about?

335
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,878
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

336
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,214
He is Satan in a smock.

337
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,883
Look, I know he's not perfect.

338
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,972
But the truth is,
at the end of the day...

339
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,600
...I still really wanna be...

340
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,395
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

341
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,689
...D.D.S.

342
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,858
Oh, God.

343
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,737
I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

344
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,365
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

345
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,702
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

346
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,503
You okay?

347
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,296
Yeah.

348
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,590
Really?

349
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,592
Yeah.

350
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,512
You know, ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

351
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,640
...I have wondered
whether I made the right choice.

352
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,059
Oh. And now I know.

353
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,853
I'm so glad.

354
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,776
Big day.

355
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,621
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

356
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,833
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat...

357
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,876
Did you know he's gay?

358
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,092
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

359
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,054
- Chandler?
- Danielle, hi.

360
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,765
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

361
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,142
Hi.

362
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,728
- What are you doing here?
- I've been calling you...

363
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,938
...but it turns out
I had your number wrong.

364
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,442
And when I finally got the right one
from Information, there was no answer.

365
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,611
So I thought I'd just come down here
and make sure you were okay.

366
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,406
Oh, uh, I'm okay.

367
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,117
Listen, uh, maybe we could
get together later?

368
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,620
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

369
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,955
- You know.
- Ha, ha.

370
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,498
- You got it.
- Okay.

371
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,584
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye.

372
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,046
Woo-hoo! Yeah, there you go.

373
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,006
Second date.

374
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,924
I don't know.

375
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,301
You don't know?

376
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,221
Oh, she seems nice, but that thing
about her coming all the way here...

377
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,808
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
