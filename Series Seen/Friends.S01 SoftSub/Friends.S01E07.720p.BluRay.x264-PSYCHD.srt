1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:06,130
Everybody. Shh. Uh, Central Perk
is proud to present...

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:10,300
...the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,846
Thanks.

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,891
Hi. Um, I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment...

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,729
...when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,689
Okay, here we go.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,362
Okay. Thank you very much.

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,995
What...?

9
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,544
Oh, great. This is just...

10
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,936
This is so cool, you guys.

11
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,230
The entire city's blacked out.

12
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,982
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens...

13
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,110
...and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.

14
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,278
- Wow.
- You guys, this is big.

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,823
Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,825
Who will I meet in a blackout?

17
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,704
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

18
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,998
Can we talk about this later? Okay.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,126
Can I borrow the phone?

20
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,629
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

21
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,381
What's my number?

22
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,009
I never call me.

23
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,304
Oh, my God. It's her.

24
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,473
It's that Victoria Secret model.

25
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,058
Something Goodacre.

26
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,643
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

27
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,312
She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.

28
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,439
Oh, my God.

29
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,527
I am trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

30
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,739
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium?

31
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,910
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.

32
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,874
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,042
Jill says vestibule...

34
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,503
...I'm going with vestibule.

35
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,463
I'm fine.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,674
No, I'm not alone.

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,718
I don't know. Some guy.

38
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,181
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,100
Hey, Jill, I saw you
with some guy last night.

40
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,103
Yes, he was some guy.

41
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,031
Hey, everyone.

42
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,290
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

43
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:37,007
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have...

44
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,467
...so happy Hanukkah.

45
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,847
Ooh, look. Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

46
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,976
Ooh.

47
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,478
Oh!

48
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,232
Ooh. That had to hurt.

49
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,653
All right, all right.
It's been 14 and a half minutes...

50
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,697
...and you still haven't said
one word. Oh, God.

51
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,701
Do something.
Just make contact. Smile.

52
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,831
There you go.

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,796
You're definitely scaring her.

54
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,590
Uh, would you like to call somebody?

55
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,636
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.

56
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,726
Yeah, thanks.

57
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,147
Hello?

58
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,316
- It's me.
- It's Chandler.

59
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,609
Are you okay?

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,319
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,490
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule...

62
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,786
...with Jill Goodacre.

63
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,496
What?

64
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,623
I'm stuck...

65
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,043
...in an ATM vestibule...

66
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,462
...with Jill Goodacre.

67
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,632
I have no idea what you said.

68
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,759
Put Joey on the phone.

69
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,014
What's up, man?

70
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,557
I'm stuck...

71
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,893
...in an ATM vestibule...

72
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,188
...with Jill Goodacre.

73
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,524
Oh, my God.

74
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,069
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

75
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,239
Chandler, listen.

76
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,038
Yeah, like that thought
never entered my mind.

77
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,001
Come on, somebody.

78
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,544
I'll go. I'll go.

79
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,965
Okay, um, senior year of college,
on a pool table.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,675
- Ooh.
- Pool table?

81
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,635
That's my sister.

82
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,640
Okay, okay.
My weirdest place would have to be...

83
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,437
...the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.

84
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,565
Oh, my God. What were you
doing in a library?

85
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,613
- Pheebs, what about you?
- Oh, um, Milwaukee.

86
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,744
Uh, Ross?

87
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,832
Disneyland, 1989.
"It's a small world after all."

88
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,294
No way.

89
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,879
The, uh, ride broke down...

90
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,217
...so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.

91
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:31,098
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

92
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,433
Ooh. Rachel?

93
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,851
I already went.

94
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,978
- You did not go.
- Yes, I did.

95
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,772
Tell us. Come on.

96
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,819
All right, uh, the weirdest place
would have to be...

97
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,198
...the foot of the bed.

98
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,494
- Step back.
- We have a winner.

99
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,921
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

100
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,259
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.

101
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,807
It was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,604
Well, Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature-golf course.

103
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,022
- Come on.
- No.

104
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,608
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.

105
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,653
And you didn't marry him because?

106
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,117
Do you think there are people
that go through life...

107
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,786
...never having that kind of?

108
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,621
- Probably.
- Really?

109
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,167
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

110
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,877
- Yeah, right.
- It is.

111
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,838
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

112
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,885
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and, uh...

113
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,095
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

114
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,646
For all those people who miss out
on that, uh, passion thing...

115
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,482
...there's other good stuff.

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,359
Okay.

117
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,820
But, um, I don't think that'll be you.

118
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,072
- You don't?
- Mm-mm.

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,283
See, I see, uh...

120
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,702
...big passion in your future.

121
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,496
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

122
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,039
- You do?
- I do.

123
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,208
Ross, you're so great.

124
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,634
Ah.

125
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,554
It's never gonna happen.

126
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,522
- What?
- You and Rachel.

127
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,949
Why not?

128
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,495
Because you waited too long
to make your move...

129
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,665
...and now you're in the "Friend Zone."

130
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,751
No, no, no.
I'm not in the Zone.

131
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,045
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.

132
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,466
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

133
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,552
I'm laying the groundwork.

134
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,346
Every day I get
a little bit closer to, uh...

135
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,722
Priesthood.

136
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,353
Ross, I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

137
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,816
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.

138
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,526
I will, I will.

139
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,112
I'm waiting for the, uh, right moment.

140
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,074
What?

141
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,952
- What, now?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,038
What's messing you up?
The wine?

143
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,041
The candles? The moonlight? Huh?

144
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,795
You gotta go up to her and say,
"Look, Rachel, I think..."

145
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,171
- Shh!
- Shh!

146
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,674
- What are we shushing?
- We're shushing...

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,386
...because we're trying to
hear something.

148
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,056
- What?
- Uh, don't you hear that?

149
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,436
Ah.

150
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,730
- See?
- Huh.

151
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,195
- Would you like some gum?
- Oh. Is it sugarless?

152
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,867
- Uh, sorry, it's not.
- Then, no, thanks.

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,620
What the hell was that?

154
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,000
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.

155
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,338
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it.

156
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,885
New York City has no power

157
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,722
And the milk is getting sour

158
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,309
But to me it is not scary

159
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,647
'Cause I stay away from dairy

160
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,234
La-la
La-la-la-la-la

161
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,282
- Here goes.
- You'll do it?

162
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,950
- I'll do it.
- Want help?

163
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,453
You come out there,
you're a dead man.

164
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,038
Ross, Ross.

165
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,123
Good luck, man.

166
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,292
Thanks.

167
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,255
- Okay.
- Okay.

168
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,178
- Where you going?
- Outside.

169
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,388
You can't go out there.

170
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,266
- Why not?
- Because of, uh, the reason.

171
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,353
And that would be?

172
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,855
I, uh... I can't tell you.

173
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,190
What's going on?

174
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,946
Okay, listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

175
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,032
- About what?
- He's planning your birthday party.

176
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,577
Oh, my God. I love him.

177
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,287
You better act surprised.

178
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,832
- About what?
- My surprise party.

179
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,086
- What surprise party?
- Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

180
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,213
Well, he didn't tell me.

181
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,758
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.

182
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,303
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.

183
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,223
- You are not. We tell you stuff.
- Uh-huh.

184
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:10,019
I was the last one to know when Chandler
got bit by the peacock at the zoo.

185
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,815
I was the last to know you had a crush
on Joey when he was moving in.

186
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,525
What?

187
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,820
Oh. Looks like I was second to last.

188
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,244
It's so nice.

189
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,709
Hey, I have a question.

190
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,921
Uh, actually, it's not
so much a question...

191
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,799
...it's more of a general wondering...

192
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,093
...ment.

193
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,721
- Okay.
- Okay.

194
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,890
Here goes.

195
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:53,354
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um...

196
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,191
- Oh.
- Yes, that's right.

197
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,735
Look at that little kitty.

198
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,028
What?

199
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:06,951
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation

200
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:12,332
And the only explanation I can find

201
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,712
Is the love that I found
Ever since you've been around

202
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,342
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

203
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,386
Ow. Ow.

204
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,972
Sorry, that was wax.

205
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,269
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.

206
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,855
Why not put "poor little Tootie"
in the hall?

207
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,776
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

208
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,027
Yeah?

209
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,783
You know, on second thought,
gum would be perfection.

210
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,869
Gum would be perfection?

211
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,248
Gum would be perfection.

212
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,043
Could've said, "Gum would be nice."
"I'll have a stick." But, no.

213
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,505
For me, gum is perfection.

214
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,467
I loathe myself.

215
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,222
Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?

216
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,099
Oh.

217
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,773
Hi. We just found this cat...

218
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,525
...and we're looking for the owner.

219
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,152
Um, yeah, it's, uh... It's mine.

220
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,156
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?

221
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,158
Yeah. It's my cat. Give me my cat.

222
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,828
Wait a minute. What's his name?

223
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,872
Um, Bob... Buttons.

224
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,791
- Bob Buttons?
- Uh-huh.

225
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,877
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.

226
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,670
Oh!

227
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,506
You are a very bad man.

228
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,634
You owe me a cat.

229
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,891
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

230
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,934
Here, kitty, kitty.

231
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,896
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty, kitty?

232
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,942
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

233
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,031
Hi.

234
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,035
Wow.

235
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,081
Come on, lucky sixes.

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,752
Everybody, this is Paolo.

237
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,338
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.

238
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,424
- This is Monica...
- Hi.

239
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,843
- ...and Joey...
- Hi.

240
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,555
- ...and Ross.
- Hi.

241
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,064
Ha, ha. He doesn't speak much English.

242
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,192
Monopoly.

243
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,445
Look at that.

244
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,781
So, uh...

245
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,158
Where did, uh, Paolo come from?

246
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,702
Italy, I think. Heh.

247
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,873
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?

248
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,337
The cat turned out to be
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?

249
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,425
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.

250
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,307
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

251
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,977
Oh, I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.

252
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,563
Ah. Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

253
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,943
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?

254
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,946
Oh. Paolo, this is Phoebe.

255
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,786
You betcha.

256
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,584
All right. Okay. What next?

257
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,753
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

258
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,924
It's got a, uh, boyish charm.
It's impish.

259
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,551
Here we go.

260
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,689
Nice going, imp.

261
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,942
Okay. It's okay. All I need to do is...

262
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:12,613
...reach over and put it
back in my mouth.

263
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,077
Good save.
We're back on track and I'm...

264
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,456
...chewing someone else's gum.

265
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,333
This is not my gum.

266
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,419
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

267
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,297
And now you're choking.

268
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,341
Are you all right?

269
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,387
Oh, my God.
You're choking.

270
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,852
Better?

271
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,312
Yes.

272
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,397
Thank you. That was...

273
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,899
That was...

274
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,567
Perfection?

275
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,133
What'd he say that was so funny?

276
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,053
I have absolutely no idea.

277
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,472
That's classic.

278
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,682
My God, you guys.
What am I doing?

279
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,768
This is so un-me.

280
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,520
If you want, I'll do it.

281
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,525
I know. I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

282
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,902
But I won't.

283
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,239
God. The first time he smiled at me...

284
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,576
...those three seconds were more exciting
than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.

285
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,203
Did you rent mopeds?

286
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,832
Because I've heard...

287
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,709
Oh, it's not about that right now. Okay.

288
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,922
I know it's totally superficial,
and we have nothing in common...

289
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,675
...and we don't even speak
the same language...

290
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,385
...but, God.

291
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,558
Paolo, hi.

292
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,269
- Ross.
- Listen, uh...

293
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,568
Listen, um, heh,
something you should, uh, know.

294
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,946
Rachel and I are...

295
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,615
We're kind of a thing.

296
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,785
- Thing?
- Thing. Yes, thing.

297
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,288
- You have the sex?
- No.

298
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:32,545
No, no. Um, technically,
the sex is not being had. But that's, uh...

299
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,714
That's not the point.

300
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,927
The point is that, uh,
Rachel and I should be, uh...

301
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,389
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.

302
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,474
And if you get in the, uh...

303
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,351
- In bed?
- No.

304
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,480
Ha. No, not where I was going.

305
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,652
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...

306
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,739
...then, uh, I would be, well, very sad.

307
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,532
Oh.

308
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,950
So do you, um?

309
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,376
- You do know a little English?
- Little.

310
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,213
Do you know the word crap-weasel?

311
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,301
No? That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.

312
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,227
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.

313
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,728
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

314
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,359
Okay? Now try it.

315
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,695
You gotta whip it.

316
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,454
Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.

317
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,875
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

318
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:57,505
...minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48...

319
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,758
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

320
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,971
Kind of spooky without any lights.

321
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,147
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

322
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,869
Uh, Ross...

323
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,539
This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...

324
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,333
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

325
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,677
- This has been fun.
- Yes.

326
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,306
Yes. Thanks for, uh, letting me
use your phone...

327
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,599
...and for saving my life.

328
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,602
Well, goodbye, Chandler.

329
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,855
I had a great blackout.

330
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,065
See you.

331
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:19,545
Hi. Um, I'm account number 7143457.
And I don't know if you got any of that...

332
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,299
...but I would really
like a copy of the tape.
