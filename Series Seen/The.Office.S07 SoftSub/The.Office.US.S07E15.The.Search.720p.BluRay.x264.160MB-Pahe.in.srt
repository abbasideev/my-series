1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,103
Everybody, can I please
have your attention?

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,066
Ryan and I have
a huge announcement.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,506
- Oh, my gosh!
- Wow.

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:12,342
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey
Howard and I got divorced.

5
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,274
Sweet.
Free ring.

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,884
Divorced? Just so you know,
it's totally amicable.

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,785
We're fine. We don't need
people here to take sides.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,982
The last thing that we
want is any kind of drama.

9
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,284
Wait, I... Can you back up?
What's the story?

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,295
We were having a beautiful
weekend in the Poconos.

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,228
We were making
love constantly.

12
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,960
We saw the sun rise, and
Ryan was crying a lot.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,467
That's not a relevant detail.
And in the morning,

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,026
we walked
by a chapel,

15
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,696
and we stopped suddenly,
and Ryan said,

16
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,764
"I don't think I should be
married to you anymore."

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,274
Wait... Sorry, when
did you get married?

18
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,610
Um, like, a week ago. We got really
wasted, and it just felt right.

19
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,082
And you didn't
invite any of us?

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,880
We are getting
divorced, Andy!

21
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,080
This is such a raw time.

22
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,089
God, baby, you know, with
people's reactions to this,

23
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,715
I wonder if we
made a mistake.

24
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,484
No, with the messed
up laws in this country,

25
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,793
I don't want to be married
until everyone can be married.

26
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,025
You know what, Ryan?

27
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,691
I talked to the
other gay guys,

28
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,066
and we're okay with it. We all agreed
it's fine for you to get married.

29
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,004
No. No, Oscar.
Not until everyone can.

30
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,433
Ryan,
I changed my mind.

31
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:14,597
Okay, fine.
You know what?

32
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,109
This actually isn't
amicable at all,

33
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,441
and we actually do need
people to take sides.

34
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,536
Who's on my side?

35
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,146
And who is on my side?

36
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,140
All right, bye.
Bye.

37
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,907
Let's go.
Just a minute!

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,211
How long do we have to wait?
For what?

39
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,983
You broke up with
A.J. weeks ago.

40
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,013
Don't you have a
sales call to go on?

41
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,679
I don't understand.
I really don't.

42
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,849
I mean, we know we're gonna start dating.
Why not now?

43
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,358
We don't know that.
Sure we do.

44
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,917
Why is it such a certainty that
we're supposed to be together?

45
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,759
Why does the sun
rise in the morning?

46
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,594
Why do magnets
stick together?

47
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,998
Because everybody
says so. Everybody.

48
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,434
Michael, I can't keep
getting into a situation

49
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,768
where I date whoever
I'm working with.

50
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,464
Well, you could
understand that.

51
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,475
Yeah, I understand.
I just don't agree.

52
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,102
Well, you don't have to agree.
Yes, I do.

53
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,813
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

54
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,247
No, you can have
your own opinion,

55
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,579
and I can have mine. I
have my own opinion,

56
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,916
and my opinion is
to disagree with you.

57
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,319
He's gonna be a lot of fun to
drive around in a car with.

58
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,051
Oh, you'll get
through it, hon.

59
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:40,060
Just make a game out of it.
A funny Jim game.

60
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,587
That's it?
That's all I get?

61
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,190
Even after all the hard work I put
into celebrating your talent today.

62
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,261
All right,
what'd you do?

63
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, those things that
you consider doodles,

64
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,798
I consider art.

65
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,876
Where'd you put it?
Where'd I put what?

66
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,809
Let's go.
Oh, sorry. I gotta go.

67
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,210
Say it. Where?
Okay, fine.

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,444
Three hints. One, when you're getting
colder, you're really getting warmer.

69
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,917
The fridge.
Two!

70
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,648
You have a better chance
if you think Bob Vance.

71
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,087
The fridge, got it.
And the final clue...

72
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,954
Let's go! You know what?
Just think about it.

73
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,822
You'll be fine.
Bye.

74
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,524
Holly is ruining
Michael's life.

75
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,356
He thinks she's
so special.

76
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,596
And she's so not.

77
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,162
Her personality is like a three,
her sense of humor is a two,

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,732
her ears are like
a seven and a four.

79
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,678
Add it all up,
and what do you get? 16.

80
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,908
And he treats her
like she's a perfect 40.

81
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,313
It's nuts.

82
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,290
Cheer up.
We made a sale.

83
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,121
Just drive faster.
I wanna get back.

84
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,391
Well, I'm going the speed limit.
Okay, fine.

85
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,964
My feelings don't
matter to you.

86
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,091
What matters to you is
your precious speed limit.

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,890
Someone's in a bad mood.

88
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,368
No, I'm not.

89
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,670
I'm not in
a bad mood.

90
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,669
I'm not,
Jim. Hello?

91
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,680
Okay, fine, ignore me.
Have it your way.

92
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,343
Let's just talk
about you as always.

93
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,414
Sex different after
the baby, Jim?

94
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,683
All right, let me turn on some music.
I need to pee!

95
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,055
No, you don't. Yeah, I do.
My word against yours.

96
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,616
All right, well, we'll
be there in 10 minutes.

97
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:23,494
What part of "I need to
pee" do you not understand?

98
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,555
I'm upset,
my bladder is full,

99
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,932
there is no telling what
I might do right now

100
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,733
all over the inside of
your precious little car.

101
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,274
All right. Well, if I see a
gas station, I'll pull over.

102
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,207
Well, I hope
I make it.

103
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,208
Hello?
Hi, Jim, it's Helene.

104
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,275
Hey, Helene.
Is everything okay?

105
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,217
Everything's fine.
Baby's fine.

106
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,687
She has a tiny fever. I'm
taking her for a checkup.

107
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,916
Nothing to worry about.

108
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,549
Okay.

109
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,891
A tiny thing. I locked
her in the car.

110
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,951
What?

111
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,964
She's smiling. She's happy.
 Oh, my God.

112
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,398
Jim, I don't have a spare key.
 Oh, my God.

113
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,368
Just stay there. I'll
be there in one second.

114
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,665
Michael!

115
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,035
Michael!

116
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,568
Excuse me, sir, there's a...
There's a guy in the bathroom.

117
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,806
He's coming out, but I have to
go, 'cause it's an emergency.

118
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,370
Will you just tell him
to call the office?

119
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,279
Just call...
Call the office.

120
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,011
Thank you! Please?

121
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,085
Hello?

122
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,077
- This is Pam.
- Hey, it's me.

123
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,316
So, don't worry.
Everything's okay.

124
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,358
What's wrong? Nothing,
absolutely nothing.

125
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,451
But you're not holding a cup of
coffee or anything, are you?

126
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,191
Jim, what? Uh, okay. So, Cece
had a little bit of a fever,

127
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,290
and your mom also
locked her in the car.

128
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,198
Oh, God. What? No,
no, no, it's okay.

129
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,568
So, Cece's with Daddy now, and
she is laughing and she's happy,

130
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,197
and we're on our way
to see Dr. Barbara.

131
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,571
Okay, so she's okay?

132
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,201
Yes, and your mom got a
very well-deserved day off.

133
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,681
So, here's the thing, though, I left
Michael at the gas station on Bennett.

134
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,807
Understood.

135
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,977
And his wallet and phone are
on the seat next to me.

136
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,212
Got it.

137
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,152
I will put
out an A.P.B.,

138
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,214
otherwise known as
an "Ask Pam Beesly."

139
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,387
Did the phone cut out? Nope.

140
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,898
All right, just call me
after the doctor. Okay.

141
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,228
All right, bye.
Bye.

142
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,162
I know, I know. You have a phone policy.
I understand.

143
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,001
But this is an emergency,
because my friend isn't here,

144
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,634
and I'm worried that
he has been abducted.

145
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,936
No.
And...

146
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,640
No, he ditched you, man.
I saw him drive away.

147
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,341
There's no way
he ditched me.

148
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,713
There's no way
that happened.

149
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,753
He's my... Okay. May I please
just use your phone? Please?

150
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,782
Just make it quick.
Thank you. Okay.

151
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,551
I will make it quick.
I will make it very quick.

152
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,617
And you don't have my
numbers on speed dial.

153
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,097
Okay, what is it?

154
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,530
You don't know. You don't...
You know what?

155
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,569
I could dial 411,
get Jim's number...

156
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,298
He left you here
on purpose,

157
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,737
all right? I saw it.

158
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,141
He just drove away.

159
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,335
Actually,
this is good.

160
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,847
I am going to take
this opportunity

161
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,506
to go walk about.

162
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,116
Good, good.

163
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,989
No, get away.

164
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,718
No. That's enough.

165
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,851
Okay.

166
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:43,789
Okay.

167
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,294
It's the gas station on
Bennett Street? Yeah.

168
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,062
You know what? Why don't
you stay and I'll go?

169
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,694
Oh, no, no, no,
I'll be fine.

170
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,433
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood,
though. I better come along.

171
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,207
Problem solved,
everyone.

172
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,439
Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop
are off to rescue Michael.

173
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,707
Unbelievable.
I'm going.

174
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,273
You drive. I got a
car full of fox meat.

175
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:07,846
Cute.

176
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,492
Very funny, everyone.

177
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,121
Who wrote captions
under my doodle?

178
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,257
I'm not even kidding.
They're pretty good.

179
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,199
Which one in particular?
Yeah, which one?

180
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,568
Well, the first one
has a surprise factor.

181
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,504
"I'm a suck, suck,
suckity Sabre."

182
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,699
Booya!

183
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,438
No. No, no.
No, no, no.

184
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,811
But I suppose the second one
is the better written line.

185
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,941
You suppose?
What's it say?

186
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,815
"I'm supposed to
be wearing red gloves,

187
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,616
"but my color cartridge
portal got jammed again."

188
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,417
Okay. No, no,
no, no, no.

189
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,823
Gloves.
Keep it real.

190
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,088
You guys, if I knew you wanted
to do a caption contest,

191
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,652
I would have drawn something
more challenging.

192
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,756
And I will take you all down.
You?

193
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,600
I've been reading the
comics to my daughter

194
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,067
since she was
three years old.

195
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,867
Not once have I used the real
captions to Family Circus.

196
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,568
That crazy family is hilarious
to her for one reason, me.

197
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,539
It is on like Genghis Khan
wearing Sean John in Bhutan.

198
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,140
Yes. You guys,
I have the perfect idea.

199
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,481
Okay, it'll just take
me 10 minutes.

200
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,384
- All right.
- I want to do it.

201
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:19,984
Male, Caucasian, 40s, black
hair, facial type, marsupial.

202
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,120
He answers to Michael,
Michael G. Scott,

203
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,562
Michael J. Fox, Mr. Fox,
the Incredible Mr. Fox...

204
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,463
Yeah, he just left.
Which way did he go?

205
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,866
Okay, hey, hey, hey,
let me answer this.

206
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,303
Stupid question. He went back to the
office, obviously, which is that way.

207
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,173
Oh, really? You don't think he walked by
that bakery just for the smell of it?

208
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,008
She's right.
He went that way.

209
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,043
All right.

210
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,677
Don't get a swelled head.
You're no tracker.

211
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,118
Let's ride.

212
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,336
Hey, you guys.
Listen to me.

213
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,739
Don't get hung up
on just one girl,

214
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,471
because there are a lot
of other girls out there.

215
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,308
Look over there. See?

216
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,405
They look cute.

217
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,383
Hello.

218
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,612
You guys are
so beautiful.

219
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,813
You're so colorful.

220
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,086
I wish I could
understand you.

221
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,359
That's a metaphor,
I guess.

222
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,624
You are disgusting.
You'll never find love.

223
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,967
Do you think she needs more time,
or it's just never gonna happen?

224
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,162
I'm being serious.
Seriously.

225
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,536
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
 Has Michael checked in?

226
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,141
Oh, hey, Dwight. I
asked you a question.

227
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,972
No, he hasn't.
Okay, bye.

228
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,773
No, wait. Hey,
while you're out,

229
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,076
could you pick up some paper
towels and chocolate syrup?

230
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,446
We have ice cream,
so I thought we could...

231
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,916
Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
No.

232
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,816
This is a
manhunt/rescue mission.

233
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,685
Okay, I just... When you're done,
or any time it's convenient,

234
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,848
I just thought
since you're out...

235
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,415
Pam, I'm obviously gonna get that
stuff for you, so just shut up. God.

236
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,461
Okay, well, it wasn't...

237
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,194
No word from Michael.

238
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,056
Ta-daa!

239
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:13,198
Okay, it's two giant dogs
with two giant palm trees

240
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,003
on a regular-sized island.

241
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,372
Oh, I got one.
Yeah?

242
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,268
Yes. Okay, I'm sorry,

243
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,903
but I'm gonna have
to shut this down.

244
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,340
Why?

245
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,781
Unless we can all agree
to some ground rules.

246
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,476
It's either that, or
I can fax this to Jo

247
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,953
and let her decide
how to proceed.

248
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,958
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules
so we can start the game.

249
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,957
Number one, and this
should be obvious,

250
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,394
no captions that insult
the company we work for.

251
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,226
Irony is such
a critical...

252
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,960
Number two,

253
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,434
no pop
culture references.

254
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,027
Seriously?
Wow.

255
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,299
I think we can all agree
they tend to alienate those

256
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,308
who don't get the reference,
making them feel like the other.

257
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,809
Wrap it up, Gabe.

258
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,346
Okay, final thing,
and this is a fun one,

259
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,973
instead of writing the caption
directly under the picture,

260
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,216
let's all try using
Sticky Quips.

261
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,811
All right? New from
Dunder Mifflin Sabre.

262
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,825
Sticky Quips are fun. They're safe.
They're handy.

263
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,918
I like to use Sticky Quips
as regular Post-it notes

264
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,054
when I'm in
a fun mood.

265
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,495
Not every day.

266
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,328
Go get 'em.
Start quipping.

267
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,523
Hmm.

268
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,898
Pam, I think I'm
gonna send you an IM.

269
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,029
Oh, okay.

270
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,041
Send me one, too. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, put me on that.

271
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,940
- Cc.
- Ditto.

272
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,980
Hello. I would like
a hot dog, please.

273
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,608
Now, I don't have any money,

274
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,109
so here is what
I would like to do.

275
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,951
I leave you here
with my watch,

276
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,423
and I come back later
and I pay for the hot dog.

277
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,857
I'm not a pawn shop.

278
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,693
Well, I understand that,
but this is a $45 watch.

279
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,632
Wow. With that, I could
buy half the menu.

280
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,099
I can't just go giving away hot dogs.
All right.

281
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,769
What do you do with the hot
dogs that you don't sell?

282
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,364
Throw 'em away.
Well, okay,

283
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,772
instead of throwing
them all away later,

284
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,936
why don't you just throw one
away now into my mouth?

285
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,268
No.

286
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,837
Okay. You've just
lost my business.

287
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,382
Hey. Hey, you were
in there forever.

288
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,461
There's too many
brands. Where's Holly?

289
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,859
She wandered
off like an idiot.

290
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,954
Hey.
Hey.

291
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,661
What are you doing? Just
changing my cell phone plan.

292
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,896
Okay. Okay.
Here you go.

293
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,033
I'll take my free
stress ball too now.

294
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,074
Sure thing.
Here you go, Miss...

295
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,110
Okay, Fanny Smellmore.

296
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,644
Real original.
What?

297
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,146
You know what? Say hi to
Orville Tootenbacher for me.

298
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,681
Tootenbacher.

299
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,717
Orville Tootenbacher, that's
Michael's millionaire character that

300
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,219
farts popcorn.
Farts popcorn.

301
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,221
Of course.
He was here.

302
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,382
She's the key.
Amazing.

303
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,854
Holly.

304
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,555
Hey, where would
you like to go next?

305
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,425
Holly?

306
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,961
Are their egg rolls
really that big?

307
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,174
Oh, boy. That was yummy.

308
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,038
Thank you so much.

309
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,311
You know what? I think I
left my wallet in my car.

310
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,614
Do you mind if
I run out and get it?

311
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,847
No problem.
Okay.

312
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,118
I'll be right back.

313
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,397
God! Okay,
you know what?

314
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,932
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

315
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,703
I don't have my wallet.
And I was...

316
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:35,037
I was gonna try to dine and
dash, and that was stupid,

317
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,304
and I realize I can't do
that to you fine people.

318
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,640
So, you can't pay
for your food?

319
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,840
Well, I can, but I will have
to come back later tonight

320
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,610
and pay you.

321
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,948
But the point is I
did the right thing.

322
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,348
You did not.

323
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,787
You have no money, but you
dined, and you dined so much.

324
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:53,190
Well, the number three
is not such a giant feast.

325
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,920
Mr. Choo!
Okay.

326
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,553
All right.
You know what?

327
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,088
You're trying to steal food from us?
I am not.

328
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,000
I just have had
a bad day, and I...

329
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,904
Okay. I'll be back later with the money.
I'm just gonna leave right now.

330
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,203
You can't.
We'll stop you.

331
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,074
Well, I think I can
get through the door.

332
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,712
Excuse me,
do you speak English?

333
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,848
We are looking
for a man,

334
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,450
Michael, this tall,
black hair, Caucasian.

335
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,994
It's Michael!

336
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,798
He just left.

337
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,528
You knew.
What?

338
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,399
No. Dwight asked if
I wanted an egg roll.

339
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,938
What... What are
you implying?

340
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,733
Uncanny.

341
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,866
Put a pin in that.

342
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,965
Which way did he go?

343
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,404
That guy,
when he leave here,

344
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,381
which way did he go?
We looking for him.

345
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,011
This way? This way? This way?
I don't know. Do you know?

346
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,713
I think he was
heading downtown.

347
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,422
He's heading downtown.

348
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,389
So what, no one's
even gonna try?

349
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,590
Guess not.
Oh, come on.

350
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,495
My rules could not possibly
have been that oppressive.

351
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,368
You crushed
our spirits, Gabe.

352
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,169
Congrats. You're
a big man, huh?

353
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,777
Takes a lot to destroy the creativity
of a whole group of people.

354
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,380
Hey...

355
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,352
Click the "X."
I'm clicking!

356
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,294
In the box.
I am clicking.

357
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,264
Woman, you've had a computer for years!
Phyllis!

358
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,356
Too late!

359
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:45,835
Oh, huh, an IM chat. Very clever.
I'll just print that out.

360
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,102
Come on, guys.
Grow up.

361
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,835
I don't want to
be your babysitter.

362
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:15,093
"Darn it, Bob, I told you not
to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat."

363
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,799
- Nice!
- No, not nice.

364
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,305
Terrible.

365
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,399
Doesn't even include
the fact that they're dogs.

366
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,376
Do the next one.
"Wake up, Fred.

367
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,607
"The power cord on your Sabre
printer shocked you into a coma,

368
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,842
"and you're dreaming you're
a dog on a desert island."

369
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,450
Dreaming he's a dog
on an island.

370
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,313
Uh, excuse me,
excuse me.

371
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,947
How does the speaker know what
the guy in the coma is dreaming?

372
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,322
Well, if you think it's so easy,
Gabe, why don't you try it?

373
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,815
Um...

374
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,829
You don't have to sniff
my rear end anymore, Bob.

375
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,626
I'm the only
one here.

376
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:46,961
That's tasteless, Gabe.

377
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,433
Tasteless?
Tasteless.

378
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,560
More tasteless
than this?

379
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,195
"Is that a palm tree,
or did Gabe get skinnier?

380
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,637
"Either way,
let's pee on it."

381
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,532
I like that.

382
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,375
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have a winner.

383
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,074
Yes. Yes. Well done!

384
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,807
Whose is it?
Who wrote that?

385
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,946
Yeah. Who wrote it?

386
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:12,448
Please. It was easy once I decided
I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.

387
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,556
Where did he
go, Holly?

388
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,152
I have no idea.

389
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,824
Do you see a little clown
that you wanna follow, huh?

390
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,733
Is there a little bird that's chirping
to you, "This way, this way"?

391
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,395
I don't know.

392
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,665
Okay. Close your eyes.

393
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,867
We need you to think. What
is Michael seeing right now?

394
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,933
Can you tell him
that we miss him?

395
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,171
Michael, we're
coming for you!

396
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,234
Will you stop?

397
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,747
There have been a few
coincidences, that's all!

398
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,514
All right, then.

399
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,711
Someone propose a plan. Okay.

400
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,981
We fan out...
Not you, Erin.

401
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,613
Stop looking
at me like that.

402
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,854
Okay, look, let's just
go up somewhere high

403
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,793
and see if we could spot
him on the street below.

404
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,329
That is the stupidest
idea I've ever heard. No.

405
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,698
Tap into your common mind, and
tell us what he would do next.

406
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,068
Look, I'm not playing.
I'm gonna go look for him.

407
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,739
Good. We don't need her. Right.

408
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,277
I can do this on my own.
I can think like Michael.

409
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,506
All right...

410
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,981
I'm deep below the ocean's
surface in a submarine.

411
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,483
A torpedo's coming
right at me.

412
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,254
No. Damn it, that's
just my own imagination.

413
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,686
Maybe he's bowling.

414
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,755
Michael?

415
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,654
Hi.

416
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,669
How did you know
I was up here?

417
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:04,999
What are you
doing up here?

418
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,095
I got turned around.

419
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,368
I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Dunder Mifflin?

420
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,471
Yeah.

421
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,803
Wow!

422
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,008
I just miss
you so much.

423
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,850
I missed you, too.

424
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,121
Really?

425
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,555
Yeah.

426
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,392
Can I kiss you?

427
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,301
Yeah.
Okay.

428
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,282
Maybe that's not the
best one. Keep reading.

429
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,044
Yeah, it was.
Maybe it wasn't.

430
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,109
"Oh, thank God, I had
a horrible nightmare

431
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,245
"that I was stuck
in America with Gabe."

432
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,190
No, that's not the one I was thinking of.
Keep going.

433
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,727
"I know what it smells like,
but I didn't roll in anything.

434
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,594
"It's from listening
to all of Gabe's..."

435
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,691
"Isn't this the perfect
romantic getaway, Erin?

436
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,671
"Sitting on a desert
island in dog costumes?

437
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,934
"I'm Gabe,
and I'm a weirdo."

438
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,978
"Gabe's mom.
Hmm, Gabe's mom?

439
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,446
"Wait, tall woman?
Looks like Gabe?

440
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,275
"Yeah, I banged her."

441
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,081
Yeah, there you go.
