1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:06,062
There is nothing wrong,
nor will there ever be wrong,

2
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:08,072
with any Sabre printers.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,164
Case closed.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,803
Michael Scott,
as seen on TV.

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:17,838
I saw you on the news
and I want to pinch your tiny wiener.

6
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,440
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:20,678
It's Packer.

8
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:24,153
Oh! Pac-Man,
I thought you were a girl.

9
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,919
Apparently,
there are allegations

10
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:29,426
that Sabre printers
can cause a fire.

11
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:33,123
So, they asked me to give
a statement to the press.

12
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:35,928
I'm like,
"What? All right."

13
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,667
So, I do it.

14
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:41,638
It's on TV last night,
and it's in the paper today,

15
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,231
and it's online.

16
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:47,335
And then I call Froggy 98.7,
their request line.

17
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:49,244
I talked to the host
about it on the air.

18
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:52,010
It's like,
"Come on, people, enough."

19
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,611
Everybody,
we are at DEFCON 5.

20
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,849
I am officially the second
most watched clip of the day

21
00:00:57,923 --> 00:00:59,788
on the WBRE news site.

22
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:00,847
What's number one?

23
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:03,895
Oh? That teacher who was wrongfully
accused of being a pedophile.

24
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:07,125
Now, we cannot let
the pedophile win again.

25
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:10,991
I would like you all to go to the
Web site and watch my clip 11 times.

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,594
So, instead of working, you want... Yes.

27
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,036
Okay.
Yes.

28
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:15,334
Come on.

29
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:20,571
Get it up. That's what... Let's do it.

30
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:23,606
Oh! Did you
see this report

31
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:25,479
that the zoo
got a baby otter?

32
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,777
It's on the same site.

33
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:29,082
Aw!
It's kissing its mommy.

34
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:30,382
Please. Michael,
you have to see this.

35
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,048
This is, like,
the cutest thing ever.

36
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:39,025
Really? A baby otter? Okay,
count me in as "Who cares?"

37
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,290
It's not even that
interesting, the baby otter.

38
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,728
It can't even stand up.

39
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:46,430
It's trying to stand up.

40
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:50,831
There he goes.

41
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,835
Howdy.

42
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,806
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

43
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:23,933
Jo, we were
not expecting you.

44
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,704
But you all no doubt
know why I'm here.

45
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:28,473
No. Turns out our printers are famous.

46
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,248
They're all over
the news.

47
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,779
It's an
interesting story.

48
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,187
Cheap, foreign printers

49
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,383
attacking
innocent Americans.

50
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,021
Well, actually the real
story isn't quite as racy.

51
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:43,819
But

52
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:47,825
let's give it a go.

53
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,261
Jo, I think that
I know what happened.

54
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,736
I'm not sure you do,
teddy bear.

55
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,130
Well, now I think
I might not.

56
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:59,002
Not long ago, we discovered a
defect in one of our printers.

57
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:01,511
So, we got a software
patch, fixed it right up.

58
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,842
Just like that.

59
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:04,314
I don't know
how it works.

60
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:07,582
Just as we
were about to

61
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:10,144
send out a letter to
our affected customers,

62
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:13,723
giving them free toner,
and we keep them happy.

63
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,560
But somebody here, they
liked that first story better.

64
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:18,887
The one where
we lose half our clients

65
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,122
For no damn good reason!

66
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:26,803
Whoever it was who talked to the
press, just come forward, please.

67
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:27,961
Jo,

68
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,765
I can assure you it was
no one in this office.

69
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:31,837
Can you, now?
Absolutely.

70
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:34,104
Anyone who talked to the
press, please raise your hand.

71
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:38,045
Put your hand up,
Norma Rae.

72
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:41,281
If you say anything,
so help me God,

73
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:42,945
I'll break off the
temples of your glasses

74
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,545
and stick them in
your eye sockets.

75
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:45,988
So unfair.

76
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,490
Even if I thought that our
printers killed baby seals,

77
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,893
I would not be
a whistleblower.

78
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:55,559
The Bernards, for generations,
have silenced whistleblowers.

79
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,625
It's how
we made all our money.

80
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,500
Woody Guthrie
wrote a song about us.

81
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,303
Old Mister Bernard

82
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,103
Old Mister Bernard

83
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,344
Who have you silenced today?

84
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:10,438
It's a little form.
Says, "I did not do it."

85
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:12,716
There is no reason for
anyone here to sign this

86
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:15,218
because I know everything there
is to know about these people.

87
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,111
I know when
their birthdays are,

88
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,656
I know what their
favorite kind of cake is,

89
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,214
I know what color
streamers they like.

90
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,718
All that's just birthday
information, Michael.

91
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:25,319
Yes, yes, but it
shows a bigger picture.

92
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:26,796
Why don't you
come with me?

93
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:29,195
We'll start out with the
honcho, what d'you say?

94
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,360
Okay.

95
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:32,795
When Mama was working
as a prison guard,

96
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:35,931
and something went missing,
she'd ask one question,

97
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:39,075
"What do we do when we
find the guilty party?"

98
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,208
And if they said,
"Come down on them

99
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,340
"with that swift hammer
of justice," innocent.

100
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,517
A clear conscience
don't need no mercy.

101
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:52,351
But if they said, "Officer Bessie,
well, they may have had a reason."

102
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:54,324
Blah, blah, blah, blah...

103
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,927
Well, nine times out of 10,
that's the anus they checked.

104
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,362
So, say we catch
this whistleblower.

105
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,626
What do you think
I should do with them?

106
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,601
We should give them a
one-way ticket to Montego Bay.

107
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,929
Where they keep
all the al-Qaeda.

108
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,106
Uh, that's Guantanamo Bay. Yes.

109
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:13,606
You put them in jail
for a long time,

110
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,544
you put them in jail
for as long as you can.

111
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,241
Well, I guess we're
all right, Michael.

112
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,982
I want these people to really
pay. I want them to suffer.

113
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,711
I'd prefer it
if they died.

114
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:23,812
Because it's not right.

115
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:24,981
Yeah.
Okay.

116
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,125
Hey, Dwight.
Hey, IT guy.

117
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:29,050
You mind if I get in
there for a second?

118
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,492
Oh, sure thing,
go ahead.

119
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,555
Just...

120
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:35,998
Dwight, what the hell?

121
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,229
Apache persuasion hold,
that's the hell.

122
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,429
What are you doing
to my computer?

123
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:42,803
The lawyers are searching our hard
drives for information on the leak.

124
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:43,997
Thanks a lot, Big Brother.

125
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,202
You're with Big Brother?

126
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:47,040
Okay, go ahead.
I got nothing to hide.

127
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,978
Wait, are they searching
all our computers?

128
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,105
Yeah.

129
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,809
I already
got to yours, Kev.

130
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,817
No, that's cool.
Sometimes I run.

131
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,249
I'm a runner.

132
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,452
Everybody knows
it was Andy,

133
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:07,328
and it is not fair for us all to take
the fall for his big, stupid mouth.

134
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,390
Ridiculous, Angela.

135
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,368
And like I'm going to believe
one of his spurned lovers.

136
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,499
Look, he's been complaining about
this for a while. It's not crazy.

137
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,472
Okay, Dwight.
Hold that thought.

138
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:24,537
I don't want to
waste your time

139
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,083
and I wouldn't
dare waste mine.

140
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,209
I didn't do it.

141
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,219
Now, I don't know
exactly who did it,

142
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:32,688
but I have a list
right here.

143
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,456
You should fire
the following people.

144
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:37,393
Well, I'm inclined
to believe you.

145
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:38,759
Why would I disparage
a company that has

146
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,354
made me rich beyond
my wildest dreams?

147
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,195
Yeah, I noticed
you've had a great year.

148
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,734
Good boy.

149
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,929
You turning that money
into more money?

150
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,598
Are you referring
to alchemy?

151
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,171
I don't like to tell a man
what to do with his money,

152
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,678
but if you ain't
investing in property,

153
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,077
then you're
dumber than a dummy.

154
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:57,839
I'm not dumb, I'm smart.

155
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,712
Well, buy property.
That's my advice.

156
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,552
Is there something
that you would like to say to me?

157
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:08,320
About talking to the
press? Uh, I do... No...

158
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,953
I didn't do that. Okay?

159
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,098
Didn't do it.
I don't believe you.

160
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,135
I swear on the graves of my
parents who aren't even dead yet.

161
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,427
That's a little much.
All right, all right.

162
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,096
I don't care.
That's how much, I swear.

163
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,663
Okay, I believe you.
I believe you.

164
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:24,569
How come no one's
giving Darryl any crap?

165
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,404
He was more bothered
about it than me.

166
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:32,282
Did you tell anyone
outside of this office

167
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,648
that the printers
were catching on fire?

168
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:37,977
Yeah, I did.

169
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,949
I was talking to
this girl at a bar.

170
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,248
Oh, no, no, no.

171
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,856
I think she could
sense my sadness.

172
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,388
And I found out too late that
she was a copyeditor at the Trib.

173
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,456
Oh, my God.

174
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:50,723
Was she cute?

175
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,733
No.
Oh, God, Darryl.

176
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,036
I basically swore up and down
that none of my employees did it.

177
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,474
And then I find out that
one of my best ones did.

178
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,037
And now he's probably
going to get fired for it.

179
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,808
And if that is not poetic
justice, I don't know what is.

180
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:11,585
Sounds like you were as
blind-sided by this as I was.

181
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:12,645
Yes.

182
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,658
And we didn't find anything
on your computer.

183
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,918
Good.

184
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,393
Except this.

185
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:22,363
Wow. This is just a mystery
novel that I've been working on.

186
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,933
I know what it is.
I skimmed the first chapter.

187
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,128
I'm just curious,

188
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,195
why would a man
who hates people

189
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,901
want to have
a relationship with a maid?

190
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,400
I don't know...
The way I look at it,

191
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,139
there's only one
of two reasons.

192
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:38,148
He knows a secret about her
that she doesn't know herself.

193
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:44,185
Or he wants to use her services
to mop up after a murder.

194
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:46,784
Yes.

195
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,220
Write your own damn novel.

196
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,386
It was me.

197
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,688
What was you?

198
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,226
You were the leak?
Okay,

199
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,700
I'm talking to this
woman at day care,

200
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:01,300
she's telling me all about her amazing
trip to Vietnam. I have nothing.

201
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:04,035
I tell her our printers
catch on fire spontaneously.

202
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:05,167
Why'd you do that? Her
husband's a reporter.

203
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,335
Yeah.

204
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,371
So, now everyone hates Andy,
and it's this whole mess,

205
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,608
and I don't know what
to do. Okay, just relax.

206
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:13,883
Just need to relax.

207
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:17,213
I could tell Jo,
or I could tell Michael.

208
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,051
This is a very good idea.
This is good.

209
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,719
Let's get all the bad ideas
out now. Flush them out.

210
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,122
You leaked it?

211
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,595
I don't know what to do.
Do I go tell Jo or...

212
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,530
I don't want everyone to
keep blaming the wrong person.

213
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,864
I don't know what
the best plan is, Pam.

214
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,332
Oh, God.

215
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,497
My mind is going
a mile an hour.

216
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,905
That fast?

217
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,911
Two whistleblowers. Two.

218
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:42,835
I always thought
Darryl and Pam

219
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:45,314
might get me fired
for something I said.

220
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:49,142
Yeah?

221
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:59,955
I weirdly know exactly
what you're saying to me.

222
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,758
So, I'll see you in
Meredith's van in five minutes.

223
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,629
Okay, you didn't need
to actually say that.

224
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,533
I have never seen
so many parking tickets.

225
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,667
All right,
this is just messed up.

226
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,402
No, you know
what's messed up?

227
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:14,707
This situation all up in
here is what's messed up.

228
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,770
We need to brainstorm,
we need to get out of this.

229
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,715
Brain-hurricane, come on.
Think. What have we got?

230
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:20,876
Um...

231
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,183
Hey, guys,
sorry I'm late.

232
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,312
We're not going
for yogurt.

233
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,914
It's okay, she's cool.
She also whistle-blew.

234
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:29,586
Guys, I couldn't help it. It
is so boring where we work.

235
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,526
I mean, it's as interesting
as a morgue.

236
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,528
It might be less interesting
than a morgue.

237
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:36,030
Hey, hey, it's as
interesting as a morgue.

238
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,396
Of course I'm the leak.
I think I tweeted it.

239
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,898
I can't control
what I say to people.

240
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,097
I spend
the whole day talking.

241
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:45,302
I mean, I video chat, I skype,
I text, I tweet, I phone, I woof.

242
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:47,006
Woof is a site that
I'm launching to be

243
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,705
the last word in
social networking.

244
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,805
For just $12.99 a month,
Woof links up

245
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:51,906
all your
communication portals,

246
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,314
so you are
always within reach.

247
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,875
It's part of the dog pack,
as I call it.

248
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,751
But look, why tell you,

249
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:00,382
when I can show you?

250
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,884
I just sent myself a woof.

251
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,196
Ryan,
you have a woof on line one.

252
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,732
Thank you, Erin.

253
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,426
Woof!

254
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:14,698
Okay, here's what we do. I say
we just smash all the computers.

255
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,171
We destroy the evidence.
No evidence, no case.

256
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,540
Wouldn't we get fired for
smashing all the computers?

257
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,808
No, okay, not all the
computers. Just our computers.

258
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,439
That idea sucks. PAM: I don't
think that's a good idea.

259
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,540
Just don't say no.

260
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:28,381
Mike, you know you don't
have to turn us all in.

261
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,689
All you need is
one scapegoat.

262
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,515
Uh, if you turn me in,
I'm turning in Darryl.

263
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,890
That's just what we need, another
black man in prison, you know?

264
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,624
Nobody's going
to prison. Okay?

265
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:45,330
All right, Michael, you need
to convince Jo to go easy on us.

266
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,099
And then we'll all confess
once we know our jobs are safe.

267
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,565
Okay, you can
count on me.

268
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:54,777
Let me give you
a hand.

269
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:56,140
Ready?
On three.

270
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,647
Oh, shoot. Got it?

271
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,947
Got it.

272
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:04,378
Dwight Schrute.

273
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,321
The property you're
looking at is in great shape.

274
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,951
By the way, it has a very
spacious basement office.

275
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,593
Basement office?
You mean like a lair?

276
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:16,191
Hey, Jo.
Michael.

277
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,102
I was thinking about
our little leak problem.

278
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,364
I was up all lunch
thinking about

279
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,269
what we should do
to this individual.

280
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:25,105
You know what I
think we should do?

281
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:28,634
We make them come to
work. And we work them,

282
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:32,012
and we make them sit next to
all the people they screwed over.

283
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,643
And we pay them,

284
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:39,179
but we make them feel like
they did something really wrong.

285
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,690
The one question I have is, "Do
we give them a Christmas bonus?"

286
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,385
I say yes, it's Christmas,

287
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:47,761
but right after, they're
back into the thick of it.

288
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,459
Michael Scott.

289
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,201
What do you know?

290
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,165
What?

291
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,537
It doesn't matter
what I know.

292
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,701
If it doesn't matter, then tell me. Why?

293
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,302
Because I wanna deal with it
the way I deal with it.

294
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,176
Well, deal with this.

295
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,015
Empathize with me
for a moment.

296
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,712
I came up here
with a big problem,

297
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,652
and now,
I've got a branch manager

298
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,485
who's giving me
the silent treatment.

299
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,319
Speak to me.

300
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:17,683
Speak.

301
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,260
Come with me.

302
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:24,824
What?

303
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:32,175
Are you leaving? Oh, my. Should
I continue with the investigation?

304
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,247
Are you gonna kill me?

305
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,255
I just need you to come
by later and sign a few forms.

306
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,631
Okay. What time works for you?

307
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,732
Mr. Schrute? What time works?

308
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:09,276
Cancel it. I want you to make
an offer at 1725 Slough Avenue.

309
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,275
Make them an offer
they can't refuse.

310
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,784
No, on second thought,
lowball them.

311
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,350
Don't call me
till you have it.

312
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:18,480
But...

313
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,050
Are we going
someplace far away?

314
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,321
I know you said
no questions,

315
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,656
but I have an early dinner
that I need to get to.

316
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:32,803
With the chief of police.

317
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,737
I'm very relieved
to learn it wasn't you.

318
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:39,106
All right.
Stan, you're up.

319
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,674
It wasn't me.

320
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,744
What a rich timbre
your voice has.

321
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:47,375
Okay, I am prepared to
conclude the investigation.

322
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,520
And?
You did it.

323
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,747
What? Based on what?

324
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:57,753
Just all the evidence. And it
really seems like it was you.

325
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,397
Can we all agree to say
that it was Andy for now

326
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,524
and sit with it,
see how it feels?

327
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,999
All right, sounds good. Okay.

328
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,831
Guys, I think that
seems a little unfair.

329
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,099
I mean, I feel like we don't
definitely know it was Andy.

330
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:12,768
Yeah, you know? I mean, for all
we know, it could have been Jim.

331
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:14,669
Really?

332
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:16,304
Michael.
I have rights.

333
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:17,973
Let's just talk.

334
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,744
I am not going to
tell you anything.

335
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:23,051
Honey, you don't seem
like your normal self.

336
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:26,356
Well, I'm going through a
little bit of a rough patch.

337
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:28,415
Mama Jo knew
there was something up.

338
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:30,358
The whole year, actually.

339
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,161
My favorite restaurant closed down. Oh.

340
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:34,826
I hate that.

341
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:37,459
And my new favorite
restaurant sucks.

342
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:42,273
I bought a video camera
last year

343
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,069
and I was looking
at the tapes,

344
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,243
and there were only, like, 12
minutes that I felt was worth taping.

345
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:49,837
The whole year.

346
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,815
And most of that was just
birds in my condo complex.

347
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:54,478
What is that?

348
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,755
And I miss Holly.

349
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:00,790
Who's Holly?

350
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,689
Holly Flax.
From the Nashua branch.

351
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,854
Best HR rep that Dunder
Mifflin has ever seen.

352
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:12,334
It has not been a blockbuster
year for me financially.

353
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,670
My Blockbuster
stock is down.

354
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,874
I think that
the real question is,

355
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,573
"Who is the whistleblower?"

356
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,234
Just...

357
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,140
I may have heard from an old
client and I may have immediately

358
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:28,674
started spreading the news to other
clients and potential clients, yeah.

359
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:30,952
But I'm not here
to talk about that.

360
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:34,458
I'm here to talk
about Suck it. Suck it...

361
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,722
Gabe, I told you all
about the printers.

362
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:38,955
I mean,
it could be you, Gabe.

363
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,797
Yes, it's totally obvious.
I mean, that's the point.

364
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:44,231
I think we all can agree
it's either Gabe or Angela.

365
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,428
It's Angela.
Get her, boys.

366
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,165
Hey, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.

367
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,832
I just wanted to say
goodbye to everyone.

368
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:52,136
Through Teach For America,

369
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,234
I'm going to go
down to Detroit

370
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,211
and teach inner-city kids
about computers.

371
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,246
Not now. NICK: Yeah,
it's just that my friends

372
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,340
are in the car waiting,
so I thought I'd...

373
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,780
Phyllis, what's
this guy's name again?

374
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,218
I don't know. Is it Shadow or
Garth? It's something weird, I...

375
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,482
My name is Nick.

376
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:09,390
Okay, well, "Nick,"
we're in a meeting.

377
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:13,754
Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the
lame IT guy and everybody hates me.

378
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,792
Hey, listen, man, you
can't take it personally.

379
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,158
You call me "man"?
I just said my name,

380
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:19,863
just now. Did you
forget it already?

381
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:20,926
No,

382
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,164
sport.

383
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,469
You guys have 15 parties a
week. You can't learn my name?

384
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:28,978
Hey, hey, hey, IT guy.

385
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,309
Here's the story, champ.

386
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,246
None of us have spent a lot of
time getting to know you, okay?

387
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:35,877
We liked the last guy, Sadiq,
because he kept to himself.

388
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:37,545
And we also thought he
might have been a terrorist.

389
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,814
You know what? I'm going to
leave you with one other thought.

390
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:43,418
Inner-city kids use computers
for two things, games and porn.

391
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:46,327
So, good luck
wasting your life, Lurch.

392
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:47,864
Thank you so much for that.

393
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,923
I saw all of your hard
drives. And guess what?

394
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:53,469
You're not a photographer. And you
definitely can't fit into a size two.

395
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,165
Darryl, man,
you're on Facebook.

396
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,934
Why have you been telling
people you're not on Facebook?

397
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:58,836
- People want to be your friend, man.
- Hey.

398
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,576
All right?
And you... This guy.

399
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:02,838
You're the one
who told the press.

400
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,245
You wrote
an e-mail to the editor.

401
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,340
I saw it and I also
saw a Quicktime movie

402
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,783
of your little printer fire
test on your hard drive.

403
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:12,084
This guy's the snitch, he's the
snitch. So, that's it. Check it out.

404
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:16,760
We're going to
believe that guy?

405
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,356
When I was growing up,

406
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,093
there was nothing better than
being a big old business tycoon.

407
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,062
And I thought I'd
break that glass ceiling

408
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:29,334
and be a hero to all those
little girls out there.

409
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:32,333
And they'd make
a Barbie out of me.

410
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,177
I hate that
I sell cheap printers.

411
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:39,408
I do.

412
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,710
But if I have to go out
there in front of the press

413
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,984
and make one of them
public apology recalls,

414
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:50,551
I mean, that's all I'll
ever be remembered for.

415
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,289
Nobody will want to
play with my Barbie.

416
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,058
Well, you know,
I would be willing,

417
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,694
under the right
circumstances,

418
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,328
to do that for you.

419
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,704
Oh, honey, surely
you don't want that.

420
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,707
I surely do,
and don't call me honey.

421
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,384
Airplane II.

422
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,714
I'm about to buy
this building, you know?

423
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:22,849
You don't say.

424
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:26,390
I own a one-eighth share in a
rental property down in Pittston.

425
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,189
Well, I'm one-eighths
proud of you.

426
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:32,829
Enjoy that chair for now.

427
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:37,268
'Cause pretty soon you
will be on your feet.

428
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,402
Like Buckingham Palace.

429
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,515
Hey, Phyllis,
have you seen my bag?

430
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:49,815
You deserve it.

431
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,417
Look, I didn't want
houses and schools

432
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,891
to burn down
and children to die.

433
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,026
Does that make me a hero?

434
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:00,961
No, it does not.

435
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:06,063
Well, it doesn't make me the
worst guy in the world, either.

436
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,365
It does!

437
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,739
Andy?
Hey.

438
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:16,977
I wanted to say that I think it was
very brave of you to go to the press.

439
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:25,785
Thanks.

440
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:28,421
Yeah, you know.

441
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,651
Just seemed like
the right thing to do.

442
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:32,718
Yeah.

443
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,130
"We at Sabre have
betrayed the trust

444
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,331
"that we have built
with our customers.

445
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:46,502
"We regret our slow response and
our lapse in candor and judgment.

446
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:52,038
"At this time, we are issuing a full
recall of all Sabre GH400 printers.

447
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:55,217
"We will not rest until
this problem is solved.

448
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:58,652
"There will be no questions."
Are there any questions?

449
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,561
Hey, I appreciate you reading that
statement. You looked pretty up there.

450
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:08,826
That was fun.

451
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:10,696
I hope your rough patch
ends soon.

452
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:12,099
Thanks. Today helped.

453
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:15,265
Well, give a shout
if I can brighten your life.

454
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,633
Okay. Hey, you could transfer
Holly back from Nashua.

455
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:22,574
Let me see what I can do.
