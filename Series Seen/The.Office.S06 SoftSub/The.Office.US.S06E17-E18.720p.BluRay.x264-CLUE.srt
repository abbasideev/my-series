1
00:00:02,034 --> 00:00:04,025
I just wanted to check and see
if there was anything you needed

2
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:05,968
before I went on
my maternity leave.

3
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:08,169
Yeah.
I'm pregnant.

4
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,270
Great. Well,
I'll write up the order.

5
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:12,401
Wait a minute.
Okay, thanks.

6
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:16,346
You can't do that. You cannot
exploit your baby for sales.

7
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,383
Hey, did I tell you
we're gonna have a baby?

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,283
Thank you very
much. I'm excited... Oh.

9
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,985
Definitely.
No. No!

10
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:25,748
You need to come by
your sales honorably.

11
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:28,384
There is nothing dishonorable
about talking about your life.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,984
People like it.

13
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,394
Hey, there.
Dwight Schrute here.

14
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:37,026
Listen, uh, would you be
interested in restocking on paper?

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,303
Yeah, I could sure
use the money.

16
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:43,205
My cousin came down with a case
of that nasty new goat fungus.

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,738
Oh, it's just horrific.

18
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,712
The doctor says he's never
seen it beard so quickly.

19
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:49,873
Okay.

20
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:57,381
I need a baby. I'll never
outsell Jim and Pam without one.

21
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:01,220
Also, I've been noticing
a gaping hole in my life.

22
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:04,855
Sometimes I wake up
cradling a gourd.

23
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,943
Kevin, you're
such a gourmand.

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,012
I cooked my way through
Julia Child's cookbook,

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,820
and now I'm halfway through
The Twilight Cookbook.

26
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:36,884
Last night, I had
Edward's cornflake chicken.

27
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,287
Hmm.

28
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,764
Pregnant Pam and I, we
get hungry at the same times,

29
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,232
so we've been eating
together a lot. Not all meals.

30
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:50,635
Just second breakfast, lunch,
second lunch and first dinner.

31
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,308
I thought that maybe we should do
something special for early dinner.

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,781
One last ultra feast.

33
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:01,752
Mmm. That sounds great.
What are you thinking?

34
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,310
I think it should be
a surprise.

35
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:06,785
Getting there, huh?

36
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,451
No, no. I still have time.

37
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,894
I'm having contractions, but
they're irregular and far apart.

38
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:15,263
So I'm not really in labor,
I'm near labor.

39
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:17,666
Yeah. We're slow-playing it
because of our stupid HMO.

40
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:18,828
If we check in
after midnight,

41
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:21,395
I get an extra day to
recuperate surrounded by doctors.

42
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:22,940
Not to mention
the extra night's sleep

43
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:24,339
in the hospital
will be very nice,

44
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,343
because once we
bring the baby home,

45
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:29,471
if it's crying all night, one of
us is gonna have to take care of it,

46
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,415
and I do not plan on
helping unless it's a boy.

47
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:35,044
I cannot wait for
that joke to be over.

48
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,176
Oh.

49
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:41,215
Contraptions! She's
contrapting! Okay, you know what?

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,124
I think that I should drive you guys
to the hospital, and here is why.

51
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:47,097
I am a licensed Class C driver
in the state of Pennsylvania.

52
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,690
Michael.
I gassed up the car.

53
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,860
Actually, I put diesel in this
time. Tried to save some money.

54
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:51,960
Michael, you shouldn't
have done that.

55
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,061
Happy to do it.

56
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:56,107
Also, I did a heck of a job
baby-proofing this office.

57
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,767
You know the baby's not
gonna live here, right?

58
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,435
Well, the baby
was conceived here,

59
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,069
so might as well live
here a little bit, too.

60
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:04,547
Mmm. That logic's airtight, but
unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.

61
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:05,913
Burning Man, Porta Potty.

62
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:09,613
Yuck! TMI. How was it?

63
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,987
I don't want to know. Tell me
later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!

64
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,787
Okay, okay, we're not
going to the hospital.

65
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,986
We are waiting
until midnight.

66
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,291
Ooh! Spooky. But why?

67
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:20,854
Because the insurance company
only covers two nights.

68
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,696
Everything's fine.
We have plenty of time.

69
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,429
Well, you don't want
to wait too long, Pam.

70
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,198
Otherwise the baby's gonna
become a teenager in there,

71
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,432
and you'll be up all night
from the rock music.

72
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:32,068
Shut up, Nick. God!
What a weird thing to say.

73
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:36,740
Weird IT nerd. Don't
get revenge on me, nerd.

74
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:40,952
What are you looking at?

75
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:43,279
Nerd.

76
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,753
Did you know that
labor can last weeks?

77
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:48,588
Then they take your insides out
and they just plop them on a table,

78
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,494
and sometimes epidurals don't
work, and you can poop yourself.

79
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,067
Bear my child.

80
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:01,964
Excuse me?

81
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:03,865
I want to have a child
for business reasons

82
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,432
and I want you
to be the mother.

83
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,239
If you agree,
say nothing.

84
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,075
If you disagree,
say anything.

85
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,317
Very well.
Let's meet at 4:00 p.m.

86
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,514
In our old meeting spot
and bang it out.

87
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:26,297
That's seven minutes.
Here we go.

88
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,457
Hold on. Hold on.
This is happening.

89
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:28,590
It isn't midnight yet.

90
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,191
Are you serious? Pam.

91
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,999
No, the doctor said
every five to seven minutes.

92
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,437
I'm gonna be okay. We should
really try to make it to midnight.

93
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:36,496
Pam, please.

94
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,633
Yeah, no,
you really should,

95
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,336
'cause if your
baby's born tomorrow,

96
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:40,810
he's gonna have
the same birthday

97
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,211
as Buttmud Brooks,
my old roommate.

98
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,716
Did you hear that?
Buttmud Brooks.

99
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:51,115
Okay, but we are leaving
at five minutes apart.

100
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,918
Five minutes apart.

101
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:56,716
So the plan was seven minutes,
but we're calling an audible,

102
00:04:56,795 --> 00:05:00,231
because that's her call,
'cause she's the quarterback.

103
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,628
I'm just the left tackle who
happened to get her pregnant.

104
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:11,166
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Stop watching me.

105
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,105
Okay, Crazy.

106
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,702
I think I have some better
things to do with my day

107
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,248
than worry about you.
Like sell printers.

108
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,374
Mmm-hmm.

109
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,749
Well, now until Friday, 20% off all
toner cartridges, that's a big deal.

110
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,448
While we're on the subject, why don't
I just run you down to the hospital

111
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,785
and just do a quick
check?

112
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,586
Not till midnight.

113
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:32,756
Guys, a word of advice,
speaking as a former baby.

114
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,090
Don't get too hung
up on baby names.

115
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,001
I was named Walter Junior
after my father,

116
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,602
until I was about six or so, when
my parents changed their minds.

117
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:45,108
I thought you said your younger
brother was named Walter Junior.

118
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,236
My brother was born

119
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,543
and my parents felt he better
exemplified the Walter Junior name,

120
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:53,345
so they gave it to him.
I was given Andrew,

121
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,613
which they got out
of a baby-name book.

122
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,684
You know what? It's getting
really crowded in here.

123
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:00,088
Maybe you guys should all go back
to work 'cause the day's not out yet.

124
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,455
No, no, no.
You know what?

125
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:02,618
You can't tell us
what to do

126
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,423
because you are not
co-manager anymore.

127
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,554
Yes!

128
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,996
I feel like this noise
is gonna prevent Pam

129
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,057
from being able to listen
to her body's signals.

130
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:12,296
Actually,
the distractions are good.

131
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,668
I don't think I'm gonna
make it till midnight

132
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,263
if I'm just sitting here
thinking about it.

133
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,467
Distractions are good!

134
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:21,569
That means conference room, five
minutes. No, no, five seconds!

135
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,575
Right now, right now,
conference room.

136
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,082
Topic, potpourri.
Let's go!

137
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,984
Um, I'm sort of
a master of distraction.

138
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,750
When I was a kid,
my mom received compliments

139
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,381
left and right
from my teachers

140
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:37,485
on how I was always able
to distract others in class.

141
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:41,757
Try to think, "What were
the first 13 colonies?"

142
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,066
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

143
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:55,904
The purpose
for this meeting

144
00:06:55,981 --> 00:07:00,145
is to take Pam's mind off of
what's going on inside of her body.

145
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:01,583
Can we do
sleight-of-hand tricks?

146
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:02,745
I will allow that.

147
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,585
Yes! Can anyone do those?

148
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:07,522
I'm gonna go look
at the Internet.

149
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:13,190
All right.
That's a good one.

150
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:14,459
Okay.

151
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,595
Sorry, guys.
Just keep talking.

152
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:17,726
Okay.

153
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:22,399
Oh, God, Pam.
You are a woman warrior.

154
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,032
Oh. Thanks, Kelly.

155
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:28,112
Does anybody have anything?
Anything interesting, any hobbies?

156
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:29,605
Uh, special skills?

157
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:30,739
Yes, this is the only time

158
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,909
I'm ever going to make
this request. Yeah, Phyl.

159
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,544
Yeah. I can put on lipstick
the way Molly Ringwald does

160
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,451
in The Breakfast Club.

161
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:39,956
No, no. I don't think
anybody wants to see that.

162
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,755
I can do the Evolution
of Dance dance.

163
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,088
That sounds good.
Do you need some music or...

164
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,098
No, actually, music
would just throw me off.

165
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,760
Okay. I need complete silence, okay?

166
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:09,311
You're clapping.
I need complete silence.

167
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,357
Totally threw me off, so
I'm gonna have to start over.

168
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,720
The Evolution
of Dance dance.

169
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:21,788
"You let me in your bed
But now I sleep alone

170
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:25,559
"Trapped with the forgotten
In my detritus home"

171
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:29,271
Affirmed, Seattle Slew,
Secretariat, Citation,

172
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:33,471
Assault, Count Fleet, Whirlaway,
War Admiral, Omaha, Gallant Fox.

173
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,077
And... I know this.

174
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:39,844
Uh, the jockey was Johnny
Loftus, sired by Star Shoot.

175
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,147
Good afternoon.

176
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,281
Have a seat.

177
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,394
What is this?

178
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,759
Before we conceive a child,

179
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,731
it is important that we bang
out a parenting contract.

180
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,130
Of course.

181
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:01,867
It's been a long time since
we've come down here separately.

182
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,929
You know, I was thinking...

183
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,134
Now then,
let's get to it, shall we?

184
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,076
Item one. Child will be
breastfed by the mother

185
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,271
for exactly six months,

186
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:11,372
then weaned onto a nutrient-rich,
winter vegetable mash

187
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:12,882
provided by the father,
Dwight Schrute,

188
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:15,317
hereafter referred
to as Morpheus.

189
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,082
Agreed?
Agreed.

190
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,316
Where are we? We have every six
minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

191
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:25,420
Another 75 contractions and
you are going to be there.

192
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:28,591
For the love of God, Pam,
do it for ultra feast.

193
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,329
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
go give Dr. Rezvani a quick call.

194
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,462
He'll probably know...

195
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:34,835
Jim, please,
happy thoughts here.

196
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,601
Happy times. Yeah, happy times. Come on.

197
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:37,903
Let's have happy times.
All right.

198
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:39,967
Jim, as a matter of fact,

199
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,678
I've printed out
10 ways to induce labor,

200
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,547
and I'm thinking we just do
the opposite of those things

201
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,086
and we can slow down
your labor.

202
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,212
Erin, read the first one.

203
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,812
"Stimulate the nipples."

204
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,482
Okay, nobody touch
Pam's nipples.

205
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:55,992
Think of Pam's nipples
as Toby's grundle.

206
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:59,428
Her shirt is touching them. Maybe
we should cut holes in her shirt.

207
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,794
I have a shirt
like that in my car.

208
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,356
Okay, yeah,
why don't you go get it?

209
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,630
Okay, uh, the second one
is "walk around."

210
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:06,966
We're already doing
the opposite of that.

211
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,734
Perfect. Okay, number three,
eat spicy foods.

212
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,275
Okay, the opposite of that.

213
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,038
Stick spicy food
up her butt.

214
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:16,046
Nope. Nope.
Nope. Nope.

215
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,407
- Come on. Let's go to the hospital.
- Jim. Jim.

216
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,109
Pam, let's go to the hospital
now. Sweetie, I love you,

217
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:21,448
but you're really distracting
me from my distractions. Mmm-hmm.

218
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,918
Okay, great.
Well, sorry.

219
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:24,148
Why don't you go
do some work?

220
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:25,382
Great. I will do that.

221
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,755
Sorry, Pam, I just feel a
little bit frazzled, and you know

222
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,953
how very rarely I use that word. I know.

223
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,222
"Frazzled." You
don't like to be frazzled.

224
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,695
No, I don't.
- Okay.

225
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:37,667
Oh. And by the way, hate that you're
helping her with this right now. Totally.

226
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:40,131
Someone's freaking.

227
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,399
Getting a little frazzled.

228
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,599
Yeah, he is.

229
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,608
I know Pam better than
anyone in this office,

230
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,541
and obviously
she's gone crazy,

231
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,203
but everybody wants
to say that I'm crazy.

232
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,045
But I'm not crazy. She's crazy.
I'm not crazy. She's crazy.

233
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,281
"Five to seven minutes."

234
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:56,079
"Five to seven minutes."

235
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,714
"Six minutes."
Different, but not really.

236
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,881
"Five to seven minutes."

237
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,920
Acceptable names include,
and are limited to,

238
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,623
Ebenezer.
Jebediah.

239
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,495
Honus.
Jedediah.

240
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,892
Worf.

241
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,395
No Star Trek names.

242
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:12,766
Okay. Fine.

243
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:13,895
What if it's a girl?

244
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,496
Irrelevant question.

245
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:18,007
Section 5A.
"Child shall be male."

246
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:20,203
Hey. Uh-uh.
I cannot control that.

247
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,905
You can't put that
in here. Yes, you can.

248
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,572
No. It's as simple as keeping the womb

249
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,980
extremely warm for
two days after sex,

250
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,349
and then extremely
cold for five months.

251
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,819
Absolutely not.

252
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,489
Hey.
Hey.

253
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,719
Oh.

254
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,757
I'm not gonna
get in the car,

255
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,991
'cause I know if I do, you'll
try to drive me to the hospital.

256
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,260
Ah!

257
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,130
You know me too well.

258
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,697
Okay, Jim.
Yeah.

259
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:48,032
Everything is fine.

260
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,164
Totally.
You don't have to worry.

261
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,301
Try not to think about it. She's
not coming out for a while, okay?

262
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:55,673
Did you say "she"?

263
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:59,639
I called the doctor, like,
a week ago. I couldn't wait.

264
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,720
Oh, God, don't be mad.

265
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,846
Mad?

266
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,921
How could I be mad?
We're having a little girl.

267
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,188
Mmm-hmm.

268
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,459
Wow. We're having
a little girl.

269
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,570
Man!
I know.

270
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,066
Whoo! All right.

271
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:25,037
Well, I definitely feel better. Good.

272
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,010
Yeah. All right.
Okay.

273
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,504
Hey, did you change?

274
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,414
Oh, yeah.
My water broke.

275
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,109
Oh.

276
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:36,647
Oh.

277
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,816
Oh! Whoa!

278
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:44,521
Pam? Pam!
Okay. All right.

279
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:48,093
Okay, it's time. Time to go to the
hospital. Somebody get Jim, please.

280
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,031
Is it midnight yet?
No, it's 4:35.

281
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,036
4:35. All right. Almost
made it. Almost made it.

282
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:56,164
Too bad you didn't have sex,
like, seven-and-a-half hours later.

283
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,209
But you had to have the
afternoon delight. I understand.

284
00:12:58,276 --> 00:12:59,436
Sometimes you
have to go for it.

285
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,978
Let's go to the hospital,
shall we?

286
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,637
No. Not yet, Michael.

287
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:03,738
We can do it.

288
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,407
Oh, wow! It's almost
time for ultra feast.

289
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:07,314
Where's Kevin?
What?

290
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,711
You want to eat cat food with
Kevin and not go to the hospital?

291
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,724
That's Fancy Feast. Ultra
feast is something they made up

292
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,317
so they can pig out together
in the name of ceremony.

293
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,622
What is October Feast?

294
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,632
There is no rush to get to the
hospital. I'm fine. I'll get there.

295
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,104
And if I don't get there,
I don't get there.

296
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,338
Our ultra feast
menu's theme,

297
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,775
Hollywood.

298
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,673
We have ratatouille
from Ratatouille,

299
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:40,684
and tandoori chicken
from Born Into Brothels.

300
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:45,348
I tried to bake a cake like that
District 9 prawn thing, but I...

301
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,958
Are you okay?

302
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:49,288
Mmm.

303
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,555
Yes. I'm fine.

304
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:52,721
Are you sure?

305
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:56,028
Yeah, the doctor said that it's
still considered a minor contraction

306
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,727
as long as I can talk
through it.

307
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,394
Okay. Okay. Jim?

308
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,499
- I think this feast is over...
- All right.

309
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,097
...and it's time to go to
the hospital. Time to go.

310
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:04,232
No.
That's right.

311
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,333
Let's do this.
Let's give it a shot.

312
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,468
No, it's better.
- Here we go.

313
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,444
That wasn't even the worst of
them. I'm fine. JIM: Hey, come on.

314
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,037
They're not that bad still.
Let's go to the hospital.

315
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:11,172
Pam. No, it's passing, it's fine.

316
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,944
Pam, it's time. Let's go to
the hospital. Let's go, Pam.

317
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:14,541
It's okay. Michael
says we should go now.

318
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:16,018
- Yeah, I think we should head out.
- It's fine.

319
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,782
Pam. You know what?
It passed. It's good.

320
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,346
Absolutely fine. Come
on. Let's go. We gotta go.

321
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:20,891
Babe, I'm not going.
We need to go.

322
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,483
It's fine. Hey, come on.
We really gotta go.

323
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,790
No. I'm not going!
I am not going, okay?

324
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,887
All right.

325
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:29,456
I'm not going today because I can't
do it! I don't think I can do it!

326
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,900
Hey. Hey. Hey.

327
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,659
Are you kidding me?

328
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:35,262
Are you kidding?

329
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,435
If anyone can do this,
you can do this.

330
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:38,532
You can do this.

331
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,599
You can do this.

332
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,042
Pam, I'm scared.

333
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,579
I'm real scared.
I'm scared, too.

334
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:43,807
I'm petrified.

335
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,247
But the best news is,

336
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,942
we're gonna
have a baby today.

337
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,042
Yeah.

338
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,450
A really
awesome baby.

339
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,078
We're gonna have a baby.

340
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,486
So let's have it
at the hospital.

341
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,149
Let's do that.

342
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,216
How are we doing on
contractions? Two minutes apart.

343
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:58,285
Two minutes.
Oh, God.

344
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,422
Oh, no.
I thought I told you...

345
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,329
It's okay. No, I told
you to warn me at five minutes.

346
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,027
Jim, we waited too long. I know.

347
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,263
We waited too long. Two
minutes doesn't do us any good.

348
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,328
- What happened to four and three?
- We're okay, Jim.

349
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,204
Okay, Pamela, you know
what time it is?

350
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:12,570
I don't want to
have my baby here.

351
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:13,975
You know...
You're not going to.

352
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,706
You know where you're
going? The hospital.

353
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,645
Yes you are, and you know
what you're gonna have?

354
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:18,739
A baby.
Yes.

355
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:20,613
We're going to the hospital
and we're gonna have a baby.

356
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:22,676
I got it! I got it!
Everybody, it's go time!

357
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,722
Action station!
Stanley, man the phones!

358
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,518
Meredith, please
grab a bottle of water.

359
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,683
Erin, call an ambulance,
please!

360
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,783
No, no, no.

361
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,293
Ambulances are
emergencies only.

362
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,158
You call the ambulance,
I call the cops.

363
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,857
- All right, we're driving ourselves, actually.
- No, Jim.

364
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,263
You are in no
condition to drive.

365
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,164
I will drive you.
Check. Got it.

366
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:38,827
- All right, I have my wallet.
- Yes.

367
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:40,165
Go bag's in the car.
Go bag? Where's my go bag?

368
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,364
Keys. I need my keys!
Where's my go bag?

369
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:42,497
There's nothing in it.

370
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:45,804
You are telling me now that there
is nothing in it! Okay, great.

371
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,004
Should I bring a
dictionary to the hospital?

372
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,774
The hospital will
provide dictionaries.

373
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:50,836
Bring the thesaurus.

374
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:52,405
Did anyone check
how dilated she is?

375
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:54,246
This is ridiculous.
Dwight, get away.

376
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,184
No, no, no, Dwight, let
Jim do that, please. Okay?

377
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:57,653
I didn't know we had
a tape measure.

378
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:58,780
"We" don't.

379
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:01,757
Okay, I can't find my keys!
I cannot find my keys!

380
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,259
Found them. They're here.
Here we go. Here we go.

381
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,818
- Here we go!
- Good luck!

382
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,090
- Good luck, Pam.
- Bye, Pam.

383
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:08,064
Thank you! Wish me luck!

384
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,565
Have fun!

385
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:13,734
Hey, it's 5:00.

386
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,963
Here we go.
Here we go. On our way.

387
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,033
Hold it.

388
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,237
Come on,
Stanley. Okay.

389
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,170
We're going now.
No. One more.

390
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:26,216
Can I... No, no, no,
no! Out, out, out! Idiot!

391
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,579
Dwight, what is
the traffic like?

392
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:28,914
Doesn't matter.
I'll escort you!

393
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,579
All right.

394
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:34,491
Let's go!
- Easy, Dwight.

395
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:40,856
Michael!
What?

396
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,456
Michael!
What?

397
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,634
This is where I saw
that deer last week.

398
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:46,863
Where?
Right over by that fence.

399
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,337
By the bushes?
Okay, Michael, focus!

400
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:49,998
Okay, go, go, go!
Guys, come on!

401
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:51,336
Let's go!

402
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,612
I love
escorting people.

403
00:16:55,747 --> 00:17:00,377
In fact, a few years back, I put an ad
in the paper starting an escort service.

404
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:05,684
Got a lot of responses. Mostly
creeps. Made a few friends.

405
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:07,952
All right, here we go.
You're doing great.

406
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,220
Okay, just breathe.

407
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:10,385
She'll be here soon.

408
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,485
She? You found out?

409
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:14,292
Come on, guys.
I wanted to be surprised.

410
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:15,896
Michael!
Yeah?

411
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,696
Stop texting. Put your
phone away! Michael, come on!

412
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,031
I'm texting
about you, okay?

413
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,400
Come on!

414
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,571
All right.

415
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,976
Let's move!

416
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:31,706
What? POLICE OFFICER: Pull over.

417
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,114
You're kidding me!

418
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:34,276
Pull over.

419
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:42,053
You're not allowed to
impersonate a police officer.

420
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:44,560
Don't make this
difficult, Dwight.

421
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,227
Wait! Wait, my iPod's not in here. Okay.

422
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,360
It has the
birth song on it.

423
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,371
Okay, I know, but my
iPod is in the go bag.

424
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,804
We'll be fine. Jim, I
don't want the first thing

425
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:57,500
the baby hears to be
the 8 Mile soundtrack.

426
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,042
Okay, so what do you
want to do? I don't know.

427
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,270
Let's go by
the house and get it.

428
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:02,073
It's only 20 minutes
past the hospital.

429
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,080
Pam, no. Are you nuts? We're
going to the hospital now.

430
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:06,275
Guys, guys,
stop fighting. Come on.

431
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,410
Come on. Do you want your
kid to come out a lawyer?

432
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,647
Right?

433
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:15,856
Okay, you know what? I am all
over this. Here we go. Ready?

434
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,522
Dwight Schrute.

435
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:20,689
Hello, Dwight.

436
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:23,296
Pam left her iPod at her
house. I want you to swing by,

437
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:26,268
pick it up and bring it to the
hospital. We need it yesterday.

438
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,202
Then why didn't you ask me
to do it yesterday?

439
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,240
I kept IM-ing you
how bored I was.

440
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,798
Okay.
Dwight!

441
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:35,874
Go to my house, get my iPod. I
think it's on the kitchen table.

442
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:37,812
Do not touch
anything else.

443
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,679
The key is under...
I don't need a key.

444
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,412
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a
key, just listen, it's under the...

445
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:43,977
No, don't. Don't.
Don't tell me.

446
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,423
Dwight, just listen.
It's underneath...

447
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,693
Okay.
You all right?

448
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,592
Yeah.

449
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:55,791
Do you have everything, guys?

450
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,264
Michael, just
go park the car.

451
00:18:58,336 --> 00:18:59,633
Okay. All right.

452
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,713
Sir! Dunder Mifflin. It's okay.

453
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:12,544
You can't park here.

454
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,518
I just did.

455
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,925
Pam's doing great. Uh,
she's 10 inches dilated now.

456
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,193
Sorry, meters...
Centimeters.

457
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,395
And she's also fully effaced,
which I don't know what that is.

458
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:37,032
But no baby yet. It's only
been six... Nineteen hours.

459
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,109
And I was sent out
for some ice chips

460
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,701
because I might have
passed out a little bit,

461
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,245
but these are very
refreshing, very...

462
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:44,611
Daddy?
She's ready to push.

463
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:45,774
Okay!

464
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:55,119
Where's my little niblet?
Halpert, room D1. All right.

465
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,358
Family only beyond
this point. Thank you.

466
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,229
Here we go.

467
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:06,194
Doing great.
Push again!

468
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,328
Not yet.

469
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:08,736
No, don't push.
Pull! Pull!

470
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:09,830
Why don't you get
some more ice chips?

471
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:10,965
No, Jim, stay!

472
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,270
Okay.
Really push this time, Pam.

473
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,435
Okay.

474
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:26,053
Nope. Not yet.
Not yet. Not yet.

475
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,620
Gotta go wash my eyes.

476
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,419
That kid's gonna
have a lot of hair.

477
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,392
Have you guys seen her?
She hasn't popped yet.

478
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:40,904
What? Damn it! She was
supposed to come out yesterday.

479
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,573
I decided to
give Baby Halpert

480
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,973
the newspaper from
the day she was born.

481
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:49,169
This frame set
me back 55 bones.

482
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,078
But she decided to
take her sweet time,

483
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,343
so now I have to switch it
with today's paper.

484
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,887
This is ridiculous.
We just can't wait here.

485
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,616
I think it's gonna
be any minute now.

486
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,215
But you don't know that. We could
be here another half an hour.

487
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,261
Phyllis, what could
you possibly have to do?

488
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,319
I have an ice cream
cake in the car.

489
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:10,595
Oh, my God! Go! Go! Go!
Are you insane? All right.

490
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,566
Guys? Hello?

491
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,367
You're doing
great. Just relax. Um...

492
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:20,902
Sorry to be a bother, but if we could
have an ETA when this is gonna...

493
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:24,339
You're kind of
losing them.

494
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:27,646
God!

495
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,743
Oh, my God.
Look at her.

496
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,016
The baby,
she's so beautiful.

497
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,292
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

498
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:42,125
Yeah, that's
right. It's a baby, see?

499
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,223
Sir.

500
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,166
Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Okay.

501
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:47,136
Put it out.
All right.

502
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:50,004
Can't smoke
anywhere these days.

503
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,236
She's incredible.

504
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:56,373
You want to count her
fingers and toes again?

505
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,109
No, let's let her rest. I'm
sure there are still 12 of each.

506
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:00,275
Okay.

507
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:02,583
Guys, guys!

508
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,621
Her name is
Cecelia Marie Halpert.

509
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:05,713
Eleven pounds,
four...

510
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,691
She's seven pounds, two
ounces, 18 inches. Seven pounds.

511
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,953
Mother and daughter
are doing great.

512
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,297
Congratulations.
That's great.

513
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:19,393
There.

514
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,494
Hey, Grandma's back.

515
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:23,472
Well, it was an adventure and a
half trying to find the cafeteria,

516
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,873
but I have returned
with the coffee. Great.

517
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:27,808
Thank God. I haven't had
caffeine in nine months.

518
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,641
- May I?
- Yes.

519
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,439
Somebody has
a full diaper.

520
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:33,813
Oh. Let me get it.

521
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:37,054
I am a diapering master.

522
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,184
I have done little else
in the past two months.

523
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,656
There is nothing
I cannot diaper.

524
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:44,324
Go ahead. Try to think
of something. I dare you.

525
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:50,393
Where's
the baby? I want to see the baby.

526
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,162
Oh! Oh.

527
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:54,304
Helene, hi.

528
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:58,632
Oh, my goodness. What
are the odds of this?

529
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,008
Congratulations
on being a grandma.

530
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,410
Hello, Michael.
Hello.

531
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,476
Oh. How are you?

532
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:06,675
I worry about you.

533
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:09,219
You know, I think
it's time for me to go.

534
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:10,810
Oh. Okay.

535
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:13,345
Love you.

536
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:14,686
Love you as a friend.

537
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,816
Love you, Mom.

538
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:20,254
Oh!

539
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:22,231
I want to hold the baby.

540
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,927
Okay, you just have to use
the hand sanitizer first.

541
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,435
Oh, right.

542
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,270
Again. No pants.

543
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:32,741
Oh. Okay.

544
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,271
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.

545
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,748
Oh, wow.

546
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,690
Michael. Michael.

547
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:51,689
That's so weird. She was saying
it just before you got here.

548
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:59,334
Yesterday I was dispatched to
Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.

549
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,338
I searched everywhere,
but I didn't find it.

550
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:07,310
What I did find was mold,
and lots of it.

551
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:10,510
So, I did what
anyone would do.

552
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,807
I read a book, had a bath,
I got a good night's sleep,

553
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:16,284
and I made plans
to eradicate it.

554
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:21,516
I also made plans to ask Jim where
he bought his marvelous sheets.

555
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,057
Time to get to work.

556
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,467
There she sat.
Her name was Pam.

557
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:37,104
She was a receptionist. She
was engaged to an animal.

558
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:41,973
There sat Jim. He was
a gawky, tall salesman.

559
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:46,849
The odds of them getting
together were insurmountainable.

560
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:50,911
I made a family. I got these
two together and I made a family.

561
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:52,888
This man has a gift.

562
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,153
Who else here is single?

563
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:56,921
I'm not single.
I have a man.

564
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,489
I am offering up my
services to you all.

565
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,031
You saw what I did with Pam
and Jim. I can help you, too.

566
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,726
Why don't you find
someone for yourself

567
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,325
instead of meddling
in our affairs?

568
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:07,700
Okay, show of hands. Who
wants to live in a world

569
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:11,070
where Stanley has two lovers
and you don't have any?

570
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,774
Who else? Come on.
People, I know models.

571
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:17,307
Plus-size
models, maybe.

572
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:21,610
You got that right. Meredith?
Come on. You're obviously single.

573
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:24,415
You know it. I am never getting married.

574
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,222
Like Clooney.

575
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:27,620
Andrew? What about you?

576
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:29,886
Torn scrotum.
Still on the mend, so...

577
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,325
Not good timing.

578
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:35,593
Yes, I'm gonna ask out Erin. I'm
just waiting for the stars to align.

579
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,690
Literally.

580
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,462
I have a small
skylight in my bedroom,

581
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,595
and I'd like for
the moon to be visible.

582
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,798
Well, when you least
expect it, expect it.

583
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:47,503
I am going to fill the empty
voids in your life with love.

584
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,412
I am going to fill
that empty hole

585
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,507
in your body
with another person.

586
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,751
And like Cupid, I am going
to shoot you with love.

587
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:14,565
Remember yesterday, when we
were terrified of being parents?

588
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:17,396
We were just kids.
What did we know?

589
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,135
Hey, how we doing?

590
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:20,471
Good.
Great.

591
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,876
Would you like me to take her
to the nursery for the night?

592
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:24,881
Doesn't she sleep here?
She can.

593
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,473
But a lot of parents
choose to have the baby

594
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,847
spend the first
night in the nursery

595
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:30,853
to get some rest.
You've been through a lot.

596
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,613
I think
we'll be okay.

597
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,816
Okay, great.

598
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,222
Big yawn.

599
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:39,757
Ready, one, two, three.

600
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,661
One, and
then wrap around.

601
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:42,754
It's okay.

602
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,331
I don't understand.
Hold that arm down.

603
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:47,131
I can't. She's too strong.
Careful, though.

604
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:48,330
You don't want
to break it.

605
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,566
She's not
going to... Just...

606
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:52,575
I got it. All right.
- Go. Go.

607
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:54,008
I'm done.
Nurse?

608
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:55,540
How you doing?

609
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,671
I don't know.

610
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,914
I just... I can't tell
if she's getting anything.

611
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,008
Really?

612
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:02,279
It doesn't feel right.

613
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:05,547
Well, you're pushing
the milk out, right?

614
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,056
How would one do that?

615
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,159
Well, isn't it kind
of like... Like that?

616
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:12,957
Do you want to try it, Jim? Mmm-mmm.

617
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,396
I think you're good.
Doing a good job.

618
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:20,761
Somebody buzzed?

619
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,033
Oh, really?
Must have sat on it, Pam.

620
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,674
I can't tell if
she's getting anything.

621
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:26,573
It just doesn't
really feel right.

622
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,578
Well, maybe we should take
a break for a little while.

623
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,670
I can take her
to the nursery

624
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:31,374
and then bring her back and
try again a little bit later.

625
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:33,313
Even if she's not
getting anything?

626
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:34,442
Yeah, she'll be fine.

627
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,577
I can always give her a bottle
once we're in the nursery.

628
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,282
No. I read in the book
about nipple confusion.

629
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:41,119
Oh, good.
You know everything.

630
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:44,024
I mean, she's just really
tentative about latching,

631
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:46,324
and I just want to
keep her self-esteem up.

632
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:49,025
I'll bring her back in a little
while and we can try again, okay?

633
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,964
All right.
All right.

634
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:55,631
It's gonna be all right.

635
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:56,934
Yeah, maybe it'll
be good 'cause then

636
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,702
she can, like, socialize
with the other babies.

637
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:03,173
No, yeah,
that would be good.

638
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:05,172
You wanted to see me?

639
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:06,546
What would you say

640
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,814
if I told you that I was
about to change your life?

641
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,115
Oh, boy!

642
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:14,484
What's that sound?

643
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:16,854
Ta-da!

644
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:18,895
I would like you to meet
your new boyfriend.

645
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,020
Yes.

646
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:22,022
I don't know
what to say.

647
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,091
Say nothing. You will learn to love me.

648
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:26,792
Okay, hold on.

649
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,201
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

650
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:30,001
You got to let
the cookies cool

651
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:32,440
before you pop them in your mouth. Okay.

652
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:36,001
Why don't you guys get to know each
other, maybe have lunch together?

653
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,446
Erin, would you
have lunch with me?

654
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:39,573
Okay.

655
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,015
Good.
Yes!

656
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,277
Michael, can I talk
to you privately?

657
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:45,548
Sure. Kevin, please leave.

658
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:47,419
Bye.
- Bye.

659
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,892
I'm so sorry if I
gave you the impression

660
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:55,659
that I'm into Kevin,
but I'm not. I like Andy.

661
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,065
Okay.
This is going to kill Kevin.

662
00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:59,227
I'm sure he'll be fine.

663
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:00,930
I'm not so sure.

664
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,265
Kevin has an
enormous heart.

665
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:05,436
Literally, he has
an elephant heart.

666
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,103
He had a transplant
when he was 17.

667
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:11,144
Had some problems... Really?

668
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:15,808
No. Kevin doesn't have an elephant
heart, but he is very sensitive,

669
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:19,149
and it won't kill Erin to just go and
have lunch with him in the break room,

670
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:20,986
like I promised him.

671
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:25,918
I bet his heart
is enlarged, though.

672
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:27,293
I don't want
anyone to die.

673
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:29,730
Just don't let
him sit on you.

674
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:32,296
I'm kidding.
You'll have fun.

675
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:35,429
It'll be good. It'll
be good. There he is.

676
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,870
Go to him.

677
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:38,802
Hi.
Hi.

678
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:43,713
Nice. She touched
my shoulder.

679
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:50,216
Hey, guys. We're short on
rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.

680
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:51,413
Oh.

681
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:53,515
Hi.
Hi.

682
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,387
Sorry.
Hi. So sorry.

683
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:56,954
Careful.

684
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,627
Wow, she just shoves
the nipple right in there.

685
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,895
I know.

686
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:09,470
Did you see that?
I'm pretty sure she's...

687
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:12,666
Hey.

688
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:22,542
Did you grow up
around here?

689
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:24,579
No.

690
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,555
So, you must have grown up
around somewhere else?

691
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:31,785
Yes.

692
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:38,932
Why was I hiding
behind the plant?

693
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:41,300
Well, in college
I took a botany class,

694
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:44,363
and there was lots of
drama in that class. Uh...

695
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:47,968
Kids would gossip about me,
so I would eavesdrop on them

696
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:51,781
by hiding behind different
plants in the botany class.

697
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:54,677
And then they
would say things like,

698
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,378
"Oh, this guy's gonna
fail this class,"

699
00:30:56,453 --> 00:31:00,514
or, "What's this guy doing
spying on us from behind plants?"

700
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:02,183
And then I would
jump out at them

701
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,557
and confront them
and be like,

702
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:08,894
"You think all I do is hide behind
plants and spy on people? Busted."

703
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,431
Oh. The reason?

704
00:31:11,902 --> 00:31:13,961
The reason I was hiding behind
that plant in this situation

705
00:31:14,037 --> 00:31:18,030
was that I thought that Erin and
Kevin were kind of hitting it off,

706
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:19,905
and I was jealous.

707
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,473
Uh, hi. Pam Halpert?

708
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:25,572
Yes.

709
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,514
Hi, I'm Clarke.

710
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:31,145
Josie said you might benefit
from a lactation consultant.

711
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,646
Yep.

712
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:34,054
Um, yeah,
that would be great.

713
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:36,149
Really great.
When's she available?

714
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,251
Actually, I'm the consultant.

715
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,961
Got milk?

716
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,226
All right, let's see
what we're working with.

717
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:51,305
So, the biggest thing besides not
being able to get her to latch...

718
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,036
I'll get that for you.
Oh, thank you.

719
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,943
...is that I can't tell
if I'm really producing.

720
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:57,708
I don't know if she's
getting anything.

721
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,271
Let me feel here.
Okay.

722
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:00,714
Yeah,
it's quite full.

723
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:01,808
Why don't you put your
hand on top of my hand?

724
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:03,853
Okay. When you're feeding you want

725
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:07,322
to press in like this, make
your hand in a C. Does that hurt?

726
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,985
No, it feels pressure.
Okay.

727
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,153
You sure it doesn't hurt? No.

728
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,355
It just feels like pressure.

729
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,330
- Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?
- Mmm-hmm.

730
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:16,798
Like that? It's stimulated. Mmm-hmm.

731
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,027
Yep. Yep.
- Mmm-hmm.

732
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:20,967
So you just want
to do that and that will...

733
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:22,130
Perfect.

734
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,465
The baby
should grab onto that.

735
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,598
I think she will.

736
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:27,508
I'm just not sure if I'm releasing,
though. I'm not sure if...

737
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:28,976
- We'll figure it out, probably.
- It doesn't...

738
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,513
Why don't you bring
your baby over here?

739
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,138
Okay.

740
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:33,506
She's beautiful. Yes.

741
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:34,914
Oh, thank you.

742
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,014
Congratulations.
Thank you.

743
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,714
Well, you're doing a good
job. Just stay relaxed

744
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,451
and I'll come back in a
bit to check on you. Okay?

745
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,152
Okay.
Please do.

746
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:48,023
Oh, shoot. Shoot,
she fell off.

747
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:49,696
Oh. Uh...

748
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:51,165
Try the torpedo thing.

749
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:52,758
Will you just grab
Clarke real quick?

750
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:55,327
No need. I saw him
do it. I can try it.

751
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:58,772
Jim, please, please, please. I think
it would be weird if you did it.

752
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:02,005
That makes sense. I'll
just go get the other guy.

753
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:05,446
Hey, what's up, kid?

754
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:09,611
Have you had a chance to look over the
revisions on the contract I prepared for you?

755
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:13,520
Nothing left to do except dot
the I's, the J's and the umlauts.

756
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:17,821
Why don't you meet me here
at exactly mid-late afternoon?

757
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:20,089
I look forward to it.

758
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:21,289
Very well.

759
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:22,793
Goodbye.

760
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,633
Jim. Jim, get her.

761
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:31,833
Hmm?

762
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:34,342
Get the baby.
Get her, come on.

763
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,674
Okay.
I know, I know.

764
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,984
Okay. Come here.

765
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:52,959
All right.
I got her.

766
00:33:56,867 --> 00:34:01,964
Okay. Okay. Okay.

767
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:08,003
Jim. She latched.
She latched!

768
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,136
That's amazing.

769
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:11,874
Oh, my God. I didn't even
have to do the C thing.

770
00:34:11,948 --> 00:34:13,279
That's awesome.

771
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,341
Oh! We're doing it.

772
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:16,611
That's great.

773
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,313
We're really parents now.

774
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:22,458
Kevin, Erin would like
a few words with you.

775
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:23,953
Hey.
Hi.

776
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:25,358
I've really enjoyed
our time together.

777
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,657
Yeah. Me, too.

778
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,129
I want to continue
working on our friendship...

779
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:29,392
It was really, really fun.

780
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,559
...'Cause I think our friendship
could be a really cool thing.

781
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:32,829
Yeah. Me, too.

782
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,495
And you're my friend.

783
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,770
Yeah. I hope that I'm your friend.

784
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,932
Yeah.
And...

785
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:39,407
Oh, my God.
This is agonizing.

786
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:44,140
Look, Kevin, do you really think
that you could have dated Erin?

787
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,346
You said she liked me.

788
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:49,384
Okay, even if someone told
you that, you should know

789
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:52,251
that that could
never be possible, Kevin.

790
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:55,456
And I'm surprised that you didn't
question me in the first place.

791
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:56,822
I've done better
than Erin.

792
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:57,917
No, you haven't.

793
00:34:57,994 --> 00:34:59,757
Lynn was way hotter
than Erin, Michael.

794
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,298
Lynn was as hot as Erin.

795
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:06,263
Yeah, Michael, but
you dated Holly and Jan

796
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:08,236
and they were so
much hotter than you.

797
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,671
This isn't about me,
and that is debatable,

798
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,834
and I have a personality,
whereas you...

799
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,241
Yes, Andy?

800
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:22,910
Kev.

801
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:26,146
Nice going.

802
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:30,725
Knock-knock.

803
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,029
Oh, hey, Isabel.

804
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:35,189
Oh, hey.

805
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:39,364
Pam, she's gorgeous.
Can I hold her?

806
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:40,494
Yes.

807
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:42,034
She was a little
fussy earlier,

808
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,130
but she's totally
quieted down.

809
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:48,075
Here. Let me just burp her. I
don't want her to spit up on you.

810
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,045
Look at you.
Come here, sweetie.

811
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,076
Oh, my God.
- What?

812
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:56,310
Wrong baby.
What?

813
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:58,581
Wrong baby.
This is not our baby!

814
00:35:58,655 --> 00:35:59,747
Oh, my God.

815
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,169
Oh.

816
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,111
Has she been
fussing long?

817
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,207
No. Not at all.
Perfect.

818
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,078
I was out like a light. Hey!

819
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,151
She's not hungry.

820
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:47,263
How's it going?
Well,

821
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:49,999
I feel like she needs to eat,
but she just won't latch on,

822
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:51,563
which is weird,
because the other baby...

823
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:57,170
Bottles are fine. A lot of
babies grow up using bottles.

824
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,679
So, you excited to
take your baby home?

825
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,148
We definitely are.
At 3:00, right?

826
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,310
You said we could
stay until 3:00?

827
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:03,909
Yeah. You can.

828
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:05,852
It's 2:35.
Half hour.

829
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,616
Well, 25 minutes.

830
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,150
And you're all set
with the car seat?

831
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,194
Yes. Car seat's
right there.

832
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,853
That bottom part
needs to go in the car.

833
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,829
Newsflash, the whole thing
needs to go in the car.

834
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,061
Be back in 25 minutes.

835
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:20,500
Or it can be a half hour,
if you need it to be.

836
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,663
Can we get
a late checkout?

837
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,832
I don't think
she heard me.

838
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:27,703
Hello?

839
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:32,748
Dwight? What...
What are you doing here?

840
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,440
Isabel, hello.

841
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:40,156
Yeah, the kitchen
was disgusting, so...

842
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,315
Wow.

843
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,115
New cabinets.
Yeah.

844
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:44,558
All I did was bring
macaroni and cheese.

845
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,524
Where's the fridge?

846
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:50,259
Oh, it's in the backyard.
I'll take this.

847
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:53,927
Well, I'll let you
get back to it.

848
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:56,199
Hey, listen, I know that I'm an adult,

849
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:59,071
but maybe I could come by
sometime for a teeth cleaning?

850
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,042
You know, just for fun.

851
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:04,641
Well, adults are supposed
to go to the dentist, too.

852
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:09,481
Are they, now? How some
people spend their money, right?

853
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,115
Yeah.
All right.

854
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:14,814
I'll call you, kid.

855
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:15,983
Do that.

856
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:21,325
You really sure
we should be leaving?

857
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:22,456
Yeah.

858
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:25,057
But you hear the baby
crying, right? Mmm-hmm.

859
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,164
Where's your car?

860
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,332
It's in the lot.

861
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:34,036
A lot of fathers
bring the car around.

862
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:39,681
Right. Okay. Yes. That
would be a smart thing to do.

863
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,414
Uh, Pam,
I will be right back.

864
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:43,247
Okay, please hurry.

865
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:47,780
Erin, I need you to send
this fax immediately.

866
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,656
It's really important,
so I'm gonna stand here

867
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:50,852
and wait for
the confirmation.

868
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,656
Okay. Good.

869
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,834
The fax says, "Erin, will you
have dinner with me? From, Andy."

870
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:02,633
And the number is
our office fax number.

871
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:05,203
It's
busy. Why don't I keep trying

872
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:06,469
and then I'll give you
the confirmation in a bit?

873
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:09,509
Sorry.
That's unacceptable.

874
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:13,140
I need you to send it
immediately or you're fired.

875
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:18,847
You can't talk to me like that.
I didn't do anything wrong.

876
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,449
I've been
having a tough day.

877
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:22,684
Oh, God, no.

878
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:24,820
Um...

879
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:26,859
Just read the fax.

880
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,158
You read the fax.

881
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,096
I'm asking you out.

882
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:37,131
Oh, my God.
That's amazing!

883
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,870
Let me just fax this
and I'll check my planner.

884
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,579
So, it's a date?
Yes!

885
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,349
Do you have
a day in mind?

886
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:49,908
Yeah, what day?
What day?

887
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,453
Every day is fine.

888
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:52,749
What's that one?

889
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:54,856
Thursday?
Okay. Let's do it.

890
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,323
We... Okay!

891
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,856
Would you like me to help
you up out of the chair?

892
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:01,763
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

893
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:03,321
We've just got a lot
of discharges today.

894
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,630
Okay. Okay.

895
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:06,726
Thanks.

896
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:07,861
All right, thanks.

897
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:09,029
All right.

898
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:20,343
Hey. You want to eat?
You want to try eating?

899
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:24,078
Okay.

900
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,615
Okay. Come here.

901
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:33,519
Just you and me.
Just you and me. Come on.

902
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,197
There we go.

903
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:41,531
Yeah. Oh, yeah!

904
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:46,239
Like that. Oh.
There we go.

905
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,536
You got it.

906
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:50,340
Five tickets on
the windshield.

907
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,679
Hey.
Hi.

908
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:58,584
We did it.

909
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,415
You used my move,
didn't you?

910
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,483
I used a variation
of your move.

911
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:07,926
There is no
greater feeling

912
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:11,192
than when two people who
are perfect for each other

913
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:14,168
overcome all obstacles
and find true love.

914
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:19,272
And that's what I thought that Erin
and Kevin were going to find today.

915
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:25,508
I think I'm going
to be sick.

916
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:33,522
Two forms of ID, please.

917
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,454
And now you.
Two forms of ID, please.

918
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:48,362
All right, all is in order.
I just need your signature.

919
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:53,673
What is it?

920
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:58,341
Nothing.

921
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,752
All right. How would
you like to celebrate?

922
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,057
Just pour yourself a cup
of apple juice. I feel sick.

923
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,357
What?

924
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:16,557
I couldn't find your iPod.

925
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:26,074
Give me a couple days.
Be out of your hair.
