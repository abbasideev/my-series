1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,697
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,206
Who would like an authentic
New York bagel, hmm?

3
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:09,604
Stanley?
Thank you.

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:13,202
Oh, no, no, no. I got a
pumpernickel just for you.

5
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:15,644
Wow, H&H.

6
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:18,774
You went all the way to New
York City to get us bagels?

7
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,479
Why? Is there a place
closer that sells them?

8
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,077
This is really nice, Dwight.
Thanks.

9
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:24,179
Thanks.

10
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:25,553
Oh, don't mention it.

11
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:28,559
You owe me one.
You all owe me one.

12
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:30,561
Good morning, Michael.
Morning, Dwight.

13
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:31,618
Hungry?

14
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,631
No, I had
a fish stick sandwich.

15
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,394
Actually, I had two
fish stick sandwiches.

16
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,230
My girlfriend
didn't want hers,

17
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:39,862
because I guess I'm the
only aphrodisiac she needs.

18
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:41,496
Fish sticks are not
an aphrodisiac. Yeah.

19
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:43,370
You're thinking of deer penis.
It worked.

20
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:45,774
Regardless, that was over
two hours ago,

21
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:48,574
and it is now a scientific
fact that you are hungry.

22
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:50,046
Bagel?

23
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:51,480
I don't mind if I do.

24
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,245
Okay, I brought cheese, too.

25
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,512
I'm taking one
for my lady friend.

26
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:55,644
Excellent.

27
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,382
Brain food.
Thank you very much.

28
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:58,445
Okay.

29
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:00,983
You owe me.

30
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,392
Can't a guy just buy
some bagels for his friends,

31
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:05,327
so they'll owe him
a favor which he can use

32
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:10,232
to get someone fired who stole a
co-manager position from him anymore?

33
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:14,329
Jeez, when did everyone
get so cynical?

34
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:38,460
Pam, would you
care for a bagel?

35
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,554
Oh, no, thank you.

36
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:42,862
Oh, that's right, you're a woman and
you need to refuse food the first time.

37
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,903
I'll try again.

38
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,200
Please, Pam, reconsider
and have a bagel.

39
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,103
I have an early lunch.

40
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,169
Michael's been trying
to get Jim and me to hang out

41
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,269
ever since he started
dating my mom.

42
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:57,179
I don't know. I really hoped
this thing would just die out,

43
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:00,343
but today he's planning a
birthday lunch for my mom.

44
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,080
And we have to go.

45
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,153
No way out.

46
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:07,122
No way out.

47
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:10,120
These are amazing.
You took all these?

48
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:13,289
I've always found beauty
in uncommon places.

49
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,663
Homeless people, graffiti.

50
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,998
Photography lets
me capture all that.

51
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,662
Have you ever been
photographed before?

52
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:20,966
Oh, just by,
like, friends.

53
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,167
Well, here's what I've
been doing around here.

54
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:27,041
It's for a series on
exposure in the workplace.

55
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,205
Pammy?
Hey!

56
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:31,674
Hey!

57
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,274
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

58
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,946
Girls, there they are.

59
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,352
Birthday lunch.
Birthday lunch.

60
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:41,290
There's no better medicine
than birthday lunch.

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,851
It'll cure all of your,

62
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:46,864
"Gee, I don't know if Michael
should be dating my mother."

63
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:49,958
And fixes all
occurrences of,

64
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:52,367
"I don't really
see them together."

65
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,961
So, open wide, Pam,

66
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,065
and take a big old spoonful
of birthday lunch medicine.

67
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,473
Take with food.

68
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:03,374
Pam, aren't you going to introduce
us to Michael's girlfriend?

69
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:05,439
I think you guys all remember
my mom from the wedding.

70
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,314
Yeah, I think everyone's met Helene. Hi.

71
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,375
Shall we?
Wait a minute,

72
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:10,250
is that another
birthday present for me?

73
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,552
'Cause you already
gave me a necklace.

74
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:13,613
Oh, my God, I love it.

75
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,683
Tell her how you gave it to
me. No, that wouldn't be...

76
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,162
He put it around my neck while
I was still asleep this morning.

77
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,459
Nice way to wake up.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:24,468
The rest of the story has been
censored due to inappropriocity.

79
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,333
Because of sex?
Kevin!

80
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:28,703
Hey, please, Kevin.
You're fired.

81
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:32,075
Sorry, sorry, work with a
bunch of idiots. Shall we go?

82
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,509
Yes, let's go.

83
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,576
Oh, wait.

84
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:38,844
Swartz Lumber's on the phone for
you, Pam. And they say it's urgent.

85
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,181
Oh, you guys,
just one second.

86
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,621
Oh, my gosh.

87
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,884
Are you serious?

88
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,719
Shipping emergency.

89
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,056
I don't think
I can go to lunch.

90
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:53,461
Oh, man, that's crazy. Right
as we were on our way out, too.

91
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,500
I know. Isn't that
always how it goes?

92
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,831
Rarely, if ever.

93
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,131
Let me give it a whirl,
I'll talk to them.

94
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,432
I will handle it.
That's okay.

95
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:02,268
I feel like it's...
It's my pleasure.

96
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,502
Hello? Well, that's great.

97
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:06,567
Turns out, the paper
was there all along.

98
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,135
Oh, thank God.

99
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:12,411
Something's up. That paper
was never supposed to arrive.

100
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,376
So, Pammy, are you
still liking sales?

101
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:17,081
Yeah, it's exciting.

102
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:21,991
You know, Michael
and I were talking,

103
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,187
and maybe, if you
put in a little more

104
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:28,029
face-to-face time with your clients,
you could improve your sales.

105
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,567
Pam's sales
are fine, actually.

106
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:32,069
Just want you
to succeed, Pammy.

107
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,503
You know what, we shouldn't even
be talking about business today.

108
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:35,562
Thank you.

109
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:37,472
Today's about family.

110
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,636
Why did I get in the
car? I could've struggled.

111
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:43,306
I have a whistle in my
purse, I didn't even blow it.

112
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,708
Oh, Dwight, I have a
little surprise for you.

113
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:50,721
Let me guess, you ate the
bagel I gave you and loved it.

114
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:51,983
Yes.

115
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,825
And I wanted to
return the favor.

116
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,123
I was polishing my loafers
and I happened to look over

117
00:04:57,195 --> 00:05:00,221
and notice that your briefcase
was a little worse for the wear,

118
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,994
so a little elbow grease,

119
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:05,525
and she's polished right
up, back to her former glory.

120
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:08,038
Well.
Feel it against your cheek.

121
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:09,898
I will.

122
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,943
You give me a gift,
bam, thank you note.

123
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,444
You invite me somewhere,
pow, RSVP.

124
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:18,241
You do me a favor,
wham, favor returned.

125
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,448
Do not test my politeness.

126
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,182
Let me get that door
for you. There we go.

127
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,951
Thank you very much,
and I got it for you.

128
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:28,857
Oh! Goodness. Thanks.

129
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:31,157
You know, here's
a healthy fitness tip,

130
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,924
if you clench your buttocks
together while walking,

131
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,693
you can really take the
pressure off your knees.

132
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,393
- Is that right?
- Observe.

133
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,994
Right?
That really works.

134
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,165
Yeah. Feel free to use that.
Anytime, okay.

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,935
Hey, hold on a second.

136
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,274
Do not walk around with
your jacket catawampus.

137
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,177
And that needs to be
straight as an arrow.

138
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:51,442
Thank you very much.

139
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:54,513
Oh, boy. Hey, thank
you very much for that.

140
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:57,350
You are welcome.
Have a seat. Allow me.

141
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:59,322
Have a seat yourself.

142
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,291
You know what? I am
going to preemptively

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,329
change the batteries
in your wireless mouse.

144
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,488
Not necessary.
No, no, no!

145
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,930
You didn't have to do that.

146
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,694
Andy is complicating things.

147
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,396
But I'm not worried.
This will only up my game.

148
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,166
Hello. Scott.
Table for four.

149
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:19,733
Welcome, Scott family.
It'll be just a moment.

150
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,837
I used to love coming here.
The chicken parm is good.

151
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:27,476
Big part of my childhood. Maybe
Michael will start dating that, too.

152
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:30,521
What table should we take?
So many to choose from.

153
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,285
Wow.
Oh, my God.

154
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:38,762
What? All I see are boring old
tables with no birthday decorations.

155
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,425
Oh, wait a second,
you mean this one? Wow!

156
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,468
Michael, you did all this?

157
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,731
It's not about taking credit.
Let's just say we all did it.

158
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,796
Well, thank you,
all of you.

159
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:52,105
Well, it was actually
me alone, so...

160
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,576
Wow, look at this place.

161
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,510
It really makes me want
to go to Italy someday.

162
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,481
Oh, you'll love it.
You can have my guidebooks.

163
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,415
I think I'm done with those
really long plane rides.

164
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:02,316
Thank you for...

165
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,082
Thanks for
lending me the books.

166
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,647
So, Mom, which birthday
are we celebrating this year?

167
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:08,852
Sticking with 49.

168
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,258
Forty-nine again?

169
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:13,388
That's nine years in a row. This
is now our longest family tradition.

170
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,194
That's funny.

171
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,064
Well, as long as
we're running numbers, Pam,

172
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,363
help me out with this one.

173
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,871
Let's see, honey,
you're six months pregnant,

174
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,500
but you've only been married for 30
days, so what does that add up to?

175
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:28,512
Ooh, burn, burn on you.
And a little bit on me, too.

176
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,639
You're 54 years old.

177
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:32,580
No, I'm 58.

178
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,214
You're 58 years old?

179
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,447
Uh-huh.

180
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,649
Congratulations.

181
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:41,283
The only time you should
care about a woman's age

182
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,883
is if she is
too young for you.

183
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:46,021
And I am not
robbing the cradle.

184
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:49,464
If anything,
I am robbing the grave.

185
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,464
Mom, have you decided
what you want to be called?

186
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:56,473
I mean, I like Nana, but I
also like the classic Grandma.

187
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,566
Please be Grandma. I want you to
be Grandma. Definitely a Grandma.

188
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,134
Michael.
What do you think? Grandma?

189
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,904
Uh-huh.

190
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,448
Yay! Grandma.

191
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:12,880
Hey, would you guys ever
do a triathlon, you think?

192
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,084
Maybe.

193
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,251
Helene?

194
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,885
No. I don't think so.

195
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:19,226
I am. I'm definitely going to do it.

196
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,629
I've already got the run
and the bike thing down,

197
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,635
just need to learn how
to swim. Come on, you in?

198
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:28,434
No, no. I think a triathlon is
pretty much something I can rule out.

199
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,668
I don't know, it just
doesn't interest me.

200
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:33,506
So, it's a matter of
interest. Good. Okay.

201
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,547
It's not anything you
would have ever done?

202
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,014
I might have done it
when I was younger,

203
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,074
but now there are just other
things I'd rather be doing

204
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:41,618
than running and jumping
and swimming...

205
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,120
Well, there's no jumping
in a triathlon. Oh!

206
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:45,588
You're thinking
the broad jump.

207
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:48,683
Would you try bungee jumping?
No.

208
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,921
Snowboarding? No, no, you
want to go snowboarding?

209
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,691
I might, I might.

210
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,595
Michael, what are
you talking about?

211
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,499
Nothing, just life

212
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:05,039
and doing things before
you die. I don't know.

213
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,807
Do I really want to
go snowboarding? No.

214
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,077
But I would like to
if I wanted to.

215
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:18,880
What's going on in here?

216
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,049
Andy bought lunch.

217
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,752
Oh, no, really?

218
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:22,850
Yep, yep.

219
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,419
Took a page right out of the
old Schrute book of niceness.

220
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,658
There is no book,
there's only a survival guide.

221
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,996
You bought
breakfast for everyone,

222
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,399
so I got
lunch for everyone.

223
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:34,370
Okay, well, allow me.
You know what?

224
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,237
Gosh, these tacos are
awfully complicated to make.

225
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,436
I will make
everyone's tacos!

226
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,974
So we should
get the check.

227
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:44,948
What about your gift, Michael?
Whoa, no, no, no.

228
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,576
No, it's stupid.
You'd hate it, I hate it.

229
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:49,176
I'm sure I won't.
Yes, you will.

230
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,121
He locked himself in his office
all morning working on it.

231
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,158
Give me. Look at
this wrapping paper.

232
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,659
It's got the word "love"
on it in every language.

233
00:09:56,728 --> 00:10:00,926
I literally... I put no thought
into the wrapping at all.

234
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,365
Might as well
have been toilet paper.

235
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,733
Toilet paper. Let's see.

236
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:10,434
"A scrapbook of our first
memories, by Michael Gary Scott,

237
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,875
"for my girlfriend,
Helene, on your birthday."

238
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,539
That's just an
arbitrary title.

239
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,980
Okay, here's a penny.

240
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,539
What's that from?
Penny for your thoughts.

241
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,347
It was from the wishing
well at the mall.

242
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,515
You threw it in, I went back
later, waded in, and I found it.

243
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,579
That's amazing.

244
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:30,992
It's not amazing at all. It's sort
of weird that I went and did that.

245
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,225
And now your wish won't
come true, so that blows.

246
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:37,200
A poem. Oh, that I plagiarized, I think.

247
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:41,204
"I cannot go to school today
said little Peggy Ann McKay"

248
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,068
Shel Silverstein?
Yeah.

249
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,665
"I have the measles
and the mumps

250
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:47,007
"a gash, a rash,
and purple bumps

251
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,670
"And my teacher's
really mean

252
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:52,183
"Happy Birthday,
I love you, Helene."

253
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,218
It's really
nice, Michael.

254
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:55,513
I think it sucks.

255
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,217
I think it's wonderful,
absolutely wonderful.

256
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:00,280
Well, that's because you and
I have very different tastes,

257
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,258
and you like lame things.

258
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,455
It's a generational
sort of gap between us.

259
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,158
Oh, God, a scrapbook.

260
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,495
Home run, Michael.

261
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,932
You set the bar so high.

262
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,060
That was a bunt.

263
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,999
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dwight,
I'm going to do this.

264
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:18,201
Hey, hey, hey, relax.
I got it covered.

265
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,470
No, I insist.

266
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,478
No, no, no, no, no, I insist.

267
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,013
Okay, Dwight,
this is ridiculous.

268
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,278
Don't worry about it,
you can just owe me.

269
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,018
Hey, where'd you go?

270
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,521
Oh, I just went
to the bathroom.

271
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,989
And then you stopped at
the bar on the way back?

272
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,583
Got thirsty.

273
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,026
Okay, weirdo.
Come on, it's time for cake.

274
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,393
Okay.

275
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:40,692
Honestly, for a long time,

276
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,563
I thought I was going
to grow old with Holly.

277
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:47,902
And then I met Helene,
and she is great,

278
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:51,567
and she already knows
and has done everything

279
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:56,410
that I have ever wanted to
do and can tell me about it.

280
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:01,912
But I think I want to
do those things myself.

281
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,244
Cake's really good.

282
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:06,256
I know. I love when they
use butter-cream frosting.

283
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,916
Finish your cake, Helene.

284
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,227
I want you to
enjoy that cake

285
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,696
because I have something
terrible I need to tell you.

286
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:17,326
And I want you
to enjoy your cake

287
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:20,530
before I tell you this
terrible, terrible thing.

288
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,311
Helene, I think you're
a wonderful person and I...

289
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,243
God, I've enjoyed
dating you

290
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:31,111
and being your
boyfriend so much,

291
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:36,950
but I have to consider Pam's
feelings as a friend and a coworker.

292
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:41,287
I cannot, in good conscience,
continue to date you,

293
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,418
when I know what
this is doing to her.

294
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:46,396
Michael. Michael, it's okay.

295
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,761
No, it's not.

296
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:50,300
I know that it took me a
little while to come around,

297
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:53,360
and it's still a little
weird to get used to,

298
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:57,505
but you obviously
make my mom very happy.

299
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,177
And that makes me happy.

300
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,775
Wow, that just...
You've really grown.

301
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,410
Well...
Oh, thank you, Pam.

302
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:11,785
And I hope you are as
gracious during this next part.

303
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:16,551
Helene, once again,
you are a wonderful person,

304
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,095
and you have
lived a great life,

305
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:21,894
and I envy it, and I want it
someday, but just in the future.

306
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,358
You need somebody who
understands your references.

307
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:26,562
Who is Kafka-esque?

308
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,731
I've never...
I don't know him.

309
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:33,774
There's another woman,
and her name is Italy,

310
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,143
and skydiving,
and bungee jumping.

311
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:37,641
Okay, so...

312
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,080
And I want kids.

313
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,051
And you, unfortunately,
have already completed

314
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,951
that part of your journey
down there. Michael.

315
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,047
It's not my decision,
it's Mother Nature.

316
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:48,922
And Mother has very
strict rules about

317
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,502
fertility.

318
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,765
I got it.

319
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,731
I'm 58. What am I
supposed to do now?

320
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:07,708
Well, hobbies.
Stop.

321
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,477
What's going on?
Stupid thing wedged up there.

322
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:14,745
No one in this
office will help me.

323
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:16,252
Yeah, move it.

324
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,789
What if Dwight dies and
I still owe him something?

325
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,791
That is a recipe
for a ghost.

326
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,759
Oh, yeah, you're gonna owe me big time.

327
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,158
Looks like a little
envelope, there you go.

328
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,197
Yup. Got it.
"To Dwight"?

329
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,327
Starbucks gift card.

330
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:32,960
Surprise!

331
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,807
It's from everybody.
$15 value.

332
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,539
Damn it! I am no closer
to taking Jim down.

333
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,676
What a waste of a day.

334
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:47,582
I could've grown poison mushrooms
that'd be this high by now!

335
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,683
They're mushrooms,
they don't get that high.

336
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,717
Pamela Beesly-Halpert.
What?

337
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,383
May I have a word with
you in my office, please?

338
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,449
I am working.

339
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:59,519
Well, this is
a work-related matter.

340
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:01,064
Really?
Yes.

341
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,264
Really?
Yes.

342
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,995
Join me, please,
won't you?

343
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,935
I'm going to give you
a raise, Pam.

344
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,067
Why?

345
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:14,304
Because of all the
good work you've done.

346
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,347
I have the lowest sales
record of anyone here.

347
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,575
Don't, no.
It's not about numbers Pam,

348
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,981
it's about attitude.

349
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:22,884
I have the worst attitude
of any person here.

350
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,514
Do you want
the raise or what?

351
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,648
Yeah, I'll take it.

352
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:28,749
Okay, hey. Pam, Pam.

353
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,420
With this raise,
there are strings attached.

354
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:37,264
And that string is attached from
my heart to your mean attitude.

355
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:38,597
You're bribing me?

356
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,833
No, no. No, I am not.
Unless you want me to.

357
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,032
Do you want me to?

358
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:45,371
Because I will,
I will bribe you.

359
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:51,848
No, your face is saying don't,
unless I haven't offered you enough.

360
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,676
Your face isn't changing.

361
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:58,617
What is it?
Talk to me, face.

362
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,590
Tell me what
Pam's brain is thinking.

363
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:04,559
Come on, what do you
want? What do you want?

364
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,120
Do you want a million
dollars? Do you want to hit me?

365
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:08,825
Do you want me to get down
on one knee and beg you?

366
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,925
I want to hit you.
What?

367
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,697
I want to hit you.
I'll do that.

368
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,634
Okay.

369
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,005
What? I don't...
Are you kidding?

370
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:19,168
No, are you kidding?

371
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:21,438
No, I don't...

372
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:23,412
All right. Come on,
I'll take off my jacket

373
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,915
and tense my stomach
and you just...

374
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:29,750
No, I don't think I can
hit you in the office.

375
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,288
Okay.

376
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,824
So, we'll do it after work.
Hmm.

377
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,519
In the parking lot,
in front of everyone.

378
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:38,759
I'm going to hit you
as hard as I can.

379
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,593
Okay.

380
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:41,689
Okay.
Okay.

381
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,700
See you then.
See you.

382
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:48,664
Hey.
Hi.

383
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,605
Quick question.
Yeah.

384
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:53,070
Are you scared?

385
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:54,509
Never.

386
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,706
About what? A little.
What are you talking about?

387
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,715
We heard about the punch.
What punch?

388
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:01,650
Pam. She's going to punch the
crap out of your face after work.

389
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,687
I'm pretty sure we said slap.

390
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:06,656
No, it's a punch and Pam has
that crazy pregnancy strength now.

391
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm getting concerned that
you don't seem to understand

392
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,193
what's going to happen.
Do you?

393
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:15,327
I'm good.

394
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,389
All right. See you there.

395
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,527
Hey.
Hey.

396
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:21,868
Do you and Pam ever get
frisky? Inappropriate.

397
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,772
I mean, do you ever
wrestle with each other?

398
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:26,070
All the time.
Really?

399
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,168
Yeah.
She's strong?

400
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,269
She wants it bad, Michael.

401
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,540
Can you stop this?

402
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,548
I can.
Okay.

403
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,550
And I don't support
her choice to hit you.

404
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:34,778
I don't, either.

405
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:37,184
But at the same time,
she goes crazy,

406
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,689
and I do
understand her reasoning.

407
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,884
Mmm-hmm. I know.

408
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,950
I just need some time. I need
some time to think about it.

409
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:45,757
You got to do... Give me
some time to make a decision.

410
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,390
How much time do you need? No
more than a week, maybe two weeks.

411
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,455
Come on, man.

412
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,962
Pam, can I talk
to you for a second?

413
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,300
I heard about the hit. Just to be sure,

414
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,964
it's off company property, right? Right.

415
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,440
Yeah, okay, I think we
should probably be okay.

416
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,942
Okay.
Okay.

417
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:05,508
And the power
comes from the back foot.

418
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,444
So, it's all one motion
through the body.

419
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:14,252
So, there's... You stay a
little low and there's a twist,

420
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,656
and you keep
your shoulder down.

421
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:17,956
And you kind of
throw out the arm.

422
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:23,359
Okay, wait, you're saying
it comes from the foot?

423
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:24,423
Yes.

424
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:25,526
Okay.

425
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,096
Yeah. Okay.

426
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:30,231
Hey, everybody.

427
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,902
He's not in the men's room,
although the seat was warm,

428
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,410
so we may have
just missed him.

429
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,741
My money's on Pam.

430
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,577
It's not a fight. What
other outcome could there be?

431
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:39,707
Michael could win.

432
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:41,615
How? He can't hit back.

433
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,712
Why can't you just
agree with me sometimes?

434
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,155
Am I scared of getting
hit in the face? No.

435
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:50,251
Every day, weirdos pay
dominatrixes hundreds of dollars

436
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,023
for that very privilege.

437
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,793
I'm scared I'm going
to love it. Let's do this.

438
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,726
It's okay, guys. I can handle
this. Everybody can go home.

439
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,772
We're here for
the show, Michael.

440
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,932
You're just
a bunch of voyeurs.

441
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,100
Are you eating popcorn?

442
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,473
It has almost no calories.

443
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:07,875
You ready?

444
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,138
Yes.

445
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,045
You have to keep your
hands down. I know.

446
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:17,013
Okay. All right.

447
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:19,446
Oh, God!

448
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,821
Michael, you have to
keep your hands down.

449
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,189
Put your hands
in your pockets.

450
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,557
Okay!

451
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,231
Pam, Pam.

452
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:35,138
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,071
What are you sorry for?
So many things.

454
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,608
I don't know,
it's hard to choose.

455
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:39,768
How about for dating my mom?

456
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:40,902
Maybe that's it.

457
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:42,309
And dumping her
on her birthday?

458
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,608
Yes.

459
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:53,222
Okay, just don't ever date
a member of my family again.

460
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:56,653
Okay, I promise.

461
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,592
For the record,
your mom came on to me.

462
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,564
Holy crap!

463
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,197
Are you okay?
No!

464
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,671
You're okay.

465
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:12,066
Feel better?

466
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:13,542
No, you were right.

467
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:17,639
Wait, why are you limping?

468
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:19,046
I don't know.

469
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:20,879
Let's get some
raw meat on that face.

470
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,977
I've got a chicken
in the freezer upstairs.

471
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:27,514
As I watched Pam's big, strong
hand coming toward my face,

472
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:30,686
I saw my entire life
flash before my eyes.

473
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:33,229
And guess what?
I have four kids.

474
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:38,157
And I have a hover car
and a hover house.

475
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,137
And my wife is a runner,
and it shows.

476
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:46,701
And Pam and Jim are my best
friends, and our kids play together.

477
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:49,974
And I'm happy.

478
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,538
And I am rich
and I never die.

479
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,184
It doesn't sound like much,
but it's enough for me.

480
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,781
Good, good, just keep it on
there for another five minutes.

481
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,760
It's cold, Dwight.
Let the swelling go down.

482
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:08,287
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
I owe you one, Dwight.

483
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,094
Fire Jim.

484
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,636
No.

485
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:15,433
I'm cashing in
the favor, fire him.

486
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:16,564
What are you talking...
Do it.

487
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,370
Promote me.
Tri-managers.

488
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,500
Forget that.

489
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:20,635
Can I have an office?
No.

490
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,440
You know what, you can
keep your stupid favor.

491
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:23,844
It's worthless.

492
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:27,179
And this is my dinner on
your face, I'm keeping it.

493
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,850
Oh, that feels better.
