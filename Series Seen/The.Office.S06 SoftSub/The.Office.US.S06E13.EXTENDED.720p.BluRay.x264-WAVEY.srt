1
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:03,967
Attention, everyone!

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,970
Jim and I, on behalf of
the Party Planning Committee

3
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,972
have an... Too loud.
Too, too loud. Too loud.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,409
But effective. Look. On behalf
of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:15,305
Merry Christmas.

6
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:16,678
Merry Christmas. Good.

7
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:19,684
My diabolical plot is
on hold for Christmas.

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,019
My heart just melts with the
sound of children singing.

9
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:31,429
Not really. I'm just tired. The
days are short. I don't know.

10
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:33,694
Maybe I'm depressed.

11
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,726
It is time to
unveil the tree.

12
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:36,961
Hey, Rockefeller Center!

13
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,128
Yeah.

14
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:39,568
Uh, I've actually
been to Rock Center

15
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:40,696
and this is
nothing like that.

16
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:42,240
This is all we have.
Ugh!

17
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:43,706
Nope, it's not "ugh."

18
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:46,004
It is office
camaraderie.

19
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:47,272
It is warm feelings.

20
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,143
Why don't we talk more
about it instead of doing it?

21
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:51,910
Thirty, 29, 28...

22
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:53,383
Why would you start so high? 27...

23
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,441
Three, two, one.

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,509
...26...

25
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:56,745
Ooh!

26
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:58,016
You didn't decorate it.

27
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,079
No.
Exactly.

28
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:02,218
We didn't, because we think it
would be better to do it together.

29
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:04,159
Everyone. Why would
you wrap it in a sheet

30
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,288
if you're not
covering anything up?

31
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,265
Is... Is it fake?
Pam.

32
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:13,495
Yes! We are unveiling an
artificial tree that will never die.

33
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:15,767
Yes. Like the spirit of Christmas.

34
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,069
And we're supposed
to applaud you

35
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,133
for taking a giant
diaper off a fake tree?

36
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:22,374
This was a successful
unveiling! Go back to work!

37
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,106
Merry Christmas.

38
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,971
Hello. Sorry, guys.
Sorry, guys.

39
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:51,108
I'm not sure I've earned the
right to make announcements yet,

40
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:53,542
but whoever is giving me
the 12 Days of Christmas

41
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:55,409
as my Secret Santa,

42
00:01:55,747 --> 00:02:01,310
please stop. I can't take it
anymore. My cat killed a turtledove.

43
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:05,023
The French hens have started
pulling out my hair to make a nest.

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,751
Please stop.

45
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,850
What psycho would
send that as a gift?

46
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:15,924
I begged Dwight and Jim to
give me Erin for Secret Santa,

47
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:18,333
and I decided to give Erin
the 12 Days of Christmas.

48
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:19,563
Bowtie time.

49
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:23,631
Is it my fault that the first eight
days there's basically 30 birds?

50
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,373
Ho! Ho! Ho!

51
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:30,108
Merry Christmas, boys and
girls. It's me, Santa Claus.

52
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,647
Hey, Santa.

53
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,407
They finally let you do it. Yeah.

54
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,577
Congrats, Phyl.

55
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:35,711
It's so edgy.

56
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,017
I have been wanting
to be Santa for years.

57
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,081
I believe I have
the right temperament

58
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,093
and the figure to
do the job well.

59
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:46,427
I slipped a note to Jim 11 weeks
ago, and he said I could do it.

60
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,659
It's been a long journey.

61
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,236
But I'm Santa Claus!

62
00:02:57,643 --> 00:03:00,407
So, Santa, what can we
expect from this party?

63
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,573
It's going to be a very jolly
time if you've been good.

64
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:04,980
What if you've been bad?

65
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,984
Then nothing but
a lump of coal for you.

66
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,815
What if you've been
really, really bad?

67
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,117
More evil than
strictly wrong.

68
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,681
Hey, Creed? We covered it. Lump of coal.

69
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,817
Yeah.

70
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,117
For the past several weeks,

71
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,062
my Secret Santa has been
giving me pieces of a machine

72
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,792
that I've been
attempting to assemble.

73
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,859
I'm suspicious of this, because
I had the exact same idea

74
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,332
for catching Osama bin Laden.

75
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,704
I would simply send him
a different piece each day.

76
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,503
He would assemble
it to find himself

77
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:35,374
in jail!

78
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,244
You know, Oscar, every
time I make this lasagna

79
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:41,582
people ask me if
it's a family recipe,

80
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,850
but really, I just get
the recipe from the box.

81
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,088
That's funny.

82
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,856
Is it funny? I thought it was
more interesting than funny.

83
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:58,530
I think my water
just broke.

84
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,935
That's too funny.

85
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,366
Oscar and
the warehouse guy.

86
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,734
Go, Oscar!
Go, gay warehouse guy!

87
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,106
Here's Santa!

88
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,914
Hey, little girl, what
would you like for Christmas?

89
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:16,851
Ooh! You have been a very
naughty girl, I see.

90
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,049
Michael, we already
have a Santa. Phyllis.

91
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,483
What the hell is going on?

92
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:25,293
Phyllis, Jim?
Phyllis is Santa?

93
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,689
Yeah.
Phyllis.

94
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:28,232
Yeah. I told her a long
time ago she could do it.

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,460
Take it back.
That is absurd.

96
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:30,592
No. I'm not gonna
do that.

97
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,136
No, Jim, come on!

98
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:33,364
I think she's
doing a good job.

99
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:36,168
Lately, there have been serious rumors
that our company's going bankrupt,

100
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,232
so David Wallace asked me
to keep morale high.

101
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:41,474
So I asked around about what
people wanted with Christmas,

102
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:43,772
and I told them
to get creative.

103
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:47,545
And they didn't really
get creative, exactly.

104
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:51,084
Secret Santa, karaoke, food,

105
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:54,483
kind of the usual thing that
we do here, which is great.

106
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,288
And people usually
argue about food,

107
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:58,522
so I told everybody
to bring their favorites.

108
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,957
I made an organized
signup sheet for karaoke

109
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,160
so that there was no fighting

110
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,168
and no crying.

111
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:08,695
I'm doing a good job, I think,
because this year,

112
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,901
I care.

113
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:15,110
It's weird. I know.

114
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,444
It's insane! A woman
Santa? Where does it stop?

115
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:23,079
No! Jim, this may be the last
Christmas that we have here.

116
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,919
Doesn't it make you
a tiny bit anxious,

117
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,323
me not playing Santa?
Come on!

118
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,229
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis
that she can't be Santa.

119
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:34,993
Fine. Then do it anonymously.
Ransom-note style. You can...

120
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,392
You know what?
I have a bunch of letters

121
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,959
cut out of magazines
in my desk.

122
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:40,061
You can use those.

123
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:41,730
If this were Russia,
yeah, sure,

124
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,297
everybody would
go to one Santa,

125
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,309
and there would be
a line around the block,

126
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:46,605
and once
you sat on her lap

127
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:47,770
and she asked you
what you wanted,

128
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,246
you would say,
probably, freedom,

129
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:53,943
at which point the KGB would
arrest you and send you to Siberia.

130
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,749
It's a good thing
Russia doesn't exist anymore.

131
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:57,911
Name?

132
00:05:58,223 --> 00:05:59,212
Kelly.

133
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:02,117
And what would you
like for Christmas?

134
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,822
I would like the
photographer, please, Santa.

135
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:05,885
We'll talk.

136
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,368
So far, people really seem
to like the party this year.

137
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,733
We took some chances
and it's working out.

138
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:16,741
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!

139
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:22,545
Why pay more to sit next to
old Trannie Claus over there

140
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,514
when you can sit
on my lap?

141
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:29,145
Phyllis is only pretending to
be a man. I'm the real thing!

142
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,056
Sit down on my lap
and there will be no doubt!

143
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,148
Okay.
Okay.

144
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,785
No, it's not,
like, penis-wise.

145
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,056
Hello, little boy!
What's your name?

146
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,658
Michael, it's me, Kevin.

147
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,700
Phyllis says
I'm too big for her lap.

148
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:48,673
Oh, I am so sorry that Phyllis
hates you and hates your body,

149
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,573
but Santa
remembers a reindeer

150
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,874
that was just a tiny
bit different as well.

151
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,538
When can I sit
on your lap?

152
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:59,243
Right now!
Come on over here, big boy!

153
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:02,612
There we go!
Oh, my God.

154
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:06,181
That's really
comfortable.

155
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:10,285
What would you like for
Christmas, little boy?

156
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,664
I don't know. I didn't know
you were gonna ask me that.

157
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,135
Well, what did you think
was going to happen?

158
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:23,163
I didn't know. Nobody's ever
let me sit on their lap before.

159
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,732
All right,
just say some toys, please.

160
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,506
Can you give me
some choices?

161
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,771
'Cause I really don't want
to mess up on this list.

162
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:31,816
Damn it, Kevin.
Come on.

163
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,079
What about if I tell you
the things I don't want?

164
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,280
Okay, get off!
Get off! Off!

165
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:40,691
Oh, God!

166
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,693
I didn't even get to
tell you what I wanted.

167
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,285
Okay, you know
what you get?

168
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:46,660
You get a thousand helium
balloons attached to you

169
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,995
so Santa doesn't have
to go through this again.

170
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,626
Awesome.

171
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:51,691
Foot's asleep.

172
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,136
Oh, God. My whole leg.

173
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:56,596
Oh, God.

174
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,199
Oh, God.

175
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,151
All right, that's better.
Who's next?

176
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,878
Well?

177
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,616
I'm trying, Phyllis.
You're Santa.

178
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,724
The only Santa.
That's what I want.

179
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:17,159
You promised me this. Don't
make me get Bob involved.

180
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,861
What would Bob do?

181
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,864
Never mind.
I shouldn't have said that.

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,392
Check it out.

183
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,766
In fourth grade, Bronwyn
Reinhart stabbed me with a pencil,

184
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:27,827
scarred me for life.

185
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:28,962
Oh!

186
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,430
Oh, yeah, I see it.

187
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,237
Yeah, so I know
how it feels.

188
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,505
Does it hurt?

189
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,739
It stings a lot.

190
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:37,604
Hmm.

191
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,844
I keep trying to figure out
who's sending me these gifts.

192
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,011
I know, right?

193
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,021
So far no one
will admit to it.

194
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,182
Is it you?

195
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:51,520
Yeah!

196
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,858
Totally.
I admit it. It's me.

197
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,162
Seriously?

198
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:58,996
Seriously?

199
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,971
Are you serious?
Is... What... Is it you?

200
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,174
When you're...
I don't... Are you...

201
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:05,334
Oh, no, no, no. I'm saying...
Are you asking...

202
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,399
I'm saying, are...
I don't...

203
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:08,507
It's you... No...
Is it...

204
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:13,341
Yeah. Totally serious. I'm
your Secret Santa. Busted!

205
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,585
There he is.

206
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,011
Hey, man.
Hey.

207
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,850
Is Matt around?
I've got his check.

208
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:23,883
Matt is on a delivery. Just
leave it here. I'll take it.

209
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,192
I'll just wait for him.

210
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,254
You'll wait?

211
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,068
You're gonna wait to give a
guy you don't know his check?

212
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:32,902
Spirit of Christmas.

213
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,529
Right. Christmas.

214
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:37,437
Matt's a pretty good-looking
dude, don't you think?

215
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:39,875
I'll just leave
it here with you.

216
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,435
All right,
thank you.

217
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,341
Come here!
Come here! Come here!

218
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm doing something
over here. Come on! Ah!

219
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,178
Ho! Ho! Ho!

220
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,155
Come on, I need
this. Come over here!

221
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:53,281
Just sit down!

222
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:54,518
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

223
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,855
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,155
Ryan and I are
just having some fun.

225
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,320
Can I just talk to
you for a second? Yeah.

226
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,227
No, now.
Okay, what?

227
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,826
You can't yell out,
"I need this, I need this,"

228
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,732
as you pin down
an employee on your lap.

229
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,794
Okay. You know what, Jim?

230
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:10,066
With two Santas in the room,
things get ruthless.

231
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,733
Yeah. Do you understand?
You forced my hand.

232
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,675
Michael, it's Phyllis.
We want Phyllis as Santa.

233
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:16,475
Do we? Do we?
Is that what we want?

234
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:17,913
Why don't we
take a vote on it?

235
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,972
Great.

236
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,449
Hey! Okay, everybody.

237
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,519
The office is being pulled
apart. I realize that.

238
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,489
There are traditions at stake.

239
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,150
And there are women...
Who wants Phyllis as Santa?

240
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:31,252
No, no, no! Wait! No!
There are other choices.

241
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:34,456
There's information that we...
Are you kidding me, Kevin?

242
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:35,999
After you almost killed me?

243
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,729
Michael, I had you.
I just want to try Phyllis.

244
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:42,000
And if you want Michael
as Santa, raise your hand.

245
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:44,867
Can I get you
some punch?

246
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:48,208
I... No, I'll get some punch.
That looks delicious.

247
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:51,443
Michael!

248
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:55,544
Excuse me.

249
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,986
Whoever has been sending me
the parts to this gun,

250
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:00,991
I think you sent me a gear
instead of a trigger.

251
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,027
How do you know it's a gun?

252
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:04,686
What else does it look like?

253
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,624
Not a gun.

254
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:09,257
Well, I don't have
all the pieces yet.

255
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:14,004
Well, unless the missing piece
is a gun, you don't have a gun.

256
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:16,938
Not a gun.

257
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:21,769
In the North Pole, I spend many
nights alone tinkering with toys.

258
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,247
So today, let's put a twinkle
in old Kris Kringle's eye.

259
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,749
Let the party begin!

260
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,488
I don't ask for much for
Christmas. I really don't.

261
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:43,557
It's not like I am begging
people to buy me diamonds

262
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,930
and broach pendants.

263
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:48,430
Oh!

264
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:52,339
"Buy me something expensive, or I'm
gonna kill myself." That's not...

265
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,675
I don't care about that!
All I want to be is Santa.

266
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:59,609
And you want to take that
away from me, fine.

267
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,547
Go ahead.

268
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,486
But when
you need my help

269
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:04,954
because I am
ruining everything,

270
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,115
don't look at me!

271
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,455
Behold,

272
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,164
Jesus Christ.

273
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:18,564
And I bring to you
glad Christmas tidings.

274
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:22,163
I want to remind everyone
the true meaning of Christmas.

275
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,999
Those of you who wish
to join me, that's great.

276
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,339
I am excited by that,

277
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,272
and those of you who don't,

278
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:31,838
I forgive you,
but I never forget.

279
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,317
Wow, Michael. This must be
obvious how wrong this is.

280
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,048
The Antichrist.

281
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:38,316
Okay, you can't...

282
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,482
Look, you cannot
push religion.

283
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,423
But I can push
drugs in here.

284
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:43,654
Is that what you're saying? No.

285
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,253
Well, you have to pick one
or the other. Your choice.

286
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:49,027
Pick your poison. Get back
to me. In the meantime,

287
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,592
I am going to spread my
goodness all over this company!

288
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,002
Hello, workers.

289
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,704
Salt of the earth.

290
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:02,735
Listen to what
I am saying unto you.

291
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,914
I am Jesus.

292
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,181
Okay, I need everybody
to stop what you're doing

293
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,745
and watch this.

294
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,019
Thank you, Darryl.
Thank you, my son.

295
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:18,863
Everyone, I have heard
your cries for rest,

296
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:22,800
and I am inviting you
up to our Christmas party,

297
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,495
where you can eat
and drink and have fun.

298
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:29,869
Hell, yeah. Let's go,
y'all. Thanks, Mike.

299
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:41,885
Everyone, everyone, please welcome
our friends from the warehouse.

300
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:45,748
I command thee to mingle
and make merriment.

301
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:49,393
Libations and food,
please, enjoy.

302
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:50,883
Enjoy.

303
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,419
That was
very nice of you.

304
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:56,495
Yes, actually nicer than
Santa. Jesus doesn't judge.

305
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,430
The only problem is
we only have food for us.

306
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,802
So would've loved
a heads up on this.

307
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,932
Well, would've loved to have been
the central gift-giving figure,

308
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:07,000
but I guess neither of us is
getting what we want, right?

309
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:11,448
Look, I can barely pretend
to like the people up here.

310
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,647
What am I supposed
to say to Artie?

311
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,451
Hey, Phyllis?

312
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:20,923
Could you not reveal to Erin
that I'm her secret Santa?

313
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,823
All right, sweetie, I'll
just tell her it's Michael.

314
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:23,986
Okay.

315
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:27,458
Santa, if you were a woman,
I'd kiss you.

316
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:34,562
Are either of you guys
friends with,

317
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,069
or ever hang out with
any cleaning ladies?

318
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:41,111
Um, I have to find a new one,
'cause mine died.

319
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,110
First training session
is free.

320
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,241
I'll show you the ropes, and get
you on track with the nutrition side.

321
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,809
My goal is
to look like you,

322
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,219
like a big, white, you.

323
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,719
How do I feel about the warehouse
guys showing up at our Christmas party?

324
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:58,285
Well, I could tell you,

325
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:00,821
or I could show you.

326
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,330
This is how I feel.

327
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:13,000
I saw
three ships come sailing in

328
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,336
Have you
talked to him?

329
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:15,470
What?

330
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,373
Matt.

331
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:18,676
Is it
that obvious?

332
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:22,114
No. Hey.

333
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:24,879
Hmm.

334
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:29,154
Good pâté, right? Oscar
made it. Have you met Oscar?

335
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:30,883
I don't think so.

336
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:32,691
Hey, Oscar, come here.

337
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:41,167
Oscar, this is Matt,
and Matt loves your pâté.

338
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,334
I had some.

339
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:44,568
Oscar's pâté's great.

340
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:49,242
I could eat it all day,
every day. Mmm.

341
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,708
How come the good ones
are never straight, right?

342
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:57,987
Oscar likes biking,

343
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:03,858
and classical movies,
French films mostly, right?

344
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:04,917
Mmm...
Yeah?

345
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,555
Okay. That's all I'm
gonna say. Classical music.

346
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:12,427
And new music. Radiohead.

347
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,463
I like Radiohead.

348
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:18,834
We should all go
to a concert together.

349
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,067
Are we still doing
that thing

350
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,544
where we take new people
to the office to a concert?

351
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:24,240
Okay, Pam.
Okay.

352
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,073
Look. Pigs
in a blanket.

353
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,355
So, Victor, is it?

354
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,251
Yeah. Victor.

355
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:37,624
Nice meeting you.

356
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:38,684
Nice to meet you.

357
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,264
Yes. They're the only two gay guys
I know. But they should be together.

358
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,167
So, guys, this is
more like finger food.

359
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,604
Uh-oh! A lasagna.
Look out, Garfield.

360
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,974
Uh-oh! What
does that mean?

361
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,203
Oh, they call me
Garfield.

362
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:56,405
I've never seen a lasagna
and not eaten the whole pan.

363
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,505
I wish you wouldn't.

364
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,675
Oh, well,
I can't help myself.

365
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,412
Can you imagine
what it's like for me,

366
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,317
that it has that power
over me?

367
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,377
I gotta have some.

368
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:07,117
Sorry, guys.
Everybody get some?

369
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:08,889
I got mine.
Okay.

370
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,596
All right, I just got out of
the restroom, and it stinks.

371
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,061
The warehouse
needs to go.

372
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,963
Okay, wait. How do you know
it's someone from the warehouse

373
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,558
who stunk up
the bathroom?

374
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,762
They stink up the bathroom
with their smelly poos,

375
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,668
because they don't eat
as quality food as us

376
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,434
'cause they're poor.
It's science.

377
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,203
That is so offensive

378
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:26,804
and thought out.

379
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,007
Maybe if we just took some
time to try to get to know them,

380
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:32,811
rather than constantly
complaining... Garfield! Garfield!

381
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,648
Garfield!
Garfield! Garfield!

382
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,778
Do it, girl.

383
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:39,550
That woman is a beast.
Garfield! Garfield!

384
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,888
Garfield! Garfield...

385
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,621
Yeah!

386
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:50,566
I am so very glad that you joined
us here on this festive occasion.

387
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:51,998
You look like Gandalf.

388
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,062
No, I'm Jesus, and we're
celebrating my birthday.

389
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,629
Seriously, though, Mike,
you should take that off, man.

390
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,732
It's offensive, even to me.

391
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,378
Merry Christmas, Creed.

392
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,477
Thanks, Santa.
I love it.

393
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,187
And he doesn't
even know what it is.

394
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:14,724
And it's probably terrible,
so save the receipt.

395
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,191
Get the receipt, Creed.

396
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,752
This just arrived from the
Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch.

397
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,629
We don't have a North
Pole branch. Idiot!

398
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:27,500
Uh-oh! What's Dwight
gonna get? What is it?

399
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:28,996
Yes!

400
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:31,041
Oh, yes! It's space garbage.

401
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,771
Dwight's gonna be able
to build himself a friend.

402
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:36,040
Deck the halls
with crappy gifts

403
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:40,312
And Stanley, ho, ho, ho,
you've been very good this year.

404
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:41,442
I have.

405
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,487
Yeah, except for
cheating on your wife.

406
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:46,318
Adultery's a sin. Look it
up in the Bible, people.

407
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,414
What'd he get?

408
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,392
He got scented candles.

409
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,557
Well, that's appropriate. A
lot of fire where you're going.

410
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,063
Better get used to it.

411
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,794
You're going to H-E-L-L,
double hockey sticks.

412
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,062
Going to hell, Stanley.

413
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,262
Amen.

414
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,298
And this brings us
to you, little one.

415
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,373
I can't see from here, people.
Somebody shout it out.

416
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,240
Don't make me get up.

417
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:11,006
It's fabric.
I really wanted this.

418
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:14,810
That's fantastic! You can make
another dress that goes past your feet.

419
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,046
Andy, was this you?

420
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,144
It's a secret.

421
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,746
No, Andy had Erin.
- It was a secret.

422
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,086
- Michael!
- You...

423
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,719
What? Was I not
supposed to say?

424
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:25,052
What? Turn it back on.

425
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,118
No.

426
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:36,400
Yes, Michael.
What is so urgent?

427
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,874
David, guess who I am
sitting here dressed as.

428
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,639
I'm not going to guess. You
can tell me, or I will hang up.

429
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:44,647
I will give you a hint.
His last name is Christ.

430
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:48,378
He has the power of flight.
He can heal leopards.

431
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:49,476
Michael...

432
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,283
I am Jesus, David,
and you know why?

433
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:55,758
Because Phyllis, a woman,
has uslurped my role as Santa.

434
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:56,815
Michael...
What?

435
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:59,158
This is a very,
very bad time.

436
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,790
Really? What's going on?

437
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,928
Stephanie,
can you hop off, please?

438
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,230
Sure, David.

439
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:09,762
What the hell? How rude!
Does she do that all the time?

440
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,633
Do you want me off
this call too, Michael?

441
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:15,042
Hey, what? Get off!
Get off the phone!

442
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:20,845
Listen, I shouldn't tell you
this, but the company has a buyer.

443
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:23,409
The board will have no
choice but to approve,

444
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,751
and they are going
to clean house.

445
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:27,051
What does that mean?

446
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:28,815
I'll be fired.

447
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,418
Well, can't Alan protect you?

448
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:33,019
Alan will be out, too.
All of us.

449
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,758
All of us?

450
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,361
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

451
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:43,601
I'm sorry you can't be Santa.

452
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:46,302
I do have to go.
Goodbye, Michael.

453
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,941
Earlier today,
this office needed a Santa.

454
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:56,146
And then it needed a second
Santa. And then it needed a Jesus.

455
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,050
And now,

456
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,287
it needs a Michael.

457
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,559
And that's one suit
Phyllis cannot fit into.

458
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:10,923
Hey, how's everybody doing?

459
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:14,196
Not great. You heckled
Santa for an hour and a half.

460
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,365
That was a different guy.
That was Jesus.

461
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,704
Jesus sort of
ruined the party.

462
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,436
Hurt, petulant Jesus.

463
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,843
Are you serious?
That is so offensive.

464
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:26,081
You know what's
even more offensive,

465
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,178
is bailing on this party because
some jerk ruined the first part of it.

466
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,184
Dwight, come here.

467
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:37,454
Here's my debit card. I want you
to go pick up a bunch of pizzas

468
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:38,620
and meet me in
the conference room.

469
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:39,754
What's your pin number?

470
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,695
I don't want to say.

471
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:44,229
But it's fun
to stay at the...

472
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:48,301
It's fun to stay at the...

473
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:51,273
Where?
Holiday Inn. I don't...

474
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:59,912
I thought that
you would like it.

475
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,417
It was a little much, Andy.

476
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:04,577
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

477
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,316
What were you thinking?

478
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:12,386
I suppose a gentleman might
throw in the towel at this point.

479
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,496
Guess what.
Not gonna happen.

480
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:20,827
You know what? Christmas
isn't about Santa or Jesus.

481
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:22,367
It's about the workplace.

482
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,337
The exact opposite of
what you just said is true.

483
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:27,775
See, that's exactly
something that Jim would say,

484
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,073
and I love him for it.

485
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:31,774
All of you feel
like my family.

486
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:37,644
Ryan, you are my son, and
Pam, you're my wife, and Jim...

487
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:42,825
And Angela and Phyllis,
you are my grandmas.

488
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,023
And Oscar, you just
moved in next door

489
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,757
because of urban renewal.

490
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,332
And Stanley,
you're our mailman.

491
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,132
And I can't help but look at all
of your wonderful, beautiful faces

492
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,973
and think, "How could
they do this to us?"

493
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,034
What?

494
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:03,239
How could we do
what to you?

495
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:05,407
That's not... Never... Nothing.
- Why would we...

496
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:06,677
We deserve to know.

497
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:07,877
I didn't
say anything!

498
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:09,214
We're going out of business!

499
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:10,310
What?
What?

500
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,377
You are kidding me.

501
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:12,513
Wait, wait, wait.
Who said that?

502
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,387
David told me on the phone.
David told me.

503
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,584
When?
When did he tell you, today?

504
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,527
Earlier today,
he said we have been sold.

505
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:20,655
What?

506
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,134
- Dwight! Jesus.
- Come on!

507
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:27,198
Michael, wait.
So they said we are sold.

508
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,171
David is gone, Alan is
gone. We're all gone.

509
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,707
Okay, but we
haven't gone under.

510
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,800
We've been sold, and that can
mean many different things.

511
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:35,141
It's hard for me to
imagine a scenario

512
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:37,772
where Meredith Palmer keeps her
job and David Wallace does not.

513
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,543
No offense, Meredith.
No, I get it.

514
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:40,845
Did he say anything
about the warehouse?

515
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,079
No, but he's always held
you guys in high regard.

516
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,654
You two are
the worst bosses!

517
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,849
You are. You never
know anything.

518
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,893
It's like the blind leading the
blind. "Guess, guess, guess."

519
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,951
Relax.
Okay, I can still fire you.

520
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:54,896
We better get some answers soon, or
it's gonna get real litigious up in here.

521
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:57,627
Like, you're gonna sue?
Who're you gonna sue? For what?

522
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,692
You have no idea. The law
protects the plaintiffs.

523
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,759
I'll call him.
I'll call David.

524
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,030
No you won't, because he's
not picking up his phone.

525
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:06,941
Yes, I will, because I always
know how to get through to him.

526
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:10,171
He told me where
his kids go to school.

527
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:12,772
I call the school. I tell
them I'm the pediatrician.

528
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,616
They patch me through to his
secretary. I use my little girl voice.

529
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:17,847
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.

530
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:19,649
Hey, sweetie,
what is it?

531
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:22,214
It's not sweetie.
It's Michael Scott.

532
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:24,261
What the hell? Stephanie,
could you hop off, please?

533
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:26,159
Michael, I have never...

534
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,254
David...
...never, ever...

535
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,593
David, you are
on speakerphone

536
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,396
with the entire branch
and the warehouse.

537
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,369
Hi, David.
- Hey, David.

538
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:34,829
Hi, everyone.

539
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:37,066
David, they do not believe me

540
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:40,441
when you told me
that everyone was canned.

541
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,336
You weren't supposed
to tell anyone, Michael.

542
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,903
Well, I think
we're past that now.

543
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:45,539
I am not supposed...

544
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:47,675
Okay, fine.
Guys, I was really

545
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,582
only talking
about Alan, myself,

546
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,416
and a few other
execs you don't know.

547
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,889
Oh, my God.
David, that's horrible.

548
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:58,554
How about us? It's Meredith. By the
way, your wife is a very lucky woman.

549
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:02,026
Look, they're buying the
company for the distribution.

550
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:04,966
You guys are the only thing
about this company that works.

551
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,161
So congratulations.

552
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:07,261
We're not fired?

553
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,771
No. Congratulations.

554
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,500
All right!
Yeah!

555
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:13,139
Come on!

556
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,438
It's a Christmas miracle!

557
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:15,804
Yeah!

558
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,641
Walk a lonely road

559
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:24,882
Only one that
I have ever known

560
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,516
Don't know where it goes

561
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:30,685
But it's all to me
and I walk alone

562
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,420
It's true.
Yes.

563
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,465
We all walk alone.
Jim.

564
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,959
Jim.
- Come on. Shall we?

565
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:41,629
Jim.

566
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:47,643
My shadow's the only one
That walks beside me

567
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:53,505
Take it away, Andy.

568
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:13,694
Wow.

569
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:19,074
Yeah. That was the idea.
Thank you.

570
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:21,043
Awesome.
Thanks, man.

571
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,340
Christmas tree
Thou leaves are so unchanging

572
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:29,818
Of course!

573
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,020
You got it?

574
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:34,949
What is that?

575
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:36,083
I have no idea.

576
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:40,758
Well, maybe those will help.

577
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:42,560
Michael, please.
Come on.

578
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,127
Sorry.
Sure.

579
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:46,191
Nice to meet you, Oscar.

580
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,259
Nice to meet you, Mark.

581
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,306
It's Matt.
Right, Matt.

582
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,998
I know what
I'm doing, Pam.

583
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,779
Oh, man!

584
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,612
I can use this
for so many nuts.

585
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:07,555
Macadamias,
Brazil nuts, pecans,

586
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,856
almonds, clams, snails.

587
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:14,925
Not in front of the kid.

588
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,064
This is a great party.

589
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:21,137
Did you buy the company just
to save your Christmas party?

590
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,935
I promise I will never buy a
company without telling you first.

591
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,143
Hi, Santa.

592
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:31,442
Hi, Michael.

593
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:36,244
Okay.

594
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:39,484
I'd like to make a wish.

595
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:41,148
What?

596
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:47,128
I would like an Xbox and a TV
that's compatible with an Xbox.

597
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,457
And I'm sorry.

598
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:58,601
An Xbox it is, because I've
decided you're a good boy.

599
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:02,373
Scott, what in the hell
is going on here?

600
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:04,277
No, no, no. We worked it
out. You called Bob? Phyllis!

601
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:06,782
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
It was earlier today.

602
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,976
Okay.

603
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:09,577
Hi, sweetheart.
You okay, baby?

604
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:10,745
I'm good, baby.

605
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,085
Oh, God.
Get a room, Santas.

606
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,379
Fresh nut?

607
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,288
I don't mind if I do.
Thank you.

608
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:22,431
Thank you, Santa.

609
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:23,830
Okay, happy holidays.

610
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:27,165
It's real slippery out here.

611
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,271
Oh, my God.

612
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:33,775
Twelve drummers drumming.

613
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:49,990
Merry Christmas, Erin.
Take it away, boys!
