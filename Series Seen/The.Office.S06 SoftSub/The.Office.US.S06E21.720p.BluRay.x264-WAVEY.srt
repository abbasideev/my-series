1
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:05,461
Okay.

2
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:06,936
Breathe.

3
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:08,604
Work your core!

4
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,039
Come on.

5
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:12,200
How many is that?

6
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:13,869
Not counting
the last one, 25.

7
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:14,935
Count the last one.

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,641
Okay, 25 and
one girl pushup.

9
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:18,307
Oh, new record!

10
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:19,817
Okay.
Oh!

11
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:21,113
What did you do today?

12
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:22,210
I made a sale.

13
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:25,256
Oh, yeah,
sitting on your big fat butt.

14
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,292
All right, that is
the number to beat.

15
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:29,292
What do we get
if we do them?

16
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,726
My respect.

17
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,326
Okay, I'll make it
a little more interesting.

18
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,232
Anyone who does
more than 25 pushups...

19
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:38,394
And one girl pushup.

20
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,097
...gets to go home.

21
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,511
I say "dance,"
they say "how high?"

22
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:48,045
Three, four...

23
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:51,276
Here we go.
No, no, no, butt too high.

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,442
Disqualified!

25
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:53,644
What do we got?
Creed, disqualified.

26
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,152
Oh, come on!

27
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,482
Nineteen.

28
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:01,759
I had a really hard
workout this morning.

29
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:06,822
Oh, wow!
That is adorable!

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,024
- Ten.
- Yeah!

31
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:13,196
I'm betting one more.

32
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,364
Eleven.

33
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,302
Wow!
Good.

34
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:22,643
Stanley! Stanley!
Stanley! Stanley! Stanley!

35
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:24,079
All right.
All right.

36
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,776
Stanley!
Stanley! Stanley!

37
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:29,014
Essentially what we have
here is one of those stories

38
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,182
where a mother lifts
a car to save her baby.

39
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:34,283
Well, it's not exactly fair.

40
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,487
He's got all this weight
that's helping him go down.

41
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:39,554
- Twenty-five!
- Come on!

42
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,428
One more! One more, Stanley!
Yeah, come on! You can do it.

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,489
Come on, Stanley!
Let's do it. Come on.

44
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:43,557
Go!

45
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:44,761
Yes!

46
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:48,605
Yes!
- Yeah!

47
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,801
- Are you okay?
- Very nicely done.

48
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,744
Are you okay, Stanley?

49
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,346
Excuse me.

50
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:03,746
Wow.

51
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:08,489
All right,
Papa Bear.

52
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:34,944
Hey!

53
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,845
Matt, right?

54
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,913
Hey, Oscar.
You're here early.

55
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:41,915
No.
I always come in at 7:00.

56
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:42,983
No you don't.

57
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,050
Well...

58
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:47,129
Hey, are you doing
anything later tonight?

59
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,526
I don't know. I'm free.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,966
If you hear of anything
going on, let me know.

61
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:52,060
Yeah.

62
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,399
Yeah, we talked this morning,

63
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,531
and we talked at Christmas,

64
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,632
so a little momentum there.

65
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:06,140
Couple hours to kill
before work.

66
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,085
Hey, what's up?
Hey.

67
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,579
Nice office.

68
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:14,489
Thanks. It's cool.

69
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:21,625
So...

70
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,159
You know what we haven't
done in a while?

71
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:25,930
Happy hour.

72
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,538
Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody
just going out for a drink.

73
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,976
Has that ever
happened? Ever?

74
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,343
Didn't we?
I think we did.

75
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,107
Want me to invite Matt?

76
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,583
Yeah, the whole gang.
Matt included.

77
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,651
Look, just be straight
with me, man.

78
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:46,782
You can be gay with Matt,
just be straight with me.

79
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:48,758
So, happy hour.
Happy hour.

80
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:50,192
Just invite everybody.

81
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,286
My pleasure.

82
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,694
All right.

83
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,598
So, what do you think?
- Hmm.

84
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:59,033
I saw a new drink
on TV I'd like to try.

85
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,230
I'll ask Bob.

86
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,330
Yeah. I love going to bars with Bob.

87
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,102
I tend to wear
something low-cut,

88
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:07,270
get men to flirt with
me, and Bob beats them up.

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,669
What?

90
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:11,515
A bunch of us are talking
about happy hour.

91
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,848
I would love,
love, love to go.

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,012
Only problem is,

93
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,215
Pam's at home with the baby and
I think she wants a night in.

94
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,315
Oh, baloney.
Good one.

95
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,654
Ring her up.

96
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:23,319
Absolutely.
I'll do that right now.

97
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,262
I gotta tell you,
this baby is amazing.

98
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,390
She gets me
out of everything.

99
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,501
And I love her.
I also love her very much.

100
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,538
So, some of
the coworkers

101
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,437
were thinking of going out
tonight, but I told them...

102
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,567
Yes! Yes,
I would love to!

103
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,475
Knew it!

104
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,479
It's been so long since
I've been with adults.

105
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:44,538
I'm so excited
to see everybody.

106
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,982
Creed, Ryan.
Oh, my God, Stanley!

107
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:48,314
Stanley's gonna be there.
Yes! Oh, my God...

108
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,412
I did not
see this coming.

109
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:54,481
Erin, I need you to fax this and
get me a confirmation, pronto.

110
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,260
Are you going later?

111
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,024
Sure, if you are.
Yes.

112
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,429
Talk to me that way again
and I'll cut your face off.

113
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,592
Whoa!

114
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:07,168
We recently struck up a
romantic relationship, and...

115
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,904
But we're kind of
keeping it quiet for now,

116
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:14,070
'cause it's still kind of a new
thing, it's a little delicate,

117
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,081
and we just don't want
all the drama. Exactly.

118
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,175
Yeah, 'cause when everyone
knows, it...

119
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:36,097
That's actually pretty funny,
but in general, you know...

120
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:39,563
Quiet.

121
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,295
Hey, boss man.
- Yes.

122
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,069
A bunch of us are going
to get some drinks. You in?

123
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,508
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is quitting time.

124
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:48,409
I'm sorry,
I meant later.

125
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,039
Okay. Yes.
For happy hour?

126
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,207
Sure. No, I got that.

127
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,307
Trying to
get a head count.

128
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,373
I am in!

129
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,441
All right.

130
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,887
Yes. It's a deal.

131
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:57,979
It's a deal.

132
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,489
Hey, I invited my friend Julie. Okay.

133
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,584
I want her
to meet Michael.

134
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,685
Why?

135
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,161
They're both single. I
have a sense they might...

136
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,219
You've been
gone for a long time.

137
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:08,789
It is not that... Kevin!

138
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,698
Yeah!

139
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,092
How are you?

140
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,331
Oh, I missed you so much.
Oh!

141
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:15,964
Yeah.

142
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,065
Yeah.

143
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:28,312
Well, when a new mom
hears a baby cry,

144
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,412
her you-know-whats
fill up with you know what,

145
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,583
and then her shirt gets,
you know...

146
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:36,286
That would be funny.

147
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:42,824
Oh, wow. I cannot believe this is
happening. This is everything I dreamed.

148
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,193
Oh, my God!

149
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,559
Hey!

150
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:48,230
Easy.

151
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:51,002
It's not a birthday,
it's not a goodbye party.

152
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,134
Hey, Pam and I
are gonna go play pool

153
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,678
with one of her friends,
and we need a fourth.

154
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,338
Sucks to be you.

155
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,315
Would you like
to be our fourth?

156
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,215
That would be sublime.

157
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,449
All right.

158
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,720
So, the guy shows me
the deck he's built,

159
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,786
and I'm like, "I'll call this
a deck if it'll make you happy,

160
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:14,297
"but this is just
a porch without a roof."

161
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,297
It was
ridiculous, man.

162
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,669
It was, like, you could maybe
get two chairs on the thing.

163
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,298
Two lawn chairs.

164
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:25,801
Hey, Michael.
Yes?

165
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:26,866
This is my friend Julie.

166
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:28,640
Hello. How are you?
Hi.

167
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:31,511
What is a nice girl like you
hanging out with these bums for?

168
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
There you go.

169
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:35,016
Julie laughs
at everything.

170
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,587
So you work
with Pam and Jim?

171
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,420
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me,

172
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:43,120
and if they win,
they are fired.

173
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,992
I should hope not.

174
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:49,397
No. No. Not really. Not
really. But they better not win.

175
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,863
Hey.
- Hey, Isabel, you made it.

176
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,063
Oh, my goodness!
Of course.

177
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,833
You want to play pool?

178
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:57,773
I'm gonna do a lap, see
if I know anyone. Okay.

179
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:01,677
And then they said the most
ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper,

180
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,271
which I do not have
the decency to repeat,

181
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,941
but trust me when
I tell you that it...

182
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,678
Hold that thought.

183
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,380
Well, well, well.

184
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,987
If it isn't Isabel.
Mmm-hmm.

185
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,027
What's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

186
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:19,029
A girl like me is why a guy like
you comes to a place like this.

187
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,792
Ooh. I love repartee.

188
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:21,890
Do you?

189
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,026
Usually means there's
a battle scene coming.

190
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:27,760
So what do you do?

191
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,397
I am an ESL teacher.

192
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:30,498
Really?
Yeah.

193
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,338
See, I didn't think
you could teach that.

194
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,878
I thought that was
something you were born with.

195
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,174
What am I thinking
right now?

196
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,409
Are you thinking
that I said ESP?

197
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:43,051
Yes. I feel like
an idiot. Awesome.

198
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:46,885
I was a little nervous when
Pam told me he was her boss,

199
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,859
but he doesn't act
like a boss at all.

200
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,328
If I had a boss like that,
we'd never get anything done.

201
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:54,824
So what do you think?

202
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,094
About what?

203
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,464
About Julie?

204
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,764
She seems nice.

205
00:08:58,837 --> 00:08:59,895
Yeah?
Yeah.

206
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,337
So you like her?
Uh, yeah, sure.

207
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:03,601
So Pam was right.

208
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:04,699
About what?

209
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:06,368
About you two
hitting it off.

210
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:21,050
Well, apparently Michael
Scott is on a date,

211
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:25,795
and that... That, my
friend, changes everything.

212
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:34,935
My brother, good head, bad
heart. Good head, bad heart.

213
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,234
I know.

214
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,868
- Yeah, you told me about him.
- Yeah.

215
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,468
- Oh, boy!
- He's all right.

216
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:42,979
Hey, Michael,
where have you been?

217
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,617
Hey, you're supposed to hit
the white ball first, buddy.

218
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:47,777
Hey!
Nice one.

219
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,786
Can I talk to you
for a second? Mmm-hmm.

220
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,318
Everything okay? Why are
you wearing a hat now?

221
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,291
Guys, come on.
I'm on a date.

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,622
Let me do my thing.

223
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:59,528
Hi, I'm Date Mike.
Nice to meet me.

224
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,759
How do you like
your eggs in the morning?

225
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:05,896
Do you want to
just make a run for it?

226
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,131
Maybe.

227
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,774
Mommy!

228
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,042
What is happening?

229
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,550
Whoa!

230
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,526
What is cracking?
One second.

231
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:31,926
Guys, we're focusing.
We can't talk.

232
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,225
What's this game?
One second.

233
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,629
Yeah. How do you play?

234
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,667
Guys, guys, guys,
please. Okay.

235
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:38,930
All right, it's all yours.
Only three tickets.

236
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,938
If we save them up, we can get
more than a sticker this time.

237
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:42,234
Stop telling me how
to spend my tickets.

238
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,331
I know,
but you wanted...

239
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,137
Wow! Can you imagine
what people would say

240
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,007
if they saw us
dancing together?

241
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,102
Oh, I know.

242
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,374
They'd be like,
"What's up with those two?"

243
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,313
"Hey, guys, get
a bedroom already."

244
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,181
"Did we miss the wedding?"

245
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:57,584
I got it. I'll do this and
you play the racing game

246
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,283
and then we'll switch.

247
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,283
Yes. Okay.
Yeah, that's smart.

248
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,827
No drama. Okay.

249
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,128
Oh, air hockey, basketball.

250
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,532
We could play that.

251
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,161
Oh, Whac-A-Mole.

252
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:14,330
Any brothers or sisters?

253
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:15,839
Three brothers.
Really?

254
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,273
Mmm-hmm. Two are in
the Marines, one's a cop.

255
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,867
Vegetarian?

256
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,502
No. I love meat.

257
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,174
What's your blood type?

258
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:25,978
O negative.
Universal donor.

259
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,882
Universal donor!
Mmm-hmm.

260
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:34,890
Angela versus Isabel.
Height, advantage Isabel.

261
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,726
Birthing hips,
advantage Isabel.

262
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,524
Remaining childbearing years,
advantage Isabel.

263
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:46,033
Legal obligation,
advantage Angela.

264
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,700
Hey, guys, guys,
guys. Excusez-moi. Hey.

265
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:50,434
Watch this. Ready?

266
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:54,402
What are you doing?

267
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,879
I'm tying a knot in
the stem with my tongue.

268
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,779
Michael, you don't have
to do this.

269
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,884
Wow. That was close.

270
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,322
I would say I kind of
have an unfair advantage,

271
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:10,555
because I watch reality
dating shows like a hawk.

272
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,128
And I learn.
I absorb information

273
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:16,133
from the strategies of
the winners and the losers.

274
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,597
Actually, I probably
learn more from the losers.

275
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,101
Hey, you two having fun?

276
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,169
Did you tell them?

277
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,231
No.

278
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,675
This is exactly
what I don't want.

279
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,736
The drama.

280
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:34,344
I don't want the drama!

281
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,211
Oh.

282
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,721
You are amazing at this.
How did you get so good?

283
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,227
Whacking moles.
Hit him on the head. Whack!

284
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:45,421
Whack!
Whack! Say it with me.

285
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,555
Whack!
Extend the fingers more.

286
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:47,655
Whack!
Good.

287
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,723
This looks like a hoot.

288
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,598
Hey, monkey, how you doing? Whack.

289
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,364
Listen, can I talk
to you for a second?

290
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,735
Okay.

291
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:58,970
You know, I've been
thinking, we had a good run,

292
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,278
we really did,
but you don't need to worry

293
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,904
about this whole
contract thing anymore.

294
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,107
It's no worry.

295
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:07,447
It's just that we both...
We want different things.

296
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,815
You know,
I want a big family.

297
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,479
I could see enjoying that.

298
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,888
No, no, no, no, no.
I want a big family.

299
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,054
Tall, thick. A big,
physically big family.

300
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,564
Listen, you go have fun.

301
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,394
You're off the hook.

302
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,525
But we signed the contract.

303
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,068
It's dissolved.
Don't worry. You're free.

304
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,125
Okay? Okay.
We'll see you later.

305
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,468
But we both...
And you didn't do...

306
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,644
Wow! Maybe we should tell her
he's not normally like this.

307
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,305
Maybe it should
come from a man.

308
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:39,782
Maybe it should
come from a note.

309
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,779
With flowers. Tomorrow.

310
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:43,581
Hello.
Hello.

311
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:44,917
Hi.
Hi.

312
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:47,856
You want to pay 400 bucks
to re-felt this table?

313
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,325
Yeah! Why don't
you send the bill

314
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:52,192
to 23 I Don't Care Lane,
Scranton, Pennsylvania?

315
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,924
Hey, Michael, why
don't you just get down?

316
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,398
Hey, she can tell
I'm on a date, right?

317
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,298
Right? We're just having fun.

318
00:13:58,369 --> 00:13:59,734
Ted, we having fun?

319
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,138
Really? You told on me.
That's lame.

320
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:06,274
We got a problem?
Yes. Homelessness.

321
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,410
What?
All right, go.

322
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,045
Where?

323
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,344
Get out. Now.

324
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,545
Okay. All right, okay. Whoa!

325
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,420
I'm just kidding
around. I'm sorry.

326
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:33,003
Okay, why don't we
just finish the game?

327
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,800
Michael, it's your shot.

328
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,306
She can't talk
to us that way.

329
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:37,807
You guys are stripes,
I think.

330
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,003
You let somebody
talk to you like that,

331
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,102
where does it stop?

332
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,203
It stopped.

333
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,111
Well, I am starting it again!

334
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:52,052
Do you guys
want some food?

335
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:53,954
The wings are
really good here.

336
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:05,660
Hey!

337
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:09,398
You embarrassed my friends in
front of me, and I am gonna need you

338
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,567
to go back over to the table
and apologize.

339
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:15,807
Then I am sorry that
I didn't kick you out.

340
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:19,982
I'm here with my employees.
I am here on a date.

341
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,075
Hello.

342
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:23,416
Well, I'm the
manager here, sir.

343
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,456
Well, it just so happens
that I'm a manager, too,

344
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:29,823
and the way I manage people is
that I touch their hearts and souls

345
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:33,421
with humor, with love and
maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle,

346
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,862
and I don't see that from you.

347
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,594
Is that how you do it?

348
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:39,034
Yes, it is.
I'm writing a book about it.

349
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:40,534
Really? How much
have you written?

350
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,368
I've written all of it.

351
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,674
In my head.

352
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:49,946
If you're really interested,
it is called Somehow I Manage,

353
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,414
and there's going to be a picture
of me on the cover shrugging

354
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:54,508
with my sleeves rolled up.

355
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:58,021
Have you read Lee
lacocca's? It's classic.

356
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,420
Read it? I own it.

357
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,424
But no, I have not read it.

358
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,187
Dude, tonight.

359
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,092
You're not gonna want to put it
down. It's gonna make you want

360
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:06,323
to go out and buy
a Chrysler tomorrow.

361
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:07,659
I own a Chrysler.

362
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:08,756
Shut up.

363
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,857
No, you shut up.

364
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,429
What's your drink?

365
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:14,393
Grenadine.

366
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:15,496
What?

367
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:20,533
We just have to throw everyone off
the scent a little, so follow my lead.

368
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,711
Hi.
Hi.

369
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,550
I don't normally do
this, but... Do what?

370
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,748
Go, go. Just sit down
next to a beautiful woman

371
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,793
and start talking to myself
to confuse other people.

372
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:40,327
Hey, big boy. Do you
like it when I do that?

373
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:44,632
What are you doing?

374
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,999
What we said to do.

375
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:48,765
We didn't say we were gonna,
like, start groping strangers.

376
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,831
I was flirting with a man.

377
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:52,205
Get in here.

378
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:54,972
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

379
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,604
The movies.
I don't know.

380
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,876
What movie?
Black Snake Moan?

381
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:02,309
I manage a paper company.
Dunder Mifflin-Sabre.

382
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,409
Do you have a card?

383
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,615
I did. I actually
put it in your bowl.

384
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,986
Stanley Hudson?

385
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,119
No. No.

386
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,088
Whoa! A lot of Stanley Hudsons in here.

387
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,462
No, it's Michael Scott.

388
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,591
Michael Scott?

389
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:17,725
He is I.

390
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,326
You just won
yourself a lunch.

391
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,837
Oh. Hey, guys!

392
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,471
I think I'm gonna go.

393
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:26,737
Really?

394
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,679
I'm sorry.
He's not usually like that.

395
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,180
What's he usually like?

396
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,575
He's more just...

397
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:40,148
Like... You can go.
Yeah.

398
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:41,555
All right.

399
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,790
Bye.
See you.

400
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,488
Nice girl.
Yeah.

401
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:49,255
Hey! Julie, having fun?

402
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:59,841
So, when are you
coming in for that free lunch?

403
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:03,447
You're gonna want to come
in on a day that I'm working.

404
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,648
Maybe I can hear
more about that book, too.

405
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:14,653
Hey, man. You put together a
pretty fun night for everybody.

406
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:19,126
I saw you talking to Hide. Did
you hear that dude's life story?

407
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:20,221
It's amazing, right?

408
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,129
I couldn't understand
a word he said.

409
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,794
Let me tell you something,
Oscar, all right?

410
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:28,197
Matt's an okay dude,
but he's a dummy.

411
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,737
You guys got
nothing in common.

412
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,504
Maybe you're right. I
should count myself lucky.

413
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:34,567
Hey, what's up?

414
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,306
There he is! Hey!

415
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,541
Anyone up for some hoops?
Yeah. Hoops!

416
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,777
Let's do it.
- Hoop it. Yeah.

417
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:56,865
This is not what I want
my relationship to look like.

418
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:02,966
Hi, ladies and gentlemen.

419
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,635
My name is Andrew Bernard and I've
been on two dates with Erin Hannon

420
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:10,272
and they went well, and
there will probably be more.

421
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,546
Thank you.

422
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,110
You know,
it got to the point

423
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:16,813
where keeping it a secret
was just too much drama.

424
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:20,153
And I hate drama,
so... There you go.

425
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,213
You love drama.

426
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,281
I know, I do, right?

427
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,429
I'm a total drama queen.

428
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:27,162
This move?
He can't get you.

429
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:29,062
I think that he could counter that move.

430
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,533
The Scranton Strangler
is a professional strangler.

431
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,365
Oh, please. I wish he'd come
after me. I would be like...

432
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:34,734
Dwight Schrute!

433
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,238
Dwight Kurt Schrute.
Shut up, what?

434
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:37,831
You are hereby served
with this summons

435
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,240
to appear in
Lackawanna County court...

436
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,436
No, no, no.
...for breach of contract

437
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,411
against Angela Noelle Martin.

438
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,175
What are you talking
about? What are you...

439
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:47,615
Dwight recently entered into a
contract with me, establishing intent

440
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:49,880
to conceive and raise
a child with me. Angela.

441
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,387
Did he not tell you that?
What?

442
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,685
You're really putting me
in an awkward position here.

443
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,623
Do you plan on
raising a child with me,

444
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,354
or do you plan on
breaking this contract?

445
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,055
Angela! Not here!

446
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,324
Dwight.

447
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,726
Whack.

448
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,663
You will see me in
small claims court!

449
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,802
You are an
impressive specimen.

450
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:10,932
Thank you.

451
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,208
And I spilled my drink and
they wouldn't give me a refill.

452
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:23,082
Oh, my gosh. Okay, yeah,
we have to get home.

453
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:24,382
Okay.
Yes!

454
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:26,650
Halperts, wait up!
What a great night!

455
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,316
Got to hang out
with my peeps.

456
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:30,917
Sort of did okay
with a new young lady.

457
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,155
Actually you didn't.
Not at all.

458
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,790
I think I did, but I
can't take all the credit.

459
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:38,824
Some of the credit is due, in
fact, to my good friend Date Mike.

460
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:41,429
Nice to meet me.

461
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:48,242
Tell me your story, Hide.
