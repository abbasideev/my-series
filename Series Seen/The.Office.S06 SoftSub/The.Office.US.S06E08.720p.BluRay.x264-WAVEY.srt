1
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:06,060
And then, I think I'm going
to go to the garlic festival.

2
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:08,197
Wow. Sounds like fun.
You guys would love it.

3
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:10,070
No, we wouldn't.
They have a TCBY booth.

4
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,973
Cool. Same stuff you get downtown.

5
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:13,636
Do you like TCBY?
Who doesn't?

6
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:18,911
"I can't believe it's
yogurt." It'll be fun.

7
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:22,283
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're
expecting the both of you in an hour.

8
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:24,049
Oh, actually, it's just going to be me.

9
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,750
They said
the both of you.

10
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:26,984
That's a mistake.

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,186
You should give them
a call, check that out.

12
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,627
All right,
just clear this up.

13
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,995
Well, there's actually been
a few changes in the company,

14
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,500
and Michael and I are
actually at the same level.

15
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:38,832
So, I can... No.

16
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:41,635
No, why would
that be a problem?

17
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,504
Jim's a good kid,
he can handle a lot,

18
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:47,443
but sometimes you
have to call in a master.

19
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:52,583
Why would you date an amateur
when you could date a professional?

20
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,179
Great. See you then.

21
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:56,619
What?

22
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:59,714
They said that they would feel
more comfortable if you came along.

23
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,726
Why don't they just want
you to go by yourself?

24
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:04,228
Why do they want me to come,
too? I don't understand.

25
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,264
I absolutely don't
understand, either.

26
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:10,233
I don't want you to feel like
I'm babysitting you or something.

27
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,637
All right.
All right.

28
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,298
Let me go get your stroller.

29
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,473
Sure.
Michael's a good teacher.

30
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:20,409
A teacher is someone who stands

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,912
right next to you
your whole life

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,880
and never lets
you do anything.

33
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:25,814
That's what
a teacher is, right?

34
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,231
What are you going to call him? Dave.

35
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:50,207
No. What is his name? Dave.

36
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,334
Mr. Borchard.
They're very formal.

37
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:53,810
Yeah. I've spoken
to them on the phone.

38
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,347
Yeah, well,
this is not the phone.

39
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,816
This is real life, baby,
and you got to own it.

40
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:01,250
Is that what
you are wearing?

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,344
Yes, it is.

42
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:05,447
And that is the watch
that you are going to wear?

43
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:08,584
No, it is not. You
should wear this watch.

44
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,888
I will loan it to you.

45
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:12,487
It is a Tankard. I highly
recommend you wear that.

46
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:14,498
No, thanks.
They are into style.

47
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:15,555
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,602
They are into appearance.
We are selling success.

49
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:20,263
And paper.
That's sort of secondary.

50
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,466
Nope. No.

51
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:25,675
He's trying to
micro co-manage me.

52
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:29,942
Or co-micromanage me.

53
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,118
Here we are outside of
the Wilkes-Barre... W.B.

54
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,619
...lndustrial Park.
Industrial P.

55
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,721
Making cold calls.

56
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,552
The two people
with the lowest sales

57
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,819
in the quarter
have to do them.

58
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:45,688
Palpabon
Drilling, where are you

59
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:49,723
Dean Trophies,
suite 100

60
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:53,032
Sherman Blinds & Rugs,
suite 202

61
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,129
Here it is.

62
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,366
Palpabon Drilling

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,964
Suite 401.

64
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,532
Yeah, I was going
to sing that part.

65
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,736
I know. Now you
don't have to.

66
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:02,006
Well, except it was going
to resolve the melody,

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,741
so now my head hurts.

68
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:05,749
It feels like
I held in a sneeze.

69
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,786
I hate this feeling.

70
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:13,550
Suite 401

71
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,254
All right.

72
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,423
Hi. Any messages?

73
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:21,523
You're soaking wet.

74
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,591
Oh, well, Jim and I
got caught in a little

75
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,866
flash rain, flash winds,
flash lightning.

76
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,566
Wow. Sounds scary.

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,132
It was. It was. And then
in an instant, it wasn't.

78
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:33,704
Why isn't Jim wet?

79
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:34,837
I outran it.

80
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,814
I don't think it rained.
My hip would be throbbing.

81
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,817
It rained. Michael,
can I get you something?

82
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,011
A towel, some cocoa?

83
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,849
Nothing. Cocoa.

84
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,988
I'll just leave that
suit in your office, then?

85
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,025
Good, yeah.

86
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,319
Must be nice to have
company on these cold calls.

87
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:51,919
We're kind of
a dynamic duo.

88
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:53,225
Or trio.

89
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,467
How exciting! Do you
guys know the sex yet?

90
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,434
Oh, no, no.

91
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,007
We're not together. No,
no, no. Definitely not.

92
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:07,045
Definitely not. No,
we just work together.

93
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:11,012
Looks like somebody's got
a case of the definitelys.

94
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:17,913
Michael, the custodian from
Raskin Design is on the line.

95
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,719
He said they found your
keys in the koi pond.

96
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,383
Okay, thank you.

97
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,089
Did you say
koi pond?

98
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,695
Yeah? Michael, people
are asking questions.

99
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,133
Okay. Put them on speaker.

100
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:32,397
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

101
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,099
Hey, Michael, did you
fall into a koi pond?

102
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:38,506
I can't really hear you. I think
we have sort of a bad connection.

103
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:41,205
Jim, did Michael
fall into a koi pond?

104
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:46,007
It's like Michael said.
It was something else.

105
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:49,212
Okay, this is what it was.
It was these bunch of idiots

106
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,725
that had put a fish tank in the
ground with no cover and no railing.

107
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:54,918
So you fell in?
No.

108
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:57,461
Maybe I was trying to save
a child that had fallen in.

109
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,757
So a child
had fallen in?

110
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,024
Not yet.

111
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,429
That is hilarious.

112
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,991
No. Don't. I'm not going to
bump. I'm not going to bump.

113
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,732
And it was not hilarious.
It was very, very terrifying.

114
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,933
Truthfully, it wasn't
the way he fell in.

115
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,537
It was how long it
took him to get out.

116
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,481
And we'd like to offer you
15% off your first purchase

117
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,916
as our way of welcoming
you to the area.

118
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,749
Well, that sounds
like a really nice deal.

119
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:23,845
Sha-bow!

120
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:26,652
And I must say that since
we are a family business,

121
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,317
it's nice to see
that you are, too.

122
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:29,860
Oh!

123
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:33,022
Wow. You thought that...

124
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,658
Oh, my gosh.
Definitely not.

125
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,361
My mistake.
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,460
It's okay.

127
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:41,529
Nah, actually,
it's kind of not okay.

128
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,642
I date models.
Face models.

129
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:49,375
My girlfriend, on a
scale of one-to-Gisele,

130
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,242
a nine.

131
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:53,375
That's good for you.

132
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,886
Anyway, we also have a
special on envelopes...

133
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,149
Pam's carrying
our surrogate

134
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:02,990
because my girlfriend needed to
keep her figure for Fashion Week.

135
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,725
So, we put
our baby in Pam.

136
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:07,560
It doesn't matter
what Pam looks like.

137
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:09,657
Yeah.

138
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:11,965
You were way meaner
to me than I was to you.

139
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,868
No, I wasn't, okay?

140
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:16,669
The very idea of us together
made you burst out laughing

141
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:19,711
like you just bit into an Adam
Sandler and jelly sandwich.

142
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:22,576
You blew the sale,
you idiot!

143
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,114
Let me tell you something.

144
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,707
I was never going
to make that sale.

145
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,215
Erin, do we have any of those
clips that hold paper together?

146
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,516
Staples?

147
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,058
David Wallace called.

148
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:36,526
Oh, he did?
What did he say?

149
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:38,688
He heard you made a big
splash at the meeting.

150
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,959
Oh, my God, that was so mean what
I just said, and I didn't mean it.

151
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:42,522
It was Kevin and Meredith
who put me up to it.

152
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:44,626
Okay.

153
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,330
I'm going to kill you.

154
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,236
Michael, don't
listen to them.

155
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:49,295
Thank you, Stanley.

156
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,433
You just ignore
their carping.

157
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,534
Okay.

158
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,635
Michael?
Yes.

159
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:56,374
A carp is both a fish
and a term for complaining.

160
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,847
They're mocking you
with word play.

161
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,146
Hey, boss,
did you find Nemo?

162
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:02,345
I can name
Pixar movies, too.

163
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,855
Toy Story.
Don't you mean Koi Story?

164
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,787
And when you fell in,
did you flounder?

165
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:12,195
Michael, flounder is
both a kind of a fish...

166
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,595
I know what a flounder is.

167
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,657
Hey, Michael.
No! No!

168
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,361
No more! That is it!

169
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,199
Everybody in the
conference room, right now!

170
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,206
I'm not usually
the butt of the joke.

171
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,071
I'm usually
the face of the joke.

172
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,706
I wish Jim had fallen
into that pond.

173
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,407
Then he'd have
to put on my suit,

174
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:33,383
and it would be too
short, and he'd look...

175
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,453
Damn it,
he'd still look good.

176
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:40,180
The most fundamental thing
about sensitivity training

177
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:44,854
is that you cannot make fun of a
person for something or some action

178
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,330
that they have done
that they regret.

179
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:50,526
You can only make fun of things
that they have control over.

180
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,835
Like, Oscar is gay.
That is his choice.

181
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:59,343
We can make fun of that. I did
not choose to fall into a koi pond.

182
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,504
Michael, you still
can't make fun of people

183
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,310
for race or gender or sexual
orientation or religion...

184
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,680
Who let the lemonhead
into the room?

185
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,582
You are a waste of life
and you should give up.

186
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,820
Is what I want to say
but I won't,

187
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,861
because that is why we
are doing this right now.

188
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:20,523
So, Toby, welcome to sensitivity
training for real. Show of hands.

189
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,892
Who here has
been koi-ponded?

190
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:28,132
Who here has been the butt of
a joke that has gone too far?

191
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:31,369
Phyllis. Michael, you
make fun of us every day.

192
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,240
Yeah. Every single day.

193
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,676
You never said anything.

194
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,213
We have. Countless times.

195
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:40,342
Well, it is hard to tell the
difference between you guys saying,

196
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,010
"Stop, because
I want you to stop,"

197
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:46,023
or stop as in, "Stop, you're
making me laugh so hard.

198
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:48,855
"What you're doing is so
funny. You're on a roll.

199
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,690
"I am busting
a gut. Stop!"

200
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,153
That's never
been the case.

201
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,563
We are going to make

202
00:08:55,634 --> 00:09:01,595
a Do Not Mock list.

203
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:06,838
Okay? Anything that we think might
be out of bounds, we put on this list.

204
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,612
Anything you put on this list,
you cannot be teased about.

205
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:11,740
Got it?

206
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,374
I'm going to kick it off.

207
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:19,219
Let's see what I have
to put on the list, right?

208
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,622
Okay.

209
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:24,651
I also have fallen into the
fountain at the Steamtown Mall.

210
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,890
You fell into
a second fountain?

211
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,461
Can you kick me
out of the meeting now?

212
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:31,968
Go. Go.

213
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,341
Starting today, teasing
will no longer be tolerated.

214
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:41,139
You mean there's
no teasing of any kind?

215
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:44,648
No, no, no, just things that are on
the list. That is the beauty of it.

216
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,116
Okay, who else? Who
else? Dwight, come on.

217
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,085
I don't want people
making fun of my nose.

218
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,621
Your nose?

219
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,586
It's too small.

220
00:09:52,657 --> 00:09:56,593
The geometric proportions of my face
are perfect in every way but one.

221
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,429
My nose is too small.

222
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:01,488
I mean, it still works.
I can smell things.

223
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:04,763
I just have to be a lot
closer than most people.

224
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:06,629
Oh, my.
That is small.

225
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,332
Just write it
down, please.

226
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:09,600
Can you
breathe okay?

227
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,266
What keeps your
glasses on?

228
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:12,742
Hey, it's on the list,
everybody.

229
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,109
No, I haven't
finished writing.

230
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,480
Did you sneeze it off?
That's it. No more. Okay.

231
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,576
Who else, who else? Everybody's
going to get their chance.

232
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,486
I don't want people
making fun of my weight.

233
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:26,751
Okay, that's too broad. It's
got to be something else.

234
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,986
How about your
stomach? Yeah?

235
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:34,327
Who else? I'm very sensitive
about my petite figure.

236
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,588
Oh, God.

237
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:39,395
I am. I'm afraid of being
thrown around like a football.

238
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,204
Well, you know, Nicole Richie
might think that you are fat.

239
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,002
Does that make
you feel better?

240
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,133
Meredith?

241
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,370
I don't want to
say it out loud.

242
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,072
Okay, fine. Come on up
here, write it yourself.

243
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:52,207
And don't sign your name
to it, and nobody look.

244
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,816
Everybody,
look away, look away.

245
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,416
Well, I really didn't want
to put it on the board,

246
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,754
but I thought maybe it was
going to come out somehow.

247
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:03,020
So, what are you
going to do?

248
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,656
Okay.

249
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,429
Some of you
may have noticed

250
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:17,806
I'm in that kind of ill-defined
relationship type of thing.

251
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,309
Okay, what do you
want me to write?

252
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,072
Just put Kelly.
Aw!

253
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:22,135
That still going on?

254
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:23,737
I will claw
your tiny nose off.

255
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,248
It's on the list.

256
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:26,681
Creed, your turn.

257
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:29,117
If I write it down,
I can't be charged with it.

258
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:30,714
No one said that.

259
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:34,353
That is our sales pitch,
and we are sticking to it.

260
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,391
Well, you two are quite the
salesmen, and a very cute couple.

261
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,193
Well, it's...
Oh...

262
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,502
Thank you.
Thank you.

263
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,529
Some couples don't seem like
a good match, but you two do.

264
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,835
Well, you know.

265
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:53,537
Yeah, you know,
two peas in a pod.

266
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,238
We complete
each other.

267
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,008
What can I say?
She loves to cook...

268
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:58,709
He loves to eat.

269
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:00,445
I love to dance...

270
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:01,678
I love to watch
him dance.

271
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:04,916
Yeah, right. Sometimes I'll just
dance for hours in the living room.

272
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,217
And I'll watch him.

273
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,089
And a baby on the way?
You must be so excited.

274
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,650
Mmm.
Yes.

275
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,959
Yeah, we are thrilled.
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,521
In fact, we spent
the whole weekend

277
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,863
researching various
birthing coaches.

278
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:17,924
Wasn't that
fun, honey?

279
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,128
It was, sweetie.
Yeah.

280
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:22,105
Oh, I know the best teacher.
Her name is Miss Janet.

281
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:23,401
Yeah, on Clearview Avenue.

282
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:24,499
Yeah!

283
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:25,668
Yeah.

284
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:31,144
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some
people say that I eat like a squirrel.

285
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:34,743
So now you're comparing
yourself to a cute, tiny animal?

286
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:36,978
Michael?
Hmm?

287
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:40,650
The custodian called again.
Apparently a koi has died.

288
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:41,817
Oh, man!

289
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:42,917
It's a fish.

290
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,891
They want you
to pay for it.

291
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,555
It could have died of
natural causes, though.

292
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:50,328
Well, they said you stepped
on its head. He did not suffer.

293
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,167
When is the funeral?

294
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,706
Do not mock, Oscar.
Do not mock.

295
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,605
How much do they want?
$300.

296
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:01,304
What? No. I could get a
fish for a five-cent worm.

297
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,372
You're paying way too much for
worms, man. Who's your worm guy?

298
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,647
Okay, great meeting,
everybody. That's it. No, no.

299
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,053
Thank you. No, we are
not done here. This...

300
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:15,618
One of the baby
books suggests

301
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:19,026
the best birthing posture is
on all fours, like an animal.

302
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,724
I just wish I had
a special telephone

303
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,962
so I could find out exactly
what the little soybean wants.

304
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,163
Right? Hey, little
soybean. What do you want?

305
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,331
Right? How do...

306
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,907
I felt it kick.
Oh, that's great!

307
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:37,141
Oh, my gosh, like a little
magical foot just high-fived me.

308
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,614
Yeah, well,
that'll happen.

309
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,014
Oh, my gosh.

310
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:43,885
It's like he's trying to say,
"I love you, too, Daddy.

311
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:45,115
"I love you, too."

312
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,317
Sometimes we're so excited,
we forget where we are.

313
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,586
Like at a business meeting.

314
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,521
Message received,
little soybean.

315
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,198
I think you just got to
ride this one out, man.

316
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,564
No, Jim, you don't understand.

317
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,728
Things like this
just don't die.

318
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,440
Kids in high school still call
me "Ponytail." No, they don't.

319
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,068
Yes, they do, Jim.
Because of the time

320
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,669
I got my ponytail
stuck in the power drill.

321
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,374
Maybe if you make fun of
yourself, it'll all go away.

322
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:12,711
I want to make fun
of you right now.

323
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:17,221
Really? Do it. I am a
big, stupid goofball.

324
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:19,882
No, don't do that.
You're not stupid.

325
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,350
See?

326
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,720
Oh, my God.

327
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:30,398
Hey, I just want to say
that I cannot believe

328
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:32,299
that I walked
into a koi pond.

329
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,565
I mean, seriously,
walk much?

330
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,734
Oh!

331
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:39,902
I should wear a snorkel to the
next business meeting that I go to.

332
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,879
Michael, you know, when you think
about it, it's not all your fault.

333
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,812
I mean, who puts
a koi pond in a lobby?

334
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,612
Well,
you know what?

335
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,653
You're right, Phyllis,
but I've been there before.

336
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,985
I've seen that pond.
This is the thing,

337
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,956
I am a world-class moron,
is the problem.

338
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:56,585
Michael, please stop it now.
You're embarrassing yourself.

339
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:57,992
It's okay.
We're having fun.

340
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:01,225
It's actually not the first time
I've been embarrassed by a pond.

341
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,491
In high school,

342
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:06,503
the girls volleyball team always
used to throw me into the frozen lake.

343
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,334
Four years in a row.

344
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:14,971
It was freezing! No, no,
no. This is even worse.

345
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:17,837
Couple of weeks ago, I
went to get a new cell phone

346
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,474
and I wanted one
of those packages

347
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,744
where you have
the five, you know,

348
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,809
the friends
and family thing?

349
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,912
And the guy was like, "Who
are your five friends?"

350
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,719
And I'm like...
I didn't even know.

351
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:31,922
I couldn't even think. Oh, my
God, it was so embarrassing.

352
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,920
That was so...

353
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,960
I don't even have Jan's cell
phone number, and I hate her.

354
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:42,572
She won't give it to me. I was
like, "I guess I'm a loser."

355
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:46,569
A loser!

356
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:49,377
Too far! God!

357
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,978
Thanks a lot, man.
Thanks for the advice.

358
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:05,018
Enjoying your nut?

359
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,085
Why?
- Kevin.

360
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:07,153
I'm not mocking.

361
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:10,826
I was just making an
observation about her nut.

362
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,460
I was.

363
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:15,335
Hey, who wants to watch
Michael's pond dive?

364
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:18,967
My roommate's friend is the
night janitor over there.

365
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:22,706
He swiped the security tape for
me, and he's bringing it over.

366
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,580
Mmm. You know what? Maybe we
should go easy on Michael, guys.

367
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,675
You know,
you watch that tape,

368
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:31,347
and you're going to have to stay late
for more sensitivity training, so.

369
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:33,322
We'll stay late.
Yeah.

370
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:37,019
You are not a joke.

371
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,119
I am.

372
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,254
You are smart.

373
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,354
Jim is smarter than me.

374
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,399
You are handsome.
Jim is more handsome.

375
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:47,370
No, Jim is ugly. Please. I mean, I'd
give anything for his nose. It's true.

376
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:50,032
The rest of him, God,
he looks like Popeye's wife.

377
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,042
Wow, Wilma.

378
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,844
See, that is funny.
That is a joke.

379
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:57,540
I know jokes
and you are not a joke.

380
00:16:58,516 --> 00:16:59,983
Her name's not Wilma.

381
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,817
Stop making me laugh.

382
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:04,312
Well, that went
pretty well.

383
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:05,378
Yeah, I guess.

384
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,481
We got a maybe.
It was our first maybe.

385
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:10,527
Going by the Nard-Dog curve,
I'd say we nailed it.

386
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:11,584
If I'm being
completely honest,

387
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,289
I could have done
without the belly kiss.

388
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:14,922
You know what?
I'm sorry,

389
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,264
'cause in that moment, I knew I
was kissing your belly too much.

390
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,735
Yeah, way too much.
Yeah.

391
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,567
I mean, what the hell was that?

392
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:23,038
What the heck was that?

393
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,096
When you cried.

394
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,700
Try "almost cried." Okay?

395
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,712
I just got caught
up in the fantasy.

396
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,011
Your fantasy involves comparison
shopping birthing classes?

397
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,348
No. I know I'm going
to go with Miss Janet.

398
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,753
I just... I don't know, it
was fun to role-play, right?

399
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:39,847
Hmm.

400
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:43,360
It was fun for me, having
a wife and a little baby.

401
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,827
I'm so sick of
being single.

402
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,196
Well, are you
dating anyone?

403
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:52,998
What do you think of Erin?
I mean, she's kind of cool.

404
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:55,998
You think
I can do better?

405
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,169
Got to get my
going out on.

406
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,435
Hey, let's watch
this thing.

407
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:03,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
okay, yeah.

408
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,140
We're not watching this.

409
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:06,581
How can we
not watch this?

410
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,141
What happened
to "Do not mock"?

411
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:09,652
We're not mocking,
we're watching.

412
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,688
That will inevitably
lead to mocking, so.

413
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,018
Well, we'll
deal with it as it comes.

414
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,251
Is this the tape
of me falling?

415
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,417
Yes, put the DVD in.
Yep.

416
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:16,892
Open up QuickTime.
It starts on its own.

417
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,826
No, use QuickTime,
trust me, I've done this.

418
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,955
Guys, Michael
can't handle this.

419
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:23,364
And as your boss, I'm
saying, we're not watching it.

420
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:26,096
No, it's okay, watch it.
He can't fire all of you.

421
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,194
What are you doing?

422
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:28,704
It's all right.
I can handle it.

423
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,104
No.
I am a grownup, Jim.

424
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:31,163
It's on.

425
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,231
There they come.

426
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:35,643
Boom!

427
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:37,408
Oh! Did you see that? See what?

428
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:38,744
Wait, why did
you stop it?

429
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,545
Oscar, yes, you're right to stop it.

430
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:41,880
Thank you, eject it.

431
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,750
Jim, you let
Michael fall in.

432
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:44,947
Play it again.

433
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,151
He purposefully
leaned away and let you fall.

434
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,454
Oh, man!

435
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,766
I think when I started to see
you go in, I think I just froze.

436
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,805
I don't think
you froze.

437
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,573
It's a killer
new dance move.

438
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,006
Do you want
to talk in your office?

439
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,105
No.

440
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:15,182
I didn't ask you.
Would you like to talk?

441
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,186
Judas.

442
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,952
Jim is my enemy,
but it turns out

443
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,152
that Jim is also
his own worst enemy.

444
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:27,857
And the enemy of my enemy is my
friend, so Jim is actually my friend.

445
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,667
But, because he is
his own worst enemy,

446
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,534
the enemy of my
friend is my enemy,

447
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,732
so actually
Jim is my enemy.

448
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:38,564
But...

449
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,740
I should have
grabbed you. I'm sorry.

450
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:46,613
Look, I thought I could have
done today's sales call alone.

451
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,211
I mean, I may never be as
good a salesman as you are,

452
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:52,279
but I at least need
the chance to do the job.

453
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,655
Jim is jealous of me?

454
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:00,793
Jim is jealous of me.

455
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,494
Hey, what's up,
lifeguard?

456
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,539
Jim, I think
I'm in your way.

457
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,106
Oscar's a douche.

458
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,083
He's all right.
No.

459
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,416
He's... Yeah,
he's all right.

460
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,249
Okay.

461
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,157
Thanks, Michael.
You're welcome.

462
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:35,729
Whoa! Almost fell.

463
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,531
Hey, Erin, do you mind
faxing this for me? Oh, sure.

464
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,338
Wait, hand them
to me upside down,

465
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,844
so I don't accidentally read them.

466
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,704
Okay.
Thanks.

467
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:51,805
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:54,544
How did today go, by the way?
Did you make any sales?

469
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,019
No, it was a total
waste of time.

470
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,282
It was fun, though,

471
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,917
because I got
to spend the day

472
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:05,258
with Andy Bernard
and he's really cool.

473
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,694
Yeah, he is.

474
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:08,061
Yeah, he is.

475
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:10,293
He's like the coolest
person I've ever met.

476
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,233
That's right.

477
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:15,305
He's like Marlon Brando.

478
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:21,443
Oh, do you mean Marlon
Wayans? 'Cause he is.

479
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,681
I actually do mean
Marlon Wayans. Yeah.
