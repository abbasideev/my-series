1
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:03,827
Yeah?
You wanted to see me?

2
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:07,394
Yes, Oscar, come on in.
Close the door if you would.

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:09,904
Thank you. Thanks so
much for talking to me.

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:10,999
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:13,442
I'm going in
for a procedure today.

6
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,446
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:17,709
It's routine. I'm just
a little bit scared.

8
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:20,479
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

9
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:23,043
What's the procedure,
if you don't mind my asking?

10
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:24,714
It is a colonoscopy.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,316
Okay.

12
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:30,386
In your experience,
what should I be expecting

13
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:34,728
in terms of sensation
or emotions?

14
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,075
Is there anything I can do to
make it more pleasurable for me,

15
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:48,909
or for Dr. Chaudry?

16
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,008
Oh, my God!

17
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,279
My main concern, should
I have a safe word?

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,614
Yeah.

19
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:18,737
So, Michael, you think
you can give me a rundown

20
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,438
on the Buffalo
clients by Monday?

21
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,480
Absolutely. You know what?
I'll do you one better.

22
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,072
Sunday. Sunday night.

23
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,639
Okay. I will
get it Monday.

24
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:27,412
Hold on, big guy.

25
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,977
I'm going to put it in the mail
Sunday night, you'll get it Wednesday.

26
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:31,955
Okay. Jim, you want to
hit the conference room?

27
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:33,013
Sure.

28
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,116
Hey, good luck.

29
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:36,521
Oh, right, this thing.
I remember now.

30
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,687
What's this about?

31
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,390
This is just me and
David, if that's okay.

32
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:40,989
It's okay with me. He's
going to want me in there.

33
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,466
No. It's okay,
Michael. We got it.

34
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:45,034
Really?
Yeah.

35
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,299
All right. Do you mind
if I sit this out?

36
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:51,206
I have so much work to do, I feel
like I'm going to blow my brains out.

37
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,038
Okay. You got it.

38
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:03,820
Am I worried that Jim and David
are having a meeting without me?

39
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:07,586
No. Because we are
the three amigos.

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
And once in a while,

41
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:13,031
one of the amigos will
go off to the bathroom,

42
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:15,931
while the other two
have a secret meeting.

43
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:23,965
Hey, let me escort you to your desk.

44
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,500
Okay. It's just three or
four steps, but thank you.

45
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,740
Thank you. You and Jim are close, huh?

46
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:33,012
Yeah. I think the pregnancy
really brought us together.

47
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:36,020
Hey, what do you think he
and David are talking about?

48
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:37,214
What do you...

49
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,620
Um, I don't know.

50
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,954
Well, you said good
luck to Jim as he walked in.

51
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,655
Did I? Doesn't sound like
me. Not very superstitious.

52
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:52,536
If you're lying to me right now, Pam,

53
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,629
your baby is gonna
come out a liar.

54
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:59,968
That's how it works. They inherit
things through the breast milk.

55
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,910
Please don't talk
about my breast milk.

56
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,347
I just don't want
you to lie to me.

57
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:08,619
I don't want you to ever lie
to me. Have I ever lied to you?

58
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:09,676
Yeah.

59
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,347
I just don't
want you to.

60
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:13,186
I was rushing
to fill an order.

61
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:16,659
I put the ladder up to grab a box
of three hole from the top shelf,

62
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:19,322
next thing I know, I'm on the
ground, ladder's on top of me.

63
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:20,659
And that's how you
broke your ankle?

64
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:21,892
Yes.

65
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,935
Hmm. Interesting.

66
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:28,063
How did the ladder end up on
top of you if you fell off of it?

67
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,438
This doesn't concern you, man.
You need to walk away.

68
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,773
Oh, really? I'm sorry. I
thought this was a free country.

69
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,937
I didn't know we were
in Communist Sweden.

70
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,071
If we were
living in Sweden,

71
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,137
I wouldn't have
to worry about this

72
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,150
because we'd have
universal healthcare.

73
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:40,909
That's not... Okay.

74
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,283
Be quiet.
I'm talking about...

75
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,616
Hmm...

76
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,156
I will send this
off to corporate.

77
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,021
Make sure you hold on
to your medical bills.

78
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:48,286
Feel better.

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,624
Thanks, T-man. Later.

80
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,226
So long, Darryl.
Feel better.

81
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,858
He's lying.

82
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,197
He has a doctor's note.

83
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:02,398
From who? Dr. J? You really
need to investigate this.

84
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:04,408
People don't just
fall off of ladders.

85
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,841
Guy on my street
fell off a ladder

86
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,503
painting his house.
It was on the news.

87
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:10,377
Since when have you known
Darryl to rush to do anything

88
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,883
other than to come up here
for birthday cake?

89
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,181
"Y'all having birthday cake?"

90
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,585
That's not a very good Darryl. Please!

91
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:20,523
And how many foremen do
you know that pull boxes?

92
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:23,587
It just doesn't add up.

93
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,291
Well, we did a little
investigation, and Dwight had a good point.

94
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:33,134
The ladder didn't reach the top
shelf. I don't know if I believe it,

95
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,174
but I am a fan of the
hardboiled detective novel.

96
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,573
"I'll punch you
into mush, see?"

97
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:43,480
Uh-huh. Well, if he doesn't like it, you
can tell that s.o. B that he is fired.

98
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:47,848
Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right
now. I will. I love you, too. Bye.

99
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,908
Who was that?

100
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,750
Sorry about that.
What'd I miss?

101
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,256
Michael, we would like to continue
the rest of this meeting in private,

102
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,314
please,
if you don't mind.

103
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,690
I do not mind.

104
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,628
Yes, I do. No, I don't.
Yes, I do. No, I don't mind.

105
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:01,063
Catch you guys on the
flippity-flop. Oh, this...

106
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,896
Call waiting. Yeah?

107
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:05,061
Uh-huh. Well, you tell the
mayor he just lost six votes.

108
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:09,139
They've been
in there a while.

109
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,004
Yeah.
Can't be good.

110
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:12,735
No.

111
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,176
Think they're
talking about me?

112
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:17,281
No, I think they're
talking about me.

113
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,648
Yeah. That makes way more
sense. Okay. Thanks, boss.

114
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:23,454
What is Jim telling
him? That I can't handle this job?

115
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,649
That's bull crap.
That is bull crap.

116
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,491
Although it has been
chaotic lately.

117
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,620
Corporate shut down
the Buffalo branch,

118
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:34,962
which left us to absorb
all of their clients.

119
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:38,992
I will tell you, there
has been work every day.

120
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,164
Had to come in
on a Saturday

121
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:45,339
to retrieve... I left
my cell phone here.

122
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:48,470
Hey, Kelly.

123
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,879
So jealous
of your boobs.

124
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,944
Thank you.

125
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:55,384
Um, listen, I just wanted to confirm

126
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,547
that you're not
coming to the wedding,

127
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:01,058
which is totally understandable,
and more than fine.

128
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,286
Is Ryan going?

129
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,295
I don't know,
he hasn't RSVPed yet.

130
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,797
We invited everyone in
the office to our wedding,

131
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,423
even though we realized most people

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,765
wouldn't be able to make
the drive to Niagara Falls.

133
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:15,300
Which is why we're
having it in Niagara Falls.

134
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,909
Then Michael
told everyone

135
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:21,434
they could have Friday and
Monday off if they came.

136
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:25,381
So now, people have to decide if
they want to come to our wedding

137
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,441
or have to work.

138
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,612
Here's the deal.
I really want to go.

139
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,485
But I'm not gonna go
if Ryan doesn't go,

140
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:33,649
because it's kind of
a waste of time.

141
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:34,851
That came out wrong.

142
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,587
It would be awesome if you
could try to get him to go

143
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:39,926
because I'd really like
to be there to support Jim.

144
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,430
What can I do
for you, hoss?

145
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,200
How are your
sales doing?

146
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:50,173
How are my sales doing?

147
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,004
Busted.

148
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,602
You know, my numbers
are down a little bit.

149
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,841
And it's 'cause
of the economy.

150
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,783
You're not buying it.
You're good.

151
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,844
Okay, the truth is

152
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,823
I have been having trouble
focusing lately. I'm in this weird,

153
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:11,727
flirty, nebulous thing
with this cousin of mine.

154
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,294
And it's a total mind f'er.

155
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,061
Again with the cousin.

156
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,795
Oh, I'm sorry, Phyllis.

157
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:19,700
You explain
this email. Okay?

158
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:24,174
"Hey, Andy, let's go visit Grandma
and then get drunk together. Ha, ha."

159
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:27,700
Shh. I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on in that room, okay?

160
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,610
Wallace
had to show up

161
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:33,515
on the one four-month period
that I'm completely overwhelmed.

162
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,621
You know when they say, "It's
so crazy it just might work?"

163
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:42,887
Well, I don't believe that. I
say go for the airtight plan.

164
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,792
And that is why
I am having Andy

165
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,387
wheel me into
the conference room

166
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,399
inside a makeshift
cheese cart.

167
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:52,867
It is just elegant.

168
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,606
Be my eyes.
You got it.

169
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,541
What have we here?
Oh!

170
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:00,635
Hello.

171
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:01,974
Just backing up
and turning around.

172
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,036
Hey, we're
gonna do this...

173
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,173
It's not for you.

174
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,312
I took the liberty of preparing
for you a cheese platter,

175
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,486
which I will place here on the
eastern wall of the conference room.

176
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,619
Cheese platter?

177
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,229
From the Wisconsin region,
a nice, firm cheddar.

178
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:26,868
Also from the great state of
Wisconsin, an aged Parmesan.

179
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:30,135
Here you will find
a cheddar-style spread,

180
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:34,304
which has reacted nicely with
the air to form a light rind,

181
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,007
which I think you'll find both
challenging and delicious.

182
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,016
At that point, I would
recommend you take

183
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:42,110
a quick trip south of the border
to the great state of Illinois,

184
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,179
where you will find this
fine blue cheese dressing.

185
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,918
If I may be so bold,

186
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:49,790
it's a lot of fun
to let the goldfish

187
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:52,625
take a little swim
in the blue cheese.

188
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,998
All right, well, I should
go. Thanks for this.

189
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:00,798
You've given me
a lot to think about.

190
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,897
Please promise me you won't
do anything until we speak.

191
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,441
No, I won't.

192
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,044
All right. Hey,
thanks for taking the time.

193
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:09,706
Yeah. Appreciate it.
Thank you, Jim.

194
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,178
Erin,
is Michael around?

195
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,348
I think
he's around here.

196
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:21,987
Is that...

197
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,220
Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,229
You must have walked right
past me. How you doing?

199
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:26,730
Yeah. Could we talk in
your office for a sec?

200
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,732
Yes, definitely.

201
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,994
Okay.

202
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:42,279
It sounds
like a EMD P40.

203
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,781
Nah. That's a GE.

204
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,941
The P40 is much
higher-pitched.

205
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,451
You're into trains?

206
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,112
Have been my whole life. Wow!

207
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,748
I'm rebuilding a
turn-of-the-century steam engine

208
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:54,348
in my slaughterhouse.

209
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,360
That's so cool.
Yeah.

210
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,055
Wow! I'd love to take a look at that.

211
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,721
Yeah. It's just a
run-of-the-mill slaughterhouse,

212
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:00,787
but sure, anytime.

213
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,197
Well, you know,
because of the trains.

214
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,133
Wait, someone's coming.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

215
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:07,603
It's Darryl! Get down!
He's not using crutches!

216
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:09,264
Get the camera.
Start taping.

217
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,365
Drive!

218
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,307
Worker's comp, my ass!

219
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,004
I can't believe this.

220
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,239
Hey, you ass!

221
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,337
Toby!

222
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:19,144
You gonna eat all
that dog food yourself?

223
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:22,378
No, no!

224
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:24,885
Oh, man!
You okay?

225
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:25,980
Just drive.

226
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:32,623
Hey, Ryan.
Hey.

227
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,632
So, I just wanted to confirm that
you're not coming to my wedding.

228
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,759
Yeah, I might stop by.

229
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,861
It costs about
$75 per person.

230
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:43,465
Okay. I once had a glass of
Cognac that cost $77, so...

231
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,533
Can you just tell me now
if you're coming or not?

232
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,809
Yes. I'm coming
to your wedding.

233
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,815
Okay. Ryan Howard, yes.

234
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,441
Probably yes.

235
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,213
Kelly Kapoor, yes.

236
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,712
Are you sure you're okay with
these new responsibilities?

237
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,018
Look who you're talking to.

238
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,788
Just trying to figure out the best
way to utilize everyone's talents.

239
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,989
Well, I would say
that my greatest talent

240
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:09,431
is being the best
man, woman or child

241
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,128
to have ever run
this branch. Ever.

242
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:12,226
And what about Jim?

243
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:13,793
You think Jim is
someone who is ready

244
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:16,602
to move into
a management position?

245
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:23,342
Permission to speak
on the record.

246
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:24,712
Please do.

247
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,775
Jim is like Big Bird.

248
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:32,221
He is tall and yellow
and very nice.

249
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,690
But would I put him
in charge? No.

250
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:39,663
I don't think so. He... Big Bird
doesn't make the tough decisions.

251
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:44,593
If I was going to put someone in
charge, I would put Bert in charge.

252
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,569
Or I would put one of the
real grownups in charge,

253
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:47,662
like Maria.

254
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,070
Or Gordon, maybe.

255
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,300
I thought you liked Jim.

256
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,639
Very much.
Jim is my best friend.

257
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,475
But here's his
performance report.

258
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:58,914
Right here.

259
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,781
Now, this was
written by Toby,

260
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:05,220
who we all know is
extremely reliable.

261
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,553
"Constant office distraction. Spends
way too much time at reception.

262
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:12,892
"Antagonizes other salesmen.
Not at all what he thinks he is."

263
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,092
It's not very well written.
But you get the gist.

264
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:19,534
Is there anybody else you think could
run the day-to-day of the branch?

265
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:21,765
I could just continue
to run it myself, that's...

266
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,640
Jim had an interesting idea to
help you with this extra workload.

267
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,701
And it involved
you being promoted

268
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,179
to oversee all
northeast sales.

269
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,342
And then Jim would be
promoted to your position.

270
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,114
This was Jim's idea?

271
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,177
Mmm-hmm.

272
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,619
Wow!

273
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:49,133
Well, I'd have to talk to my
mother and my guy at H&R Block.

274
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,900
Okay. But, well, see,
here's the thing, though.

275
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,530
The plan doesn't work

276
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,269
unless we have someone to
replace you. I was hoping...

277
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,641
Plus, we have to worry about
Jim. He has another job offer.

278
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,944
We may have to replace him.

279
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:08,782
I didn't tell Michael because
I thought he'd try to help.

280
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:13,952
Example, he handed out Jell-O shots at
the 23rd mile of the Steamtown Marathon.

281
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,291
Jim, can you walk me down
to my car for a second?

282
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:20,524
Sure.

283
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:45,544
I can't help but feel
partially responsible.

284
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:58,764
Little pick-me-up. Those
are the best. Sugar rush.

285
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,305
When you were in the office
earlier talking to Wallace,

286
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,499
did I come up at all?

287
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,676
Well, we did talk about
how handsome you are.

288
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:09,076
Why don't we head into
your office and talk?

289
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:12,776
Okay. What did
we... God! We said...

290
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:16,486
I know there were
certain things we said.

291
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,650
Michael, look.
I'll just be honest with you.

292
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,590
Earlier today, I spoke with
Wallace about a promotion.

293
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,217
And I actually think
that talk went really well.

294
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,318
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:25,726
And then,
after he spoke with you,

296
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,357
for some reason, it felt
like things had changed.

297
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,799
Hmm. That's weird.
That's weird.

298
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,531
Kind of weirding me out.

299
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,335
Did you know that Lincoln's
secretary was named Kennedy?

300
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,739
Michael,
did you say anything?

301
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,772
Tell you what,
when you leave this office,

302
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,973
I'm going to call Wallace
and I'm going to tell him

303
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,811
that you should
get that promotion.

304
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:46,976
Really?
Yes.

305
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,450
You will?
Yes.

306
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,009
Wanna do it right now?

307
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,077
Yes.

308
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:54,953
I tried to keep
Michael in the dark.

309
00:14:56,628 --> 00:15:00,689
I should have known that he can
do just as much damage in the dark.

310
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,194
I need to see
your pupils.

311
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:03,700
I have to see if
they're dilating...

312
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,497
Toby! Dwight!

313
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,699
Is that them?

314
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:08,966
Definitely.

315
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:13,043
You come to my house,
bust up my trash cans,

316
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:16,012
call my baby sister an ass
and told her to eat dog food?

317
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,775
We thought that
she was you.

318
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:20,044
Why would you think
a lady is me?

319
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:28,283
Are you serious? Because
you look exactly alike.

320
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,553
Am I the only one?
- That's too far...

321
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,492
Are you getting this?
I mean...

322
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:32,551
I don't see it.

323
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,427
Here's what
I'm gonna do.

324
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,957
I'm calling corporate and I'm filing
a complaint against both of you.

325
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,264
Oh, Darryl.

326
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:40,497
Come on, Gwyneth.

327
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:42,864
Sad.

328
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:45,899
This is David.

329
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:48,735
Hey, David,
this is Michael...

330
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:51,581
Michael Scott here.
Yeah.

331
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,913
Just wanted to talk to
you about Jim Halpert.

332
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:58,046
I understand that he did
not receive that promotion,

333
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:00,090
and I wanted to see
what I could do

334
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,558
to nudge you in the right direction.

335
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:05,755
So, what, you're changing
your mind about Jim?

336
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,460
Absolutely not!
Like I said before,

337
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:14,027
Jim is fantastic
and he deserves this job.

338
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,270
Michael, it seems like
you're cutting in and out.

339
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:20,334
This is not what
you said earlier.

340
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,038
What... Here's the thing.

341
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,648
Jim is the best
man for this job.

342
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,013
I think you should
give it to him.

343
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,348
Well, it doesn't change what
you showed me in Jim's file.

344
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,784
What?
Well...

345
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:33,288
That was an anomaly.

346
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,624
That file had been falsified.
Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.

347
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,631
Michael, I really don't know
what's going on down there, but...

348
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,325
Oh, damn it!

349
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:47,929
I am getting pulled over for
talking on my cell. Damn it!

350
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:56,180
Hey, Darryl, look,
we're here to apologize.

351
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:57,441
We're cool.
- Wait.

352
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,745
They're using the lift as
their own personal elevator.

353
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,409
What?
He broke his ankle

354
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,579
climbing over the railing,
then he lied about it

355
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:06,418
because it was a misuse
of company equipment.

356
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:07,981
Case closed.

357
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,492
Stupidest thing
I ever heard.

358
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,428
Really? Then why is there
new wood only on one railing?

359
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,328
Let's just check
the security tapes, Toby.

360
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:21,229
Well, you know, I don't think
there's any reason to check them,

361
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:24,502
but I suppose if we wanted
to be really certain.

362
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,839
All right. Yeah.
Fine, so whatever.

363
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:27,900
Yes!

364
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,207
You really did it.

365
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,977
Now, I would like to file an
official complaint to corporate

366
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,452
because Darryl lied
on an official form.

367
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:39,081
And I'm telling them you guys
sexually harassed my sister.

368
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:42,388
No judge
is gonna believe that.

369
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:46,159
Okay.

370
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,165
Look, we could all file
complaints against each other

371
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,997
and just drown in a sea
of paperwork, but,

372
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,267
you know, we'll just
move on with our lives.

373
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:01,444
So, Dwight and Darryl came to an
agreement that they would both file

374
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:03,036
complaints
with corporate,

375
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:05,742
and now I get to do
all this paperwork.

376
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,745
We worked it out.

377
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:14,785
Hey, hey, Jim. It would make
me feel really good right now

378
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:18,226
if you would just punch me in
the face, all right? Just do it.

379
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,786
How many times
have I asked you

380
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:21,331
to put me up for
a branch manager job?

381
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:24,368
I never recommended you because
I didn't want to lose you.

382
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,096
And I didn't
want to lose Pam.

383
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,728
Now I don't want
to lose the baby.

384
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,705
So, instead,
you screwed me?

385
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,833
That's what she said.
No.

386
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:33,999
David Wallace
is calling.

387
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,204
We're kind of in the
middle of something here.

388
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,268
Should I tell him
you'll call back?

389
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:39,544
Yeah. No.
I'll tell him myself.

390
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,507
Let's both.

391
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:46,712
Hello?

392
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,019
Hey, Michael.
Yes.

393
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,252
You got Jim
there with you?

394
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,794
No, it's just us.

395
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:53,729
Actually, can you call Jim in?
I want him on this. Please.

396
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:56,392
Oh! Well, here
he is right now.

397
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:58,896
Come in.

398
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,443
Hi, David.

399
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:09,378
Hey, guys.
So, I spoke to Alan.

400
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,905
We had kind of an unconventional
idea, which I think is pretty cool.

401
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,544
But it only works if
everyone's on board.

402
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,282
Well, just as long as it
means Jim becomes a manager.

403
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,655
We were thinking of having two
branch managers in Scranton.

404
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:24,160
Both of you guys
working as co-managers.

405
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:25,593
Jim would handle
the day-to-day,

406
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:29,030
and Michael, you would focus on
clients and big picture stuff.

407
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,328
Wow!
That sounds pretty cool.

408
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,629
I like that!

409
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,499
So, manager
and co-manager.

410
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,664
Co-manager and co-manager.

411
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,230
See, there are a lot
of moving pieces

412
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:39,674
and this is the only way
I can sell it upstairs.

413
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,507
Well, that might be a
little confusing for people

414
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:43,740
because they
know me as manager.

415
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:47,714
All right, hey, Michael, can
you pick up for one second?

416
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,183
Okay, look, I'm not going
to force you into anything.

417
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:53,416
If you're willing
to lose Jim, fine.

418
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,585
You just say so. We'll
find another solution. Okay?

419
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,588
Is that what
you want to do?

420
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,797
Okay, people, listen up!
- Okay, everybody.

421
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,863
I have an announcement to make.

422
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,169
Fraud was committed in... Whoa!

423
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,231
Do you have
an announcement?

424
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,675
I was making it.

425
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,577
Everybody, David Wallace
and I have talked,

426
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:20,640
and we have decided to promote
Jim to the position of co-manager.

427
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:22,477
Co-manager of what?

428
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,384
Of your butt!

429
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:28,992
And your butt, and your butt, and your
butt. All of Scranton branch butts.

430
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,584
What's happening
to you, Michael?

431
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:31,787
What's happening to me?

432
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:34,296
I am also being
promoted to co-manager.

433
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:36,731
We will be
co-managers together.

434
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,833
Jim Halpert, welcome.

435
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,270
Thank you.

436
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:53,846
Niagara Falls in October?
Hells yeah!

437
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:57,354
Do you think that you could
send in your RSVP card?

438
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:58,854
No. I'll just
tell you now. Easier.

439
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,255
Well, you have to
choose a food option,

440
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,816
and there's information in there
about directions and lodging.

441
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:06,761
I'll just have whatever's
fanciest, unless there's ribs,

442
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,425
and I'll just get all the other
information the day of. I'll text you.

443
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,526
You are going to text me
the morning of my wedding

444
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,070
to ask for directions...
Mmm-hmm. Right.

445
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:16,436
...and you will eat
whatever is fanciest?

446
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:17,838
Unless there's ribs.

447
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:20,234
Rude.

448
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:22,211
So rude, right?
Mmm-hmm.

449
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,579
Oh, my gosh. I have been
chasing people down all day.

450
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,639
It's incredible.

451
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,378
Pam, my bag was there.
