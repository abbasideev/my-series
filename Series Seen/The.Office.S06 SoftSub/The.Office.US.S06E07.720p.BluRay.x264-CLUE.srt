1
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:05,895
They're back!

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:08,735
Oh, yeah!

3
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:11,207
Woo-hoo!
- Jim and Pam!

4
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:13,574
- How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
- It was.

5
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:14,634
It really was.

6
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:15,805
Really was.

7
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:17,712
I'm so happy for you.

8
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:19,011
Puerto Rico
was awesome.

9
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,109
Oh, my gosh. The honeymoon was great.

10
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:23,586
We met this other couple at
the resort, Frank and Benny.

11
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:25,145
We hung out
with them a lot.

12
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:28,716
Frank and
Beans. Always makes her laugh.

13
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,596
Frank and Beans.

14
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,322
Is there someone there?
Who's there?

15
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,925
I hear voices.
Is somebody there?

16
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,094
Yeah!

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,130
Is someone here? I can't
see you because I'm blind.

18
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,470
It's Jim
and Pam, Michael.

19
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,033
- It is?
- Yeah.

20
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,442
They're back?

21
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,007
Pam.
Nope.

22
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,780
And, oh, Jim.

23
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:56,184
Hi, Michael.

24
00:00:56,255 --> 00:01:01,090
I haven't seen you since my
accident that I had when I fell...

25
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:05,525
I fell into the pool
of acid, eyes-first.

26
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:08,090
Blind guy.

27
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:11,869
Blind Guy McSqueezy.
How do I describe it?

28
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:14,030
It is a character
I've been workshopping,

29
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:17,633
whose lack of vision gets
him into all sorts of trouble.

30
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,507
The women in my improv
class absolutely hate him.

31
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:26,808
So, what'd you
bring us?

32
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:28,147
Some candy.

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,278
What else?

34
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:30,343
That's it.

35
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:33,186
Oh, because you spent
so much on the wedding.

36
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,122
It's good to be home.

37
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:02,415
This conversation has
two items on the agenda.

38
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:03,716
Did we have a conversation scheduled?

39
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,758
Number one, do not leave
your things on my desk.

40
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,521
It's not some kind of personal
pen receptacle for you.

41
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,290
I don't care how high
they promote you.

42
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:14,093
Which brings me
to item number two.

43
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,498
I never formally congratulated
you on your promotion,

44
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:20,868
so I'd just like to
say congratulations.

45
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:26,038
Wow. That's really thoughtful
of you, Dwight. Thank you.

46
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,135
You're welcome.

47
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:31,242
I inserted a listening device
into the belly of the mallard.

48
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:35,585
Now I can observe Jim,
track Jim, and destroy Jim.

49
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,383
Just like in
the Bavarian fairytale.

50
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,790
Only this time the mallard
skins the toad alive.

51
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,217
And, of course,
in this version,

52
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,958
you lose the whole veiled
critique of the Kaiser thing.

53
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,991
I'm sorry to have been
bugging you all these years.

54
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,595
It's a real
handsome duck.

55
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:54,696
Mallard.

56
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,832
Okay, I'll get out
of your hair.

57
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:04,440
Hey.
Hey.

58
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,416
We brought back some
Puerto Rican candy.

59
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,578
Coco-Leche. That's
my favorite. Awesome.

60
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,383
I'll leave it up here
so everyone can enjoy it.

61
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:13,720
Oh, let me just check
with Michael first.

62
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,885
I think it'll be okay.

63
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:18,759
I think it will, too, but I'll
just check with him, though.

64
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,819
Great.

65
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:22,423
Oops. Sorry. Oops!

66
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,401
I have recently
taken a lover.

67
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:36,072
Well, that's great.
Congratulations.

68
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,944
Who's the lucky lady?

69
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,244
Pam's mom.

70
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:43,254
What?
Pam's mom, Helene.

71
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:44,550
Remember,
from your wedding?

72
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,058
You're messing with me.
About what?

73
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,854
You did not have
sex with Pam's mom.

74
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:49,951
Oh, big time.

75
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,017
What kind of car
does she drive?

76
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:52,654
She drives a green Camry,

77
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,495
And the seats go
all the way down.

78
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,556
All the way down.

79
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:57,897
Oh, my God.

80
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:00,026
Oh, my God.

81
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:01,732
What?

82
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:04,367
Okay, never tell Pam,
and then, secondly...

83
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,934
Good. A pact. A pact.

84
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,206
Although, I may have
to break it tonight,

85
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,181
when Helene and I
tell Pam over dinner.

86
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,308
You all right?

87
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,408
Oh, my God.

88
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,510
Hey, Jim... Not now, Toby. My God!

89
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,521
Jesus. Get the hell out of here, idiot!

90
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,647
What did I do?

91
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,249
Okay, as far as dinner
tonight, cancel that,

92
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,317
and please,
for both of our sakes,

93
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:27,195
never, ever,
ever see her again.

94
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,166
I think you're
underestimating Pam.

95
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,668
I think more than anything,
she wants me to be happy.

96
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,637
No. Not more
than anything.

97
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:34,967
Okay. I...

98
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,031
I have a good thing with the
mom. Don't call her "the mom."

99
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:38,440
She's right on my way
home from work.

100
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,875
Then take a different
way home, man!

101
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:43,278
All right,
I'll take surface streets.

102
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:46,240
The last thing in the world I
would want to do is upset Pam.

103
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,808
Okay. So, we're good.

104
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:48,978
Yeah.

105
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,852
Can you change my dinner
reservations from four people to two?

106
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,191
Sure. Is it okay
if I put out some candy

107
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,787
that Pam brought back
from Puerto Rico?

108
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,856
Sure.
Thanks for asking.

109
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,491
Pam, we're all set.

110
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,434
Yum.

111
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:13,800
Frank and Beans!

112
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,437
Frank and Beans!

113
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,846
So, what'd we decide
for Michael?

114
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,715
The bottle of rum or
the seashell alarm clock?

115
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,722
You know what, can I have
the weekend to decide?

116
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,553
Bottle of rum it is.

117
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:29,752
All right, shall we?
You know what?

118
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,626
I am really slammed trying to
catch up on everything here,

119
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,757
and I know that
Michael's slammed, too,

120
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,769
so maybe we should do this when
things are a little less crazy.

121
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,074
Come on, it'll take two seconds.

122
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,575
No, it...

123
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,257
Oh, wow.

124
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,870
That is amazing. I feel
like a real Puerto Rican.

125
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,270
Michael, you're all
set at Botticelli's.

126
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,830
I changed the reservation
to two people.

127
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,273
Erin, look.

128
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,008
Fun.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,180
Wow, Botticelli's. That
sounds like a special occasion.

130
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,080
Yeah, no,
it's nobody.

131
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:29,812
I don't know. I think
Michael has a date.

132
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,549
No. Yeah, I think you have a date.

133
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,284
I don't, I don't.
Come on.

134
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:34,950
Ah, I think we should just drop it.

135
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,586
Because obviously he doesn't
want to talk about it.

136
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,425
I don't deserve this, guys.
- Yes, you do.

137
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,830
No, I don't.
Just take the parrot.

138
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,459
Okay, back to
the old grind.

139
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,437
I was probably going to
break up with her anyway.

140
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,201
Oh! That's too bad.
Don't.

141
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,969
Pam, it is very
complicated.

142
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,236
There are a lot of
moving parts here.

143
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,470
Sounds complicated.

144
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,706
Yeah, but, I mean, if you
really like this person,

145
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,476
then you should
see where it goes.

146
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:58,607
You want me
to be happy?

147
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,310
Of course.

148
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:04,754
Part of the problem is she's the
mother of a close friend of mine.

149
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,281
Oh.

150
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,792
More than a friend.
A coworker.

151
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,860
Oh, gossip.
Who is it?

152
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,932
Who is it?

153
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,599
Who is it,
Michael?

154
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,907
Who?

155
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,033
It's okay.

156
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,637
No, no, no, no, no.

157
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:33,212
No. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

158
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,879
No!

159
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,414
That could have
gone one of two ways,

160
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,981
but I never expected her to get upset.

161
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:51,429
You seem tense. Hey, you want
me to give you the chills?

162
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,331
Okay.

163
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:03,847
There's an egg on your
head And the yolk is running down

164
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:05,007
The yolk is running down

165
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,141
Feels good.

166
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:09,551
There's a knife in your back
And the blood is gushing down

167
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,419
Sleeping with Pam's mom.
Sometimes dinner.

168
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:17,558
The blood is gushing down
The blood is gushing down

169
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,991
You know, I really would
have appreciated a heads-up

170
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,397
that you were
into dating mothers.

171
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,765
I would have introduced you to mine.

172
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:28,067
How could you do this
to me? He's my boss.

173
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:31,904
How many times have I
complained about him to you?

174
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,441
No, I am not being dramatic,
you are being crazy!

175
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,544
Who wants a hot chocolate?

176
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,052
Thank you.

177
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:49,586
So, Dwight gave me this
wooden mallard as a gift.

178
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:52,129
I found a recording
device in it.

179
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:57,057
Yes. So, I think
if I play it just right,

180
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:01,163
I can get Dwight to live out
the plot of National Treasure.

181
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:05,300
You need to be more upset about
this. She's your mother, too, now.

182
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:10,113
Your mother is sleeping
with Michael Scott.

183
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,419
Andy, can I talk
to you for a second?

184
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,318
Sure thing,
Tuna boss.

185
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,899
How may I be
of service to you?

186
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:34,000
I am going to need
your advice.

187
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,417
I was thinking of getting this
opera for Dwight's birthday.

188
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,182
What do you think?

189
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,493
This aria is a joke.
Really?

190
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:57,823
What are you thinking?

191
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:01,791
I was going to go
with this one.

192
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,664
Let me tell you something,
if you respect him at all,

193
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,204
you will get him
something better.

194
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,104
Nard-Dog, what was
that all about?

195
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,440
I know, right?

196
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:15,979
What were you guys
talking about in there?

197
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,515
Trust me, it would
only make you mad.

198
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,263
Due to a certain
recent incident,

199
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:36,027
corporate has asked all the
branches to come up with ideas

200
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:40,595
as to how we can better
communicate with our communities.

201
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:44,164
Is this because of the 60 Minutes
segment about working conditions

202
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:45,300
in our Peruvian
paper mill?

203
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,935
That was a hit job.

204
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:50,539
If you read the Dunder Mifflin
press release, it clearly states

205
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,083
that they had absolutely
nothing to do

206
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:55,210
with that particular
cancer cluster.

207
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,118
So, if there is a lesson
to be learned here,

208
00:10:58,189 --> 00:10:59,884
and I'm not sure
that there is,

209
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,654
it is that in order to
help our communities,

210
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,525
we need to put other people's
needs ahead of our own.

211
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,895
And whoever comes up with the best
idea gets a $50 gift certificate

212
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:11,868
to the restaurant of his or
her choice.

213
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,767
Yeah.
- Good, good.

214
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:17,706
Okay, who wants to help the
world one step at a time?

215
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,301
All right, good.

216
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:20,401
Volunteerism is important.

217
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,707
Every weekend I volunteer
at the local animal shelter,

218
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:24,749
and they need a lot
of help down there.

219
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,546
Last Sunday, I had to put down
over 150 pets all by myself.

220
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:28,745
All right,
that's...

221
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,288
Paint a mural of Chicano
leaders. All right.

222
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:34,519
I have a way to make Scranton a
better place. You could leave it.

223
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,989
Okay, I'm out of here.
See you later, guys.

224
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,553
And stay out.
Bye-bye.

225
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,061
Okay. Oh, no, here's
an idea. Conservation.

226
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,034
I love it,
conservation.

227
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:47,663
Let's start by
conserving our time

228
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,866
and stop having
these stupid meetings.

229
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:54,107
No more meetings!
No more meetings!

230
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,376
No more meetings!
No more meetings!

231
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,909
Anybody else?
Who else has an idea?

232
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,976
- I have some ideas about conservation.
- Yes.

233
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,214
Angela.
Thank you.

234
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,153
Please. Can you hold down the fort?

235
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,557
Hey, boo. ANGELA: Well, first
of all, I think that we could...

236
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:10,616
Why are you crying?

237
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,253
Yes, I think we should
look into that.

238
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,389
If you could just
speak up louder.

239
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,694
- Well, for our profit and loss...
- No, no.

240
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:21,429
No, I'll talk to her. I will. No,
nobody talks to my baby that way. Uh-uh.

241
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:25,641
Yeah, I'll let you know how it
goes. All right. Bye, pickle.

242
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,605
- Who's pickle?
- Who's pickle?

243
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,741
Pamela Morgan Beesly.

244
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:33,409
You need to apologize
to your mother right now.

245
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,919
I'm sorry, I was told
I had the floor. Yes.

246
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,284
Hold on, hold on.
What's going on?

247
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,413
Nothing.

248
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,924
Nothing at all.
It's all good.

249
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:45,691
I'm not apologizing to anyone.
Michael owes me an apology.

250
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,629
For trying to find happiness
in the arms of a lover?

251
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,394
Don't call my mother
your lover.

252
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:51,968
Oh, yes! That's what
I'm talking about.

253
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,663
That is not okay, dude.

254
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:54,966
All right,
in my defense...

255
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,836
Disgusting.
That's messed up, man.

256
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,308
Yes, thank you.
Welcome to my personal hell.

257
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:01,641
You have no sense of boundaries,
Michael. Shut up, Oscar.

258
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:04,045
Hey, all right, you know what?
Clearly, I'm outnumbered here.

259
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:07,482
But can I just say
one thing? Please?

260
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,412
What is so wrong
about me?

261
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,685
I'm caring,
I'm generous.

262
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,260
I'm sensual.

263
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:24,424
Is it really so horrible that I could
possibly go out and find happiness?

264
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,803
Good luck, Michael. I hope
you find what you're looking for.

265
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,071
Maybe you're right.
Who are we to...

266
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:35,237
Shut up, Oscar!

267
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:36,746
What is wrong
with all of you?

268
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,249
He is sleeping
with my mother!

269
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,581
I don't think there's a whole
lot of sleeping going on.

270
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,951
Let's get back to
the matter at hand.

271
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,387
Whatever, you know.

272
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,447
Sleep with my mom, just
sleep with everybody's mom.

273
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:48,514
No, no, no,
no, no... No.

274
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,527
This is not... RYAN: Whoa! That's
my mom you're talking about.

275
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:51,892
I don't like
the tone here.

276
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,488
This is a place of business.
You are to listen to others,

277
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,999
you are to give
others respect,

278
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,160
and you are to keep your
personal issues out of it.

279
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:00,602
Oh, my God!
You are ridiculous!

280
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,936
Do not talk
to me that way!

281
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,568
I am your boss and I may someday
be your father, so get out.

282
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:09,772
You are never going to
be my father. You get out.

283
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,784
I hope that you are willing to
die in this office, because I am.

284
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:15,514
Me, too.

285
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,684
Hey.
Hey.

286
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,292
Pam, how's your day going?

287
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:26,387
Pam, just for the record, I think
you're overreacting a little bit.

288
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,455
Your mom's old enough
to make her own decisions.

289
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,728
Oh, well, thanks, Oscar.

290
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,167
I was just wondering,
how would you feel

291
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,966
if Michael was sleeping
with your mom?

292
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,165
My mother's
in a wheelchair.

293
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:38,574
Well, he could still...

294
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,342
I'm sorry about that.

295
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:46,547
Could I just get you to sign
the second page as well?

296
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:49,212
Ryan, I have
to ask you a personal question.

297
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,050
Do you think that
I should get a fedora?

298
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,090
I don't think so, no.

299
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:54,821
Why? I think I'd
look really hot in one.

300
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,121
Where did you
get your fedora?

301
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,388
I'd rather
not say.

302
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,794
You think I'm going
to get the same fedora as you?

303
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,024
Hey, Dwight.
Shh!

304
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,260
Natural look. KELLY: I think
I would look really cute in it.

305
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,858
It has to go with the
persona that you already have.

306
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,164
Well, I think
I have that persona.

307
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:07,397
Where did you
get that mallard?

308
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,461
What the hell
is a mallard?

309
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:09,870
That!

310
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:13,400
Oh, Professor Damon D. Duck.
Jim gave him to me.

311
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,946
Okay, I gave that to him as
a gift. I'm taking that back.

312
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,777
If you take it back,
I'll scream.

313
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:21,310
I'll give you
five bucks for it.

314
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,717
Twenty.

315
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:24,152
Ten.
Deal.

316
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,093
You're so cool.

317
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,289
This reminds me, you owe
me three bucks for gas.

318
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,896
Hey, Toby, can I talk
to you for a minute?

319
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:36,991
Yeah, sure.

320
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,933
What's up?
I just wanted to apologize

321
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:40,937
for taking that tone
with you earlier.

322
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,200
That was uncalled for.
I'm sorry.

323
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:47,005
Yeah. That means a lot.
Thank you for saying it.

324
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,067
Can I sit down
for a second?

325
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,135
Yeah,
or pull up a chair,

326
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:50,510
or you can sit
on the shredder.

327
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,780
This is going
to sound weird,

328
00:15:57,355 --> 00:16:00,791
but I think I may be the victim
of a hostile work environment

329
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,655
with this whole
Pam situation.

330
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:05,457
You should probably deal with
that outside of the workplace.

331
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,088
She brought it
into the workplace,

332
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,463
so I feel like it has
to be dealt with here.

333
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:12,503
Yeah. Okay, well, I
mean, I could talk to her.

334
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,559
Really?
Yeah.

335
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,367
Would you do that?
Yeah.

336
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,704
That's why they
pay me the big bucks.

337
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,214
You're a good, good guy.

338
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,107
Okay.

339
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:29,119
You know, I always knew if Michael
just took the time to get to know me,

340
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:30,677
we'd become friends.

341
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,958
Hey, Pam, could I talk
to you for a sec?

342
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,429
Sure. What's up?

343
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:42,432
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light
of everything that's happened today,

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,094
it would be a good idea
if you and me and Michael

345
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,036
head into the conference room
for some conflict resolution.

346
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,573
What's the matter? Can't
fight your own battles?

347
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,200
No, that's...

348
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:54,506
Maybe you should just take the
rest of the day off, you know?

349
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,444
Oh, would that make
you feel better?

350
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:59,142
I don't... I can't hear
your conversation.

351
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:02,118
You can tell Michael
that I'm not leaving.

352
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,088
Buddy, I think that you
can't make her leave...

353
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,684
Yeah, yeah, okay,
you're a jackass.

354
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:14,391
Hey, hey, you know what? You're
just as stubborn as your mother.

355
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,092
When you don't want to do
something, you just don't do it.

356
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,066
Michael, you're just her rebound!

357
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,968
You were right, Jim, I
should have listened to you.

358
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,973
Should never
have told her.

359
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,770
What? You knew?

360
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:29,905
Barely. I... I don't have all the facts.

361
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:33,147
Frank and Beans.

362
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:38,785
Okay, do you want me
to stop dating your mom?

363
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:41,290
Is that how we're going to
get past this? Because I will.

364
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,725
Hmm. Yes.

365
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,194
Well, that is not
going to happen.

366
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,560
Then why did you
even offer?

367
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:49,498
Because I assumed that
you want me to be happy,

368
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,092
because I want
you to be happy.

369
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,900
Michael, let me make
this very easy for you.

370
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:58,965
I could give a About your
happiness. Stop dating my mother!

371
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,840
You know what? I'm going to
start dating her even harder.

372
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,074
What's that
supposed to mean?

373
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,581
You know what it means.

374
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:12,547
Hey.
Shut it.

375
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:13,783
Yep.

376
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,223
I don't need to be
friends with Pam.

377
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,092
I have plenty of
female friends.

378
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:25,329
My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt,
although she just blocked me on IM.

379
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:29,966
What's-her-face from Quiznos.
I see her four times a week.

380
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,072
Dwight, you brought
the mallard back.

381
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,050
Well, I had to.
I mean, Kelly was not...

382
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:42,717
Hi, buddy.

383
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,767
I'm sorry.
A wooden duck?

384
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:03,205
Mallard. I put it in your
office in order to surveil you.

385
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,037
I was jealous that you
got the promotion over me.

386
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:09,875
Okay, just to be clear,
you're terrible at this.

387
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:11,812
And you're not equipped for
espionage. I'm equipped...

388
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,145
Stop.

389
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,274
Don't tell Michael.

390
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,445
I won't.

391
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:19,012
But you will wash
and buff our car.

392
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,150
Punishment fits the crime. I accept.

393
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:26,888
Good night, everyone.
Night, Pam.

394
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:29,792
Thanks again
for the rum.

395
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:33,832
Good night, Michael.
Good night, Erin.

396
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,702
Hey, Pam, can I see you for a second?

397
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:45,812
So, Dwight heard you were
having a really rough day,

398
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,681
so he generously
offered to wash our car.

399
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,744
Aw, he did that for me?

400
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:53,687
Yes, he did.

401
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,457
You know what was nice?

402
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,553
Night swimming in Biobay.

403
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:02,792
Remember that older couple whose
kids were also named Jim and Pam?

404
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,027
Yeah.

405
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,269
Say more nice things.

406
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,241
Well, we went on a Segway
tour, and we're awesome at it.

407
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,777
Yes, we are.

408
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:16,176
And Frank and Beans.

409
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,675
Maybe I'm overreacting.

410
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,548
Yeah, maybe.

411
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:24,812
But I don't think I am.

412
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,789
You're not, nope.

413
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,051
Nope.

414
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,628
Oh! Where did you get that hat?

415
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:35,893
I'd rather not say.

416
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:02,388
We have our high
quality 28-pound bond,

417
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,988
our heavier 38-pound bond, or our...

418
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,925
I've got eight
hours of this.

419
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:15,929
Of course I wanted Jim to find
the mallard. Make him feel safe.

420
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:19,374
Did you really think I would
put my primary listening device

421
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,910
in a wooden mallard?

422
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,637
I'm not insane.

423
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:27,746
Fifty-five pound cover
stock, which is the heaviest paper

424
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:30,013
that will still feed smoothly
through your desktop printer.
