1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,200
De Beauvoir's work
is steeped in patriarchal values.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,360
It asks how we can be better emancipated
living within a man's world

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
rather than calling
for what women actually need,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,840
which is a complete withdrawal
from that mode of being.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
What are you suggesting?

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,600
For women to go and live on some commune?

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,400
No, darling. The men.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,880
- Have you got everything you need?
- Mum.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,160
- Turtle, it's a party.
- Stop calling me Turtle. I hate it.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,160
But look at your cute little turtley nose.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Just give it to me.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,640
Now look what you've done.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,280
You're going to get me in trouble.
I'm supposed to be watching you.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,280

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,120
Did you find the salt?

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,720

Morning, Turtle.
Has Otis not come back yet?

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,640
No. He's been at Maeve's all weekend.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,360
He's got a mock exam today.
I feel like he's shutting me out.

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,800
Maybe he's just embarrassed
to have Maeve stay over.

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Why would he be embarrassed?

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,680
Perhaps you need
to be a little bit less intense.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,640
You know, like one
of those laid-back, cool, friend mums.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm laid-back.

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,280
Anyway, I've decided
to give you the money.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,120
Oh my God. Thank you.

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
What's this?

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,920
It's a "sister contract"
so that we both understand the conditions.

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,440
It's very, um... long.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Yeah.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,480
Mull it over. Take your time.

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,400
There's no rush. And when you sign it,
I'll transfer the money.

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,800
You are not laid-back.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,560
I might come in
and register at college today.

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
Really?

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Oh, um, my mum.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,800
<i>Um, can you chat for a minute?</i>

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,760
Uh, if this is about O, then no.

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
<i>It's not.</i>

62
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,160
The show's on hiatus
until that stuff about, you know,

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,280
her being deleted gets worked out.

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Canceled, Mum.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,200
<i>That's not actually why
I called at all.</i>

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,720
I was just wondering if you and Maeve
wanted to come over for dinner tonight.

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,480
It would be very relaxed.

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
Um, you know, laid-back.

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
<i>Not intense at all.</i>

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
Okay, let me ask.

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,880
Mum's wondering
if you wanna come for dinner.

72
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,440
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,600
I just... I thought, Maeve and I
got off on the wrong foot,

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,960
and... well, I'd like
to get to know her better.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,440
She wants to get to know you better.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,640
- Fine.
- Yeah?

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
<i>- That sounds really nice.</i>
- Oh.

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,400
<i>- We'll come over later.</i>
- Good.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
Okay, bye.

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,280
Sorry, she put me on the spot.

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,600
Hmm. Oh.

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll get it.

83
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
- Come in.
- Oh, you're not Jean. Stranger.

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,920
Hi, Jean. Got you a skimmed latte,
if I remembered correctly?

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
- Thanks.
- Nice house!

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,800
Except for that tree house out the front.

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
That's creepy.

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,240
My ex built it.

89
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm going to take it down.
I just haven't had the chance.

90
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,520
Um, sorry. Have I forgotten something?

91
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,880
I just wanna chat.

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm... I'm gonna go.

93
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Let's go in here.

99
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,240

100
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440

What the fuck?

111
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Here you go. Your mother's finest.

112
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,720
How are you feeling about your exam?

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,360
I just got an email saying
that there's no record of my sperm donor.

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,560
I thought we agreed you were going to wait
until after your exams.

115
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,720
I know you guys
are hiding something from me.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Jackson, we just want you to do well.

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,120
It's your final year at college.
You need to stay focused.

118
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,080
- Mum, can you tell me what's going on?
- There's nothing going on.

119
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,280
It's just a mix-up.

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,800
Stop staring at me.

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,640
You silly, silly Jesus.

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,440
Eric!
Your toast is getting burnt!

123
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,600
Should I have bought Joy a "babyccino"?

124
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,920
Look, I wanted to come over
to update you.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Things got a little fruity
down at the station.

126
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,840
And "Terry" is not happy with me at all,

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,960
but I still have a lot of faith
that we can make this show work.

128
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,000
We just have to come up
with a plan of action and regroup.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,120
Well, the thing is, Celia, um,

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,600
I don't think
I'm the right person for the show.

131
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,600
Oh.

132
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,800
I thought I'd be able
to juggle everything,

133
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
and it turns out
that it's a lot harder than I realized.

134
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,960
But the last show was a lot better.
You were finding your groove.

135
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,200
I just need to be a mum right now.

136
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,920
Uh, hi. Hey, everyone.
The fundraiser's coming up,

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and we're still looking for people
to help with ticketing and catering,

138
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,560
so shoot me a message if... Ooh.

139
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,080
you fancy helping out.

140
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,280
You're so brave for outing O.

141
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,160
Yeah, and I accidentally pissed
in my wardrobe when I was drunk once,

142
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
so you shouldn't feel embarrassed.

143
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,400
So it's down there for enrollment.

144
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,640
- Okay.
- Good luck.

145
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
- See you later.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,000
Ruby. Hi. Um...

147
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,080
That stuff I said about us and Maeve,
I'm really sorry.

148
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
It was pigheaded of me,
and I was panicking,

149
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,200
and that sometimes
makes me say stupid things.

150
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,720
But I... I really think we still have
a chance of winning this thing

151
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
if we can move past it.

152
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,280
I'm working for someone new now, Otis.

153
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,400
{\an8}- Take a badge.
- Stick it in your eye.

154
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,520
Oh, come on. Be reasonable.

155
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,120
- Who put you up to this?
- Nobody. I'm an independent.

156
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
You?

157
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
No. No, you can't just join the race.
That's against the rules.

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
There are no rules, Otis.

159
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
And Connor is no less worthy
than either of you two.

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,600
- But I have had my channel for years.
- No, okay...

161
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,560
- I've been around therapy my entire life.
- Actually, my dad's also a therapist.

162
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,160
And I have my own video channel,
mostly about gaming.

163
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,880
- But Ruby's helping me rebrand.
- Rebrand. Yes.

164
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,200
She took me shopping.

165
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Connor, no one's gonna vote for you.

166
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,640
Sorry. We're more likely to vote for him
than either of you two.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,960
You're both super problematic.

168
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,816
- Excuse me.
- I am not problematic.

169
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,200
And we have free beanies!
Free beanies for everyone!

170
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,920
- Vote Connor! Vote Connor!
- Ah, Jesus.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,120
Vote Connor! Vote Connor!

172
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,440
- Enough.
- Oh yeah!

173
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,800
I've figured it out.

174
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
The meaning of life?

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,840
No, what I wanna take photos of.
I've taken my first ones. Can I show you?

176
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,280
- Aren't we not supposed to be talking?
- No, Maeve says we can be friends.

177
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,600
Yeah.

178
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Let's go!

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,760
<i>♪ Hush, little planty, don't say a word ♪</i>

180
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,000
<i>♪ Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪</i>

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,960
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, Maeve? It's, uh, Mo.</i>

182
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,080
<i>Uh, the dodgy one.</i>

183
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah, hi.

184
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,880
<i>Sean asked me to tell you
you need to pick your mum up.</i>

185
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,640
Why, where is he?

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
<i>He's left, took all his stuff. Um...</i>

187
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
<i>All right. Peace out.</i>

188
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,760
Oh.

189
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,440
Oh. Hi, Maeve.

190
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Hi.

191
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,560
I'm sorry about your mum.

192
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,280
Oh, do cock biters get a free pass
when they've got a dead mum?

193
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
How gracious.

194
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,480
So,

195
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,960
these are the jeans
I was wearing on that day

196
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,760
when I was assaulted on the bus.

197
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,840
I keep meaning to throw them away,
but for some reason, I can't.

198
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,040
Every day I feel more like myself,
and, like, that's great,

199
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
but sometimes, it feels like

200
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,600
even when I'm doing something I love,

201
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,080
like eating ice cream...

202
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,320
it feels like I'm still wearing them.

203
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
Like it never goes away.

204
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,960
So, yeah, this is my idea.

205
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,840
These are brilliant.

206
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
Well, you've helped so much.

207
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,280
You're gonna be such a great teacher.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you, but this is all you.

209
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,200
<i>Can students who are taking
the history or geography mock exams</i>

210
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,040
<i>make their way to the first floor?</i>

211
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
- Vote Connor.
- Connor.

212
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,640
Talk to me because I don't get it.

213
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,960
You're so in love.

214
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
This way.

215
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,600
<i>Doors closing.</i>

216
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
<i>Lift going up.</i>

217
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,720
Hello?

218
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Sarajevo, Belgrade, Sofia.

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,880
- Uh, what's the capital of Montenegro?
- Podgorica.

220
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,080
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

221
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,960
It was called Titograd between
1946 to 1992, but we're splitting hairs.

222
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
- You got this.
- Thanks.

223
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,600
Viv.

224
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Hey.

225
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Why were you talking to that guy?

226
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
What guy? Oh, he was just
asking me questions about the exam.

227
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,920
Oh, because it looked like you were
coming onto him. That's why.

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Uh, I wasn't. Trust me.

229
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,776
- Don't lie to me.
- Geography mock this way.

230
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,880
Oh, I think they're going in, so...

231
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
Don't walk away from me.

232
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,640
You're hurting me, Beau.

233
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,320
Ow, s-stop.

234
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,360
What are you doing?

235
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't be nervous. You'll smash it.

236
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Hello?

237
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,280
Phone's dead.

238
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,760
Are you sure?

239
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,480
No, I, uh, just fancied staying in here
with you for a wee bit longer, Otis.

240
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Hello?

241
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Hello?

242
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,840
Oh God.

243
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Oh God.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,120
Oh, we're stuck. We are stuck in here.
We're gonna run out of air, O.

245
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,680
We're gonna run out of air and oxygen,
and we might die.

246
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,840
- What are you doing?
- Trying to pretend that you're not here.

247
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,600
AC/DC. AC/DC. Adam and the Ants.

248
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,200
Bowie, David. Carpenters.

249
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,960
Ugh. It was working this morning.

250
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,640
Well, it's not working now.
It's stuck again!

251
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,120
Look, you're gonna be late,
so if you just take the stairs...

252
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,040
No, I'm waiting with you.

253
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,160
Excuse me. Siobhan, hi.

254
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,440
I've got an exam
in exactly ten minutes' time. Upstairs.

255
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,640
And the shitty lift is broken again.

256
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,920
Right.

257
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,040
- I'll get Principal Lakhani.
- Yeah.

258
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,920
I've had enough of this.

259
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,680
- There's mischief in your eyes.
- Hmm.

260
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
You are now
under exam conditions.

261
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
If you have unauthorized items...

262
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,320
I have not revised.

263
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,440
...electronic device,
you must hand them in now.

264
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,200
If you do not hand them in,
your results may be canceled.

265
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,080
You should have a question paper
on your desk.

266
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,360
Do not open the question paper
until I instruct you to do so.

267
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,880
You'll have 60 minutes
to complete this exam.

268
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,520
Your time starts now.

269
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,400
All right. Stay calm, everyone.

270
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,560
Please make your way to the exit,
and leave your exam papers where they are.

271
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,360
- Oh my God, like, I hate fire.
- Single file. Don't run.

272
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,520
Everybody, please remain calm.

273
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,440
Form two very distinctive lines behind me.

274
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,680
We'll descend the stairs, exit outside,
and gather at the muster point.

275
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,440
- Nothing to worry about.
- Is this gonna be all tough?

276
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,080
Uh...

277
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,120
Right. Uh, that's fine.

278
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,960
Um, we may need to find
an alternative way...

279
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,080
How do we get out?

280
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,400
- We're going to die.
- No one's gonna... We're not gonna die.

281
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
It's annoying, isn't it?

282
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,560
Not being able
to get where you need to go.

283
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,120
What's... What's happening?
This is very disruptive.

284
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,320
- Ros, can you please sort out the alarm?
- On my way.

285
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,680
I've asked nicely multiple times
for the lift to be replaced,

286
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,160
and nothing has changed.

287
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,480
So, yeah, I'm gonna be
a little bit disruptive,

288
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,000
because, quite frankly, I'm fucked off.

289
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,480
I've got other things
I need to be worried about.

290
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,760
Whether I'm gonna
get a good result on my exam.

291
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,320
What I'm gonna have for dinner tonight.

292
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,120
Normal everyday shit.

293
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,240
But instead, I'm here wasting my time

294
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,720
explaining why accessibility is a big deal
when it should be a given.

295
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,280
I thought you fixed it.

296
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,080
Yeah, it's just fucked.

297
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,680
I'm not blaming
any one person specifically.

298
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,760
It's everyone's fault.

299
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,176
- What's happening?
- It's everyone's responsibility.

300
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,800
The lift isn't working. Again.

301
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,160
If this college can afford sound baths,
communal harmony bees...

302
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,000
- Save the bees!
- Sh!

303
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,160
...they can definitely
afford a working lift.

304
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,480
And I know that that's not glamorous,

305
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
but it's really important

306
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,000
that when people ask for something
that they need, you listen.

307
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,440
Look, I think this is just
one big misunderstanding.

308
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,640
- "Big misunderstanding."
- We can fix this.

309
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,680
- You come to us with your problems...
- It's not a misunderstanding.

310
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,280
It's an afterthought.

311
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,640
None of you realized
you'd left me behind just now

312
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,040
when college could have burned down.

313
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,160
I used to sign BSL as a kid,

314
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,120
but when I went to secondary school,
the access just wasn't there.

315
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,160
And I was so embarrassed to ask for it.

316
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,640
So I pretend I'm coping
as well as everyone else.

317
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,280
It's so much work.

318
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,480
Lip-reading, having people speak for me,

319
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,120
no notetaker in class.

320
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,040
It's so draining.

321
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,200
I wish people understood

322
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,320
that our problems come
from barriers in society,

323
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,360
not from our disabilities.

324
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,000
- Who is that?
- I'm not sure. I've never seen him before.

325
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,680
I don't think he goes here.

326
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,400
I'm just very passionate.

327
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,080
Look, I'm going to call an engineer,
and we're gonna sort all of this out.

328
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,000
But in the meantime,
please just get back to your exams.

329
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,520
No. Not good enough.

330
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,840
If Isaac can't do his exam,
I won't do my exam.

331
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Yeah. You know what?
We're not moving until it gets fixed.

332
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,920
<i>♪ And yeah, the president sucks ♪</i>

333
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240

341
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,040
That's her ashes.

342
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Ah.

343
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,880
Sean and I were supposed to
scatter them together.

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,440
Did he...
Did he say anything before he left?

345
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,160
Just that he wanted to try and get clean.

346
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,200
And, uh, if he was gonna stay here,
he wouldn't be able to do that.

347
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Right, yeah.

348
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,800
What's with the plastic?

349
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,680
- Oh, I've got allergies, you know?
- Oh.

350
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,720
Do you wanna play <i>Temple of Zoltan?</i>

351
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,560
Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,360
So...

353
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,000
You're the pink slug.
I call her Sluggy.

354
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,280
Why am I the slug?

355
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,080
'Cause it's pink.

356
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,320
Hmm.

357
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Wow.

358
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,080
Oh.

359
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,440
Hey, mate. Got your hay delivery,
but your tractor's in the way.

360
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,240
- Can you move it?
- Uh...

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Tell you what.
I'll be out there in a minute.

362
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Tractor.

363
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,160
Okay.

364
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,400
Put that in there.

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,040
Okay.

366
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,920
Whoa!

367
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,080
What are you doing?

368
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,560
- What's going on?
- Are you totally incompetent?

369
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,840
Adam, what the hell?
Get down now! Come on, quickly.

370
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,600
What the fuck?

371
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,880
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,800
I leave you alone for 15 minutes!

373
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,320
"You must keep your promises
and stay true to your core values."

374
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,800
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

375
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,920
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking down the tree house.

376
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,440
Yes, I can see that,
but why are you doing it right now?

377
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,640
Because it's ugly and annoying,
and I don't wanna look at it anymore.

378
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,880
Auntie Jo-Jo will go and help.
Auntie Jo-Jo will go and help. Come on.

379
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,760
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping.

380
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,360
You ever used a hammer before?

381
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,920
I know how to use a hammer.

382
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,320
Just turn it around.

383
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,920
- There's a hook on the other side.
- It's a hammer. I know what I'm doing...

384
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,600
- What have you done?
- You are such a control freak!

385
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,600
No, I'm not! Just get off me!

386
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,280
You have to micromanage everything!

387
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,080
I mean, what kind of person
handwrites a fucking sister contract?

388
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,320
It is anally retentive!

389
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,640
Why can't you just leave me
to use my own judgment?

390
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,200
Because your judgment is famously bad!

391
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,000
And what is that supposed to mean?

392
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,760
Well, okay. How much
was that electric face mask thing?

393
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,600
It was £250, which is actually quite cheap

394
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,840
because it was meant to be £350,
and I got it in a sale.

395
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,080
But you're in debt, Joanna!

396
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,640
I just think that you could... benefit
from some therapy.

397
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,560
Oh my God! Really?

398
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,760
Yes.

399
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,920
I mean, our childhood was not that bad!

400
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,320
Therapy has helped me profoundly,

401
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,920
and I just think that you'd be able
to get some structure in your life.

402
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,040
Yes, yeah, because you have
really got your shit together.

403
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,480
When you're out here
fucking knocking down a tree house

404
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,440
when you should be talking about
the guy who built it,

405
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,120
who thought he was
the father of your child and he wasn't!

406
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,280
How is that person not fucked up?

407
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,280
All I'm saying is that you haven't
dealt with the years of abuse.

408
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,200
And that is why all of this
is just self-sabotage.

409
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,680
Your whole life would be different!

410
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Fuck.

It must be so frustrating.

428
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,040
We're really gonna try a lot harder
to support you.

429
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Thanks.

430
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,920
- Hey.
- Hi.

431
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
Is anyone hungry? I'm gonna go see
if the canteen will give us any food.

432
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm starving. Yeah. I'll come with you.
I'll come with you.

433
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,680
Can you not do that, please?

434
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,560
I really need to get out of here.

435
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,440
Oh, is there somewhere
you're desperate to be?

436
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,360
- Yes, actually.
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,840
My girlfriend's meeting
my mum properly tonight.

438
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,160
Not that it's your business.

439
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,560
It's not poisoned. Don't worry.

440
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Thanks.

441
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,080
We shouldn't have got
something to put on it?

442
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,280
Nah, everyone likes bread.

443
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,320
I've been meaning to ask
if you're doing okay?

444
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,640
Yeah, you know, up and down.
The T's definitely helping.

445
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,040
- And things are better with my mum.
- Good.

446
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,160
Yeah, I get these flashes
of how good things could be,

447
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,040
but then I remember
it's all out of my control.

448
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,040
And then, I don't know.

449
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,800
I remember I can't get the care
that I actually need to live my life.

450
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,240
It's so painful.

451
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,560
So shit.

452
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,600
It is so shit.

453
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,520
I've been thinking
I might just go private.

454
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,480
But I've heard
a lot of different things though.

455
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,120
How much did it cost you?

456
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,120
Uh, mine was about £10,000.
My family paid.

457
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Fuck!

458
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,040
There's no way we can afford that.

459
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,640
- I'm starving. What did you get?
- We have bread.

460
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,920
Is there any filling, or...

461
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
Just bread?

462
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,720
- Ooh.
- Thanks.

463
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,760
- Just bread?
- Just bread.

464
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,840
Mmm. Mmm.

465
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh.

466
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
There you go.

467
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,120
- Yo.
- Hey.

468
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,920
Would you like some bread?

469
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,000
Are you okay?

470
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,920
- Babe.
- I keep seeing things, Abbi.

471
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,240
Like, I am getting signs from God.

472
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,000
God is telling me that
I shouldn't turn my back on my community.

473
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,840
That I should get baptized.

474
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,480
I just... I don't know what to do.

475
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,000
Do you want to get baptized?

476
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes, but I feel guilty for that.

477
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,520
Like, look at everyone out there
literally fighting for who they are.

478
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,920
Why can't I be like that?

479
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,440
Sometimes I would give anything
to go back to my church.

480
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,560
It was my whole world,
and I miss it so much.

481
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,240
Not everyone can fight, Eric,
and that's okay.

482
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
Whatever you decide, I'll support you.

483
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,200
Let's pray on it together.

484
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,040
I just wanted to say

485
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,200
thank you for everything you've taught me

486
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,800
before I go.

487
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
What?

488
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,080
What are you talking about?

489
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,280
Well, you know, I'm gonna be fired now,
and I just wanna say thank you.

490
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,080
Fired? Adam. You're not fired.

491
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,400
Look, I think
you're really good at this job.

492
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,760
And today aside,
I think you show good instincts.

493
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,040
So I'm not fired?

494
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
No.

495
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,080
But you will be if you keep standing there
wasting my time asking if you're fired.

496
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,360
And don't ever get on that tractor again.

497
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,840
Oh yeah, understood.

498
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,960
You are so dramatic!

499
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,720
I don't know why
I thought I could ever live with you.

500
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,040
Well, maybe because the alternative
is being homeless,

501
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,240
and I was kind enough to take you in.

502
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,920
- Take me in?
- Yes.

503
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,640
Do you know that Otis,
he begged me to come here

504
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,520
because you are all over the place?

505
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,520
Ha! You have only ever shown up
when it suited you, Jo,

506
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,880
because you are fundamentally selfish.

507
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,280
- I'm selfish?
- Yes.

508
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,840
Dan might be the one,

509
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,800
and you are forbidding me from seeing him!

510
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,320
Every guy you have ever dated has been
the one, Jo, until you run away.

511
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,560
Oh, piss off!

512
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,760
- You piss off!
- No, you piss off!

513
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,800
Pissy knickers!

514
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Jo!

515
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Oh shit. Let's talk about it!
This is ridiculous!

516
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,120
Jo, why won't you talk about it?

517
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,400
Oh, Jo. If you leave now,
there's no coming back.

518
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,080
Oh, don't worry! I'm not coming back!

519
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,360
So much for helping your sister in need!

520
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,320
Do you know you are pathologically
incapable of accepting help!

521
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
That's so not true.

522
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,760
And your sister contract can kiss my arse!

523
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

524
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Come in.

525
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,960
That's better, mud free.

526
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,480
You caught my sister and I
in an unfortunate moment before.

527
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Siblings can really
push each other's buttons.

528
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,200
Otis told me that you lost your mum.

529
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,960
I'm so sorry.

530
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,520
It's okay. She's not lost. She's dead.

531
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,800
I wish people would stop saying sorry.
It's fucking annoying.

532
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,640
Isn't it?

533
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,880
I should go. This was a mistake, I think.

534
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,600
No, I really want to get to know you,

535
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,360
and... I said the wrong thing.

536
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm just not myself at the moment.

537
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,520
Of course you aren't.

538
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,200
I mean, when I lost my mum,
I felt so disjointed.

539
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,600
It's like my center had completely gone.

540
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,400
We had a very difficult relationship.

541
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,840
I still couldn't make sense of
the world without her.

542
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,720
Did Otis tell you anything else
about my mum?

543
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,640
No.

544
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,480
She was a drug addict.

545
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,520
Oh, that must've been so hard for you.

546
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,160
I feel relieved

547
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,600
that she's gone.

548
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,400
It's not uncommon
for people to feel relief,

549
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,960
particularly when there's
childhood trauma.

550
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,720
- So I'm not a terrible person, then?
- No.

551
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,720
Try not to be hard on yourself.

552
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,520
Can I help with anything?

553
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,160
Yes. How are you at peeling?

554
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,080
Um, yeah. Grade-A peeler.

555
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,360
I thought your girlfriend lived
in America?

556
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,680
Ah, come on. I'm only making conversation.

557
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,640
No, she's moving back to Moordale.
She's gonna start studying at Cavendish.

558
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,160
I thought she was
doing that impressive course thing?

559
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,560
What's your point?

560
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,560
Mm-mm.

561
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,320
Just seems a bit strange.

562
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,240
She must really like spending time
with you to give all that up.

563
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,240
Well, yeah, she does, actually.
We are pretty happy.

564
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,920
Things are going mostly great between us.

565
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
"Mostly"?

566
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,480
Are you still having
that sex phobia stuff?

567
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,400
What?

568
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
I read that thing
your mum wrote about you.

569
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,920
It's really fascinating.

570
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,040
That is so unbelievably inappropriate.

571
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,920
So I'll take that as a yes, then?

572
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,360
Yeah, sure.
We're having some issues.

573
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Sex issues?

574
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,440
Yeah, I...

575
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
Yeah, I have this thing.

576
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,640
I <i>had</i> this thing where
I would just get very anxious around sex,

577
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,960
but I dealt with it.

578
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,120
But now it's back,
and I don't understand why.

579
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,360
Mmm.

580
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,440
No, I'm not... we're not doing this.

581
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,040
I'm not. What am I doing, Otis?
I'm not doing anything.

582
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,040
Why don't we talk about you for a change?

583
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
What about me?

584
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,760
Well, I don't know
literally anything about you.

585
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,320
Well, have you ever asked?

586
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,880
No.

587
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,280
Then, what happened with Ruby?
Why don't we start there?

588
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,240
Do you have any idea how awful she felt?

589
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,080
Oh please, Otis.
Don't pretend like you care about her.

590
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,040
You're literally using her
'cause you want to win the election.

591
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,120
How about everything you've said,

592
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,320
making me out to be some kind of meninist.

593
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,120
You got on my mum's radio show.
You literally don't stop.

594
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Like, are you asexual, or was that just
something else to make me look bad?

595
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,560
That's a really, really fucked up thing
to say, Otis.

596
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,600
Otis told me about
the course that you're on.

597
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,160
Sounds prestigious.

598
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,960
- When do you go back?
- Uh, I'm not going back, actually.

599
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,480
I was gonna register at Cavendish today,

600
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,760
but I don't know
if I'm gonna go back to college either.

601
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
It's a big decision.

602
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,440
Yeah. I actually might just get a job,
you know, something secure.

603
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Sounds sensible.

604
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,680
What do you really want to do?

605
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,320
I wanted to be a writer.

606
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,160
Kind of realized it's just so competitive,

607
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,480
and my tutor told me
I wasn't cut out for it.

608
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
I'm not gonna waste my time on something
if I'm not good enough, you know?

609
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,520
Doesn't make any sense. Fuck!

610
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,120
Oh. Ooh.

611
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
- Hold on. Hold it under there.
- It's fine.

612
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Let's have a look.

613
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,760
Ah.

614
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,080
Sorry.

615
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,720
- I don't think it's deep.
- It's fine.

616
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,480
I don't know why I'm crying.

617
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,080
Such a baby.

618
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,480
It's okay to cry.

619
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,360
It really is.

620
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
All right.

621
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
- Sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

622
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,760
Why don't you sit there? We've got...

623
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
I just feel so stupid.

624
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,200
I kind of convinced myself
that I was special or something,

625
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,360
like I deserved to be there
with those people. I'm just an idiot.

626
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,280
This might hurt a little bit.

627
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Now I don't know you very well, Maeve,

628
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,320
but it seems to me
that you're the kind of person

629
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,920
who has raised herself
from a very young age.

630
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,320
And from what I can tell,

631
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,440
you're doing a very good job.

632
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,360
But sometimes
when we haven't been parented securely,

633
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,080
we can suffer from low self-esteem.

634
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,040
Now, you've taken quite a knock,

635
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,200
and that kind of rejection
can feel very painful.

636
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,560
But I would say that

637
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,960
you were good enough
to get into the course in the first place,

638
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,520
and I reckon that you are just as worthy
of succeeding as anybody else there.

639
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,560
Really?

640
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Thank you.

641
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,000
Why don't you use this?

642
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,560
I think that what you probably need
is someone in your corner,

643
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,440
a parent to tell you
to pick yourself back up,

644
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,840
to stay resilient,

645
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,760
to keep believing in yourself.

646
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,520
And not to let
one teacher dictate your future.

647
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,360
Okay.

648
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,360
You know, I do feel awful
about what I did to Ruby.

649
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,360
Why did you do it?

650
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,120
I'd just moved from Belfast,
and I was the kid with the funny accent.

651
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,040
I was one of
the only kids of color in my year,

652
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,400
and I already started feeling
like something wasn't normal.

653
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,920
The other girls were talking about boys
and kissing and crushes and...

654
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,440
There was... There was so much pressure
to behave a particular way,

655
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,680
and I decided that

656
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,840
I needed to become best friends
with the popular girls

657
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,160
so that people didn't notice
that I didn't fit in.

658
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,440
<i>Then I started learning everything I could
about sex and relationships</i>

659
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,200
<i>so that I could pretend
to be like everyone else.</i>

660
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,880
<i>I was quite surprised
that I found it quite fascinating, but</i>

661
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,400
<i>you know, keeping up that facade
was really hard, and...</i>

662
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,840
<i>it is exhausting...</i>

663
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,200
<i>not being able to be yourself.</i>

664
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,600
What are you looking at, bed-wetter?

665
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,720
And when I got into college,
I set up my clinic, and

666
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,000
I still didn't feel like
I could tell people that I was ace.

667
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,560
I mean, who wants to have sex advice
from someone who doesn't have sex?

668
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,440
Sounds like it'd be quite lonely.

669
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Yeah.

670
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
I did try to make friends.

671
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,080
But I couldn't let people in
without giving myself away.

672
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,840
So I decided
that I was just better off alone.

673
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,640
I mean, I didn't need anything
except my clinic.

674
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,080
That was my passion. It was my safe place.

675
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,600
Then you just came in
and took everything away from me.

676
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,920
<i>Doors opening.</i>

677
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,840
Fucking Nora. We didn't know
there was anybody in here.

678
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,720
Thank you.

679
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,360
The lift is fixed.

680
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,320
Does that mean
we don't have to do our exam anymore?

681
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,320
Well, the exam,
that's been rescheduled to tomorrow.

682
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,680
Aw, what?

683
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,040
We're putting some funding
into replacing the lift.

684
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
About time.

685
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
- We did it.
- Yeah.

686
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,200
That was thrilling.

687
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Um,

688
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,800
do you wanna hang out?

689
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,320
Sorry, uh, I thought I was feeling better,
but I'm a bit all over the place,

690
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,400
so maybe I just need
to sleep it off or something.

691
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,000
Okay, um, I'm here if you need me.

692
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,360
Yeah.

693
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
Thanks.

694
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,040
Hey, um, I've been thinking
about your penis problem.

695
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,040
Okay. I don't really need
your input for that.

696
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Right, but your mum said
that your dad left when you were younger.

697
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,520
- And that she really struggled.
- Yeah, she did.

698
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,440
She had a breakdown, basically.
It was terrible. What's your point?

699
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,800
Well, I don't think
that you're afraid of having sex, Otis.

700
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,680
I think you're afraid you're gonna
get your heart broken like your mum did.

701
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,760
And I know that you don't really
want advice from me,

702
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,200
but I think you should just
let that fear go,

703
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,480
'cause you can't love anyone without risk.

704
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,840
Stop getting in the way of yourself.

705
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,880
Ruby, help! Make them stop.

706
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,400
It's okay. One at a time.
Okay, right. We will get to all of you.

707
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,520
I can't believe
he's actually gonna win this thing.

708
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
Yep. Guess that's my karma.

709
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,360
I know you made a mistake.

710
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,320
But no one's better off alone.
You should just apologize.

711
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,120
Yeah, well, see you around, Otis.

712
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,840
Adam.

713
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,240
I've been trying to call you.

714
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,120
- Are you all right?
- No!

715
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,200
No, I'm not.

716
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,880
I messed up at work today,
and the first thing that I thought

717
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,560
is I'm going to disappoint my dad.

718
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,320
You have made me feel like
I'm shit at everything since I was born.

719
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,520
I don't wanna feel like a failure anymore
because I'm not a failure.

720
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,800
You're a failure.

721
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
You are just a sad man
who does a job that he hates

722
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,960
because he's too afraid
to do anything else.

723
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,840
I thought you were interested in me,
but you weren't.

724
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,040
It was all just about
getting back together with Mum.

725
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,360
- Adam, that's not true.
- It is true.

726
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,160
You don't like me,
so just stop pretending.

727
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Anyone home?

728
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,720
Mum?

729
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,080
Whoa.

730
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
Jerome?

731
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,560
I'm home!

732
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,616
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

733
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,080
Hi. Sorry. I'm so late.

734
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,760
It's all right.

735
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,360
Hi. Uh, I got stuck in a lift.

736
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh. Maeve and I
have been having a nice time.

737
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,320
Mm-hmm.

738
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

739
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,760
- Shall we eat?
- Please. I'm starving.

I don't wanna lose you, Otis.

You won't lose me.

We'll figure it out. We did it before.

00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,840
It was always my dream
to get out of Moordale.

763
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,880
I love it so much out there.

764
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160
I feel so different. I feel like

765
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,120
the best version of me.

766
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,160
Are you saying you don't know
if you would come back?

767
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,120
We can still make it work though.

768
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,200
I don't know that we could.

769
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,600
I would feel like I'm holding you back.

00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,800
I think we both know that

771
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,960
it would be too hard.

I have to go.

792
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,160
Okay.

793
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,880
I'm gonna close my eyes.

794
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,440
I don't think I can watch you go.

795
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,280
Bye.

797
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
Morning.

798
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,680
Hi, love. What are we doing here, then?

799
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,240
I'm going back to America.

800
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,840
I have to put something right
before I leave.

801
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,160
I owe you both an apology.

802
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,976
I've been acting like a tiny baby child
for the past couple of weeks,

803
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,720
and I realize I wasn't upset

804
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,880
at the thought
of you two being together at all.

805
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,200
I was more upset
at the idea of losing you both.

806
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,200
I kind of realized
that you're the only family I have left.

807
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,760
Maeve, you could never lose us. Ever.

808
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,840
No.

809
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,960
Okay, good.

810
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,920
I think you two
should definitely explore this.

811
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,280
You don't need my permission,
but it makes a lot of sense.

812
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,960
And also, um, would you mind helping me
scatter my mum's ashes today?

813
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,680
- Right. Yeah.
- Of course.

814
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,240
Thanks. Okay. We can stop being weird now.

815
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,960
