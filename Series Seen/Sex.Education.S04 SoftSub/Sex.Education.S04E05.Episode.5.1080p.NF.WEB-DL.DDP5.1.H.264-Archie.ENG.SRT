Morning. I'm taking Elsie to school.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,280
Are you guys going to college? It's been three days.

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,560
So unless your parents tell me it's okay, I think you need to go.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,920
Yeah, my mum's been asking, but rock 'n' roll.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,160
-I don't care. I'm not scared. -I can take another day. It'll be fine.

39
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,200
-Yeah. -No, no, no.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm gonna go to the funeral home with Sean today,

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,680
so you two should go back to college.

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,440
Okay, I am actually really scared.

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
-I'll go get ready. -Okay.

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,360
Thanks for brekkie.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,560
Do you wanna do something later?

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,560
Like, go out. You and me.

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,720
Okay, just to clarify,

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,520
because I've got this wrong in the past… do you mean a date?

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,160
Yeah, I mean a date.

50
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,560
Are you sure?

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,240
Just with what's goin' on at the moment?

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Yeah, I'm sure.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,360
I think it would really help to take my mind off things.

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,400
-You know? -Yeah. No. Let's… let's go on a date.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
It'll be fun.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
Okay, great. Yes. Yeah.

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,160
Thanks for letting me walk you to college. Oh, and, um… good luck with the test.

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,520
Walkin' to college together already?

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,520
-It's gettin' serious! -Shut up.

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,680
-But I know, right? -Mmm!

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,880
-He's taking me to Martha Street Cinema. -Oh!

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,200
They're playing all the old movies this week.

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,320
How are you feeling? I was worried about you.

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
Oh, I'm okay. Been trying not to think about it too much, to be honest.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,080
And I've decided, yeah? I wanna find my sperm donor.

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,040
-So grim. I heard that about him. -I know. Everyone…

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,760
Um…wow! That's kind of a big deal.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, yeah.

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,960
My parents don't talk about donor stuff, you know, like, ever.

70
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,280
They made me this book when I was a kid. That was the end of the conversation.

71
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,120
But I wanna know, you know, like… where I come from.

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,880
Are you gonna try and tell your parents that you're doing this?

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,480
Yeah, I will at some point.

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,520
Jackson, you have to tell them.

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,120
Yeah, I will.

76
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,720
So, I have had an idea,

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,360
and you can totally say no.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,320
Try me.

79
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,880
Okay, well, you know the other day at the soup kitchen?

80
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,080
-Yeah. -I wasn't supposed to go, obviously.

81
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,880
But I feel like I was led there.

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,360
-And this is silly. This is silly. This… -No, don't worry. I do get it. Go on.

83
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,600
Okay, well, I then found out that its funding has been cut,

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,200
and it just all felt like it was supposed to be or something.

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,320
And I was wondering whether we could use the fundraiser for that.

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,200
-Roman might take a bit of persuading. -Yeah.

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
But queer people holding out an olive branch to the church?

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,640
I feel it's givin' "We are gay Jesus."

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,200
-We are… We totally are gay Jesus. -We're gay Jesus.

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,720
-In the name of the Father, the Son… -Girl!

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,120
-Ah! -No, I love it. Let's do it.

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,720
-Yeah? Oh my God. Oh! -Yeah. 100%. That'll be so good for us.

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
Thank you, Abbi. Thank you. I feel like it'll mean so much to my mum…

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,320
I'll leave you guys to catch up. I'll see you in a bit.

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,280
Okay.

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,400
Yeah, it was so funny…

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Hey, Otis.

98
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,800
Um, hey.

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,600
I have been wanting to say sorry about the club night

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,720
because it was awkward and not nice, and I feel terrible.

101
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,280
-Yeah… It's fine. -And it was awk--

102
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,080
It's fine. Honestly. Like…

103
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,880
It probably wasn't even my thing. But I need to tell you something.

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,720
It happened that night, and I'm feeling really weird about it. Basically…

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,360
me and Ruby fell asleep together.

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,320
Nothing happened.

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,680
But we were hangin' out all night, and we woke up in the same bed.

108
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,680
Oh… gosh.

109
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,600
Yeah.

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
-Have you told Maeve? -Mm, no.

111
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,480
We weren't really speaking when it happened.

112
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
And… I know it didn't mean anything, but I need to tell her.

113
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,440
But her fuckin' mum's just died. So, I don't know.

114
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,240
-It's, like, the wrong… time. -Mmm… mmm…

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Well, the longer you leave that, the more of a secret it's gonna feel.

116
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,680
-Yep. -Yeah.

117
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,400
How was the club?

118
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,520
Oh-ho!

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,120
It was amazing! I got with the hottest guy ever.

120
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,080
-From my church. -She was on it one time!

121
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
Oh! Otis! You're back!

122
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
I was worried I'd have no one to debate.

123
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,680
I loved chattin' to your mum, by the way. She told me so much about you.

124
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,160
I forgot about the debate.

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,640
Oh shit.

126
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,320
Okay, um… I gotta go.

127
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,320
Nice chattin'.

128
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,440
That was a nice chat about my life.

129
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,640
Ruby, hey.

130
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,240
So, O is calling herself the "Star of Sexology," which is a lie.

131
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,400
-Is that even allowed? -No, it's called "spin," Otis.

132
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,480
So, I haven't… really had any time to prepare anything for the debate.

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,640
You don't have any notes for me, do you?

134
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
No. Why would I have that?

135
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,200
Because you're my campaign manager.

136
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
I was your campaign manager.

137
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,720
Then you stopped responding to my texts and disappeared for three days.

138
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
So you're on your own.

139
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,880
Uh, you're right, and I should've… I'm sorry.

140
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,000
Wait, please. I should have texted you.

141
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,200
It's just Maeve's mum just died, and I've been a bit all over the place.

142
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
And I'm rubbish at this whole election thing without you.

143
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
Please?

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,640
I'm sorry about Maeve's mum.

145
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,680
Thanks.

146
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,680
Okay. You don't have a lot of time to prepare.

147
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,120
You want to deliver your mission statement in a concise way. Don't ramble.

148
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,240
-I don't ramble. -You do. You ramble, Otis.

149
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Sexology!

150
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,480
-Sexology! -Did you get any dirt on her?

151
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,080
No, everyone at this college is so sweet and good-natured. It's disgusting, really.

152
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,880
I'll find you later.

153
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,360
-Vote O! -Ruby.

154
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,200
Oh, that is good.

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
We have some information for you.

156
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
-It's about O. -Oh?

157
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,240
Work, you big metal fuck!

158
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,760
It's broken again, mate. I've called an engineer.

159
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,600
Great. When are they getting here?

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,560
Tomorrow, hopefully, but it took three days last time.

161
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,880
So, how am I supposed to get to my class now, then?

162
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm not sure.

163
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,440
That's a tricky one. Maybe I could carry you.

164
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,400
Could you? Really?

165
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,840
Me, my chair, up two flights of stairs.

166
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,080
I've broken my neck once. I'd rather not do it again, but thank you.

167
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,200
I could set up a classroom down here for you.

168
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,520
Yeah.

169
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,080
Ah-ah-ah.

170
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,880
Can I take Isaac's stuff down to him? He says the lift's broken again.

171
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,840
Yeah, of course.

172
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,640
This fucking college.

173
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,400
-Hey, there. -Hiya.

174
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,120
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

175
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,640
-How's Maeve doing? -Oh my God. I'm so worried about her.

176
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,960
-It's awful. -Yeah.

177
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,680
Her mum was complicated, but…

178
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,800
Yeah, I really liked her.

179
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,520
Hey, how are your photos going?

180
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
-Good, I think. -Yeah?

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,600
-Yeah! -Good.

182
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,440
-How do I get them out of this? -Ah. We need to use a darkroom.

183
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,120
Which, luckily for you, is on the ground floor.

184
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,720
-What do you think? -They're hideous.

185
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,840
Right.

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
Which means Mum would have liked them.

187
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,800
How much do you think they cost?

188
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,160
Sean?

189
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,160
-Boo! -Fuck's sake. That's not funny.

190
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,360
You've gotta try it before you buy it. This one's good. Very comfy.

191
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Grow up.

192
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm very sorry for your loss.

193
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
Thank you. Sean, get out of the box.

194
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,600
-Hi. Nice to meet you, mate. -So, how can I help?

195
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,440
We've never done this before.

196
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,200
Um… ahem. How does it work?

197
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,400
Did your mother leave behind any instructions?

198
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,320
No, she wasn't much of a planner.

199
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,640
Do you know if she wanted a burial or a cremation?

200
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,480
-Burial. -Cremation. Cremation.

201
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,680
She told me she didn't want her exes visiting her grave.

202
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,400
Don't like the idea of her gettin' burned.

203
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,960
I don't like the idea of her being stuck underground. She was claustrophobic.

204
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
-You can think about it. Please. -All right.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,400
So, how many people will you be expecting?

206
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
Absolutely no one. Mum didn't have friends.

207
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,800
-People didn't like her. -That's not really true. She had friends.

208
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,440
-Really? -Mm-hmm.

209
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,040
-Name one friend. -Sh… um…

210
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,240
Uh…

211
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,400
Exactly. Anyway, it's good news for us.

212
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,720
It doesn't matter if it's a shit funeral if no one's there.

213
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,120
Fuck's sake, Sean.

214
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
An intimate funeral, then.

215
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,960
Yeah, an intimate funeral. God, you're a good salesman.

216
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,080
I'll give you a moment alone to discuss, but here are all our packages.

217
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
-Right. -Thank you.

218
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,360
Fuckin' hell.

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,440
Well, I guess it's a cremation, then, isn't it?

220
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
Right.

221
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,680
I have to take this. Sorry.

222
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,720
-Sean. -Two seconds. Two seconds.

223
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, mate.

224
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,040
She cries a lot. I find it hard to settle her.

225
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,160
And… and she makes these grunting sounds after she's feeding.

226
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,200
And she does these unbelievable projectile poos.

227
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,840
I was wondering if it had to do with her being premature.

228
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,360
No, I don't think so.

229
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,320
Joy is a very healthy baby. Yeah.

230
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,120
-Really? -There we are.

231
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
Such a relief.

232
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,040
I didn't realize how anxious I was about today.

233
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,840
And how is Mum's mood?

234
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,160
Oh, I'm fine. Just… I'm a bit tired.

235
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,280
Your mood is not okay. She cries all of the time.

236
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,800
She's stressed and forgetful and touchy as fuck.

237
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,560
You're not right. Sorry.

238
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,920
Can I speak to Jean alone for a moment?

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,520
-Oh, I'm her sister. It's fine. -Jo!

240
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
Fine.

241
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
Okay.

242
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,880
A bit of blueness is normal after a baby.

243
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,480
But feeling constantly anxious and low isn't.

244
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,640
I can see from your notes that you've had a previous period of depression.

245
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,200
Yes. Well, that was ten years ago.

246
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,240
I mention this because birthing parents

247
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,440
who've previously struggled with mental health

248
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,160
are more susceptible to postnatal depression.

249
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,160
Yes.

250
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,840
Would you consider trying some medication?

251
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,640
No. Thank you. But, um…

252
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,840
I know that my hormones are all over the place

253
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
and that it's normal.

254
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,720
And when I was depressed before, I got through it without medication,

255
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,240
and I'd like to try that again.

256
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
Well, we'll keep an eye on things.

257
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,920
Thank you.

258
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,880
Thanks a lot. She tried to prescribe me medication.

259
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,920
Well, that's good. I think you might need some.

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,640
Why are you being so weird about it?

261
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,000
Because you embarrassed me, that's why.

262
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,760
Because I know my own brain.

263
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
I'm fine.

264
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,480
Anyway, I have to go to the studio. Can you take her?

265
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,000
No, I… I can't take her. And you don't get to snap my head off whenever you want.

266
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,760
You said you weren't doing anything.

267
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,520
My plans changed. I've got a second date, and I need to get my hoo-hoo waxed.

268
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
When did you go on a first date?

269
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,200
And it's not a hoo-hoo! It's a vulva!

270
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,320
Absolutely.

271
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,600
Any students wishing to attend the student counselor debate,

272
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
please make your way to the atrium.

273
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,600
Otis! I have got some information that looks very, very bad for O.

274
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,200
I feel like a wizard in this bit.

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Abracadabra!

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,840
-Hey, I think it's quite good. -Yeah, that's great.

277
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
What made you wanna paint your foster homes?

278
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,280
Um…

279
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,920
Hmm.

280
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,920
-So I lived with nine different families. -Wow.

281
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Every time we'd get settled, they'd just move us on to the next one.

282
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,880
There was one family that did actually want to, uh… adopt my brother and me,

283
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,000
but, uh… that fell through.

284
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,480
The whole system is just broken, and it makes me angry.

285
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,480
So I paint about it.

286
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,360
I still don't know what I wanna say with my photos.

287
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,120
-Aimee. -Yeah?

288
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,240
-You literally never stop talking. -What?

289
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,120
So you've definitely got plenty to say.

290
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,120
Stop underestimating yourself. That's all I'd say.

291
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,720
Thank you.

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,840
Aimee, I, um--

293
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,160
Please stop talking, 'cause I think I know what you're gonna say.

294
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
I think I like you.

295
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,840
I think I like you too.

296
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,480
-Shit. This is really terrible. -What do we do?

297
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,120
I need to talk to Maeve.

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Right. Is that me?

299
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,120
See you there.

300
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,960
Uh…

301
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,920
Hey, Frog. You ready?

302
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,680
Yeah, who was that?

303
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,280
-Wanted a lighter. I said no. -Did he?

304
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,760
Yeah. What the fuck are you doing?

305
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,320
-Get off that fucking bag! -No. Let go. I'm not doing anything--

306
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,160
-Have you started dealing again? -No. No, I haven't.

307
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,760
-Are you using? -No, of course I'm not using.

308
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,120
-Fucking lying to me! -Fuck off. I said I'm not.

309
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
-Show me your arm. -Fuck, Maeve!

310
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,520
All right! Calm down.

311
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,320
Maybe I have started using a little bit. It's not a big deal. I'm gonna stop soon.

312
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,120
You're a fucking idiot, Sean. Fucking idiot!

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,480
-Oh, get off your high horse, Maeve! -Fuck you, Sean!

314
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,800
You might be smarter than me,

315
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,280
but we came from exactly the same shithole!

316
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,920
All right, Cavendish.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What's up?

318
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,400

I've got gardening book club to get to, so, uh, opening statements?

329
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,600
-Thanks, Principal Lak-- -Hi, everyone. I am O.

330
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,720
Vote for me,

331
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,160
and I promise that I will continue doin' what I have already been doin',

332
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,920
serving you all with openness and integrity.

333
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,680
-Thank you. -Thank you. Um… Ahem.

334
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,600
Well, I am Otis Milburn, and you should vote for me

335
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,080
because I came up with this original idea to set up a therapy clinic on campus.

336
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,520
It's because I believe all students

337
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,160
should have access to unbiased information and counseling on sex and their bodies.

338
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,440
Oh, I suppose I'd better ask a question.

339
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,640
I've got a question for Otis.

340
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,440
Who is this man?

341
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
-That's my dad. And-- -Correct.

342
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,000
-This is Otis's father, Remi Milburn. -Oh my God.

343
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,360
Now, his writing is quite popular amongst certain men's rights groups.

344
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,560
And, if you don't mind, I'd like to read you

345
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,120
an extract from his latest book.

346
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,440
-Is this allowed? -It is.

347
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,880
-Here we are. -Yeah, it's fine.

348
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,240
"In order to attract a woman,

349
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
-the modern man finds himself…" -It's fine.

350
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,320
"…unable to assert his natural authority."

351
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,760
-I don't see how this is relevant-- -Thank you, Otis.

352
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
If you don't mind, I'd like to finish. Thank you.

353
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,440
"Forced into a submissive role,

354
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,400
which not only emasculates him,

355
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,560
but creates a society disinterested in harmony."

356
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,040
Wow. Thank you, Remi Milburn.

357
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,760
Otis Milburn,

358
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,680
would you agree that men have a natural authority over women?

359
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
No. Of course I don't.

360
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,440
Look, my dad just writes that stuff to sell books.

361
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,040
I'm not him, and I don't agree with anything he says.

362
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
-That's interesting. -Is it?

363
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,360
It is. Because I would argue that the way you have behaved,

364
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
particularly towards me, has been pretty sexist.

365
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
That is ridiculous.

366
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,920
And I think it's inappropriate that you're even bringing my family into this.

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,680
I disagree. People need to know

368
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,720
what kind of person they're getting advice from.

369
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
I agree with that.

370
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,440
-So, O, I have a question for you. -No, I'm not ready to move on.

371
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,960
-I have a few more points to make. -I thought this was a debate.

372
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,360
Please continue, Otis.

373
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
Thank you, sir.

374
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,200
O, what advice would you give to someone who's recently been ghosted?

375
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Well, I would need a little bit more information than that, Otis.

376
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
Sure.

377
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,880
PK, it's true, isn't it, that O ghosted you last term?

378
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,920
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,560
And you're not the only one who's been strung along and tossed aside.

380
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,520
-There are others. -You did it to me too.

381
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,920
I tried to talk to you about it, but you ignored me.

382
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,360
-Well, I-- -I felt like shit.

383
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
You stamped on my heart.

384
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
I--

385
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,320
Can someone go and check on her?

386
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
He's so right!

387
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,320
I'm not sure I would want to be counseled

388
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
by someone who clearly cares so little about people's feelings.

389
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,120
Hmm.

390
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,240
Uh, we… Um…

391
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay… um…

392
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,920
Um…

393
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,400
I deserve to be called out on my past behavior.

394
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
I have withdrawn from several relationships

395
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,840
without proper communication, and that is not something that I condone.

396
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,720
I think that leaving people without closure just isn't right.

397
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,040
And I am an absolute arsehole for doin' that, and I am owning that.

398
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,680
However, this hasn't just happened in a vacuum.

399
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,920
I have actually been on my own personal journey recently.

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,960
And… well, it's not something that I was going to talk about

401
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,360
until I felt ready to,

402
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,080
but I guess you have kind of forced my hand there, Otis.

403
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,320
Um…

404
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,040
So… uh…

405
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,120
Um…

406
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,640
Oh God! Um…

407
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,880
I am asexual.

408
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,520
And I really enjoyed the friendships of the people that I ghosted. I really did.

409
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,360
But when it started to move into somethin' more intimate,

410
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
I… I felt really overwhelmed and uncomfortable.

411
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
I didn't know how to deal with the feelings.

412
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,520
I didn't have the words to articulate that.

413
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
So I did the cowardly thing, and I just ran away,

414
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,720
and that is something that I really regret.

415
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,240
But unlike some people, I can accept criticism when it is valid.

416
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,960
And I really hope you all believe me

417
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,040
when I say that I am working hard on doing better.

418
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,400
I am working on accepting myself and… and feeling proud of my identity.

419
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,040
Thank you.

420
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,560
That was bad, man.

421
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,680
What just happened?

422
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
Well, I think she's won, and you've been canceled.

423
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,280
Yeah.

424
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,480
-Come in. -Sorry. I had to bring Joy again.

425
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,640
No worries. Would you like a cuppa?

426
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,440
Oh no. I did not wet myself. Ice pack.

427
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,360
I rubbed some of my son's home-brewed chili oil on my vulva.

428
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,320
-Oh. -I might have burned my clitoris.

429
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,360
-Oh boy. -I figured you're a therapist.

430
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,960
-Don't mind me sharing personal stuff? -No problem.

431
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
-Tea. -Yes.

432
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,760
-Thanks. -Great.

433
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,440
-I'll wash my hands. -Good.

434
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
There you go.

435
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,040
Is that the, uh… chili sauce?

436
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Ha ha! You're funny.

437
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,320
Yeah, peri-peri for the peri-perimenopause.

438
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,440
Oh.

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,320
How long have you been perimenopausal?

440
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh, couple of years, I guess. I haven't had an official diagnosis.

441
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,760
It's just the hot flashes

442
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,440
and desert-like vagina are a bit of a giveaway.

443
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,920
Well, you know, you don't have to suffer.

444
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,000
There are plenty of treatments on offer if you call your GP.

445
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm very busy. I work a lot. I'm a workaholic.

446
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,880
That's what my ex-wife reckons, but mostly I'm in here just playing with dinosaurs.

447
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,680
But I think I'm fine.

448
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,160
Yeah, it's not like I'm sick, you know.

449
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,640
Just uncomfortable.

450
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,280
Especially today.

451
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,960
So, you otherwise feel good in yourself? No mood changes?

452
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
What the fuck do you mean by that?

453
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,800
-Oh. Well, some-- -Oh. That is a joke. I'm sorry.

454
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
-Too soon. -Fine.

455
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,520
I mean, my sons keep telling me I'm a bit more emotional than normal, but…

456
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,040
Sometimes our loved ones can see us much more clearly than we see ourselves.

457
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,680
Honestly…

458
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,440
I think I'm embarrassed.

459
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,200
You know, so many women don't seek help,

460
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,440
but it's because the subject of…

461
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,440
yeah, menopause is still so… stigmatized in society.

462
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,200
It's fucking ridiculous.

463
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,640
But even if you don't go for any of the treatments,

464
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,720
I think even just calling might help you feel more empowered,

465
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,560
and there is no reason to feel shame.

466
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,880
-Yeah? -Yeah.

467
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
There's the Jean I hired.

468
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,160
Hello again! Like, more of that on air.

469
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,400
Yes, well, I… I did feel better after the last show, I have to say.

470
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,120
-Yeah, about that. -Mmm.

471
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,720
Listen, Terry wants me to hire O on as your permanent cohost.

472
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,320
He thinks the idea of having two sex therapists,

473
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,880
you know, one young and one old-er,

474
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,080
is the hook that we've been looking for.

475
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,760
How do you feel about that?

476
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,320
Do I have a choice?

477
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah.

478
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,320
Nah. No.

479
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,760
Right.

480
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,480
I love my sister, I really do, but she is so tightly wound.

481
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,280
She's been like that since she was a kid.

482
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,800
She has to control everything in her life, and she doesn't know how to have any fun.

483
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,800
My husband Greg's exactly the same.

484
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,600
He's such a downer. I'll be eating dinner with him and thinking,

485
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,320
"Christ, Greg, you're depressing."

486
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,320
"Everything you do makes me sad, even the way you eat chicken."

487
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
Ow! Fuck! Shit!

488
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Remember that I'm not Greg!

489
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,560
Sorry, love, but brace yourself. There's more where that came from.

490
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,000
-Ah! -Oh! What the fuck?

491
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,560
Don't itch it.

492
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,200
Um… Oh, sorry, it's been declined. Have you got another card?

493
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,640
No.

494
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,240
Um…

495
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,520
Just give me a second.

496
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
Oh…

497
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,720
Hi.

498
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,680
Turtle, hi.

499
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,920
My, um… my card has been declined.

500
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,440
I think they put a block on it. Could you pay for a wax over the phone?

501
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,320
-Didn't they block it the other day? -Yeah, I'll pay you back.

502
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,640
Okay. Can you just speak to the lady? Thank you. She's gonna…

503
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,440
Hello. Yeah, well, full bush, front and back.

504
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
You all right, mate?

505
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,960
Just gettin' to know each other a bit, aren't we? Yeah?

506
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,320
Sorry. I, uh… I was cleaning, and…

507
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,120
I wasn't… Yeah.

508
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,000
So, how come you left school?

509
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,320
Uh… just… I wasn't very good at it.

510
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,760
Yeah, me either. I'm dyslexic, so that didn't help.

511
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,760
I was lucky, my… my dad let me come and work here.

512
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,120
I think he realized there was no point pushing me.

513
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,160
I've seen your dad picking you up for driving lessons.

514
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
He must be supportive too?

515
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,760
Uh…

516
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,280
Not really. I've always been a bit of an embarrassment to him.

517
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,760
What do you mean?

518
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,080
Well, he was the headmaster at my school.

519
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,800
And I just couldn't get it. More I tried, the worse I got.

520
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,840
He used to yell at me a lot.

521
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,720
Sounds like a bully.

522
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,960
Yeah, it's… a little bit scary.

523
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,640
But now he seems to be trying to, I dunno…

524
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,560
trying to be a normal dad, I suppose, or something.

525
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,320
Can I show you something?

526
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,160
Okay, don't think it's weird, but, um… Yeah, put that down.

527
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,480
I think that horses can help heal anything.

528
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,920
-So, if you just trust me… -Yep.

529
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,160
Just relax. Put your hand on his belly.

530
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,960
-Then put a hand here. -Uh-huh.

531
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,440
Yeah, and, yep.

532
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,840
-Do the thing. -Okay.

533
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,640
Feel his heartbeat.

534
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Feeling it?

535
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,800
Okay, tell me that… that doesn't make everything else feel… calm.

536
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,640
Feels a bit weird to be huggin' a horse, but…

537
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,800
yeah, it does.

538
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,720
Yeah, great…

539
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,520
Oh shit. I've got a class to teach.

540
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,280
Okay, I'll see ya.

541
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,480
You should come and shadow me.

542
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,640
-Hi, guys. -Hi, Jem.

543
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
-You ready to go? -Yes.

544
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,840
Oh, Michael, I feel awful. I feel like we're doing this behind Adam's back.

545
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,640
I think we should get back together.

546
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,200
We can't.

547
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,440
Adam would be devastated.

548
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,200
But… I've… changed.

549
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,920
Michael!

550
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,320
You've taken him on a few driving lessons.

551
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,560
It's gonna take time to earn his trust.

552
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

553
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,720
No.

554
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,200
Okay. Here we go.

555
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,720
Oh. Hello, darling. You're back.

556
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,280
Yep. I'm goin' out.

557
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,720
Wh… where are you going? I… I haven't seen you in three days.

558
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,120
I'm going to see Maeve.

559
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,040
Why are you being cold?

560
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,960
Because, Mum, you decided to bring my main competition onto your radio show.

561
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,160
What? Who?

562
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,760
O? What? I didn't even know that you knew her.

563
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,640
I told you about the other therapist on campus. That's her.

564
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,560
Oh, wh--

565
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,120
And now she's walkin' around saying she's the star of Sexology.

566
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,400
Well, she sort of is the star of Sexology. They…

567
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,920
they've hired her as my cohost.

568
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,960
Wh… Otis, you can't just come and go as you please.

569
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,680
You're still living under my roof,

570
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,600
and I would like to continue this conversation, please.

571
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,720
-Why're you suddenly acting like a parent? -What?

572
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,200
You've paid zero notice of me since Joy arrived. Like, at all.

573
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,800
And I know it's been hard, and I know having a baby is a huge deal,

574
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,080
but you… you're treatin' me like an adult, and I still need a mum.

575
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,840
I'm gonna be late.

576
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,720
-Hello, surgery. -Yes, um…

577
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,320
I'd like to book back in to see Dr. Miller, please.

578
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,960
Come in.

579
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,520
-Hello. -Hi.

580
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,240
Ooh! Where are you going?

581
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,080
I'm going on a date with Otis. It's our first one.

582
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Oh, you look amazing.

583
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,400
-How was today? -Um…

584
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,520
Not great.

585
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,080
Yeah.

586
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,720
Kind of realized we don't have anyone to invite to the funeral.

587
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,240
I still want Mum to have a proper goodbye, so I need to figure it out.

588
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,360
Definitely.

589
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Anyway, it's fine. How was your day?

590
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,880
Yeah, it was fine.

591
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,160
-Could you sit for two seconds? Sorry. -Yeah.

592
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,880
Um…

593
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,200
So, you know how you thought me and Isaac would get along?

594
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,120
Yeah.

595
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,800
Well, we've been doing art class together, and we've kind of become friends.

596
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
-I knew it. -Yeah.

597
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,680
Um…

598
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,600
-This is really hard to say. -What? Aimes?

599
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,960
I think we might like each other more than that.

600
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,920
Sorry.

601
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,680
What?

602
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,240
-So-- -Wait. Why are you laughing?

603
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,480
Oh… I'm not. I was--

604
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,160
-It's been a weird day. -I'm so sorry.

605
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,120
I wasn't expecting you to say that.

606
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,000
Sorry, do you actually like Isaac now?

607
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,320
Yeah. I mean, he's grumpy.

608
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,240
-He's a bit rude. But he gets me. -Yeah.

609
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,560
Hanging out with him has made me realize that I'm actually quite smart.

610
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,040
Aimes, you are smart.

611
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,640
-I thought you wanted to be single. -I know.

612
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,880
It's shit. I'm a shit person, and I'm a shit friend.

613
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,160
-You're not shit. Aimee, you're not shit. -No, I am.

614
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,160
How do you feel about it?

615
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,880
Um… I can't really deal with this now. I'm sorry.

616
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
-Absolutely. I'm gonna go. -We can talk another time.

617
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,120
Of course. Complete wrong moment.

618
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,960
-Um… -I'm really sorry.

619
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,840
It's okay. I… I'll see you.

620
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,120
-Enjoy your date. -Thanks.

621
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
-I love you. -Love you.

622
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,920
-Don't tell me. -I'm far too busy for that.

623
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,560
-More than you though. -Yes. Busted.

624
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,440
How was school?

625
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,480
-Yeah, fine. -Hmm.

626
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,840
I'm gonna say something, and I need you both to not get defensive.

627
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,240
-Okay? -Hmm.

628
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,320
I wanna find out who my sperm donor is.

629
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
Wh… why now?

630
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,720
-Ahem. -Well, I've always had questions.

631
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,680
Right, well, um… What kind of questions?

632
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,440
Lots of things. Like, who am I?

633
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,080
Well, you know who you are, Jackson.

634
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,280
-I said don't get defensive. -Right.

635
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,000
-What else? -Like, does cancer run in their family?

636
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,600
And their heritage.

637
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm so anxious, yeah? And I feel like I was born with it.

638
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,480
-And it didn't come from either of you. -Well, your mum and I will think about it.

639
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,760
-Uh… -What?

640
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,480
I don't think it's your decision, Mum.

641
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,240
You have a lot going on,

642
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,360
and you've got to get your test results back from the doctor.

643
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,960
-Exactly. -And your A-levels are coming up, so…

644
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,880
This is not the time.

645
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,360
I knew there was no point talking to you about this.

646
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
Hey!

647
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
I said this would eventually happen.

648
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,680
I am not…

649
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
ready.

650
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,560
Um…

651
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,960
-Yeah. -Uh…

652
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,760
What can I get you?

653
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Can I get that bag of sweets there? Top left, the white one.

654
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,960
Sure.

655
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,840
-The white one. -Here you go.

656
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,640
Thank you. Can I just tap that?

657
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,240
Eric, it's good to see you again.

658
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,000
Uh…

659
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,920
My college is doing their annual fundraiser,

660
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,320
and I was wondering whether I could donate the money to the soup kitchen.

661
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,360
I enjoyed workin' there the other night and bein' a part of the community.

662
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,000
And I just think it would be sad if it didn't continue.

663
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,840
That is… very kind.

664
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,400
Thank you.

665
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,880
Uh… Great!

666
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Great.

667
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,080
I will tell my friends. Thank you, Pastor Samuel.

668
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,440
You haven't been coming to baptism classes.

669
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,960
Yeah…

670
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,560
Um…

671
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,320
I'm not sure

672
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,080
I want to be baptized anymore.

673
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,520
Oh.

674
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,080
I understand. But you are welcome to come back at any time.

675
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,000
I'll think about it.

676
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,040
Hello.

677
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,520
-Hi. -Hi. Uh…

678
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,360
I didn't know you were part of church choir.

679
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,320
Yeah. Um, you should stay and listen. We've been workin' on a new song, so…

680
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,080
-I'm gonna get warmed up. -Okay.

681
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,720
See you in a bit. Stay.

682
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,360

-Hi. -Are you seeing something tonight?

724
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,880
Yeah, um… I was supposed to be, but I was stood up. Yeah.

725
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,400
Apparently, he has had a motorbike accident.

726
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,320
Oh.

727
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,240
-Bet he says that to everyone. -This is Maeve.

728
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,520
-Uh… This is my Auntie Jo. -Hi.

729
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,520
-Hello. -Hi, Jo.

730
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,240
Oh my God, she is a goddess.

731
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,960
Look at her. You two are adorable.

732
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,480
Okay, stop.

733
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,280
-Okay, um… we should get the tickets. -Yeah.

734
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,320
-Yeah. -It's gonna start.

735
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,000
-But I'll see you. -Nice to meet you.

736
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,320
Could you, um… shout me a ticket?

737
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,880
Yeah. Yeah. That's fine.

738
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,400
-You don't mind, do you? -No.

739
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,520
Hey.

740
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,320
Hey.

741
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,920
I know you don't wanna be friends anymore, but you don't need to be a dick about it.

742
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,520
-What? -It's okay. I won't bother you anymore.

743
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,440
-Wait, Cal. -No.

744
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,400
Sorry, I'm late. Shall we go get popcorn?

745
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,600
-Um, yeah. Yeah. -Okay.

746
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,040
Hey!

747
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,240
-Viv. -Hey.

748
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,200
Hey, sorry.

749
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,160
Had a big fight with my parents. I didn't know where else to go.

750
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,200
Come watch the film with us.

751
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,080
That's fine, right, Beau?

752
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,960
-Yeah. I'll get another ticket. -Cool. Thanks, man.

753
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,560
I can't believe that that twat stood me up.

754
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,360
I mean, he told me he wanted to get married and have kids.

755
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,280
Talk about red fucking flag.

756
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,600
-Where are we? -Hi. Um…

757
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,320
-These ones. -Mmm.

758
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,920
But if… Uh, we were…

759
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,080
It's humiliating.

760
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,760
Do you want a drink?

761
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,640
Yes, I want a drink.

762
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,000
-Tequila? Yes, my friend. -Mmm.

763
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,480
I really like her.

764
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,400
Mmm.

765
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,360
Ah! Oh, that's strong.

766
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,160
-Here we are. -What a fucking pig.

767
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,760
So, what happened, then?

768
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,480
So I told them, and they freaked out.

769
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,600
All right, lads?

770
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,920
They said, yeah, I'm not allowed to look for him.

771
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,680
But I'm 18 now, so they can't stop me.

772
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,640
Do you think it's a good idea to go behind your parents' backs?

773
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,000
-What's behind their back? -Oh, nothing.

774
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,840
Thanks.

775
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,880
Film's starting.

776
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,680
Is this a fucking black-and-white film?

777
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,120
"You pay the balance at once," he says, "or I'll hand you over to the police."

778
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,320
-You ought to have seen the chap's face. -So sad. Oh my God.

779
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,480
Changed his tune…

780
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,400
Oh shit. They haven't turned the subtitles on.

781
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,040
-I can go ask. -Oh, no, no, no.

782
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,720
-You don't have to do that. Let's watch. -You can't expect much spirit from a man

783
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,000
-with only one lung… -Cheers, everyone!

784
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,200
I thought something must be wrong when you didn't come.

785
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,320
I'd have popped in to explain, but I had a date.

786
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,120
-Oh, good morning. -How's the eye?

787
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,040
-"How's the eye"? -"Very fine, actually. Thanks for asking."

788
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,880
-"Feels like it's clearing up." -"Yes, looks very good."

789
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
-And I to the grocer's. -What exciting lives…

790
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,200
-"An exciting life we lead." -I'm gonna go.

791
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,040
I'd been to the Palladium, as usual, but it was a terribly long film.

792
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,800
-I was afraid I'd be late. -Okay, I'm gonna see if he's okay.

793
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,680
-As I came up onto the platform… -All men are arseholes.

794
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
I mean, not you, Otis.

795
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,200
You're actually quite sweet,

796
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,000
but most men are big, fucking, gaping, prolapsed arseholes.

797
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Sh!

798
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,720
You, sh!

799
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,040
-Look… -Sh…

800
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,720
Relax, Otis. Have some tequila.

801
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Beau. Beau! Wait. What's wrong?

802
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,920
Why is he talking to you about this private stuff?

803
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,080
And… and crashing our date. He's obviously into you, Viv.

804
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,560
I've told you it's not like that. We're just mates.

805
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,760
Okay. If you say so.

806
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,560
But I don't think you know how great you are.

807
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,560
And we've got mock exams comin' up, so don't let him distract you, all right?

808
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
Yeah.

809
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,560
I'm sorry I got upset. I just…

810
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,960
I… I think I'm falling for you.

811
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,800
-You don't have to say anything. -I think I'm falling for you too.

812
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,720
Bitch!

813
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,880
Sh.

814
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,200
Hey, Maeve, give me another sip.

815
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,480
Give me another sip.

816
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,360
Just one more.

817
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Sorry. I'm sorry.

818
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,160
Please stop throwing popcorn.

819
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,080
-They'll kick us out. -Sorry. Okay, I won't.

820
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,840
-I'm going to get the usher. -Okay.

821
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,160
Good. Can you tell him to change the film as well?

822
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,920
'Cause this one is slow.

823
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,840
-Tell you what a good film is. -Jo, please…

824
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,360
-What's that one with Lady Gaga? -Just be quiet.

825
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,640
-They're gonna kick us out. -And that guy, and he pisses himself.

826
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,880
And he's really sad.

827
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,720
Now that's a good… That is a good film.

828
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,800
Excuse me, madam.

829
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,080
-Oh! -You need to leave.

830
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,360
-I'm… -We're going. Stand up. Stand up!

831
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
-I am standing up! -Just take this.

832
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,000
Ooh!

833
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,320
-I'm sorry. -I am so sorry.

834
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,320
-I might be a bit sick. -Maeve, please help.

835
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,440
-I'll be sick if I don't eat… -Just wait till you're…

836
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,840
-You're so lovely. -…home. Oh, Jo…

837
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,520
-Oh, thank you. -I like you so much.

838
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,560
-In the car. Hey, mate. You okay? -Don't be sick on the seat.

839
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,120
Belt on. There's your bag.

840
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,200
Hey, mate. You know where you're going? Just up the hill. Here's 20.

841
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,840
-All right, mate. -Okay. Cheers.

842
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,400
-Maeve! -Bye.

843
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,640
Where you going? We've got a table booked for dinner.

844
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,720
-We can do it another day. Come on. -But…

845
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,000
Oh, yeah…

846
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,760
-Aww! -There she is.

847
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,200
You're not gonna get in.

848
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,800
Ahem.

849
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,240
Uh…

850
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,600
Uh, really?

851
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,760
Yeah, why?

852
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,640
You scared?

853
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,760
Follow me.

854
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,080
Okay. Oop!

855
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,680
Ooh!

856
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,800
So many fucking steps. Oh God!

857
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,840
Fucking bush.

858
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,440
I'll fucking take you up.

859
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,760
Sh… Okay.

860
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,840
Okay… We're down now.

861
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,080
Oh fuck. Oh my God. Jesus.

862
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,000
Fucking gibberish.

863
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,400
Jean.

864
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,440
Jean, I…

865
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,000
Are you drunk?

866
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,240
I know that you're upset about the doctor's,

867
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,160
but you're the best sister I've ever had.

868
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,600
I'm your only sister.

869
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,200
You're so kind to me.

870
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,520
You're such a… a kind, kind woman, and I'm a mess.

871
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,440
-Mm-hmm. -No wonder no one loves me.

872
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,400
-Well, I love you, Jo. -I know you do.

873
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,000
And that's why you're gonna be so angry when I tell you about the debt.

874
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,720
What debt?

875
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,960
I owe a lot of money.

876
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,560
How much is a lot?

877
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,520
A lot. A lot.

878
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,480
-Can I ask you a silly question? -Yes.

879
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,040
Why did you stop me when I was gonna ask them about the captions?

880
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,320
Oh, I don't like making a fuss.

881
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,200
Why not?

882
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,960
What do you mean?

883
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,280
I mean, if it would have made your experience better,

884
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,720
I feel you should have asked.

885
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,040
If I make it a thing every time something like that happens,

886
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,240
I will spend my life having awkward arguments

887
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,200
with non-disabled people.

888
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,760
I feel that.

889
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,040
I'm like that sometimes with my mom. She doesn't understand my identity.

890
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,200
I love her, but I get tired of explaining everything to her all the time,

891
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,000
so I've just kind of stopped talking altogether.

892
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,680
But you have a right to ask for things when you need them.

893
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,800
Hmm.

894
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,200
It's a shame it's cloudy because I would love to show you the stars.

895
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,880
What?

896
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,000
Are you seriously trying to talk about stars?

897
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,920
It's my signature move. Thank you very much.

898
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You could also kiss me.

899
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,560
-Oh my God. -What?

900
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,480
Sh.

901
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,560
Shut up!

902
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,120
Come on.

903
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,720
Ta-da!

904
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,480
Ah!

905
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,840
-Ooh! -Oh!

906
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,200
Okay!

907
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,000
-Come on. -We definitely shouldn't be here.

908
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,600
-Hey. -Hey.

909
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,280
We should have sex.

910
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,600
Well, you've just had a bit to drink.

911
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,600
-I don't know… -I'm fine. I'm not drunk.

912
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,520
-Yes, you are. -I wanna have sex with you.

913
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,800
-Take your jacket off. -Yeah.

914
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,920
-Okay. This feels a bit weird. -Why? It's fine.

915
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,640
-Stop worrying about everything. -Okay.

916
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,400
Sorry, I can't. Stop.

917
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,600
Sorry. Um… I spent the night with Ruby.

918
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,440
I just… Uh, I had to tell you.

919
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,880
It's when you were in America. We were fighting, and…

920
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,400
And we just… We slept together. No, as in, we didn't have sex.

921
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,080
Like, nothing happened. We just… We just stayed in the same bed. Sorry.

922
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,840
Fuck.

923
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,120
Mmm.

924
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Hmm.

925
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,320
Maeve?

926
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,000
Well, fuck you.

927
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,560
Did you hear that?

928
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,520
-Yeah, it's usually… -Shit. Someone's here.

929
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,520
There's someone down there. Go, go, go.

930
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,160
My jacket. I can't get arrested.

931
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,960
-Oi! -I'm too young.

932
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,600
What do you think you're doin'?

933
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,160
-Fuck! -Oh, my neck.

934
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,000
Stop playin' around.

935
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,480
Out!

936
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,320
Mum, this is Maeve.

937
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,240
