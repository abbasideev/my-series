I have been absolutely beside myself.

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,480
I'm so disappointed in the person I used to be,

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,560
but I have learned from my mistakes.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,560
And I know that I have to prove that to you now,

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,880
and that might take some time,

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,800
but for the moment, I would just like to say,

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,040
from the very, very bottom of my heart

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,960
to all of my clients, all of my followers,

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,040
and all of my friends, to everyone…

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm truly, truly sorry.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,160
Surprise!

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
Oh no!

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
Oh no! No!

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,120
-Morning, darling. -Morning.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
Want coffee?

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
Yes, please.

49
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
What's going on?

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,480
Well, I… I thought I'd make you some breakfast.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,600
-Why? -We haven't done this in a while.

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,080
-Well… -It's nice.

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,320
Mmm.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,560
Hey, Joy.

55
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,840
How did you sleep? How are you?

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,480
Yeah, I'm okay.

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
It's the election stuff today.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm obviously not gonna win,

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,320
so it feels like that was a massive waste of time.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Well, you did your best,

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,440
which is never a waste of time.

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,880
Have you heard from Maeve?

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,240
She landed this morning.

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,840
I know it might be hard, darling, but I think she made the right decision.

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,560
She was so discouraged when I spoke to her.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,960
What do you mean?

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,880
Well, I think she convinced herself that she wasn't good enough for the course.

68
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,800
And, well, that's just ridiculous. She's such an intelligent young woman.

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
So I told her that she'd had a knock

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,920
and that she shouldn't let it affect her ambition,

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,160
and she should go back and finish.

72
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,360
What?

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,760
You told Maeve to go back to America.

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
Well, no--

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,160
She wanted to stay here with me, Mum. Everything was fine.

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
I didn't tell her anything she didn't already know.

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Of course you did!

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
-You're always doing this! -Hi.

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,000
You get inside people's brains.

80
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,000
You wheedle in like some wheedling brain wheedler!

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,400
Darling, you told me that you wanted me to be more involved in your life.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,080
Don't you dare put this on me!

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
I wanted you to ask me how my day was, not therapize my girlfriend

84
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,280
into getting on a plane and breaking up with me.

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
Oh, Otis. I didn't know you broke up.

86
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,440
You crossed a line.

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,960
I was worried you were having another mental breakdown,

88
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,760
but no, you're just consistently fucking with everything in my life.

89
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,280
-Don't talk to your mother like that-- -Don't get involved.

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,760
No, I will get involved. Your mum does everything for you.

91
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
At least talk to her with some respect.

92
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,640
Oh my God. I hate you both!

93
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Otis, don't…

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Fuck.

95
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,600
You're back.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Not really.

97
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,880
I've got a friend with a spare room down south,

98
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,720
so, uh, I've just come to say goodbye

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,200
and to, uh, pick up my LED face mask.

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,880
Do you mind if I have a shower and get changed before I go?

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,040
No, go on.

102
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,120
Thanks.

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
Thanks for sticking up for me.

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,880
It's all right.

105
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,440
Cal?

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,520
Cal, can I come in?

107
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,960
You sure you wanna do this? Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
You saw the letter.

109
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,320
It's all sexy and gross.

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,920
Yeah, your mum is kind of filthy.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,160
-Odusanya! -Sorry.

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,160
I think this is it.

113
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,920
Good luck.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,760
Hi, how can I help you?

115
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,040
Hi.

116
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200

This is a bit strange. I… I…

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,640
I found a letter that you wrote to my mum.

121
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,480
Her name is Roz…

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,600

00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,880
Oh, you mean practicing?

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Practicing, sorry.

153
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,120
Oh, that's very nice that you're trying. Aw.

154
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,080
Oh, we were saying that O's apology was a bit fake.

155
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,760
Guys, that's really mean. You know the drill.

156
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Hi. Sorry, do you know Cal Bowman?

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,680
-Yes. -I'm their mum.

158
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,000
They didn't come home last night, and they're not answering their phone.

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't seen them.

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,360
I've called the police, but they're just not taking it seriously.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,240
They just… they don't seem themself now, and I'm…

162
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,280
Ooh wow.

163
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,680
This one's good.

164
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
It's upside down.

165
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,440
Oh, it's better that way.

166
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,480
Our first art auction. I'm excited.

167
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,080
-What? -Can I kiss you?

168
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,600
We've been eating cheese and onion.

169
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,400
I don't mind.

170
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,320
Oh God! Cal's gone missing.

171
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,520
-Just pop it on there. -No worries.

172
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,840
What's going on?

173
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,240
Oh, Cal Bowman's been missing since last night. That's their mum.

174
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,080
Christ, how awful.

175
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,200
Yeah, yeah. We'll make sure there's people searching the skate park.

176
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,160
Thank you for coming, everyone.

177
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,760
Cal is in a very vulnerable place right now,

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,840
so we need to start searching for them straight away.

179
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,240
Their last text message said they were going to Pinelands Shopping Center.

180
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,320
This is a real moment to focus on the power of intention

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
and manifest finding Cal.

182
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,840
Come on. Let's do this. Come on, Cavendish!

183
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,800
Whoo!

184
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,640
Thank you.

185
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,960
Should we get some?

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,880
Oh.

187
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,840
-I am so happy you are doing this. -Hmm.

188
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,400
-Good morning. -Good morning.

189
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,120
-Good morning, Pastor. -Hello, girls.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,280
-Hello. -Eric, can I have a quick word?

191
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,480
Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
I'm very sorry.

193
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,600
Someone looked up your college online,

194
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,400
and we've had some complaints about your fundraiser.

195
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,280
Why?

196
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,800
The college values are not something the church can support.

197
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm afraid the church council have decided we cannot accept your money.

198
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,520
-But the fundraiser is tonight. -I know.

199
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,720
It's out of my hands.

200
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Please don't let this ruin your special day.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,200
Maybe you should go home and tell your parents.

202
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,560
I wanna be here, okay?

203
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
What if Cal's not all right?

204
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,480
Oh, Otis, mate.

205
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,320
Can I speak to you about a sex thing?

206
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,800
-You don't wanna speak with Connor? -Well, he's all booked up.

207
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,640
Basically, what it is, yeah, is me and Abbi, yeah,

208
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,480
we tried to have sex last night,

209
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,560
and I thought everything was sound, but then she set my blanket on fire.

210
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,480
Are you okay?

211
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,800
She might have done it on purpose, like, to try and get out of it.

212
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,960
We've been going back to basics, just like you said, but it's not working.

213
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,480
We barely even kiss anymore, and we still haven't had sex.

214
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,880
Well, it sounds to me like she's still feeling some kind of pressure.

215
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,600
I know it's hard, but I think you just have to be patient. Yeah?

216
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
Sorry about the blanket.

217
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,600
My nan knitted that. I'm gutted.

218
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,760
Thanks.

219
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,000
It's best if we split into groups, so you guys go together.

220
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,320
And then you two and then you guys come with me. Where's Roman?

221
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,240
-Look who it is. -Did you see her apology?

222
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,440
-Hey, can I go with you guys? -Oh, no.

223
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,720
Too little too late.

224
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,360
What's the plan?

225
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,400
I would rather wear synthetic wool.

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
What? I did apologize.

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,560
You kind of apologized to everyone except her.

228
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,080
-Have you seen this person? -No, sorry.

229
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,000
-Thanks. -Guys, no one's seen Cal anywhere.

230
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,920
-Aimes? -What?

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,760
It's 50% off. I shop when I'm stressed, Jackson.

232
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Uh, Viv?

233
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,600
Can we talk?

234
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,640
Hey, are you okay?

235
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,040
Um…

236
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,960
Yeah.

237
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,840
-Hi. -Are you here to find Cal?

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,480
I didn't know what else to do. You weren't responding to my messages.

239
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,040
I know I upset you, and I made a mistake.

240
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,920
I… I just can't stand seeing you with anyone else.

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,360
I know that's wrong, and I'm gonna work on it.

242
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,080
No. I… I can't talk to you right now. I'm gonna go back to my friends.

243
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,760
I'm gonna go.

244
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,200
That's the money you need.

245
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,520
Why are you giving me this?

246
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,640
You're right.

247
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,840
I am a fucked-up person.

248
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,600
I really wanted it to work out with Jakob.

249
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,240
I really loved him.

250
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,800
And I wanted to raise Joy with him.

251
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
But…

252
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,440
a little bit of me knew that she wasn't his,

253
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,440
and I just really didn't want it to be true,

254
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,360
so I blocked it out, and now it's all fucked-up.

255
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, well, I quit the show, and…

257
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,160
and I'm going to get myself together.

258
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
Why did you do that?

259
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,560
Because it's not fair on Joy.

260
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,520
You've really been growing in confidence.

261
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,520
No, it's the right decision.

262
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,880
Look, I know I'm not good at asking for help. Come here.

263
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,040
It's been so nice to have you here.

264
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,240
And if you stayed here for a while, you could start your nursery.

265
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,480
I slept with Dan.

266
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,880
Of course you did.

267
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,040
But you don't need to worry. I realized he has those toes

268
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,760
that are all the same length,

269
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,680
and he gave me the ick, so I'm not into him anymore, anyway.

270
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,320
I know what you're doing, Jo.

271
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,920
You don't get to just blow it up so that you can leave like always.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,640
Let's just… just stay here, and we'll work on it.

273
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,880
I would die of boredom out here. I…

274
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
I really need to go.

275
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,280
Keep the money.

276
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,600
I know that you're leaving your job because you think that you're a shit mum,

277
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,440
but you have raised Otis so brilliantly, and you're gonna do the same with Joy.

278
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,200
I wish we'd had a mum like you.

279
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
Uh, hi. Sorry. Um…

280
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,880
You've not seen this person recently, have you?

281
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,320
Oh yeah, they were here last night.

282
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,200
They ordered three cheeseburgers and then didn't eat them.

283
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
It was weird.

284
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Do you guys have security cameras?

285
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,760
Okay, thank you.

286
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,400
Security. Where's security?

287
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,960
-Would you like to try Boats by Boats? -No, I've got… Ugh, don't…

288
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,800
It's quite nice.

289
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,440
Hey. Bit of an emergency, um…

290
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,120
We need to look at last night's security tapes

291
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,640
from the food court.

292
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,800
-Our friend is missing, and we're worried. -Sorry, can't help you.

293
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,840
-They were here last night. We-- -You'll have to call the police.

294
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
Harriet. Harriet Anders. From Moordale Secondary.

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,960
Shut up.

296
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,760
You're Ruby Matthews.

297
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,240
As if you remember me.

298
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,960
Of course I remember you. Why wouldn't I?

299
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,560
Because you were such a bitch. I mean, you were magnificent.

300
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,160
But terrifying.

301
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
-Can I have a selfie? -Of course you can.

302
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,680
If you let us take a peek at those security tapes.

303
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,800
Yeah, of course.

304
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,600
-What's happening? -She's kind of a big deal.

305
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,280
Cheese.

306
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Adam.

307
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,360
-What are you doing here? -I've been worried.

308
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
Why are you worried?

309
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,480
Because you're not talking to me.

310
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
And a student has gone missing at college.

311
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
It made me think about what I'd do if anything happened to you

312
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,880
while you still thought that…

313
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,920
that I don't like you.

314
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,120
You don't like me.

315
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,280
No. Adam, I do like you very much.

316
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,560
I love you.

317
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,680
You're my son.

318
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,120
I just don't like myself.

319
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,160
And I've made you feel small because of that, and I deeply regret it.

320
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,080
And I know we can never get that time back,

321
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,920
but I am trying to change.

322
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,920
Do you wanna hug a horse?

323
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,680
-Pardon? -Hugging a horse makes things feel better.

324
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
Oh, uh…

325
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,160
Uh, no, I'm okay. Thank you.

326
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,320
But I'd

327
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
quite like to hug you.

328
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,120
Uh…

329
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,240
-Dad. -Uh, yes.

330
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,680
Just about to teach my first lesson.

331
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,880
Maybe I could stay and watch.

332
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,960
You could join in if you like.

333
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,040
I…

334
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
No. Uh…

342

Please be seated.

343
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,720
It's now time for our baptism.

344
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Adedayo, my son.

345
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,280
Are you ready to take this next step?

346
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,480
Hallelujah! Whoo!

347
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,560
Do you renounce all sin

348
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,880
and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?

349
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,080
I do.

350
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Would you like to share anything with your community?

351
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,720
I've done many things in my life that I am ashamed of.

352
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,720
Things that have made me unclean.

353
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,320
But today, I turn my back on sin

354
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,440
and thank God for his mercy that I can be reborn and made pure.

355
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,720
Praise God.

356
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,840
Hallelujah!

357
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,000
It is my honor to baptize you

358
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,800
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

359
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,560
Eric, it's your turn.

360
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Are you ready to take this next step?

361
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,360
Do you renounce all sin

362
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,600
and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?

363
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,520
Um…

364
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,120
I have something that I need to say.

365
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,120
Hallelujah. Speak your truth, Eric.

366
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,200
I don't know how you're all gonna feel about my truth.

367
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,600
I thought God wanted me to be baptized today.

368
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,360
And I wanted to make God happy.

369
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,120
I wanted to make you all happy,

370
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,920
especially my family.

371
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,080
But I can't stay silent any longer.

372
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,160
I have to tell my truth.

373
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,280
Otherwise, I will be half a person, and I can't live like that.

374
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,200
My name is Eric Effiong.

375
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
And I'm a Christian.

376
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
And a proud gay man.

377
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,160
I know a lot of you feel that what I've just said is sinful

378
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,600
and that I need to pray for forgiveness, but you're wrong.

379
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,400
My heart is torn,

380
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,960
because I'm in a position where I have to either choose

381
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,360
to hide my truth and live in pain

382
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,520
or be honest and lose my community.

383
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,560
I keep getting told that I need to wait and be patient,

384
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,200
but I'm tired of waiting.

385
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,440
And I love myself too much to not tell my truth.

386
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,600
So, if you love me as I am,

387
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,240
I will be baptized,

388
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,560
but if you don't,

389
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
then I must leave.

390
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,240
I love you as you are, my son.

391
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,800
I have my answer.

392
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,600
I know! A completely normal day, and then she just walks in.

393
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,760
Literally, the best day of my life.

394
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,040
OMG, Lana.

395
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,280
No, she's actually not scary at all,

396
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,240
and her skin is so soft.

397
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,800
What if something bad has happened?

398
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Just say positive, Aish.

399
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,240
I don't feel positive. I feel worried.

400
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,880
Try and breathe, and remember the power of manifestation.

401
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,800
Abbi.

402
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,360
I don't think I know that one yet, sorry.

403
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,480
-I think she said fuck off. -Why?

404
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Because I wanted to express a normal emotion,

405
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,960
and you never let us.

406
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,080
You want us to be positive all the time, and that's why we never tell you a thing.

407
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,760
-Like what? -I want to be a pescatarian.

408
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,880
What about the oceans?

409
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,440
See? I can't tell you anything.

410
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,560
Okay, fine. What else?

411
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,920
I like gossip. It's fun.

412
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
And Roman hates yoga.

413
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,800
What?

414
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,840
I do hate yoga, and I'm really sad that we don't have sex anymore.

415
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,960
-You guys don't have sex anymore? -Why are you ganging up on me?

416
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,840
Uh, Roman, I think your intimacy issues should be separate,

417
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,120
and you can talk about that privately.

418
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Sorry, um,

419
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,960
I… I actually think it might all be connected.

420
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,560
Abbi, why do you feel the need to keep things positive all the time?

421
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,240
Uh, thinking negative things just makes me feel heavy. Um…

422
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,640
Basically, everyone important in my life has rejected me.

423
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,360
That must be really difficult for you.

424
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,800
I imagine there's a lot of emotions that you're keeping at bay.

425
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,280
If I think about how I feel, then I just wanna scream.

426
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,520
So I think it's better if I keep things light.

427
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,840
That makes sense. It feels like you can't cope with anything else.

428
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,200
Well, sometimes, that constant positivity can become a little bit toxic.

429
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,840
And if you're shutting down those very natural negative reactions,

430
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,200
it can hurt you a little bit further down the line.

431
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,560
I just get scared of saying how I really feel

432
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,800
in case you guys abandon me as well.

433
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,280
We would never reject you, Abbi.

434
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,000
You're part of us.

435
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,320
Navigating conflict and having these difficult conversations,

436
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,040
that's the mark of a true relationship with someone.

437
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,720
Do you think you'd feel comfortable sharing more of those negative thoughts?

438
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,440
Aisha, the way you pick your fingernails in class is disgusting.

439
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,120
And sometimes, I don't wanna hear about Mercury being in fucking retrograde.

440
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,640
And, Roman, we don't have sex anymore

441
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
because you make this loud moaning noise when we kiss, and it's so irritating.

442
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,240
It's all I think about.

443
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,160
Your natural toothpaste isn't working because your breath smells like garlic.

444
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,280
You need fluoride.

445
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,520
That actually felt really good.

446
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,360
Hang on.

447
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,200
What noise do I make?

448
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,520
Hey, Grace. Did Lana tell you who I'm here with?

449
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Yeah, I think we might be best friends. We're getting on really well.

450
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,080
I know. Yeah, you can just feel it when it's right, can't you?

451
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,800
And it's definitely right.

452
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,600
Yeah, I did. And I was the only person who could help,

453
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,840
so, like, we're sitting together right now.

454
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah, I thought that, but no, she's really nice.

455
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
We're getting on so well.

456
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,560
Like, you know when you just have chemistry with someone.

457
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
Thank you. Think I've found something.

458
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,880
Call you back.

459
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,800
No.

460
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,240
Yep, it smells like burgers. That's it.

461
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,760
Fine.

462
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,200
Get in.

463
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,440
One jump should do. Big one.

464
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,880
-Okay. -One, two, three.

465
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,720
Yeah. Hop.

466
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
-Ugh. It smells. -It's a bin.

467
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,520
-One, two, three. -Shut up!

468
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,000
Drop. Just drop.

469
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,360
-Okay. -Hey, can we, um…

470
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,640
Jesus Christ.

471
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Look, I don't know if you saw the video or not, but I, um…

472
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,640
Okay, no way.

473
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,800
I did really mean it, and…

474
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But I also should have just said it to your face.

475
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,560
You deserve a proper apology.

476
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,880
I just didn't really know if you'd actually wanna hear it

477
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,480
because of how far I dug myself in,

478
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,400
but you know, what I did to you was really horrible.

479
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,240
For what it's worth,

480
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,280
I didn't really like myself for doing that. I still don't.

481
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,840
Um…

482
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,880
And I am really sorry.

483
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,920
No. No. No.

484
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Thank you.

485
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,600
I needed to hear that, so…

486
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,000
I got it. I got it.

487
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,360
Yes.

488
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,200
Let's open it. Open it.

489
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,040
Why have they dumped their stuff?

490
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,960
I think we need to call the police.

491
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,360
This is a customer announcement for Gina.

492
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,320
Gina, your mum is waiting for you.

493
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,360
Gina, please come to reception. Thank you.

494
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,720
Are you all right, Viv?

495
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,560
He seems quite persistent.

496
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Um…

497
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,840
-You know? Maybe I should just text him. -Do not text him, Viv.

498
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,760
I know, but he can be really sweet.

499
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,520
You just haven't seen that side of him.

500
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
And, yes, he gets jealous, but he has low self-esteem.

501
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,720
It's not his fault.

502
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,560
-And it's not your fault. -No.

503
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,800
How do you feel with him?

504
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,440
Sometimes I feel happy,

505
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,360
and then sometimes he makes me feel like I've done something wrong.

506
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,680
It's really confusing.

507
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,720
I don't know when he's gonna get upset next.

508
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
Viv.

509
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,840
Viv, I've been reading a lot of stuff about abuse for my art,

510
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,520
and it does sound like he could maybe be emotionally coercive.

511
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,560
He's so controlling, Viv.

512
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,960
I just feel confused.

513
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Love should make you feel safe. It should make you feel braver

514
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,360
because you can be totally yourself around that person.

515
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,400
It shouldn't be confusing, and it shouldn't be scary.

516
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,240
Shit, I think I know where Cal is.

517
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,800
-I'll text you, okay? -Okay.

518
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,240
-All right. -Thank you.

519
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,600
Oh my gosh.

520
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,080
Oi!

521
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,360
Um, excuse me!

522
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,480
Excuse me! You've got my ph-- Excuse me! Give me my phone!

523
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,200
Oi.

524
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,760
I know you.

525
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,080
No!

526
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,120
Look, I can't… I couldn't get baptized.

527
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,400
Okay, I can't be something that I'm not!

528
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,720
What do you want from me?

529
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,800
Why are you laughing?

530
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,080
Because you've done exactly what I wanted you to do.

531
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,160
Today was the start of a long and hard road.

532
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,400
I will be with you every step of the way.

533
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,480
You will change hearts and minds

534
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,800
and let everyone know that I love them for who they are.

535
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,400
This will be your calling.

536
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,400
It will be your life's work.

537
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,840
I don't think so.

538
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,240
I made you this bright

539
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,640
so that others would see in the darkness.

540
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,440
What do I do now?

541
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,520
Oh, no more poo, please. I beg.

542
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,320
Cal.

543
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,200
Cal?

544
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,840
Cal.

545
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,920
Uh,

546
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,920
I think…

547
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,200
I think people are looking for you.

548
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,120
I've been here for a while.

549
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,320
I don't really know what happened.

550
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,120
Then I got scared, and then…

551
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,040
I couldn't go home.

552
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,240
If you wanna talk about it, I'm here.

553
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,480
But also, if you just wanna sit in silence…

554
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,400
then we can do that too.

555
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,840
It feels like I'm…

556
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,200
drowning.

557
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,480
I can't wait any longer, and I wish I could make it stop because…

558
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,160
that's never gonna change.

559
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,800
It's gonna be okay.

560
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,520
I don't think the world wants people like me in it.

561
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,120
Cal?

562
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,560
Cal. Oh, you're okay. Thank God.

563
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,560
-There's, like, a search party. -Jackson. Jackson.

564
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,200
-Everyone was so worried. -Jackson.

565
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,200
Are people angry that I worried them?

566
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,560
No, no one's angry.

567
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,800
They're gonna be happy

568
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,520
that you're safe.

569
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,600
Cal, I had no idea that you were having such a difficult time.

570
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,680
I'm so sorry that I let you down.

571
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,160
We should've all done more

572
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,720
to show you just how loved you are.

573
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,720
Things have to change, Cal,

574
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,120
because people like us aren't going anywhere.

575
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,440
I know that the world can be harsh, but you're not alone.

576
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,040
We need you here with us.

577
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,240
Shall we take you home?

578
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,080
-Yeah. -Yeah?

579
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,120
Do you want to hear my song?

580
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
I will play a song for you now.

581
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,600
Oh my God. Cal's been found. They're safe.

582
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,840
Oh my God.

583
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,800
They found Cal.

584
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,600
-Oh my God. Thank you. -Oh my gosh.

585
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,000
Eric found Cal!

586
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
-Thank you, Abbi. -You guys!

587
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,360
I want to explain about this morning.

588
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,080
I've still got some stuff with intimacy

589
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,360
since the assault,

590
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,800
and I guess I was scared to tell you 'cause I thought it might put you off.

591
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,080
Aimee, you could never put me off. I'm really glad that you told me.

592
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,560
There you go.

593
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,480
Thank you.

594
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,840
There's something I have to do.

595
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,680
-Thank you. -Bye!

596
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,080
No one's gonna feel it, bro.

597
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,400
-Sorry, I should take this. -Yeah, do your thing.

598
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Hello.

599
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,000
Maeve Wiley?

600
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,840
This is Caitlin Reed from Goodhart Books. I read your piece, Southchester.

601
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,480
You…

602
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,960
How… Sorry. How did you read my piece?

603
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,080
Ellen Rasmussen gave it to me.

604
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,040
I've been speaking to her as part of the Wallace internship.

605
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,160
Anyway, it's a very evocative piece.

606
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,320
I'd really like to read some more if you have it.

607
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,640
Yeah, sure. I can send some more over to you. Definitely.

608
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,480
That would be fantastic. We'll be in touch.

609
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,320
Okay. Thanks.

610
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,360
Very good. Well done.

611
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,240
-Thank you. -Great poise, Liza.

612
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,640
-Keep it up, Sophie. Good job. -Yay!

613
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,200
Come on, Michael, we're trotting.

614
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,360
Uh, no, no. I'm okay walking. Thank you.

615
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,280
Come on, Michael. We're trotting now, mate. Giddyap.

616
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,800
Whoa! Whoa!

617
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,640
Ah!

618
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,920
-Am I doing it? -You are. You're doing great!

619
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,400
Ah! I'm bouncing now. Ooh!

620
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,920
Ow! Ah. Ah. How am I doing? Ah!

621
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,840
How do I stop?

622
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,360
Are your legs all right?

623
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,120
-Yeah, I'm fine. -Yeah?

624
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,120
Okay.

625
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,640
-Um, I'll meet you in the car. -Oh, okay.

626
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,360
-Oh, thank you. -Oh, thanks. Bye.

627
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Yup.

628
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
Oh Christ.

629
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,200
Well done.

630
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,800
Thanks.

631
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,960
I wasn't completely honest with you the other day.

632
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,840
My ex is called Eric.

633
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,600
I'm attracted to men and women. It's not a phase. That's just who I am.

634
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,760
And I haven't always liked that about myself, but I want to.

635
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,200
And, anyway, I just wanted you to know.

636
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,400
Do you wanna go on a date?

637
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,720
Yeah.

638
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,920
I'd like that.

639
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,840
We've got 90 seconds, Tilly.

640
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,360
It's gonna be great.

641
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,920
Don't forget to smile.

642
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,200
Stop.

643
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,800
Oh, Jean. We haven't actually started, so…

644
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,520
Right. Um, I made a mistake.

645
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,880
I don't want to quit. I want to keep doing the show.

646
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,120
But if I am gonna do it, I have to do it my way.

647
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,680
No cohosts, no making it spicy for spicy's sake.

648
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,000
Just proper in-depth therapy sessions with listeners and me.

649
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,320
That's what I'm good at. I think it could be great if you give me another chance.

650
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,240
Um… what's going on?

651
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,480
Yes, good. Yep. Jean. Jean. Jean.

652
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,280
This is Tilly. Tilly, this is Jean.

653
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,160
Tilly's filling in your show.

654
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,960
Tilly's show is about antiquing and true crime.

655
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,520
It's fun. Tilly, not today. I'm sorry.

656
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,400
We're gonna rearrange your time slot. So off you pop. Another time.

657
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,480
You're great.

658
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,960
Bright future. Good luck. Jean.

659
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,600
Oh, sure.

660
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,760
On that, I want you to let me bring in my baby anytime I need to,

661
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,080
and I need a private area to be able to pump milk.

662
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,040
Sure you do. We'll talk about that later.

663
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,080
Okay.

664
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,960
Right.

665
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,080
This is Dr. Jean Milburn,

666
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,120
and you are listening to Sexology.

667
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,640
Please call in. I am here.

668
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,960
Every time. Every time.

669
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,360
-Oh, yeah. -Psych.

670
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,880
That's how you're gonna do me today? All right.

671
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,560
-Hey. -I won't forget.

672
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,000
I know about Jerome.

673
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,360
I found this letter.

674
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,800
So he's my biological father, isn't he? I went to see him.

675
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,200
Told him who I was.

676
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,800
And he asked me to leave.

677
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,680
I just want to know everything, and I want to know it now.

678
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,160
What are these?

679
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,560
Jackson, take a seat.

680
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,080
Before I met your mum,

681
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,640
I had an affair with a married man.

682
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,760
It was a mistake, but I was confused.

683
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,680
And then I fell pregnant with you.

684
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,720
It was unexpected and stressful,

685
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,160
but I very quickly realized I was so happy.

686
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
The thing is, Jerome already had a family.

687
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,680
I sent him updates and photos.

688
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,440
I thought if he saw how incredible you are,

689
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,200
he might change his mind.

690
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,080
But he just sent them back unopened.

691
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,840
And then I met your mum.

692
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,040
And everything changed.

693
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,040
We wanted to raise you together.

694
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,600
To be a family.

695
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,000
We didn't want you to, in any way, feel like you were unloved.

696
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,600
What?

697
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,680
I have to go.

698
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,080
-I have to go. -What?

699
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,960
-I can't believe you lied to me. -Jackson, we were trying to protect you.

700
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,400
-Hey, Savior! -Hey.

701
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,960
Look who it is. It's the savior.

702
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,240
What a hero. You found Cal.

703
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,840
Uh…

704
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,000
Guys, I've got some bad news.

705
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,480
The church isn't going to accept any of the money

706
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,280
that we raise tonight at the fundraiser.

707
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh, I can't believe it.

708
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,440
-I can. -Oh, fuck!

709
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,240
Sorry. Sorry. I'm… I'm good.

710
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,760
Oh gosh.

711
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,520
I'll see you guys in there.

712
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,200
What are we gonna fundraise for now?

713
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,680
Well, there's this charity for homeless guinea pigs.

714
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Oh, I love guinea pigs.

715
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,160
-Hey. -Hey.

716
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,240
I was gonna call you earlier, but I was being all stubborn.

717
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,320
-I wanted to call you as well. -Been thinking about what you said.

718
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,440
And I think I do feel uncomfortable about some of our differences,

719
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,400
and I've never known how to talk about it

720
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,560
because I'm scared that I'm gonna get it wrong

721
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,560
or I'm gonna upset you.

722
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,440
I shouldn't be afraid of that.

723
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,240
Shouldn't be afraid of those conversations because you're my best friend.

724
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,280
And I feel like I've lost a lot this year,

725
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,800
and I couldn't survive if I lost you.

726
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,640
You're not gonna get rid of me.

727
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,240
Look, we're getting ready for the fundraiser here.

728
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,400
Mm-hmm.

729
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,080
Do you care to join?

730
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,800
-Would I like to join? -Would you like to join?

731
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,880
-Like to join? -Am I getting a little invite?

732
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,280
You're getting a little invite into The Coven.

733
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,840
I don't really know about the whole hat and jacket.

734
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,080
Ah, absolutely not. Take that off right now.

735
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,480
-Okay. Something else. -It's just not very you.

736
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,760
-No, it's not. -You can do better.

737
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,000
You can do well better.

738
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,160
-I hate this song. -Yeah, same. Can you change it, babe?

739
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,520
There are treatment options for a tight foreskin.

740
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,840
Ah! Oh my God. It's your mum!

741
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,120
Oh my God. I love her. Let's listen.

742
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,760
Maybe we raise money for people with tight foreskins?

743
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,200
…talcum powder. Thank you, Adrian.

744
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,480
Keep those calls coming.

745
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,680
And remember, there are no topics that are off-limits.

746
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,440
Our next caller is Joanna.

747
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,240
Hello, Joanna.

748
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,720
What's on your mind tonight?

749
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,520
I, um…

750
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,880
Something, um, happened to me when I was, um, 12.

751
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,520
There was a man.

752
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,680
He was… he was a boyfriend of my mum's,

753
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,000
and he… touched me.

754
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,320
I mean, he…

755
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,880
abused me, and, uh,

756
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,200
I don't think I'm okay.

757
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,080
I am never happy or… or secure,

758
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,000
and I think I need to get some help with that, but I'm scared.

759
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,320
Can you tell me what you're scared of?

760
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,920
The thing is, I've, um… I've never liked to stay in the same place for too long.

761
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,120
I, um…

762
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,200
I'm scared that if I stop moving

763
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,600
and I start properly talking about what happened,

764
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,640
then it might all catch up on me,

765
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,040
and I won't be able to pretend that I'm okay anymore.

766
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,520
Thank you for sharing that, Joanna.

767
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,120
What you have experienced is truly soul-crushing…

768
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,480
and deciding that you no longer want to bury these things is…

769
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,400
is very brave and powerful.

770
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,600
But you're right. It is scary.

771
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,200
Now, I don't usually share things from

772
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,920
my own life, but

773
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,640
I just had a baby,

774
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,080
and I've been diagnosed

775
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,040
with postnatal depression.

776
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,320
Now, I didn't even realize that anything was wrong.

777
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,960
I didn't want to accept that anything was wrong.

778
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,680
But

779
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,280
just saying it out loud…

780
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,400
is really the first step to getting help.

781
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,240
It sounds to me that you're ready to do this work on yourself,

782
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,120
but I would urge you

783
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,640
to lean on your friends and family during this time, Joanna.

784
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,920
There's no reason for you to deal with this alone.

785
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,960
-Sexy. -Thanks, babes.

786
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,480
She's ready, girls.

787
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,080

Hey, Molloy wants to see you.

I…

804
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,160
Oh, okay.

805
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,440
Oh, um, Caitlin Reed called me. Thanks for sending her my writing.

806
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,800
It's a brilliant piece.

807
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,960
It's annoying because she wasn't that interested in what I'd written.

808
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,360
But, you know, it's fine. I don't think I want to write anymore.

809
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,680
I think I want to set up a tech company, or maybe I'll go into banking.

810
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,840
Okay. Well, thank you.

811
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,520
-I'll see you later. -I'll see you later.

812
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,040
All right!

813
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,720
Bro, we got this!

814
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,880
Maeve, thanks for dropping in.

815
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,840
It's good to have you back.

816
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,760
Maeve.

817
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,400
Come on.

818
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,120
I was sorry to hear about your mother.

819
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,200
Yeah, thanks.

820
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,640
I also heard that there's been some interest in Southchester.

821
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,840
Congratulations.

822
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,560
Yeah, I'm excited about it.

823
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,160
I just wanted to say that I know I was harsh with you the last time we spoke.

824
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,960
You told me I wasn't cut out to be a writer.

825
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,520
I was just trying to push you to be better.

826
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,000
I don't think you were.

827
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,040
And even if that is true, your words really crushed me.

828
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,120
And I almost didn't come back because of you.

829
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,560
And unlike most students on this campus,

830
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,520
I haven't grown up being told I'm brilliant or deserving.

831
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,000
If I take a risk, and it doesn't work out, I don't have a safety net to fall back on,

832
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:53,480
and you're going to come across other students like me, so

833
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,120
I just want you to know that, as a teacher,

834
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,200
your words hold a lot of power.

835
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,320
I went home and

836
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,120
reminded myself of what I'm made of and where I want to go.

837
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,440
You don't get to be the gatekeeper of my dreams.

838
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,120
Okay.

839
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,680
I can take that on board.

840
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,680
It's… it's just not easy sometimes watching all of you at the beginning.

841
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,120
Yeah.

842
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,200
-I'll see you in class. -Mm-hmm.

843
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,200
I'm so glad you're okay.

844
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,840
I came to ask if you'd be comfortable with us raising money tonight

845
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,920
for your top surgery.

846
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,880
That's amazing.

847
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,080
Thank you so much.

848
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,600
Will you come with me?

849
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,440
No. Uh…

850
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,840
I'd love to, but I don't think I'm ready to see everyone.

851
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,840
-Do you like auctions? -I've never been to one before.

852
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,040
-Have you not? -No.

853
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,480
Oh, last one I went to, my mum won a year's supply of ham.

854
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,400
Oh?

855
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,560
Ugh, it was way too much ham.

856
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,440
-Viv. -Oh, he's here again.

857
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,240
Can we please talk?

858
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,800
Okay. Okay, um, Beau, we've spoken about this already,

859
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,120
but you don't seem to be listening, so I'm gonna be really clear.

860
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,040
I don't wanna talk to you. I don't wanna see you.

861
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,280
I don't wanna hear from you.

862
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,800
I don't know what made you like this, and it's probably something really sad,

863
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,440
and I hope you seek out some therapy, but if you keep on trying to contact me,

864
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,960
I will report you.

865
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,680
Do you hear me?

866
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,280
Yeah.

867
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,680
Oh my God.

868
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,040
-You're amazing. -You too.

869
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,520
Wow!

870
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,640
How did it go?

871
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,720
I've got a lot to fill you in on.

872
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,160
Turns out my mum was filthy!

873
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,440
-Let's start the bidding at 50 pounds. -Fifty-five!

874
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,280
-Sixty-five! -Seventy-five!

875
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,080
Sold to Miss Winton for 75 pounds.

876
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,760
Our next piece is called Melon

877
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,440
by the wonderfully talented Aimee Gibbs.

878
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,920
Let's keep those bids coming. We're raising money for Cal.

879
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,000
Let's start the bidding at 50 pounds.

880
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,120
Whoo!

881
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,920
-Very nice. Fifty-five, anyone? -Fifty-five.

882
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,360

I know a lot's happened today,

904
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,520
but it's time to announce the winner of the student counselor elections.

905
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,360
Vote Connor!

906
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,920
It's the real fun. It's the real fun.

907
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,280
It's time to go. It's time to go.

908
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,520
Let's get this over and done with.

909
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,120
Can I have all the candidates to the stage, please?

910
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,400
Thank you. Hello.

911
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,080
Hello. Welcome.

912
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,160
Yeah.

913
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,080
Thank you.

914
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,800
Take your time. Okay.

915
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,080
Whoo!

916
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,800
And the winner is….

917
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,320
Connor Pearson!

918
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,280
Go, Connor! Get in there! Come on!

919
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,040
Thank you.

920
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,800
Oh, this means a lot.

921
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,840
But I cannot accept the position.

922
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,560
I've been doing therapy sessions for the last few days,

923
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,520
and you guys have a lot of problems.

924
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,360
It's been kind of exhausting and a bit gross.

925
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,480
Rude!

926
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,760
Otis, I only ran because I was hoping I could get on the radio with your mum

927
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,560
because she's, like, super hot.

928
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,480
Oh my God.

929
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,280
But it's too much work.

930
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,160
So, yeah, I'm out.

931
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,400
Don't. Don't. Don't.

932
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,520
Okay, well, thank you, Connor.

933
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,960
I suppose that means we have to go with the runner-up then,

934
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,600
which is

935
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,920
Otis Milburn!

936
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,320
Whoo!

937
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,120
Lady hater!

938
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,760
He's a misogynist.

939
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Wow. Okay. Um…

940
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,800
Uh, thanks. This is unexpected.

941
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,320
Um…

942
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,240
I didn't think anyone was gonna vote for me after the whole meninist thing.

943
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,680
I voted for you.

944
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,160
Great. Thanks. Thanks for the vote.

945
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,240
Um…

946
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,320
Well, I'm… I'm afraid I can't take this position either because

947
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,280
you guys already have a fantastic student therapist,

948
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,560
and that made me feel threatened.

949
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,840
I convinced myself that my behavior was acceptable

950
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,800
because I thought I was the better therapist.

951
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,760
But I'm… I'm really not,

952
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,720
and I should never have taken away someone's space like that,

953
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,520
and this position has always been O's, so…

954
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,680
-Um… -She's a bully.

955
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,920
Get her off the stage!

956
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,280
Boo!

957
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,640
Boo!

958
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,120
No. No, no, no.

959
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,720
Stay there. I… I would like to say something.

960
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,360
Sh!

961
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,480
Hello. I'm Ruby Matthews.

962
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,480
Who?

963
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,440
The bed wetter. Uh…

964
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,320
I released that video because I wanted to destroy O

965
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,040
like she destroyed me,

966
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,600
and I thought it was gonna feel very good, and it didn't,

967
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,120
which is very annoying because it made me realize

968
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,880
that this stupid college

969
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:41,200
is starting to make me have the… the feelings or something.

970
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:48,160
And I honestly thought that this whole "being kind" thing was a load of crap.

971
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,160
Nobody can be perfect. And you're certainly not.

972
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,920
But I've realized you're trying to make the world a better place.

973
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,480
And that makes me want to be better.

974
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,080
I think the Cavendish thing to do would be to give her a second chance.

975
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,640
You go, bed wetter!

976
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,560
Right, then.

977
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,920
Okay, so I guess this means that, um, O here is our therapist again.

978
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,600
This was a huge waste of time.

01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,000
You're the first person I've told.

1064
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,360
I think that's really cool.

1065
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
-Yeah? -You'll be a natural.

1066
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,840
-Oh, thanks, Oatcake. -Mmm.

1067
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,440
Pastor Effiong.

1068
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,240
It's got a little ring to it, eh?

1069
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,520
-Wanna stay at mine and play Smash Bros? -Yes.

1070
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,320
-Yes. -I thought you'd never ask.

1071
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,920
-Oh! Come on. -I'm gonna beat your ass.

1072
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,280
Oh, please. Please.

1073
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,160
So we ended up going on this awesome boat.

1074
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,280
I think one of Patrice's friends owned it.

1075
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,360
Adam?

1076
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,520
Oh, uh, Third Wives of Miami is on. Do you want to come and watch?

1077
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:14,920
Michael.

1078
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,080
I'm just dropping Adam home.

1079
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:21,080
We've been hanging out. I watched him teach a class today.

1080
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,440
And he was excellent.

1081
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,840
Uh, anyhow, I'll let you two get on with your evening.

1082
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,320
Um, I was thinking that…

1083
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,640
maybe we could watch some TV for a bit.

1084
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,160
Yeah.

1085
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,160
-Yeah. -Yeah.

1086
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,120
Jackson?

1087
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,840
-I should've told you sooner. -Yeah.

1088
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,920
I didn't want you to hate me.

1089
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,000
I don't hate you, Mum.

1090
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,440
I'm angry at you though.

1091
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,600
Both.

1092
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,200
It's okay to be angry with us.

1093
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,320
But we're not going anywhere.

1094
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,560
We're gonna work through this together.

1095
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,600
Why didn't he want to know me?

1096
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,480
Because he's a fool, Jackson.

1097
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,040
He has no idea what he's missing.

1098
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,440
How can anyone not want to know someone as brilliant as you?

1099
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,280
You are. You are. You are.

1100
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,800
Oh.

1101
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,760
Love you.

1102
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,400
I love you.

1103
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,640
I'm so sorry, Mum.

1104
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,600
You do not have to say sorry.

1105
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,400
I just wish I knew how to make it better.

1106
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,920
Sorry.

1107
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,520
I love having sex with you.

1108
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,200
I love being inside of you.

1109
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,680
-Sorry. -It's okay.

1110
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,720
Go!

1111
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,920
Come on, then! Oh, can't you catch me?

1112
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,400
You can't catch me because I'm too fast for you.

1113
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,600
Oh!

1114
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,040
He's too quick for you.

1115
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,560
-Slap. And jump. Slap. -Do you think you're--

1116
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,600
Pull it. Aim.

1117
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,400
Whoa! Goodbye. Good night. It's the end.

1118
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,240
-Go again. -Sorry. It's the end. No.

1119
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,360
That's such a nice smile.

1120
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,720
-Hello, darling. -Hey.

1121
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,920
How was your night?

1122
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,880
It was quite fun, actually.

1123
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,720
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1124
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,840
Maeve leaving was the right thing for her.

1125
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,760
-I shouldn't have taken it out on you. -Thank you for apologizing.

1126
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,480
How are you feeling about it all?

1127
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,960
Okay.

1128
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,640
Well, it's all right not to be okay.

1129
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,320
I'm worried that if I think about it too much,

1130
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,480
I'm gonna end up all sad like you were when Dad left.

1131
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,280
So I'm just not.

1132
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,920
I think you shouldn't try to block out all those emotions

1133
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,360
because that's how heartbreak becomes unresolved

1134
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,040
and turns into something bitter.

1135
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,920
It's really important that you feel all those feelings,

1136
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,240
as much as they hurt.

1137
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,440
-Thanks. -Oh.

1138
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,600
-I love you, darling. -Love you too.

1139
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,640
And I'm proud of you

1140
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,840
for getting help.

1141
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,880
Thank you.

1142
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,840
He's proud of me.

1143
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,720
-I'll get it. -Thanks.

1144
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,600
Ah.

1145
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,680
Hey, little dude.

1146
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,280
-You all right? -No, broke my leg several places.

1147
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,840
-You coming in? -I thought I might. Would that work?

1148
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,120
Do you need a hand?

1149
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,760
No, it's cool. I have the crutch-arinos.

1150
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,480
Mum, it's, uh, motorbike man.

1151
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,160
Yeah, I mean, it's normally just Dan, but, uh…

1152
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,320
Fuck it. Call me motorbike man. That's cool.

1153
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,000
-Hi, Dan. -Hey, Jean.

1154
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,000
Oh shit! Baby! That's cool.

1155
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,480
Congratul-aciones.

1156
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,960
-Thank you for coming. -It's all good.

1157
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,200
You might wanna have a seat.

1158
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,600
Sure, okay. Maybe I'll just…

1159
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,840
Are you all right?

1160
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,280
Go ahead and use the table.

1161
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,360
Thank you. Hi, baby.

1162
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,520
Thanks. So, what's up?

1163
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,120
Dear Otis.

1164
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,360
You know I hate soppy romantic stuff.

1165
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,080
So don't get your hopes up. This isn't a love letter.

1166
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,120
When we first met, I didn't trust anyone.

1167
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,040
I thought if I kept everybody out,

1168
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,360
I'd stop myself from being hurt or let down,

1169
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,120
which is what I was used to.

1170
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,760
Then we set the clinic up together, and I realized that most of the people

1171
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,240
who came to us for help really just needed connection.

1172
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,600
And maybe I wasn't so different.

1173
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,120
You have the rare ability to make people feel truly seen.

1174
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,760
And you did the same for me.

1175
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,720
It was this and your relentless optimism about human beings

1176
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:21,040
that gave me the courage to start opening myself up to other people.

1177
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,080
For the first time in my life, I didn't feel alone,

1178
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,720
which allowed me to imagine something bigger for myself.

1179
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,280
I want you to know that however much it fucking hurts

1180
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,040
that we can't be together, I won't ever close myself off again.

1181
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,560
Meeting you cracked my heart open, and now it's forever changed.

1182
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,560
And because of that,

1183
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,040
I will carry a part of you with me wherever I go.

1184
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,280
I think what I'm trying to say is

1185
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,600
thanks for everything,

1186
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,880
