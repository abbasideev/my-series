00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,040
-Hello, beautiful. -I don't think that's a river fish.

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,040
I think you should probably throw that back, no?

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,040
Ah-ah!

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,440
-Don't touch my fish. -It needs to go back.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
I said don't.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,040
Oh my…

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,400
God?

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Please don't tell me you were expecting an old white guy.

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,560
Hmm?

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,880
Now, we need to have a little talk.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Am I in trouble?

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,120
Why are you turning your back on your church?

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
Look, I… I don't want to, but I…

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,480
I don't think I can be baptized.

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,480
-It's too hard. -Life is hard!

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,800
And sacrifices must be made.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
But your church needs you.

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,280
I need you.

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,200
I sin all the time.

40
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,560
I had a wank this morning.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,960
And you know I wear my pants two days in a row.

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,280
And I--

43
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,800
Eric Effiong! You are my precious child.

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,680
You are brave and bold and absolutely "effervocious."

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,280
-I don't think that's a word. -Are you arguing with God?

46
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,160
No, I… I just… Maybe you're trying to say effervescent?

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,400
-Which is very kind of you-- -Sh, sh, sh.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,480

-Uh… Uh, no. No, excuse me. -Oh!

73
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,920
What… what are you doing in my house?

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,320
I, uh… popped by to see your mum.

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,680
-Okay. -I've got a free period, so…

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Oh, um… you've… you've just got a few crumbs in your neck brace.

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,440
-What happened, by the way? -None of your business.

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,600
Look, Otis, you don't have to be like that.

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,760
I know that things got a little bit tense at the debate,

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,680
but it's a competition.

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,360
Tense? You lied about me in front of the entire college.

82
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,520
I didn't lie. And you outed me in front of the entire college.

83
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,920
Dr. Milburn!

84
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,040
Hi. Um, I hope you don't mind me poppin' by.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120
I just wanted to run through a few things before our show tonight.

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
Yeah, sure.

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,120
-Do you wanna pop into my office? -I'll leave you guys to it.

88
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,560
I'll be there in just a minute. Otis!

89
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
Darling.

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,880
-I didn't know she was coming. -Whatever. Mum, I've gotta go.

91
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,480
Wait, wait.

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,160
Look, I know Maeve is going through a vulnerable time right now.

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,640
I just… I think that maybe you should pay attention

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
to your own instincts on things.

95
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,120
Mum, it was both of us the other night. Okay? Maeve didn't make me do anything.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,680
Okay. Just it's my job to worry about you.

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,160
You weren't worried about me when you hired my nemesis

98
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,600
to be your cohost, were you?

99
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,800
Enjoy your prep meeting.

100
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,480
Oh, hi. Please, take a wee seat.

101
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,080
This is a safe space.

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,480
Wow.

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,600
O?

104
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
Hi, hi. Hello.

105
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,760
Hi.

106
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,320
Ruby! Hey.

107
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
Ooh.

108
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,600
What are you doing here? What is that?

109
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,320
Oh, uh… it's nothing. Um… A crick.

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,720
I wanted to speak with you about

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,080
the whole next steps for the election thing.

112
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,080
Otis, people think you're a meninist who outs people.

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
No, I know, but I'm not.

114
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,600
And, well, you're so good at PR.

115
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,280
I think you can get the truth out there and counteract this whole spin from O.

116
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,320
Yes, okay. I'll get onto that today.

117
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,280
-Thanks. -Where are you going?

118
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,720
Ah, well, it's Maeve's mum's… funeral.

119
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,880
-Oh. -Yeah.

120
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,800
Which, uh… reminds me, actually. Um…

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,920
I wanna say, like, if… if you bump into Maeve for whatever reason,

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,880
and she asks you about that night, you know, when I stayed over,

123
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,320
I told her we were working on the campaign,

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,680
and we accidentally fell asleep.

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,440
That is what happened.

126
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,680
No, I know. But, like, you know, that wasn't great.

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,760
And I just don't want her to think that we're more than friends.

128
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
That's why you came here. To do damage control on your relationship?

129
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
No.

130
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,480
I mean, a little bit, but no.

131
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,400
I wanted to speak with you about the campaign.

132
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
Maeve doesn't need to worry. We're not more than friends.

133
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,560
-We're not friends at all. -Ruby.

134
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,040
-It isn't very you. -Hmm.

135
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
Yeah, but it is a proper funeral dress, which means Mum would have loved it.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
Okay.

137
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,520
God.

138
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,560
-Does my eye look really bad? -No.

139
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
What happened?

140
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,880
Otis and I tried to have sex. It was a disaster.

141
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Ooh.

142
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,720
Yeah, we're not really speaking.

143
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,960
It's a bit of a long story. I was gonna text you about it, but…

144
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,760
Yeah.

145
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,880
Well, I know we're not in a very good place right now. I get it.

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,080
Aimes, I think the Isaac thing makes me uncomfortable.

147
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,600
-D-do you reckon you two could be friends? -Yes. Absolutely.

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,880
I should never have brought it up, seriously. I mean…

149
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,000
Nothin' happened, and nothin' ever will happen. I promise.

150
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,640
And I cannot believe you're going to a funeral with a sex injury.

151
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,840
She'd be proud.

152
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
Stop. Stop.

153
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,800
Maeve, there's someone from Wallace on the phone.

154
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,360
Uh… What did they say?

155
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,880
They're asking if you're going back to finish the course.

156
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
Well, tell them I'm busy. I'll call them back.

157
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Cremating my mother today.

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,360
-Hello? -Jackson Marchetti?

159
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,760
-Yeah. -Your test results have come in.

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,400
The doctor would like to see you at four p.m. today.

161
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,520
Uh, okay, I'll… I'll see you then.

162
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,280
See you later on.

163
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,840
What the fuck?

164
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,120
As you know, I am passionate about debunking sex myths on my video channel.

165
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,320
So I was wonderin', is there a sex myth that you would like to debunk?

166
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,680
Uh… let's see. Off the top of my head…

167
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,120
Um…

168
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,120
I guess there's an enduring myth about women who engage in a lot of sex

169
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,920
having loose vulvas.

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
Right, um… Okay, so… Ahem.

171
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
Maybe we try it again, just a little pithier.

172
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,160
So I ask about the sex myth,

173
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,680
and then you come straight in with saggy vaginas.

174
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,400
So, has Celia asked you to help me with my delivery?

175
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,840
No, no, no. Um…

176
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,000
I think she just wants the show to have a bit more of a pace.

177
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,120
Right.

178
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,600
God.

179
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,080
This is so humiliating. I'm being trained by a 17-year-old.

180
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,880
Shit. Sorry, I… I don't mean to tread on your toes.

181
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,160
No. That's all right. It's not your fault.

182
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Well…

183
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,680
I mean, being live on air is very different

184
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,240
than sitting face-to-face to someone in private.

185
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,320
So, maybe you're feelin' a wee bit exposed?

186
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,640
Yeah.

187
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
In truth, I, um… came back to work too soon.

188
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,040
-And… Well, anyway, it doesn't matter. -No, no, no. It… it does. It does matter.

189
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,400
If you would like to share, I'd like to listen.

190
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,800
You know, there's still a feeling that

191
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,720
if a woman gets off the career roller coaster,

192
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,720
that she won't be let back on again.

193
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,680
And it took me quite a while to get on in the first place, so…

194
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,440
Really? I kind of just assumed that you'd been doing this forever.

195
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,080
Well, sure. Um…

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,960
When I was still married, my career was on track, and…

197
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,680
And then, when my husband left, it…

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,200
all just got very difficult.

199
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
There was the grief.

200
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,160
And getting used to being a single parent was… really hard.

201
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Mum?

202
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,120
Anyway, I eventually got stronger.

203
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,840
And I knew that the most important thing was that I was there for Otis.

204
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,800
And so I decided that, well, running my clinic would be enough.

205
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,560
But I've always wanted more.

206
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,760
And so when this… radio job came up,

207
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,560
I didn't… I didn't want it to pass me by.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,440
Yeah. That all makes perfect sense.

209
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,560
But it also sounds quite overwhelming.

210
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
Gosh. How did you get me to talk about all of that?

211
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
I think that tonight is gonna go great. I think you just need to trust yourself.

212
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,200
Hi, team. I'm Samantha, your celebrant.

213
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,200
-Wow. -Ooh.

214
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,000
-Hostess with the mostest. -Hi.

215
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,560
I will be guiding you through your goodbyes.

216
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,560
Ooh. What's happened to your eye?

217
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,480
-She had a se-- -Oh, little accident.

218
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Mmm.

219
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,880
Oh. What a lovely picture of Elaine.

220
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,880
Er… Erin.

221
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
My mum was called Erin.

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Yeah. Apologies.

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,760
Okay, quick checklist.

224
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,200
Photo, tick.

225
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,080
-Do you have your own floral tributes? -Yes, my brother's sorting that out.

226
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
Tick.

227
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,880
-Order of service? -Oh, that was my job.

228
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Tick.

229
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,760
Hmm.

230
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,760
Do you have a track you'd like playing for Erin's entrance?

231
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
Yeah. I do.

232
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,960
Tick.

233
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,320
Oof, I like saying tick.

234
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,200
Tick.

235
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,520
What a great word.

236
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Trippingly on the tongue. Tickety tick. Tick.

237
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
Ai… Aimes.

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,160
Sorry.

239
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,240
Shall I proceed?

240
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,280
Yeah.

241
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,440
Oh.

242
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Nice suit.

243
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,680
Thanks.

244
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,200
-Thanks for lettin' me leave early. -It's fine.

245
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,680
Hey, you're doing really well in classes. The kids are really listening to you.

246
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,440
Maybe you could, uh… teach a class on your own?

247
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,080
Okay, yeah. Sure.

248
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,480
Oh, um… can I just… Your tie's all…

249
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,720
-Oh. -Sorry. Mm…

250
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,000
I mean, I… I couldn't do it. My hands… shake when I'm nervous.

251
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,360
Well, why are you nervous?

252
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,200
Uh… might… might see my ex today.

253
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,200
She your… your first love?

254
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,120
Sh… Yeah.

255
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,200
-Somethin'… somethin' like that. -Oh.

256
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,960
It's been a while, but it still hurts.

257
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,800
Well, I don't think it ever gets easier, but you look great, so…

258
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,400
She's missing out.

259
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
-Oh, my… me dad's here. Better go. -Oh, all right. Cool. See you.

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,760
-Adam. Adam! -Yeah?

261
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,800
You can drive.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay.

263
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,600
Um… we don't normally allow food during the service.

264
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Oh.

265
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,720
I mean, they look delicious.

266
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,320
-May I? -Mmm!

267
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,520
So good.

268
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Mm!

269
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,840
Mmm! Oh, that's so good.

270
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,280
Fuck's sake.

271
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,800
-Sean's not picking up. -I can go get some flowers.

272
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,960
No. I don't really care about the flowers.

273
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,560
-Oh. -Honestly no need for all this.

274
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,520
No one's coming. I told you.

275
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,280
-How's the neck? -Better, I think.

276
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,080
-And how's the old penis? -I don't know what's wrong with it.

277
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,160
I was… I was feeling guilty about staying at Ruby's house,

278
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,960
and couldn't stop thinkin' about it.

279
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,840
Do you think you were trying to make Maeve a little jealous?

280
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,040
-No. -No? Not even a little bit?

281
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,120
I wouldn't have had to stay there if you didn't dump me for your new friends.

282
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,000
Ah! Wh… Hang on. Are you blaming me?

283
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,440
Otis, you literally said you were fine with it!

284
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,480
It's Maeve. Wait.

285
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,480
Hey.

286
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,000
Sean was to be here at 12:00. He's not picking up his phone.

287
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
- I'm sure he'll be there soon. -What is it?

288
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,000
I really need him to be here, Otis.

289
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,040
Uh… we'll find him. Don't worry. Uh, where's he staying?

290
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,080
His mate's.

291
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,360
Dodgy Mo.

292
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,480
Text me the address?

293
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
I'll send it now.

294
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,760
Okay, yeah. Don't worry.

295
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,680
-Okay. -Bye-bye.

296
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,800
Bye.

297
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,920
Where are we going?

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,080
To find someone called Dodgy Mo.

299
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,880
Oh my God, Turtle!

300
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,880
She just smiled. Not a gassy one. Like, an actual smile.

301
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,840
-Has she ever done that before? -No. Hello.

302
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,240
Go on, smile for Mummy. Smile for Mummy.

303
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,440
Oh fuck. Sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

304
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,800
-It's okay. -Come on, darling. Smile for Mummy.

305
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,760
-I think she's hungry. -Oh, okay.

306
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,360
It's okay. I just, um… I've got such a bad headache.

307
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,640
They said this would happen when I started taking the antidepressants.

308
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,280
Do you have any pain meds, Jo?

309
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,640
No, I don't.

310
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,400
Sorry.

311
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,400
Yes. I've been thinking about this childcare.

312
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,400
I mean, maybe I could open a nursery.

313
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,880
You know, like… like one of those fancy ones with baby yoga.

314
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,840
Yeah.

315
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,320
Would you do that before or after you cleared your debt?

316
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,160
Yeah, I, um… I wanted to, uh, talk to you about that, actually, um…

317
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,320
About you maybe loaning me the money. I mean, I… I would pay it all back.

318
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,320
-Obviously. -Um…

319
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,960
That's a lot of money.

320
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
But can we talk about this another time?

321
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,280
I mean, I promise I'll think about it. I just… I have to go to the pharmacy.

322
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,280
Shit. Can you… can you grab me a Mooncup?

323
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,760
And also, some of those fiber powder things. I haven't pooed for days.

324
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,120
-Actually, I'll just come with you. -Great. Okay…

325
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,120
Why are you being so quiet?

326
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
It's hypocritical of you to take the queer night so personally.

327
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,040
-You dump me for Maeve all the time. -Look, Eric!

328
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,520
-Her mum-- -It's not the first time, is it?

329
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,760
No. I hardly ever see you anymore, Eric.

330
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,160
You're always with Abbi and those guys.

331
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,320
Oh!

332
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,320
Hello.

333
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,840
Oh, uh… hi. Hi! Uh, we are looking for Dodgy Mo.

334
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,320
-Not his actual name. -It's his street name.

335
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Dodgy Mo. Yeah, yeah, that's me.

336
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,280
Is Sean staying here?

337
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,640
No. Sean didn't come back last night.

338
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,640
Well, if you see him, could you ask him to call his sister Maeve?

339
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,480
-It's urgent. -Yes.

340
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
-Yeah? -Yeah?

341
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Dodgy Mo.

342
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,480
Hang on a sec.

343
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,920
Uh… Yeah…

344
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,600
These got delivered for Sean.

345
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,800
-Uh… -Sorry.

346
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
I can't have them in the house 'cause of me allergies, so…

347
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,240
-Oh. -If you take 'em?

348
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,080
You'll probably see him before me, so…

349
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,800
-Of course. Mm-hmm. -Of course.

350
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,560
-Thanks. -Mmm. Uh… Yeah.

351
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
Um…

352
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,400
So, I don't get it.

353
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,520
-You don't want me to have other friends? -No!

354
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,640
-Or what? -I dunno.

355
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,280
I just sometimes feel like you'd rather hang out with the cool kids.

356
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,480
I'm getting left behind.

357
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,760
I wouldn't rather hang out with those other guys, Oatcake.

358
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,240
But sometimes we have more in common.

359
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,920
Can you tell me one thing that's been goin' on in my life?

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,240
Uh… You going back to church?

361
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,840
No, I'm not, actually!

362
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,080
I'm having an existential crisis about it, but you wouldn't know that.

363
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,480
-You don't care if it's not about you. -What?

364
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,560
That's… Uh… No! That's… that is so unfair.

365
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,920
How is it unfair?

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
-Go on. -Uh…

367
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,400
-Whoa. Wow. Wow! -Whoa!

368
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,080
-Oh my gosh! -Whoa!

369
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,560
I can't stop. I can't stop! Eric, help!

370
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,800
Oatcake! Oh my gosh!

371
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,040
-Ah! -Ow!

372
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,040
-Ow! Oh… Ow! -Oatcake!

373
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,000
-Oh my gosh. Are you okay? -Aah! I'll just--

374
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,760
-Give me your hand. -There's pine in my eye.

375
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,200
-Give me your hand! -Oh, yeah…

376
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,920
Here!

377
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,880
-Oh my gosh. -Ow! There's something in my eye.

378
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,520
-Are you okay? Let me see your eye. Let-- -I'm fine.

379
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
Fucking neck brace!

380
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,480
The flowers! Oh!

381
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,600
-They're gonna be okay. -What are we gonna do?

382
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,320
-It's going to be okay. Yes. -Eric, put them back in the holes.

383
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
No. No, Oatcake.

384
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,520
Carnations on the outside. Roses on the inside.

385
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,040
Follow the color code.

386
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,400
We have stuff in common as well, right?

387
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,120
Of course we do.

388
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,880
I'm just trying to say that there's… there's parts of my life

389
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,920
-that you don't really understand. -Like what?

390
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,160
Well, like the fact that I'm a Christian.

391
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,560
Or the fact that my family doesn't have as much money as yours.

392
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,600
Or we don't talk about race, for example.

393
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,040
Look, I'm just… I guess I'm just trying to say that we're very different,

394
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,520
and we don't talk about it.

395
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,160
-Okay. Why are you blaming me for that? -I'm not blaming you.

396
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm just trying to say how I feel.

397
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,480
Okay. Well, um… we're gonna be late.

398
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,120
We should just get this sorted and…

399
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,920
Great.

400
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Constable.

401
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,760
Famous for his landscapes, mainly of the Suffolk countryside,

402
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,400
which sounds boring, but in his hands,

403
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,280
these luscious landscapes pulsate with drama.

404
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,360
Festering riverbanks, crumbling brickwork, slimy bridges,

405
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,720
living, breathing, moving trees.

406
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,440
He loved willows.

407
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,440
He was drawn to their sloping frames,

408
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,160
their branches plunging deep into undulating water.

409
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,680
-You feel the moist air of the mornings. -Yeah.

410
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,120
He painted another form for feeling.

411
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,040
Yes?

412
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
May I use the bathroom?

413
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,120
Yes. Sorry. Of course you can.

414
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,320
Where was I? Oh, yes.

415
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,360
Constable's unrecognized genius.

416
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,600
This visceral living, moving…

417
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,120
Can I touch you?

418
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
Ooh…

419
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm sorry. I'm on T, so I thought I wouldn't get my period.

420
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,280
Don't worry. I don't mind.

421
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,040
Are you all right?

422
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,760
Yeah.

423
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,280
Um…

424
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,440
I think I just, uh… I think I need a second.

425
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,560
Pick up. Pick up the phone, you dick.

426
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,880
Fuck's sake.

427
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,520
-Oh my God. -Hey.

428
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Hi.

429
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,920
-Oh-- -We couldn't find him.

430
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
The flowers, they sort of broke in the middle a little bit. Sorry.

431
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,960
Are you okay?

432
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,680
Yeah. Just wish Sean would pick up the fucking phone.

433
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,080
It's almost time to start.

434
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,600
Are you waiting on… some people?

435
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,520
Uh, no, this is… this is everyone.

436
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,960
Shall we just get it over with?

437
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,920
-Yeah. -Well, actually…

438
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,760
Wait. Wait, wait. A flower.

439
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,960
What… what are they doing here?

440
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,560
You worried about your mum being alone, so I invited them.

441
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,280
I hope I didn't do the wrong thing.

442
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,640
It's a really nice thing to do. Thanks, Aimes.

443
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,720
Oh, good. I wondered who was gonna carry the coffin.

444
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Come on.

445
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,760
Oh, yeah.

446
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,040
Come on.

447
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,720
-Hi. -Thanks for coming.

448
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,400
Hi.

449
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,560
It was my mum's favorite.

450
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,480
I love this song.

451
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,680
Okay, uh… to me.

452
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,560
-Uh, yeah. Yeah. -Pivot. Pivot.

453
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
Okay. Okay.

454
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,720
Please be upstanding, for those who can.

455
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,680
That means you.

456
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,840
♪ See the stone set in your eyes ♪

457
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,000
♪ See the thorn twist in your side… ♪

458
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,160
♪ I… for… ♪

459
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
Oh.

460
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,040
Sorry, the… the Wi-Fi is…

461
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
Shall… shall we go back?

462
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,560
-Shall we… shall we start again? -No, keep going.

463
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,600
-Uh, back it up a bit? -Adam.

464
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,400
-Otis, keep going. -Adam, wh…

465
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,960
-Ah! -Sorry.

466
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,920
-Sh. -Come…

467
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,800
-Just go. Just go. -My toe.

468
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,000
Come on.

469
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,000
-Whoa! -Oh!

470
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,000
-Jesus. Jackson! -Oh my gosh.

471
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,880
-Shit. Sorry, sorry. -Steady. Steady.

472
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,320
Okay, slowly.

473
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,160
-Just squeeze round… -Going round, are we? Okay. Right.

474
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,360
-Easy. Straighten her up. -Guys, it's wonky. Straighten.

475
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,680
-Fingers. Hold on. -There.

476
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,120
Welcome, everyone, and apologies for that little musical hiccup,

477
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,160
but I'm sure Erin's singing her favorite song wherever she is.

478
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,440
Hopefully.

479
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,400
My name is Samantha.

480
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,840
I'm your celebrant today.

481
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,320
And we are gathered here so that Erin Willy can continue--

482
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Wiley. Erin… Erin Wiley.

483
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,800
-Wiley? -Yep.

484
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,920
It reads like Willy on the page.

485
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It quite clearly reads like Wiley.

486
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,160
Mm-mm.

487
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,640
…so that Erin Wiley

488
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,600
can continue to live on in our memories.

489
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Erin was born in Moordale,

490
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,720
and she is survived by two children.

491
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,720
Three.

492
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,480
Three children.

493
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,160
Maeve, Sean, and Elsie…

494
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,360
…who were the light of her life.

495
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,040
Being a single mum had its challenges.

496
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,320
But she was the kind of woman

497
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,840
who rose to the occasion with energy and enthusiasm.

498
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,360
What are you doing?

499
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,480
Sorry I'm late.

500
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Welcome.

501
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,560
Ahem. Erin had a vibrant spirit…

502
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,000
-Who are these people? -I've been calling you for hours.

503
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,280
She enjoyed listening to music, talking to friends.

504
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,600
And, you know,

505
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,520
I think we can all take comfort

506
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,200
in the idea that there is a particularly bright

507
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,280
new star in the sky tonight.

508
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,240
This is great.

509
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,880
This is… fab. It really…

510
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,240
-I mean… I mean, it's complete crap. -Shut up.

511
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,240
But it is beautifully… beautifully crafted.

512
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,480
-Thank you. -Stop it.

513
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,560
-I actually think I might add to it. -No. No, no, no. Sean.

514
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,720
If you don't mind if I say a few words…

515
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,040
-Thank you. -Please don't.

516
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,040
-About my mother. -Sean.

517
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,320
My darling mummy

518
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,960
died doing what she loved.

519
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,400
Drugs.

520
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,680
Oh, come on. We weren't all buying that "she's a bright star in the sky" stuff.

521
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,160
Were we?

522
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,160
No, I think it would actually be much more appropriate

523
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,360
if I, as her son,

524
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,680
shared a few stories of Erin from our childhood.

525
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,360
Should I tell them about the games we used to play?

526
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,520
Shall I? Number one. Ahem. Football in the dark.

527
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,760
This was a good one, where Mum would kick us out of our caravan

528
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,200
in the middle of the night,

529
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,600
so that she could get high and then screw some guy called Greg.

530
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,120
Then, there was, of course, "ciggie hunting" or "hunt the cigarette,"

531
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,480
which is when we used to go to the park

532
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,440
and had to get on our hands and knees and search in the mud for cigarette butts

533
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,240
that were just long enough for Mum to smoke 'cause we had run out of money.

534
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,160
And then… I've got loads of these. I can keep going.

535
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,720
-There was my favorite-- -Stop it, Sean. That's enough.

536
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,600
You're humiliating yourself.

537
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,960
Come off it, sis.

538
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,120
As if a fancy dress and a nice photo is gonna convince anyone in this room

539
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,800
that our mum was nothing but a dirty junkie.

540
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,760
Get out.

541
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,800
Get out!

542
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,600
Fine. With pleasure.

543
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,560
Bye, Mum.

544
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,120
I think we shall just take a little break.

545
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,240
Sean.

546
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,440
Sean, stop running away from me.

547
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,040
-Why do you have to be so selfish? -Because I can't be fake like you.

548
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,280
-I'm trying to give her a nice send-off. -It's not fair.

549
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,560
-What's not fair? -You're gonna get out of this place.

550
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,880
But I'm gonna die alone, just like Mum.

551
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,720
You can get yourself clean, Sean.

552
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,240
Well, it doesn't really matter anyway

553
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,040
because you're gonna go back to your fancy little life in America

554
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,560
and forget I exist.

555
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
I'm leaving.

556
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,800
Sean, don't do this. We're saying goodbye to Mum.

557
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,800
She didn't care about saying goodbye to us, did she?

558
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,200
Oh…

559
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,840
Customer announcement. All tropical fish now half price.

560
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,120
This koala thing is so great.

561
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,240
Look, she's already asleep.

562
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,960
Hmm.

563
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Oh shit.

564
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,520
-What are you doing? -I'm hiding.

565
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,320
-From who? -From him.

566
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,080
Oh my God, that's Dan! Shit.

567
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,880
He must've really had a motorbike accident.

568
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,560
-How do you know Dan? -What are you doing?

569
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,840
How do you know Dan?

570
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,400
That's the guy that I've been seeing.

571
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,240
Fuck! Agh!

572
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,960
Fucking hell.

573
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,760
What?

574
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,160
That's Joy's dad.

575
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,880
-What, so you and Dan? -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

576
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,640
Well, how sure are you about the whole dad thing?

577
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,960
-Well, 95% sure. -For fuck's sake!

578
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,000
-You haven't slept with him, have you? -No.

579
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,040
I actually really quite like him.

580
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,800
You know you can't see him anymore, right?

581
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,040
Yes. Course.

582
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,440
-Shit. -Fucking typical.

583
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,560
Oh. You're home early.

584
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
You okay?

585
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,880
I don't really wanna talk about it right now.

586
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
If that's all right.

587
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,040
Okay.

588
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Mmm.

589
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,160
Can we have some cake?

590
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,160
-Do you think she's okay? -Hope so.

591
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,800
-Hey, kids. -Hi.

592
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,760
Um, just so you know,

593
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,760
um, I have another funeral this afternoon.

594
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,200
So…

595
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
Um…

596
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,800
-Okay. -Yeah.

597
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,840
Mm-hmm.

598
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,680
-I'm gonna look for her. -Okay.

599
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,600
It's all right.

600
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,360
-How have you been? -Good.

601
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,400
Good.

602
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,040
Hmm.

603
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm…

604
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,280
working with horses now.

605
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,320
Are you?

606
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,520
Mmm.

607
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,480
Did you, um…

608
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,640
did you ever tell your parents?

609
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,960
Yeah, uh… I have.

610
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,560
They were pretty good about it.

611
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,360
That's amazing, Adam. That's… that's huge.

612
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,640
I'm so proud of you, genuinely.

613
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,360
I'm still findin' it really hard…

614
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,280
-Mmm? -Uh… to be…

615
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,560
-To be fully out. -Mmm.

616
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,080
When did you stop feeling ashamed?

617
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,200
Oh… it's a… it's a long road.

618
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,560
Hmm.

619
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,760
But, Adam, you… you have to believe that you deserve good things.

620
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,000
And, Adam, you have to love yourself.

621
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,720
Mm-hmm.

622
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,680
I know that we weren't… right together.

623
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
But I do really miss you.

624
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,920
You're completely… "effercrescent."

625
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,520
Uh… Did you… Sorry, um… do you mean effervescent?

626
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,200
-Uh… yes, I did. -Yeah.

627
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,680
Yes, I did.

628
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,000
Colin… Colin, no.

629
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,120
What?

630
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,040
I can't find her.

631
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,560
What should we do? Should we tell everyone to go home?

632
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,280
No. She'll be back. I think.

633
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,320
Okay.

634
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,320
She keeps tappin' her watch at me.

635
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,120
Found you.

636
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,760
Do you think if I die of embarrassment, I might get a discount?

637
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,920
I can check the brochure, but I doubt it.

638
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,040
I didn't need an audience in there.

639
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,920
Aimee was just trying to help, you know.

640
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,000
Your brother's in pain.

641
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,480
She wasn't all bad.

642
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,920
Of course she wasn't. No one's all bad.

643
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,760
Look, this is fucking awful.

644
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,440
And most people here won't understand this dysfunctional family shit.

645
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,240
But even though it's hard, you wanted to honor Erin,

646
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,080
and that's something to be incredibly proud of.

647
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,960
So get back in there and tell them about your mum.

648
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,280
Okay.

649
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,640
-All right? -Yeah.

650
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,520
Um… Okay, folks, the break's over.

651
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,640
We now have the eulogy, which is going to be read by Erin's daughter, Maeve.

652
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Okay.

653
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,840
Sorry.

654
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,320
All that stuff my brother said is true.

655
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,520
My mum was an addict.

656
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,600
She also helped set up my first business when I was eight years old,

657
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,120
washing people's cars.

658
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,480
She taught me how to pick out returning customers

659
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,760
and how to make good tips.

660
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,600
She loved to sing, even though she sang terribly

661
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,400
and could never get the lyrics right.

662
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,280
And…

663
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,480
we never went hungry,

664
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,360
which was no mean feat.

665
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,560
Even when she was high, she would make these, um…

666
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,200
stupid pancakes for us,

667
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,320
with chocolate smiley faces.

668
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,360
Pretty good.

669
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,160
And, yeah, I think…

670
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,200
Sorry.

671
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah.

672
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,320
Uh… I think what I'm trying to say is that

673
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,800
a mother can be a pretty shit parent sometimes,

674
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,960
and you can still love them and want them to get better.

675
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,440
And someone can be an addict and still be generous and kind.

676
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,200
Mmm, I really hate her for everything she put me through, but…

677
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,800
I also miss her… with every cell of my being.

678
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,200
Okay.

679
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,320
So as our ceremony comes to a close,

680
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,360
and we all go back to our daily lives,

681
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,680
I hope you've gained some comfort

682
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,760
from us all being together today.

683
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,480
Thank you.

684
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
Do you know it?

685
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
Yeah.

686
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,720
Do you think… you…

687
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,800
-I think. -Mmm.

688
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,600
-Okay. -Yeah.

689
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,600
Who's that?

690
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,840

Whoo!

723
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,440
Hey.

724
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,080
What's going on?

725
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,840
I just had--

726
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,120
Just wanted to check everything was all right.

727
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,320
Yeah, everything's fine.

728
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,440
Um… I'll be there in a minute. Thank you.

729
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah. Sure.

730
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,080
What?

731
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,920
I don't know, man.

732
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,000
-I just think he's a bit weird. -What, Beau?

733
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,600
What are you sayin'?

734
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,040
He's super intense, no?

735
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,520
-Why you gettin' jealous? -I'm not being jealous.

736
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,160
I'm just worried that it's movin' so fast.

737
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,560
-Okay. Well, Jackson, he's my boyfriend. -Yeah.

738
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,080
And I know you're going through a tough time at the moment, but I'm happy.

739
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,640
-All right. If you're sure. -We good?

740
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,640
-Yeah. -Right, see you in there.

741
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,840
-It was good to see you, man. -You too.

742
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,560
Take care, yeah?

743
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,120
I'll have one after, yeah.

744
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,640
-Hey. -Hey.

745
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,040
Aww.

746
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,080
You all right, mate?

747
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,360
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

748
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Was just, um… just getting Viv's stuff for her.

749
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,520
Hmm.

750
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,000
'Scuse me.

751
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,240
Hi, Jeffrey. Thanks for coming.

752
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,560
Cynthia's sorry she's not here.

753
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,360
Funerals remind her of Jonathan.

754
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,720
Ah. Oh, of course, yeah.

755
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,400
Your mum could be a bit of an arse, but it's sad she died.

756
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,120
And what you said up there was…

757
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,680
was… was lovely.

758
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,240
Thanks, Jeffrey.

759
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,640
Hey.

760
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,160
Hi. Thanks for coming.

761
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,120
Maeve, I'm so sorry.

762
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,280
How are you both?

763
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,760
-Yeah, good. Um… -Good, yeah.

764
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,240
I'm still teaching, and Emily's gone back to university.

765
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,640
-Wow. -Yeah,

766
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,080
I… I'm doing, um… a master's in literature.

767
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,160
Yeah. Uh… You actually inspired me.

768
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,960
-Really? -Getting to study at Wallace.

769
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,240
-It must be amazing. -Yeah, hotshot.

770
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,000
-Yeah. -It's pretty incredible.

771
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,920
I bet you're doing so well. Top of your class in everything?

772
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
Anyway, uh…

773
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,240
I am just so unbelievably proud of you.

774
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,560
Teaching you and watching you thrive

775
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,600
when you've had so much working against you

776
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,160
has been one of the greatest privileges of my career.

777
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,680
Oh…

778
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,520
Thank you.

779
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,600
Thank you.

780
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,600
-Get home safe. Enjoy the cupcakes. -Yeah. Oh, we will.

781
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,360
-Sorry he took two. -Aimee Gibbs special.

782
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,280
Okay.

783
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,600
Bye, Maeve.

784
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,200
I'm so sorry for your loss.

785
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,760
Thanks. Enjoy the cupcakes.

786
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,200
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

787
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,640
Hey.

788
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,680
Are we okay?

789
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,840
Because I don't feel like we need to fight. Can we just move on?

790
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,080
Yeah, I don't know.

791
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,040
I don't know.

792
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,520
I just… I don't feel like you really heard what I've said.

793
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,520
Well, I… I don't feel like you've heard what I've said.

794
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,120
Okay. Uh…

795
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,680
Maybe we need some time apart from each other.

796
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,240
Yeah.

797
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,640
Yeah, maybe.

798
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,120
Cool. Cool.

799
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,040
I'll… see you around.

800
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,760
How are you doing?

801
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,360
Yeah.

802
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,160
I know I fucked up.

803
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,120
Okay, I'm… I am really sorry.

804
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,080
I think I was just missing you a lot, and I wanted to feel important,

805
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,320
which is pathetic,

806
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,360
and I'd hate for this to be the reason that things didn't work out with us, so…

807
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,760
Nothing happened?

808
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,960
No.

809
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,840
Promise?

810
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,880
I promise.

811
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,840
Do you wanna walk me home?

812
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,520
Sure.

00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,560

838
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah!

839
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,960
-Adam. -Hey, Dad.

840
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,880
That funeral made me feel… a bit weird,

841
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,320
and I was thinking that

842
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,200
maybe we could hang out.

843
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,760
Ye… yeah, sure.

844
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,400
Mm-hmm.

845
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,880
Your shirt's on a bit odd.

846
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,280
-Um -Oh. Oh.

847
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,960
Are… are you with that lady? Sorry. Leave you to it.

848
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,480
What's Mum's coat doin' here?

849
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,000
Mum? Mum?

850
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,360
-Mum, are you in there? -No, no, she's not.

851
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,920
Adam. Um… I… I was just…

852
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,760
-I… I just dropped by to get… something. -Uh… Yeah.

853
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,800
Adam. Adam. Please, Adam…

854
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,680
How can we help you today, Nicky?

855
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,840
My, um… my teenager is non-binary,

856
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,120
and, uh, when they turned 18,

857
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,200
they went to a private doctor and… and started taking testosterone.

858
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,040
And… and now, I think they want top surgery.

859
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,920
And I want to understand, so I can support them,

860
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,080
but they just won't talk to me.

861
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,200
Have you had an open dialogue with your child in the past?

862
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,120
Yeah, I… I didn't react so well when they first came out.

863
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,400
-I felt out of control. -Ah.

864
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,520
Well, it sounds like there's been a breakdown in the trust between you.

865
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,200
And that can take time to rebuild.

866
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,920
As a parent, I know it can be hard

867
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,880
to feel like you're being shut out.

868
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,000
But if you educate yourself about what's going on for your child,

869
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,760
then that could be hugely helpful.

870
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,080
I think you need to show that you're serious

871
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,480
about going on this journey with them

872
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,840
and that they don't need to keep explaining themselves to you.

873
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,040
It's really important.

874
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,520
Letting them know that you love them for who they are.

875
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,320
And look, teenagers are always gonna have stuff that they don't tell their parents.

876
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,520
But it's important to create an environment

877
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,720
where they feel safe enough to bring things to you if they need to.

878
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,400
If you just try and stay open and curious and compassionate,

879
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,320
then I don't think you can go far wrong.

880
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,600
Thanks. That… that helps a lot.

881
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,640
Your results are just loading.

882
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,360
The tests are clear, Mr. Marchetti.

883
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,600

Our final call this evening is Ruby.

900
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,680
Hello, Ruby. What can we do for you today?

901
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,680
I have a question for O.

902
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,200
I just wanted to know what it feels like

903
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,520
to pretend to be so nice and kind and compassionate and helpful

904
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,680
when really you're just a bully.

905
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,560
I am so sorry, Ruby.

906
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,600
I have absolutely no idea what you're referring to.

907
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,560
Yes, you do.

908
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,400
And so will everyone else after they see the video I've just tagged you in.

909
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,520
No. No. Next… next… next caller.

910
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,800
Uh, sorry about that, everyone.

911
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,360
So, we've got, um… Right. Okay.

912
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,320
Um, next call is from Rob. Hello, Rob. What can I do to you… for you?

913
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,280
Bed wetter!

914
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,760

917
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,400
Who was that?

918
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,640
Ellen.

919
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,120
She's asking when I'm back.

920
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,200
When are you going back?

921
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,440
I don't know.

922
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,360
I actually think I might stay here.

923
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,520
What about your course?

924
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,080
I just think I need some stability.

925
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,920
-You said you loved being at Wallace. -Yeah, but I missed you.

926
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,160
I missed you too.

927
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,480
You might not get another chance like that.

928
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,480
I wanna make sure you're doing the right thing.

929
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,280
Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I just wanna be here with you.

930
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,160
Shall we try again?

931
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,640
Mum?

932
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,400
Mum, are you okay?

933
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,920
I made you some toast.

934
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,000
Otis. Otis. Otis?

935
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,160
Otis, are you okay?

936
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,600
-Otis. -Okay, stop.

937
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,280
I don't know what's wrong with me.

938
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,560
I keep thinking about my mum.

939
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,760
-You keep thinking about your mum? -Yeah… No.

940
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,960
I mean, not… not in a sort of weird, creepy sexy way.

941
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,640
-Why are you thinking about your mum? -I don't know.

942
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,360
I… I used to have these problems with sex, and…

943
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,720
I thought I… was over them and…

944
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,720
Now I'm just really embarrassed, and I wanna die, and…

945
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,600
I don't wanna die. Your mum just died. I keep talking about mums.

946
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,000
Okay. Okay. Shush, please. It's fine.

947
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,800
We don't have to do anything.

948
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,480
Just lie down. Come on.

949
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,680
It's been a weird day.

950
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,640
Yeah.

951
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,400
