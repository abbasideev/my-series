37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
Morning.

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
-Morning, darling. -Hello, Joy.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
You are making a noise this morning.

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,400
Hello, hello. What's up?

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,600
Bwaaaaah!

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
Yes, you are.

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,880
Waaaah!

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,560
Come on. Oh, what's the matter?

45
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,880
Hey, Mum.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,800
-You all right? -I forgot why I opened the fridge.

47
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,240
You're… dressed. You going somewhere today?

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
I didn't tell you? I've got a job interview.

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,720
It's to host a new radio show about sex.

50
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Well, do you think it's a good idea?

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,480
-To be going back to work? -Oh…

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,920
Oh, it's just cabbage leaves. It's all right.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,920
I, uh…

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,320
I've got a blocked duct.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,440
-They help. -Okay, well…

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
I just think it might be a bit soon.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,200
I had a baby, darling. Not a lobotomy.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,400
-. -My agent thinks it's a good opportunity.

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,320
Coffee.

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,160
Right.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Oh, bollocks.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,320
Do you mind popping to the shop with Joy while I'm gone and picking some up?

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,480
Maybe some… wet wipes, and… I'll send you a list.

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,200
Well, actually, Mum, it's my first day at the new school, remember?

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,560
-What, today? -Uh-huh.

66
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,400
-I totally forgot. -Yeah, I should get going.

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,240
But if you need me to stay…

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
No, we'll be fine. Don't be silly.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
We'll be fine! I'm fine!

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
We'll be fine.

71
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,840
-Bye. -Bye. Don't worry.

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,000
Fuck!

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,000
-Morning. -Good morning.

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,040
Wow, that's a new one.

75
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,760
-You look amazing. -Thank you… look tired.

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,680
What were you up all night doin'?

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,200
Hey. Heeeey!

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,520
-Uh-huh! -Uh-huh!

79
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,040
-Uh-huh! -Uh-heeeey!

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
Very profesh.

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,920
-So it's my new free… -Uh-huh.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,360
…totally transparent sex therapy clinic.

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,000
-Ah! -You were right.

84
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,560
I don't wanna give up helping people.

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,080
And I know it sounds silly, but I think therapy is my calling.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
Oh-ho-ho!

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,880
-Oh, I'm so proud of you. -Thanks, man.

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,720
Aww! Come on.

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,440
-I am shitting myself. -Why?

90
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,880
Well, what if people think that we're losers again?

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
We're not.

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,360
We're literally different people now. We're confident. We know who we are.

93
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
-Mmm. -We're the cool guys.

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
Mmm.

95
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,640
Oh.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,960
This is my voice six months on testosterone.

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,760
List of pros. My eyebrows are bushier.

98
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,520
I have some facial hair coming in, which feels amazing.

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Shoulders getting broader.

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,320
Cons. Still sweating a lot and have some dry skin patches.

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,160

Ooh!

111
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,560
Aah!

112
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,440
We might…

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
need to start gettin'…

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,160
the bus.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,560
So I was texting Maeve.

116
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
-She sent me a nude. -What?

117
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,680
Oatcake! Oh my God! That's huge!

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,800
-I haven't responded yet. -Are you mad?

119
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,200
-Stop yelling! -No! You have to send one back.

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,640
-There's sexting etiquette! -Yeah--

121
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,360
-You can't leave her hanging. -Okay! I know! I know! I've…

122
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,800
I took a load of pictures.

123
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,520
And I just didn't send any. I hated them.

124
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,760
-I don't like nudes. I… I feel anxious… -Oh my God. I don't get it.

125
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
I send dick pics all the time. No big deal.

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,440
Who are you sending them to?

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,600
Oh, I've been on a couple of dating apps!

128
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,520
But all the hot, interesting people live so far away.

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,120
But there's this gay night at the Labour Club.

130
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,680
-You wanna come? Be my wingman? -Sure.

131
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,440
-Yay! -Yeah, I will come.

132
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
But what should I wear?

133
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
Um, preferably something without baby sick.

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,040
Do I have b-- Ugh! Why didn't you say anything?

135
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,960
-Because it's very funny. -No, it's not!

136
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,920
It's dripping down my back!

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,040
-Wow! -Wow!

138
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,040
Oh my God!

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,520
-Hmm! -Aha!

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
-Hah! -A-hey!

141
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,720
Heh!

142
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,480
-It's like Amsterdam. -But in space.

143
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
And everyone seems happy.

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,720
-Hi. -Hi.

145
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,880
And queer.

146
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
No stopping in the bike lane.

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,400
Super queer.

148
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,280
-"No stopping in the bike lane." -"Wah wah wah!"

149
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Come on!

150
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
-Oh my God, Aimee! -Hey!

151
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
Hiya, crumpets.

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,320
-I haven't seen you in… -Oh my gosh!

153
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,880
This is a no-car zone.

154
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,440
-Where am I supposed to park, then? -There's a car park across the road.

155
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,760
Um…

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,160
-Uh, she was rude. -Yes!

157
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Are you okay?

158
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
-Yes. Yeah. -Yeah?

159
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,240
I mean, thank you for saving my life!

160
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
-I'll see you around. -Bye.

161
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,080
Well. Ruby's back.

162
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,440
Aah.

163
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,240
I wonder where Anwar and Olivia are. They usually move as a pack.

164
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,600
I think they went to Taylor's Secondary in Northbury.

165
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,800
Oh.

166
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
-Don't you usually have a car? -Yeah, I do.

167
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,400
I let a family of squirrels live in it, and now it's having loads of repairs.

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
Shall we?

169
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,800
The time has come.

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,040
-Come on, Eric. -I know.

171
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,920
-Gonna be late. -I'm coming.

172
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,040
-Whoo! -Well, this is different.

173
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,360
Oh my God! Is that a slide?

174
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Wow!

175
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,280
This is kind of cool.

176
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,840
-Apparently, it's all student-led. -Yes!

177
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
Look at that!

178
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,680
-Right. I could say that… -Yeah.

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
Have you played before?

180
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,320
My God. And all the gays, everywhere.

181
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,640
Starting a new school in the middle of the year is statistically very bad.

182
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,920
That's why me and Eugene called things off.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,520
We need to focus and stay serious about the future.

184
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
Can I have all the Moordale students over here, please?

185
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,160
-Okay. Hello, everyone. -Car park's miles away.

186
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,200
-Can't do that every day. Not in heels. -Sh, sh. Don't interrupt the Coven.

187
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,160
Hello. Welcome to Cavendish College. My name is Abbi.

188
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,640
This is Aisha and my boyfriend, Roman.

189
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
And we're your sixth form reps.

190
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,080
We have got some tablets to hand out to you all.

191
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,840
Ooh, that's a bit fancy.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,960
You will find your schedule, uh, on our social media platform, Dolly.

193
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,800
It doesn't look like I'm in the top sets. How do you rank your students?

194
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,120
We don't.

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,480
We believe if one person does well, then we all do well.

196
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,280
-Aww! -We have mock exams.

197
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,400
That makes zero sense.

198
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,160
-Why don't we talk about it later? -But it doesn't make sense.

199
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,160
Anyway, grab your Cavendish tote bags and your reusable water bottles.

200
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,720
Then I'll take you on a little tour. Follow me!

201
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,840
There's daily meditation, silent discos,

202
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,400
sound baths, and yoga on offer

203
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,720
'cause we believe your mental health matters.

204
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,120
Oh, and Cavendish is a gossip-free zone.

205
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,560
Talking behind each other's backs is not a healthy learning environment.

206
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,800
We encourage students

207
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,960
to help with cleaning, gardening, and community fundraising.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,360
Our motto is, "Why be mean when you could be green?"

209
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,480
Christ.

210
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,760
Our facilities are obviously gender-neutral.

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,600
We just want everyone to feel comfortable in themselves.

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,760
Awake, and see that people are sleeping.

213
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,880
It's time to bang your drum

214
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,080
and make them open their eyes.

215
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,920
Speakers' Corner is here for students to express themselves freely at any time.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,880
Your voice matters to Cavendish, and we wanna hear from you.

217
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,400
Does anyone have any questions?

218
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,680
Hi. Yeah. Um, I want to set up a service on campus. Who should I speak with?

219
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,600
No one. I suggest booking a room and making it happen.

220
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,160
-I'm Otis. -And I'm Eric.

221
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm doing a free sex therapy service on campus.

222
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,080
-Free sex therapy today. -Lunchtime. Please pop down.

223
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
-Free sex therapy. -One for you…

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,280
-Complete confidentiality. No? -Just keep it. Just keep it.

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,560
Erectile dysfunction? No?

226
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,680
-This guy is the walking Kama Sutra. -Hello.

227
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,640
If you have discharge, vaginismus…

228
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,280
Oh, look. It's my favorite person. And the sparkly Pied Piper.

229
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,960
-Aww! -What are you doing here, Isaac?

230
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
I started last term. Finishing my A-levels.

231
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,720
You should check out Otis's clinic.

232
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,520
It's completely free. On the first floor.

233
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,920
With all due respect, I won't be talking to you about my penis.

234
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,520
-Fine. -The school's paperless, by the way.

235
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,120
Sh…

236
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,760
-No! No, no, no! -Yes! Yes!

237
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,680
That's my whole promotional plan!

238
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,120
Otis, we cannot be seen as tree killers.

239
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,360
Please remember to recycle.

240
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,400
-Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so-- -No worries. No worries.

241
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
Do you need help settin' up at your clinic today?

242
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
No, I should be fine.

243
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,960
They prefer it sort of one-on-one.

244
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,320
-Keeps it anonymous. -Mmm.

245
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,240
-You gonna be okay on your own? -Yeah! Yeah, course.

246
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,320
-I'll see you later. Mmm! -Cool.

247
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,720
Oh, remember to reply to Maeve. It'll be awkward if you don't.

248
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,760
-I know. -Just send her your dick.

249
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,640
-Shut up. -Just send it. Root to tip.

250
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
-Get in the toilet. -Shut up.

251
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,760
-Have a little rub. Okay? -Eric!

252
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,160
Oh God! Sorry.

253
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,240
Oh, for fuck's sake!

254
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,520
-That didn't sound good. Are we stuck? -Yep.

255
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,120
They've got enough money for a meditation room,

256
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,880
but not for a lift that works.

257
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,240
I've complained so many times.

258
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,640
You don't remember me, do you?

259
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,720
Isaac.

260
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
Maeve's sort of ex.

261
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,480
Isaac!

262
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,160
Oh!

263
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,600
Sorry. I'm good with names, not faces.

264
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,600
-What class are you off to? -Art.

265
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
-Same. -I switched from history.

266
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,280
I've never done art, but I'm reading this book

267
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,560
that says art can help process trauma, and I'm on a healing journey, so…

268
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,880
Oh, is that why you do art?

269
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,440
To process trauma? 'Cause you're disabled.

270
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,360
Yes, I'm looking to find catharsis

271
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,520
from the daily emotional torture of being in a wheelchair

272
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,960
through the magical outlet of painting.

273
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,880
Really?

274
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
So, it helps?

275
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,720
I don't need anything to help,

276
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,760
because I'm actually very happy with my life.

277
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,800
I do art because I like painting.

278
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,120
But thank you very much for your ableist projection.

279
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,280
Did I just say the wrong thing?

280
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,320
Kind of wish I'd taken the stairs.

281
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,560
Me too.

282
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
-Yeah. -Colorful.

283
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,560
Headmaster Groff!

285
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,040
Sor… Um…

286
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,640
You just…

287
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,560
uh… scared me.

288
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,680
"Mr. Groff" is fine.

289
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm substitute teaching now. It's my first day.

290
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,240
Oh.

291
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,280
Did Adam start today as well?

292
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,440
I don't know.

293
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,160
Um, we're… we're not really friends anymore.

294
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,680
Right.

295
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,240
Very good.

296
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,640
I'm still debating…

297
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,320
-Oh yeah. -I really want…

298
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,720
-Uh, do you want… -Uh… just…

299
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,880
-Take a… -Seat.

300
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
-Mm-hmm. -Uh, yeah.

301
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,680
All right, maybe, maybe.

302
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,680
Hi.

303
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,640
Hey.

304
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,760
Let's take the register…

305
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,400
We sign in with Dolly, sir.

306
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
Is that the school receptionist?

307
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
No, it's this…

308
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Um… Mmm. Uh…

309
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,320
I assume you're all familiar with algebra.

310
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,200
-And algebraic equations-- -Sir.

311
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,840
-Huh? -It's a projector screen.

312
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,320
Ohh…

313
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,920
Ahem.

314
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,960
So, um, you will need to be able to expand

315
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,680
productions of algebraic expressions

316
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,440
and factorize quadratic expressions.

317
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Excuse me, sir. My tablet isn't working.

318
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,680
Can we just wait a second? I really don't wanna get behind.

319
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,720
Um, I'll take notes for you.

320
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,320
Thanks.

321
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,080
It's fine.

322
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,560
So I thought it would be a good idea to do a refresher on completing the square.

323
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,160
Like, I am a huge fan.

324
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,760
He's a visionary.

325
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,320
I just can't believe he wrote this when he was 25.

326
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,600
He's a mad genius.

327
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,880
I heard his last intern got selected for the Growcott Prize.

328
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,920
-What intern? -Oh, Maeve. You're so naive sometimes.

329
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,840
Every year he chooses someone to be his intern.

330
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,840
He mentors them, and they almost always get published.

331
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,960
We all know Tyrone's gonna get it.

332
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,960
Hey, what about me?

333
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
So…

334
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,880
How many of you wanna be writers?

335
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,480
How many of you are thinking about writing your novel already?

336
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,240
Okay. So here are some home truths.

337
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,920
Only a handful of you will be talented enough to write well,

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,480
and even fewer of you will write anything that will earn you any money.

339
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,240
Sorry, sir.

340
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,600
In future, if you are late to this class, you will not be let in.

341
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,600
I think they had you read my book, Blood on a Rainbow Maze.

342
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,240
Any thoughts?

343
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,640
I think it's your masterpiece.

344
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,240
It's so vibrant, an incendiary allegory for unregulated capitalism.

345
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,320
Do you disagree?

346
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,520
No. No, I liked it.

347
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,320
I, uh… I preferred your first novel, Night Tales.

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,760
I thought the relationship between the mother and the son was

349
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,560
really complicated and quite moving.

350
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Hmm.

351
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,080
Not many people have read that book. And you're right.

352
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,720
Rainbow Maze is a pile of shit compared.

353
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,680
Although the critics seem to like it.

354
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,960
But with Night Tales,

355
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,000
it was actually quite a painful experience to write,

356
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,280
but I believe that writing is supposed to cost us something.

357
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,320
So as you begin to explore your ideas for these novels in my class,

358
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,560
I want to remind you that this will not be easy.

359
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,920
We'll be reading your first chapters in the next class.

360
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
Okay, let's move on.

361
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,320
What do we mean when we talk… Ahem.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
-Sorry. -Mm-hmm.

363
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,920
Can I see that for a sec?

364
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,480
-Yeah. -Thank you so much.

365
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,160
Now, where was I?

366
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,160
Great eyes.

367
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,200
-Lovely detail. -Thanks.

368
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,440
I love the way you're playing with form and light.

369
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
That's very nice.

370
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,560
Oh, that's interesting.

371
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
What is it?

372
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,960
It's boobs.

373
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,280
So it is.

374
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,440
Remember, you don't have to be so… literal.

375
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,600
Oh.

376
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,080
-That's good. -Thanks, miss.

377
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
Very sensual.

378
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,480
Right there.

379
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
Lovely texture.

380
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,880
Ooh, I like that.

381
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,320
Keep going. Yes! Yes!

382
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,280
May I be excused?

383
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,680
What's wrong with you? Oh fuck.

384
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,080
-Hello. -Hello, Maureen. Hi.

385
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,760
Uh, I know it's a long shot,

386
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,800
but you wouldn't be able to take Joy for a couple of hours?

387
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,760
-Would you? -Oh, Jean, I'd love to,

388
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,880
but I've got my self-defense class,

389
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,240
and I'm getting a belt today, so…

390
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,600
-Any other time, I'd be there in a flash. -All right, well, um, thanks anyway.

391
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,520
It was short notice.

392
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,800
-Is everything all right? -Yeah!

393
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,480
Yeah. No, I'm fine. It's all good.

394
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Okay, thanks. I'd better run. Bye.

395
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,440
Oh, okay. Bye.

396
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,640
I picked up these from the Jobcentre for you.

397
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,840
Adam, I respect your decision to not go back to school.

398
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,520
It isn't for everyone.

399
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,520
But you can't sit around all day eating cereal

400
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,840
and looking at pictures of your ex-boyfriend.

401
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,600
Hi, sir. I'm so sorry about my phone. It won't happen again, promise.

402
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,240
-Maeve Wiley, right? -Yeah.

403
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,400
I heard your application was impressive. Look forward to reading your chapter.

404
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,000
-He knew about your application. -He also threw my phone out.

405
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,120
-Who was calling you, anyway? -My mum.

406
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,240
Oh, nice that she checks up on you.

407
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,800
-Are you close? -Not really, no.

408
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,000
-She's a drug addict. -Your mum is a drug addict?

409
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Yeah.

410
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,520
Well, you're gonna have so much cool stuff to write about for this class.

411
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't think you can say that.

412
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,320
I don't think I agree with the whole "writing should cost you something."

413
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,560
Feel like stories can just be stories.

414
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,160
I found it.

415
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,080
Hypothetically speaking, if you'd sent an intimate picture

416
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,880
to the person you're kind of dating,

417
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
and they hadn't replied, what would you do?

418
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,840
Dump him.

419
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,000
I can't. He's not technically my boyfriend.

420
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,200
Ghost him, then.

421
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,920
But what if he's ghosting her?

422
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,760

Nothing dramatic. It's just everyone's listening to "podcasts" these days.

439
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,920
So we really need this show to be a little on the spicier side,

440
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,440
um, you know, to hook in new listeners.

441
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,400
So, do you have any ideas?

442
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,960
Well, yes.

443
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,480
My sessions with my clients can be really quite dramatic,

444
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,920
so I was thinking that we could recreate that one-on-one atmosphere,

445
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,280
but live on air.

446
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,400
-Katie! What? Why? You okay? -Oh.

447
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,640
She-- she asked me to watch her kid, but now it won't stop crying.

448
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,320
Sorry. I couldn't find childcare.

449
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,480
Oh, no worries.

450
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,440
So, is it just gonna be a basic call-in show?

451
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,240
Uh, no, no, no. Not… not basic at all, actually.

452
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,920
Uh it could be really unfiltered, raw,

453
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,040
and, well, potentially…

454
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,960
Oh, sorry.

455
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,680
-Do you wanna do this another time? -No. No, this is perfect. Perfect timing.

456
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,320
Actually, what I was trying to say is, uh…

457
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
There you go.

458
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
What I was trying to say is that, um…

459
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,680
you know, listening to real people's sexual problems

460
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,600
can be quite, you know, quite exciting.

461
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,120
Wildly exciting.

462
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,360
And it can even demystify the listeners' own relationships.

463
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
And that's something I'm quite committed to in my… in my work.

464
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,200
-I love it. -Oh.

465
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,960
Yeah! Look, I loved your book. I… I dig your vibe.

466
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,440
Um… Can you start this week?

467
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,120
Um… Sorry.

468
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,560
Um, I didn't know that it would be so quick.

469
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,440
See, Joy is only eight weeks old, and… Do you think you could give me more time?

470
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,480
No. We have to fill the slot. This is a now thing.

471
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,200
-We can keep you in mind for another time. -No. I can start immediately.

472
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,200
Great! What a rollercoaster.

473
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,400
-Great. -It's great.

474
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,560
Thank you.

475
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,600
Fantastic.

476
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,240
Abbi said she liked my trousers.

477
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,000
I heard the Coven say that corduroy is in now.

478
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,280
-…probably orange. -Good idea.

479
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,840
What do you reckon?

480
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,680
Actually, I think I'll go for ginger this time.

481
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,440
You know, I do love…

482
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,320
"I am here. I am enough. I am learning to be a better person."

483
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,320
Hmm.

484
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,920
-Honestly, do we not… Hello! -Hey!

485
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,800
-How are you today? -Hungry!

486
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,520
Have you had a good… Oh, you're so gorgeous, babe.

487
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,880
-Yeah. Uh… -Yes?

488
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
-No, I'm fine. Yeah. -Okay.

489
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,560
-Thanks. Yeah. -No worries. What can I get you?

490
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,600
Mmm… I'll have the burger, please.

491
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,000
I like lentils, but they give me really runny poos.

492
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,400
Every day!

493
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,720
This is a bit… awkward, but this is Abbi's favorite seat.

494
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,920
She loves the view.

495
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,200
Oh, well, I'm fine here, thanks.

496
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,320
I told her this is your seat.

497
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,040
Don't be silly. It's fine. We'll sit somewhere else today.

498
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,320
I mean, I could move.

499
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,200
Or I could just stay sitting here and hang out with you guys.

500
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,840
Hey, you're the girl with the car. Have you considered getting a bike?

501
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,200
-It's so much greener. -Yeah.

502
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,520
I'll think about it.

503
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,480
I love your coat. Where did you get it?

504
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,080
Thank you. I actually made it.

505
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,680

It's really different, but it's very friendly.

526
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,560

Oh, no. No, no, no, no, they… they weren't.

00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,480
Well, that's sad.

529
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,280
It takes so much more energy to be negative than positive.

530
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
-Mmm! -What is your star sign?

531
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,960
Oh, um, I'm a Virgo.

532
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,280
When were you born, and at what time?

533
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Oh my God, yes. You have to get Aisha to do your full chart. She is incredible.

534
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,640
Wh… Oh! Um…

535
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,600
Oh, I don't know. I'm gonna have to ask my mum.

536
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,040
Sorry, what… what was that?

537
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,320
-Aisha needs to see your lips. -Oh, sorry. Sorry.

538
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,800
-Sorry. -Don't worry. It's fine.

539
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,760
I said I'll have to ask my mum.

540
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,560
-Let me know. -I will do.

541
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,560
Hi.

542
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,000
Hey.

543
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,960
Hi.

544
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,840
OMG! I forgot to tell you guys.

545
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,840
I found out that Ms. Masters is on Tinder.

546
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,040
I bet you she is a Libra.

547
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,680
Oh!

548
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Remember, Aisha, no gossiping.

549
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,640
We're gonna donate the money to charity.

550
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,160
I mean, absolutely. I hate gossipin'.

551
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,400
Where's your friend, the guy you were with earlier?

552
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,680
Okay, uh…

553
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,640
Um, he…

554
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,960
…is setting up a sex therapy clinic on campus.

555
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,600
No, I know it sounds very weird, but, like,

556
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,600
he has just got a gift for giving advice.

557
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,960
And he knows about O, right?

558
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
"O"?

559
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,280
Ooh, hi. Hi. Welcome.

560
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
Take a seat. How can I help you?

561
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,560
Sorry, I'm looking for O.

562
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,480
There is no need to apologize.

563
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,960
Many women struggle to reach orgasm. Please take a seat.

564
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,360
No, O, the other sex therapist.

565
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,080
What?

566
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,840
-Otis! Otis! Okay… -Oh!

567
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,840
-Otis! No! Otis! -Eric. Eric!

568
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,360
Otis! Otis!

569
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,760
-Sh! -Otis! Otis!

570
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,480
I think there is another sex therapist on campus.

571
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,880
What? That…

572
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,000
that's what I was coming to tell you.

573
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,600
I know, really.

574
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,120
-I'm just-- -I can't help--

575
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,040
-It is a lot! -…going out with…

576
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,080
Okay, he is obviously a hack.

577
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,840
Probably just taking people's money, like Sex King.

578
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,680
I need to… I need to tell him to shut it down.

579
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,960
Disgusting.

580
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,840
Oh my God, Otis! Look, free cookies.

581
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,760
-Actually, they're carob bites. -What's your name?

582
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,080
-Timothy. -Timothy. Nobody was asking you.

583
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,320
…isn't just sex, right?

584
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,680
-What? -Yeah.

585
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Okay, what's this?

586
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
You need an appointment if you want to speak to O.

587
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,560
You need an appointment to change your attitude.

588
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,080
Look. Oh my God.

589
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,640
-There's a free slot Friday at 12:00. -Yeah. That's four days away.

590
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah, well, I guess he's very popular, Oatcake.

591
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,800
Otis!

592
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,640
I've just had a cancelation. Would you like to come in?

593
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,320
-He's a she. -Mmm.

594
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,360
She knows your name.

595
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,160
Come in, Otis.

596
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,160
I saw you handin' out flyers about your new clinic.

597
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Seems you wanna set up a similar thing to me,

598
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,040
so I thought it might be good to chat.

599
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,680
Yeah. Uh… well, I was wondering what your setup is here.

600
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,560
Well, I just talk to people, offer my advice.

601
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,000
Please, take a wee seat.

602
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,160
Uh…

603
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
-Yeah, get yourself comfy. -Thanks.

604
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,840
Ah…

605
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,560
Sorry.

606
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,440
I'm not… I'm not a very natural floor sitter.

607
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,440
So, when did you come up with all this, then?

608
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,840
I started off making little videos about sex and relationships,

609
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
and I put them online.

610
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
And then, I discovered the joy of connecting to people face-to-face.

611
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,200
Mmm.

612
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,240
You've got a little stain on your back.

613
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,400
-It's sick. My mum's just had a baby. -Oh,

614
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,360
Congratulations. I'm a big fan of your mum's work.

615
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,640
That must be quite an adjustment for you, though. Having a newborn at home.

616
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,560
Is she a single parent?

617
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,920
-Well, yeah, but how… how did-- -I just say it 'cause you seem tired.

618
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,400
Like you've been helpin' out a lot at home.

619
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,000
Joy was… the baby was premature.

620
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,880
And my mum has gone through a breakup.

621
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,560
Now she wants to work again,

622
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,560
which is crazy, because she is clearly overwhelmed.

623
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
-And so I'm… -Worried?

624
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,360
Anyone you can ask for help?

625
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,040
You know, I'm not here to talk about my personal troubles.

626
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,760
We need to discuss the…

627
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,880
-The, uh… -Is it bad news?

628
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,520
No. It's the girl I'm seeing.

629
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,760
-She's in America. She's coming home soon. -Ah.

630
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,400
-Have you had a fight? -No.

631
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,800
Uh, I mean… I mean, I don't know.

632
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,400
She sent me a text, and I didn't respond, and now she's annoyed at me.

633
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,480
But can we please just get back to talking about--

634
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,960
Why didn't you respond?

635
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,080
It just seems a bit dickish to leave her waiting.

636
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,040
She wanted me to send a nude. That's illegal if you're under 18.

637
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,800
I would not survive in prison.

638
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,760
Interestin'.

639
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,840
And is that the only reason why you haven't replied?

640
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,600
Well, I did take some pictures, and I wasn't very happy

641
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,040
with the way I looked in them.

642
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,160
Okay, well, many men struggle with body image.

643
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,280
Taking photographs can feel confronting, but could it be that you're afraid?

644
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,720
Maybe you're afraid of allowing yourself to be intimate

645
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,680
when you're not sure when she's coming back,

646
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,200
or if she's coming back at all?

647
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,320
-She is coming back. -Okay.

648
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,680
Well, I don't think it's viable

649
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,840
to have two sex therapy clinics.

650
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,520
Otis, I'm afraid that's actually all we have time for today.

651
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,840
Um, no. No, because this was not an appointment.

652
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,760
We need to discuss what we're gonna do about our clinics.

653
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,280
I was here first, so I don't really have to do anything.

654
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,680
-Well, I'm the original sex therapist, so… -The original?

655
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,400
-You have clearly stolen my idea. -I haven't stolen anything, Otis.

656
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,640
Women do have brains of their own. But good luck with your clinic.

657
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,520
I hope it works out for you. Thanks for droppin' in.

658
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,360
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

659
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,920
Did you tell her she was a hack?

660
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,880
Hmm. Okay.

661
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,400
What?

662
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,240
Oh my God! She has got thousands of followers.

663
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,400
Well, then.

664
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,400
Hey, everyone. O here.

665
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,160
Thanks for joining me again on this week's episode of Myth Busters,

666
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,120
where we're gonna talk about the hymen.

667
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Popping your cherry.

668
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,760
I wanna make it clear that there is no such thing as popping your cherry.

669
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,720
Wow!

670
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,200
She's just like you!

671
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,600
Except she's doin' it on a much bigger and better scale.

672
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,960
-…which comes in all shapes and sizes… -And she's like…

673
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
-She's famous. -She's stolen my idea.

674
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,200
Mmm, I dunno. She has had a page for a while now.

675
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,160
And her advice wasn't even that helpful.

676
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,920
She said I'm afraid to send Maeve my nudes because I'm scared she's not coming back.

677
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,560
Ah! When is she comin' back?

678
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,080
I don't know. That's not the point, Eric. I'm not… I'm not scared of anything.

679
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,280
In fact, I'm going to send my nudes right now.

680
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,560
Oh my gosh. Ooh la la.

681
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Not that one.

682
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,880
-How do you feel? -So chill.

683
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,480
Really chill.

684
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,640
-Where are you going? -To tell people about my clinic.

685
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,880
Wait. Wait!

686
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,160
Because public speaking isn't your strong suit.

687
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,560
Do you remember your party?

688
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,240
Otis, I think that you just need to think about this.

689
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,960
She is not stealing my clinic.

690
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,760
…chocolate or cotton.

691
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,880
A healthy environment needs bees.

692
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,200
-And without bees, we'd all be… -I'm gonna go next.

693
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,160
…dead.

694
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,880
I love bees.

695
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,040
Just remember to talk slowly. And don't dance, okay?

696
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,080
Okay.

697
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,720
-Never dance. -Okay.

698
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,400
-Um… -Hi. Hi, I'm Eric.

699
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
I'm Eric.

700
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,040
-That's Otis. -Hello!

701
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,320
Hi, everyone. Um, I'm Otis Milburn.

702
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,320
I'm new here. I'm with the whole Moordale Secondary team.

703
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,440
-Yeah! -Thank you.

704
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,360
I wanted to let you know a little bit about myself.

705
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,480
So, uh, I'm 17 years old,

706
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,600
and I spend a lot of my free time thinkin' about sex.

707
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,400
In fact, I live and breathe sex all day, every day.

708
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,280
I think he's doing, like, a sex addict confession thing.

709
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,920
Okay. Now, then. That came out wrong.

710
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,040
Uh…

711
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,680
What I meant to say is…

712
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,440
…thinking about sex comes very naturally to me

713
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,440
because I learned everything I know about sex from my mum.

714
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,280
-Jesus. -Oh.

715
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,240
-This is dark. -Jesus.

716
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,600
We're here for you.

717
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,880
-You're brave for sharing. -No. Wait, no.

718
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,400
That's not what I-- Please, no, don't clap.

719
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,120
-No, no, no. No, no. -Yeah!

720
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
I'm not in a sexual relationship with my mother.

721
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,240
I know that's what it sounded like. I'm not. I promise. That'd be… ugh!

722
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,680
But I am interested in the subject because of her and what she gives me--

723
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,360
For goodness' sake! Just tell them you're a sex therapist!

724
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,080
Yes, I am.

725
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,520
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna start again.

726
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,600
I am a student sex therapist.

727
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,400
And what I was trying to say before is that I learned to be a good therapist

728
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,600
because I grew up with my mum, who is also a sex therapist.

729
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,560
It's my calling.

730
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,920
I have decided to set up my clinic here and share my knowledge with you all.

731
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,320
Hmm?

732
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,000
Micro USB. Yes, very nice.

733
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,760
Thank you. Ooh, it worked. Ta-da!

734
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,480
We have a sex therapist already.

735
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,520
I know you do.

736
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,440
And I don't know how,

737
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,920
but she has stolen my idea.

738
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,640
And between me and O, you should come to me,

739
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,800
because I am the original and the best.

740
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,720
What do you mean she stole it?

741
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,920
Well, she--

742
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,240
Um…

743
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,280
I'll get back to you. One sec. Go away, text.

744
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,560
-Aah. Aaah! -Oh my God!

745
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,360
That's not me!

746
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,360
Wow! Okay.

747
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,480
Thank you for listening. I'm Otis. I'm a sex therapist…

748
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,880
-I-- -Bluetooth connected.

749
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,200
Bluetooth? Oh my God!

750
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,080
Oh my God. Okay. Cover your eyes.

751
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,800
-Cover your eyes! -Go away! Stop!

752
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,000
Why is his penis flaccid?

753
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,120
Go away. Oh God.

754
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,760
Why are his pubes shaved like that?

755
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,080
Cover your eyes.

756
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,840
Stop! Don't look.

757
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,160
That's… incredibly embarrassing.

758
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,680
Please. Uh…

759
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,600
Oh!

760
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,960
-Oh God. -Can someone help turn off the projector?

761
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,520
For the love of God, please. Quickly. Quickly.

762
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,720
Thank you, Bee Lady. Thanks for listening.

763
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,640
And I'll see you at my clinic. Hopefully.

764
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,240
Jesus Christ.

765
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,400
Wait for me!

766
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,560
Otis!

767
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,000
Tell me those photos didn't send to Maeve.

768
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,920
Get inside. Sit down.

769
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
-They didn't. -Hallelujah. Hallelujah, praise the Lord.

770
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,040
-Did that really just happen? -Yes.

771
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,760
-Is everyone talking about me? -Yes, but this college is weird.

772
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,240
Nobody's saying anything mean.

773
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,560
They all just feel sorry for you. Oh God!

774
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Why was your penis flaccid?

775
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,480
People are more into pictures of hard dicks.

776
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,920
Erect just felt aggressive.

777
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Also, why were your pubes shaved in that strange pattern?

778
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,240
-Why was the camera so far away, Oatcake? -I just--

779
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,920
I over-shaved the right. And I was trying to capture natural light.

780
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,160
I can't believe this is happening.

781
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,920
No one's gonna come and have therapy with Creepy Pube Man.

782
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,000
Hi, I need a therapy session.

783
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,120
Uh, come in.

784
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,480
Ahem.

785
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,320
Oh, uh, yes, I will go.

786
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,600
-Oh. -I will go. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

787
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,640
Have a good session.

788
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,280
Oh, God bless you.

789
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,200
-Ahem. -Ahem.

790
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,560
Ah. Um…

791
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,400
How can I help you?

792
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
I just had an orgasm.

793
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,080
Um, good for you.

794
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,240
It wasn't great. It was very strange.

795
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,720
It happened now, in the middle of college, after I saw your photos.

796
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,680
-Uh, well, I'm flattered. -No, I don't think you understand.

797
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,240
I'm not remotely attracted to you. And your nudes were profoundly unsexy.

798
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,960
Valid.

799
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,800
I started taking testosterone six months ago.

800
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,160
The doctor warned me it could feel like a second puberty.

801
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,000
But now I'm horny all the time.

802
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,120
Like, everything turns me on. I jerked off twice this morning.

803
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,400
Art class made me feel like I was gonna get off,

804
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,360
and then I saw your penis, and… boom.

805
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,880
-Fu… -Of course.

806
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,560
Inexplicably, I came. So, I don't know.

807
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,800
I don't wanna stop taking T, but I feel like… I'm losing control,

808
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,520
and I don't wanna be walkin' around, coming… all the time.

809
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,480
Well, spontaneous orgasms are rare, but they're not unheard of,

810
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,920
and it can happen to anyone.

811
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,880
It definitely doesn't happen to everyone who takes testosterone.

812
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,240
And puberty makes us feel out of control and unusually aroused.

813
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,080
It sounds like you're describing how it feels to be a teenage boy.

814
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,000
Really?

815
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,800
Yeah. And believe me, I have had my fair share of poorly timed orgasms,

816
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,640
and they are uncomfortable and embarrassing.

817
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,920
-Mmm. -But I promise it doesn't last forever.

818
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,520
Um…

819
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,080
So I'm just like a horny teenage boy?

820
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
-I thought I was disgusting. -No.

821
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And I know it's hard, but you should try and enjoy the journey.

822
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,000
It's an opportunity to get to know yourself and your body better.

823
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Thank you, Otis.

824
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,720
Can I ask why you decided to come and speak with me?

825
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,520
You showed your flaccid penis to the whole college,

826
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,240
so I figured you wouldn't judge me.

827
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,080
-Hey. -Yeah, I think it's down there.

828
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,200
Wow. You're really not over them.

829
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm workin' on it, all right?

830
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,960
Anyway, neither of us have time to date. This year is make or break, okay?

831
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,720
Yeah, exactly!

832
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,960
-Hey. -Hi!

833
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,640
-Did you get your tablet fixed? -Yeah, I fixed me.

834
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Um, sorry. I… I fixed it.

835
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,760
-Hey, I'm Beau. -Jackson.

836
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,120
I'll send you those notes on Dolly.

837
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,520
-Oh. -What's your last name?

838
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,400
Um, it's…

839
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,040
Vivienne Odusanya. See you in class tomorrow.

840
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,280
See you in class tomorrow.

841
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,200
What was that about make or break?

842
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,160
Wow. Vivienne Odusanya.

843
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,920
-I'll see you in class tomorrow. -This close.

844
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,040
How was school?

845
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,040
It was… terrible.

846
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,880
There is another student doing therapy,

847
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,080
and they've got a bloody channel with loads of videos and followers.

848
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,680
It just made my whole thing feel pathetic.

849
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,480
You're not even listening.

850
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,440
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,320
I got the job!

852
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,120
They want me to start right away.

853
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,360
-Which I know is not ideal, but… -Who is gonna look after Joy?

854
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,240
Well, it's an early evening show.

855
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,040
So I thought I could take her to the studio sometimes,

856
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,120
and sometimes you could watch her.

857
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,080
Mum, we are struggling as it is.

858
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,800
I've just started college. I really don't think it's a good idea--

859
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,760
Where's Joy?

860
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,600
Where's Joy? Where?

861
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,400
-I just got home, Mum. -Oh! Oh!

862
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
What do you mean, where's Joy?

863
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,440
Joy!

864
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,520
Whew. I must have put her to bed.

865
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,200
I completely forgot.

866
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,240
Panic over.

867
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,120
Hey, I am worried about Mum.

868
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,680
-Ah! Devastating. -Eric!

869
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,840
Uh-huh?

870
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,840
The new pastor was asking me why you're not baptized at church today.

871
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,840
-I think you should do his course. -Oh!

872
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,480
Apparently, he's very progressive.

873
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,080
Mum, we have already spoken about this, and you know I'm not sure.

874
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,120
-Okay? Ohhh! -Please, Eric. All the girls are baptized.

875
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,080
-So what? -You're the only one left.

876
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,520
It'd mean so much to me and your grandma.

879
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,200
I'll think about it.

880
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,280
Oh, Mum, um, what time was I born?

881
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
-Ah! -Ah?

882
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,800
Who have you been speaking to?

883
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960

-Adam didn't start at Cavendish today. -No.

893
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,360
He's decided he doesn't want to continue with school.

894
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,600
-Why didn't he tell me? -Michael.

895
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,800
He's scared of you.

896
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,960
I am working on myself.

897
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,560
I'm doing therapy.

898
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,680
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

899
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,440
But if you want Adam to tell you things,

900
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,840
you have to start making an effort with him.

901
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,360
You ignored me all day. I feel like an idiot.

902
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,680
I'm sorry. I didn't handle it well. And I should have texted.

903
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,640
I think I'm scared to make myself vulnerable

904
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,400
when I don't know you're coming back.

905
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,640
Why wouldn't I come back?

906
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,400
It sounds like you're having a really great time over there.

907
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,440
I am, but it's also hard being away from home.

908
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,840
And I miss you. A lot.

909
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,040
Yeah. I miss you too.

910
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,320
I am coming home.

911
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,880
Well…

912
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,840
I don't think that photos are my thing.

913
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,240
But maybe we could try something else.

914
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,960
Okay. What did you have in mind?

915
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,760
I don't know. Um…

916
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,320
Oh, I'm terrible at this kind of thing.

917
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,920
It's okay.

918
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,360
Mmm…

919
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,400
What are you thinking about right now?

920
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,720
I'm thinking about you being here with me.

921
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,960
And, uh… I'm taking my trousers off.

922
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,960
Hang on a minute.

923
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,920
Um…

924
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,840
And I'm in my pants.

925
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
Hang on a second.

926
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,320
-You okay? -What are you doing?

927
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,960
I'm imagining you here with me.

928
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,640
And I'm taking off your clothes, and I'm touching you.

929
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,680
-Where are you touching me? -Your face.

930
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,720
-And your mouth. -Are you kissing me?

931
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,680
Yeah.

932
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,560

933
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,880

934
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,240

935
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,200
