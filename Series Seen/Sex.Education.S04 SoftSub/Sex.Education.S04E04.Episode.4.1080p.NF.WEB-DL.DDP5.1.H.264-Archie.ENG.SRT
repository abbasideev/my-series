1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,440
Uh…

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,400
-Can I get you a drink? -Sure.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,760
-Uh… -Where's all your furniture?

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,200
Um, I haven't been here that long.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,440
My ex-wife still lives in the family home, so I don't have much stuff.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,960
We've been separated for almost a year now.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,160
It's, um… it's been quite an adjustment.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,400
Michael, I don't really wanna talk about your ex-wife.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,640
Sorry. Yeah.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,640
Why don't we drink afterwards?

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,600
After what?

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,840
Ah! Oh! Uh…

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
Uh… uh… Oh. Ooh!

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,680
Mmph! Oh… Mmm!

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Ah!

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,440
Ah! Uh… Oh…

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,360
Uh. Ah!

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,560
Oh! Ow!

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,840
Ah!

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,000
-Ah! Oh! Ah! -Ah! Oh!

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Oh, yes. Oh, that's it!

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,000
Ah! Ah!

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Oh, hang on.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
Oh. Oh.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,000
Sorry. Ah! Sorry. Sorry. I just need a moment. Um…

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,840
Sometimes I have trouble performing at the drop of a hat.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,480
Do you have any little blue pills?

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,960
Uh… no. But I did try one once when my ex-wife--

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
Michael.

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,440
I don't wanna think about you

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,240
-and your ex-wife right now. -Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,160
-Come on. You can do this. -Uh-huh.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,320
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. -Yeah?

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,320
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,480
Okay, yeah.

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,680
Come on. Come on.

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,240
Oh, that's… Oh!

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,440
-Come on! -I can't.

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,600
Come on!

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,760

Uh, maybe…

46
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,200
Or we could just have a nice cuddle instead.

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you for dinner, Michael, but I need a proper man in the bedroom.

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,600
-Someone who wants to rip my clothes off. -Ah!

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720

Yeah, I'm good. You?

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,520
Uh, had a chat with your mum, um…

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,520
Yeah?

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,400
If you want to stay home, you can.

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,520
No. I want to go to college. There's no point worrying about it.

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,240
-Jackson. -Yeah.

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Look at me.

81
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,080
It's gonna be okay.

82
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,920
Yeah, I know.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,880
Love you.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm your host, Dr. Jean Milburn.

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,120
This is your host.

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm your host, Dr. Jean Milburn,

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,160
and I wanted to start today by talking about male mental health.

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
Caffeine delivery!

89
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,640
-Sh! I just got her to settle. -Oh shit. Sorry.

90
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,160
-Thank you. -There we go.

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,040
Oh.

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,480
Ooh!

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,360
-Mmph. -So, Jo.

94
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,400
-Mmm? -Uh…

95
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,520
I've been asked to come in early to the station this afternoon.

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,360
-Would you watch Joy? -I can't.

97
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,280
Why?

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,680
I have got a date with this guy that I met at the bank.

99
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh my God.

100
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
What?

101
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,280
Well, I don't know. Just maybe don't do the thing that you always do?

102
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,680
Just jump into another relationship.

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,400
-Mmm. -Take a breath. Huh?

104
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
You can talk.

105
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,880
-I'm just saying. -Do you know, I… I really…

106
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
I don't need you to do the whole mothering thing right now.

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,720
-It's just a date. -Sh.

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Okay.

109
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,240
-Can you not take Joy with you? -No, I can't.

110
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm afraid they're gonna fire me today.

111
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
What?

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,520
I don't know. The show hasn't been going very well.

113
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,840
It's been quite bad, actually.

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,040
And I just… I can't find my rhythm.

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,280
And I just should never have taken the job in the first place.

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,160
Fine. It's fine.

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,600
-It's okay. -No, fine. I can rearrange my date.

118
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
No.

119
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,520
If you can do something for me?

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,720
I need you to lie really still.

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,840
-Oh, no, no, no. -I'm going to fart on your head.

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,160
-It'll be a squelchy one. -Jo!

123
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm heading out.

124
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,640
-Nice. -Sorry, I was farting on your mum's head.

125
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,880
Maeve's back, but her mum's in hospital.

126
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,320
What about college, darling?

127
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,920
Well, it's just a day. Mum, she really needs me.

128
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
-Have fun. -Well, call me later.

129
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,360
-Oh. -That was definitely his fault, not mine.

130
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,120
My Joy! Hey, baby! Hey!

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Who is that?

132
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,440
Uh, it's Jem. Dad owns the place.

133
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,040
Very pretty.

134
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,040
Is she? Uh… didn't notice.

135
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Um… I don't need a lift.

136
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,400
-Dad's gonna give me another lesson. -Oh, good.

137
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,120
Oh, um… I was gonna ask. Uh, did your dad ever go on that date?

138
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,240
No, I don't know. Why do you care?

139
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,320
Uh I… I don't care.

140
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,120
I mean, I'm just, um… just, uh…

141
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,080
really happy for him that he's moving on, that's all.

142
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,480
-Have a lovely day. -Mm-hmm.

143
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Can you meet me in the riding pen after lunch, okay?

144
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,680
Hmm.

145
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
When I met you, I was but the learner.

146
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,680
Now I am the master.

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,600
Can you get that?

148
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,560
My God, Jean!

149
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,640
-Oh! -No, I'm… I'm Joanna.

150
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm Jean's sister.

151
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,400
-Oh! -Actually, I've just got this thing.

152
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,280
It's supposed to, like, boost my collagen and make me look 17 years old again.

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,800
I hope it works, 'cause it was really fucking expensive.

154
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh my God! Sounds fabulous.

155
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,400
Sorry, who are you?

156
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,280
-Oh, I'm… I'm Eric. -Right.

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
-Uh, I'm Otis's friend. Is he here? -Oh. Uh, no, he isn't.

158
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,800
Somebody called "Mavis" has just got back, so he's gone to see her.

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,640
Huh.

160
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,440
Okay.

161
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
-Shall I pass on a message? Or… -Uh, no. No, no.

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,960
-Um, nice to meet you, Joanna. -You too, Eric.

163
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,800
-Good luck with the collagen. -Thank you. I really need it.

164
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,840
Thank you for letting me know, Otis!

165
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Maeve, Aimee's here.

166
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,440
-Oh. -Aimes, I missed you.

167
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,280
Thanks for giving me a lift.

168
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,960
-Let's go. -Yeah.

169
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,480
-Oh, is Otis comin'? -No.

170
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,200
-Hi. -Hey.

171
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,560
What are you doing here?

172
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,720
I just thought I'd come and give you some support.

173
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,000
Sorry, have I done the wrong thing?

174
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,240
Uh… No, no. That's… that's really nice… that's really nice of you.

175
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,400
It's just I haven't showered since the plane.

176
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,480
I was hoping to see you a bit more spruced up, but I'm not--

177
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,800
That's okay. I'm…

178
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,840
It's fine. I can come back. Don't worry.

179
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
Nice to see you.

180
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,680
Don't go, actually. Please.

181
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,040
-I've missed you. -I missed you.

182
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,480
-Ow! -Sorry.

183
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,440
Carry it 'cause my feet get dead sweaty when I drive. Knock yourself out.

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,040
Hop in.

185
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Fresh blossom?

186
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,200
Fuckin' hell.

187
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,920
What?

188
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,840
Disgustin'.

189
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,280
-We texted all weekend. -Aw!

190
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,960
-I think I really like him. -See, I told you.

191
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,800
He's like your nerdy soulmate.

192
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,480
He even told his dad about me.

193
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,240
They're like best mates.

194
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,520
How sweet is that?

195
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,760
-Yeah. -Yeah!

196
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,480
What? What?

197
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Nothin'.

198
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,040
Viv, you have a bad case of mention-itis.

199
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,760
-You can't stop talkin' about him. -Stop!

200
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,240
-Okay, I'll stop. -No, no, look, I'm happy for you.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,280
I am.

202
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Hey, um…

203
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,080
I do need to talk to you about something. It's a bit awkward. I found a lump.

204
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,640
Like, in my ball sack.

205
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,000
What do you mean? Are you okay?

206
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,680
-Yeah. -Yeah?

207
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,520
No.

208
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,200
Freakin' out. But they're doin' tests, so…

209
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,520
I wanted to let you know, you're my best friend.

210
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,120
Okay, well, um…

211
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,760
Thank you for letting me know. I'm here for you.

212
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Thanks.

213
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,000
Come on.

214
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,560
His video was so relatable.

215
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,280
O's video was too shiny. I feel like we never really know her.

216
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
Yeah, that's crazy.

217
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm just, like, really itchy. I don't know what happened.

218
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
Excuse me. No queue-jumping.

219
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,600
Chill. I'm looking for Otis. I'm his campaign manager.

220
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,880
If you're his campaign manager, then where is he?

221
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,640
Let me get back to you on that. What's the point of booking?

Do you know what? I'm actually taking some walk-in appointments today,

227
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,960
as Otis hasn't turned up.

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,840
-I also have some free T-shirts. -Mmm. Cool

229
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,600
They are organic and ethically made.

230
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
Remember, vote O!

231
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,120
For you. And there's one for you.

233
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,880
-And you. -Thank you. These are so soft!

234
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
There's my dickhead brother.

235
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,880
Do you want us to come in with you?

236
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,760
No, it's fine.

237
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,120
-You sure? -Yeah. I won't be long.

238
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,640
I hope she's all right.

239
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,920
I know. Me too.

240
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
Do you know how to play Scabby Queen?

241
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,120
Hey, Froggy! Ribbit!

242
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Ah!

243
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,520
-Where have you been? -Oh, just with my mate, um… Mo.

244
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,640
-You know, Mo. He's got… -No.

245
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,200
I can't believe you've come back from America for this.

246
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,600
-She'd better be really ill this time. -Sean.

247
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,680
Do you not remember last time she ended up in hospital?

248
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,600
She escaped. By the time they caught her, she was by the train station.

249
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,480
Yeah? In nothing but a hospital gown with her arse hangin' out.

250
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,440
Wasn't funny.

251
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,000
-Come on. It was a little bit funny. -I'm not laughing.

252
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,400
Don't let you laugh in America, do they?

253
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,080
Hey, um… can I walk you to class?

254
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,560
-Ready? Smile! -Yeah.

255
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Yeah, um… I just wanted to ask

256
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,280
if there's anything goin' on with you and that Jackson guy?

257
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,240
Because you guys were huggin' earlier, and I, um…

258
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,560
I… I don't wanna get my hopes up if you're already involved with someone else.

259
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,040
No. Um…

260
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,960
Jackson's my best mate. He's going through some personal stuff.

261
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,760
But there is definitely nothing going on between us.

262
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,360
Okay. Okay, cool.

263
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,680
Okay. I'm… I'm sorry.

264
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,440
I'm sorry. I just… I get in my head sometimes, and…

265
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,680
I… I really like you.

266
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,280
Uh, um… I know this is fast, but I've been thinking, actually.

267
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,600
If you wanted to, do you wanna be my girlfriend?

268
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,720
-If you want. I don't-- -I would love to be your girlfriend.

269
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,760
Okay. Cool.

270
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
-Cool. -Yeah.

271
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,160
-Cool. Shall we-- -Class?

272
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,480
-Class. Yeah. -Class. Yes. Probably should.

273
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Yeah. There's this statistics book I'm really enjoying.

274
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,640
-The way it analyzes data… -Oh, yeah, did you finish the--

275
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,920
Oh no. You have to try it. It's so invigorating.

276
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,000
-I didn't exfoliate for a week. -See you!

277
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,640
-Hey. -Hi, miss.

278
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,080
Yeah, just an idea. Um, homage to my phone.

279
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,440
It's gonna…

280
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,760
-Hey. -Hey.

281
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry about the other night. I was so awkward.

282
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,960
No, you weren't.

283
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,600
People think I want to kiss them all the time.

284
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,520
You're just saying that to make me feel better.

285
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,480
Just a little bit.

286
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,400
Um… I wanted to explain. PK and I are ethically non-monogamous.

287
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,240
So, I was wondering

288
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,760
if you might wanna go on a date sometime with me?

289
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,080
Um…

290
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,000
-Yeah, I'd like that. -Yeah!

291
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,880
Hmm…

292
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
-Boom. -Mm-hmm.

293
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Heh-heh-heh.

294
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,240
Pause.

295
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,400
Ahem.

296
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,960
-Everythin' all right? -Yeah, it's just Isaac.

297
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,520
-I didn't know you were friends. -We're not. I just do art class with him.

298
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
-It's not like I like him or anythin'. -Okay. Sure.

299
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,960
Not everything's therapy, Otis.

300
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,360
-You're the Scabby Queen. -You're like a mind reader.

301
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
What shall we do now?

302
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,000
Can I take your photo?

303
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,840
Sure.

304
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,840
That's a nice camera.

305
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,600
Right. Oh God. It gets me every time.

306
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
-What? -It's not an appropriate place to whistle.

307
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,760
Sean.

308
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,280
Sorry.

309
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,240
-Sorry. -Maeve and Sean Wiley?

310
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,280
Come with me.

311
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,760
If you'd like to come through.

312
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,560
Where's my mum?

313
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,840
Take a seat, and we can have a chat.

314
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't wanna sit. What are you doing? Get up.

315
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,560
-Sean. Sit down. Sit down. -Loser, get up. Get up.

316
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,080
I am very sorry to inform you that your mother has passed away.

317
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,720
Shortly after she was admitted to ICU,

318
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,920
she lost consciousness and fell into a coma.

319
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,680
It was very unexpected…

320
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,600
Whilst she was initially stable, she deteriorated quickly,

321
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,480
and her heart stopped working.

322
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,080
We did everything to try and save her, but I'm afraid we were unsuccessful.

323
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,440
We lost her about 20 minutes ago.

324
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm so sorry for your loss.

325
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,880
Take as much time as you need. This room is for you.

326
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,520
A nurse will be in to see you shortly.

327
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
Oh!

328
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,680
-Hi. Hello. -Hola.

329
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,880
-That's a baby. -Oh, yeah. No, she's not mine.

330
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,360
-Oh. -No, she's my niece.

331
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,880
-I couldn't get out of watching her, so… -Oh.

332
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,040
-Hi. Hello. -Uh, mange-tout.

333
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
-Well, this-- -Mmm!

334
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,680
Maybe I'll just pop another one there for good luck.

335
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,240
Wow, you smell really…

336
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,960
…fucking nice, actually. Thanks very much!

337
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,160
Came over here on my "motorbee-kay."

338
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,920
Wow, a bike. That's, um…

339
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,360
-Oh no. -It's fine.

340
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Sorry.

341
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,480
Oh, she's been fussing all morning.

342
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,720
I thought I could leave her at home, but my… my sister had to work, so, uh…

343
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Yeah, I should probably feed her.

344
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,440
-Sorry. -No, don't apologize.

345
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,960
Go ahead. I, uh… love babies.

346
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,400
-They're, uh, you know… cool. -Yeah, I'm sure you do.

347
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,920
I do. They're great stuff.

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,960
I'm the eldest of, uh, six siblings.

349
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,600
-Oh right? -Would you believe?

350
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,760
I was around them a lot. My little brother Billy called me "Daddy Brother."

351
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,080
-Uh-huh. -Not in a creepy…

352
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,200
-We weren't in a cult. I promise. -Right.

353
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,480
Just a normal family. My parents just… loved bangin', I guess.

354
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,000
Hey! Hi there.

355
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,800
Who are you? You're a handsome little devil.

356
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
Oh, she likes you.

357
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,520
So, what about you? Do you wanna get married?

358
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Pop out some babies? Pop!

359
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,800
Wow! Right to the point.

360
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,200
Sorry. You know what it is? I just… I go on so many dates.

361
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
Honestly, I just wanna settle down,

362
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,200
but most of the women I… I go out with, they're only interested in, you know…

363
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Mm-hmm.

364
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,600
So I'm… I'm trying out this new thing where I'm just really honest

365
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,000
so I don't waste people's time.

366
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,400
Yeah, I, uh… I wanna settle down too.

367
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,960
But I just can't seem to make anything long-term stick.

368
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,320
You know, it's just, like, the wrong person.

369
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,920
-Right. -Or, like, you know, the wrong time.

370
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,600
And there's always that risk

371
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,040
of, like, passing down all of your dysfunctional shit to an infant.

372
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,320
Not that I've got loads of it. Just a normal amount.

373
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,040
Right, sure. Like, a normal amount of dysfunctional shit.

374
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,240
Yeah, that was probably the wrong answer.

375
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,800
It wasn't at all. It really… It really wasn't.

376
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
If you're happy to wait until tomorrow to see Otis,

377
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,360
he will give you a double appointment and a regular slot.

378
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,160
I only wanna stop my muff itching.

379
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,040
Any time, that's what I'm here for. Don't forget to vote for O.

380
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,760
-Bye. Thanks so much. -Thanks.

381
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,960
Can I help you?

382
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,080
Yes, you can.

383
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,400
You can stop taking Otis's clients.

384
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,920
There will be a student counselor debate this Thursday lunchtime.

385
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,640
Come and hear Otis and O make the case for why they deserve your vote.

386
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
We'll have free tote bags for anyone who comes along.

387
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,120
What's this about a debate?

388
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm so sorry. Who are you again?

389
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,320
Oh, please stop pretending that you don't know who I am.

390
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,680
-Why don't we step inside? -Yeah, shall we?

391
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,280
Take a wee seat.

392
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,880
No, thank you. I don't want to crease my skirt.

393
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,000
So, what's with this debate?

394
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,680
Oh, uh… I just thought it might be a good opportunity

395
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,600
for Otis and I to get our points across.

396
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,120
-I was gonna tell him if it got approved. -I bet you were.

397
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,280
What's your connection to Otis?

398
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,800
Why does that matter?

399
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,200
Just tryin' to work out what's in this for you.

400
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
I mean, you must be pretty good friends to help him like this.

401
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
Yes, we're friends.

402
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,480
But you used to be more?

403
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,280
We dated briefly.

404
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,720
I broke up with him, obviously.

405
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,640
Because his feelings weren't as strong as yours?

406
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,200
And he still held a torch for that girl?

407
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,720
Oh, what's her name, the one he's with now, the one in America?

408
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,920
Maeve, is it?

409
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm just guessing here.

410
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,560
I don't know, but it would explain why you're runnin' round after him.

411
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,320
You're hoping that one day he will see the light

412
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,680
and realize that you're the person who's always known how special he is,

413
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,680
and he'll say that he loves you as much as you've always loved him.

414
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,280
That's not true.

415
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,840
Okay.

416
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,640
But I'll give you some advice.

417
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,520
If someone really truly likes you, they shouldn't be playin' any games.

418
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,560
They shouldn't be leaving you confused.

419
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,240
It'll be clear.

420
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,160
Thank you for the advice.

421
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,360
Now, let me give you some.

422
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Start preparing yourself to lose.

423
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
When we were ten, you decided to make my life a living hell.

424
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,560
And now, I promise you, I plan on doing the exact same thing to you.

425
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,760
-Was that a threat? -No, it's a promise, Sarah.

426
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,320
Now, I've got a debate to prepare for.

427
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,040
My name is O.

428
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,160
-Shall I look at you? -Whatever you want.

429
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,360
Shall I--

430
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,000
Just, kind of, you know, relax.

431
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,240
What's that?

432
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,240
Uh… Sorry. I was just… I was… I was trying to pose.

433
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,720
Maybe just do nothing.

434
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,280
Ahem. Okay.

435
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,440
I feel like you're still doing something.

436
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Weird.

437
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Oh, okay.

438
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,000
-Not bad. -Thanks.

439
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,920
Weird.

440
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,240
Are these going in your portfolio?

441
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,920
No, no, no. I'm just practicin'.

442
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,680
I actually think I wanna take photos of myself.

443
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,160
Isaac showed me these amazing self-portraits I really like.

444
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,000
I thought you weren't friends with Isaac?

445
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,840
Yeah, I'm not.

446
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,360
Yeah, I don't really know what I'm trying to say yet

447
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,880
with the self-portraits, which is annoying.

448
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,880
Like, say with Isaac's work, for example. It really means something.

449
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,040
Maybe you're thinking about it too much. Just trust your instincts.

450
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,720
That is exactly what Isaac says.

451
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,480
Otis, will you therapy me?

452
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,360
Uh, what's up?

453
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,480
Right. Um…

454
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,040
Say…

455
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,720
if you thought you were getting feelings for someone

456
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,480
who your best friend used to have a thing with,

457
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,640
do you think you would have to tell your best friend

458
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,040
you were getting feelings for the person that they used to have the thing with?

459
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,440
I think…

460
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,480
I think if these feelings are real, and you wanna act on them, then…

461
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,600
yeah, you should be upfront with your friend.

462
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,320
-Mmm. -If you don't tell them and they find out,

463
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,640
it'll be a lot worse.

464
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,320
Yeah.

465
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,240
I wasn't talking about Isaac, by the way.

466
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,880
-Didn't think you were. -That's good. Hold that.

467
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,160
Ahem…

468
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,400
-You changed it again. -I'm sorry. I did. I know I did.

469
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,560
Hi. I'm doing a survey for the student counselor election.

470
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,840
Do you feel that O has ever crossed a line or treated anyone badly?

471
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,840
-No. -Okay.

472
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,480
Has O's behavior ever been not inclusive or mean?

473
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,040
-No. -No.

474
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
-No. -No, not at all.

475
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,240
Has O ever given you advice that was damaging or incorrect?

476
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,920
-No. -No.

477
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,680
No. No. No. No.

478
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,440
-No! -Okay.

479
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,840
In terms of a charity, we should raise for something different this year.

480
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,600
Hi. I'm doing a survey for the student counselor election.

481
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,080
-Can I ask a few questions? -We are in the middle of a meeting.

482
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,320
It'll just take a sec.

483
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,560
So, do you feel that O has ever crossed the line or treated anyone badly?

484
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Um… No. She's actually helped me out with a lot of problems.

485
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,520
We think she's great.

486
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,080
Sorry. I didn't catch what you said.

487
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,040
Don't worry, babe. I'll tell you later.

488
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,040
Uh, do you have any more questions?

489
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:26,080
Yeah. Do you feel that O's behavior has ever been not inclusive or mean?

490
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,400
-Um… last-- -Look, this is feeling quite bitchy now.

491
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Oh, come on.

492
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,640
I know you don't really buy into the whole not-talking-behind-people's-back thing

493
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,560
and that, like, being kind is, you know, your brand.

494
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Love it.

495
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,920
But, uh, I'm not gonna tell anyone. You can give me the goss.

496
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,560
Being kind isn't a brand. It's the right thing to do.

497
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,840
Um… we actually do need to get on with our meetin',

498
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,200
but good luck with your survey.

499
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,680
That girl's energy is so emotionally draining.

500
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,080
Aisha, that's not gossip. It's a fact.

501
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,760
Ooh! Eric.

502
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,000
Have you seen Otis? Because he's ignoring my texts.

503
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,520
Uh, no. No, he stood me up this mornin'.

504
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,880
Because you disinvited him from the club night thing?

505
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,600
-Excuse me? -No, I'm not judging you, Eric.

506
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,800
Believe me. I disinvite uncool people from things all the time.

507
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
It's just I think he was a bit upset.

508
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,080
Oh my God! No. No, it's because Maeve is back in town.

509
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,000
And whenever she's around, nothin' else matters to him.

510
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,240
He's not told you that she's back?

511
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,520
Oh, I'm…

512
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,280
-No, it's fine. Yes. -Did… Yeah?

513
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,880
-Okay, good. Yes, thank you. Thanks. -Because I-- Good, yeah. Yeah, okay.

514
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,720
What did I miss?

515
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,240
Ruby.

516
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,280
Of course.

517
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
We still need to choose a charity for the fundraiser.

518
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,560
Do we have any ideas?

519
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,760
Up. No. Keep going.

520
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,040
So, what's going through your head when you look at Midnight?

521
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,360
Uh…

522
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,320
"If I fall over, you will crush me with your small metal feet."

523
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,440
Right. Well, take the reins.

524
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,840
You need to let the horse know you're not afraid.

525
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,080
Come on. We're gonna walk together. Come on.

526
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,640
Give her a tug. Come on.

527
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,920
Try and… tune into the horse's rhythm.

528
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,760
Okay.

529
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,280
See.

530
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,480
He's not that scary, is he?

531
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,040
Okay, let's get you on.

532
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,200
-Don't I need another lesson? -Well, you know the old saying.

533
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,160
"Thinking doesn't overcome fear. Action does." Up.

534
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,160
Ready? Shall I help you?

535
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
Okay. One, two, three.

536
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
-Ah. -Okay.

537
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,880
-You good? -Uh-huh.

538
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,040
-Go on. -Oof! Okay.

539
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,480
-Slowly, though. -All right.

540
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,440
-You've got it. -Slow it down.

541
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,520
-Slowly. -Okay.

542
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
There we go, boy.

543
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,600
That's it. Good boy.

544
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,120
Okay. Ready?

545
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,120
-You're gonna trot now. Come on. -No. I think I should get down.

546
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,640
Oh my! Oh! Hey.

547
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,040
Ah! Hey! Oh! My balls! My balls!

548
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,400
-Just tune into his rhythm. -I'm riding. Okay.

549
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,240
Okay, there you go. You're actually cantering.

550
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,080
-Okay? Yes! -Okay.

551
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,520
I'm riding. I'm riding a horse.

552
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,640
Yes, you are.

553
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,400
We're moving your mother to the mortuary. You'll be able to see her soon.

554
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,520
Here are her belongings.

555
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,320
Do you think it's weird if I finish the sweets?

556
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,400
She's hardly gonna need them now, is she?

557
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,360
Can no one take a joke anymore?

558
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Do you remember when Uncle Pat died?

559
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,600
Um…

560
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,880
Yeah, kinda. His funeral was the first time I had beer.

561
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,880
-You were eight. -Yeah.

562
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,640
Uncle Pat's girlfriend gave it to me. Now she could take a joke. Remember?

563
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,880
I remember seeing him dead. He didn't look like himself.

564
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,440
After that, I couldn't remember what alive Uncle Pat looked like.

565
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,320
I don't think I can see Mum like that.

566
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,000
If that's okay.

567
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,480
Yeah.

568
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,160
All right.

569
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,640
Celia?

570
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,040
Sorry. I'll come back.

571
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,160
No. No, no, no, no. I'm awake. Power napping.

572
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,320
Okay.

573
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,800
Power napping. Come in.

574
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,200
Come in. Sit down. Sit down, sit down. Sit down.

575
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,760
How about you turn around, bright eyes?

576
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,400
-I'm not moving. This is me for a bit. -Oh, okay.

577
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,080
Okay.

578
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,520
We need to talk about your last few shows.

579
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,280
-Yes. -They have not been great.

580
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
I know they haven't been very good.

581
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,440
And, um, I am just finding my feet,

582
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,800
but I've done some extra prep, and I think I've found a way in.

583
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,080
Probably a little bit late for that.

584
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,520
I'm afraid the big boss, Terry, is a bit worried about the format.

585
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,080
He thinks it's flat.

586
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,120
So what I have done is…

587
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,280
I've found some guests who are going to come and cohost with you this week, okay?

588
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,680
-Right. What… what kind of guests? -You know, sex people like yourself.

589
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,560
I've got one woman who makes plaster casts

590
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,160
out of her own vagina.

591
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,080
Um, look. I… I know that I haven't been on form,

592
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,760
but I would really like the chance to be able to work out how to do it myself.

593
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,160
I'm really sorry, Jean.

594
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,880
If it was up to me, absolutely.

595
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm under a lot of pressure to make this work.

596
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,360
It could loosen things up. Could make it fun.

597
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,600
You know, this could be a good thing.

598
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
-Hello! -Oh. O!

599
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,200
That's her name, not an exclamation. Come on in.

600
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,160
-O, this is Jean. O. -Oh.

601
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,080
O… Jean, hi.

602
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,640
-O. Co-host. -Uh…

603
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,960
Yeah. Oh, O-host!

604
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,600
You should, uh… check out her channel. The videos are great.

605
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,440
Good. No. Remember to indicate.

606
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
Round there.

607
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,520
And… All right. Now let's try a parallel park.

608
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,640
How did your date go with the, uh… teacher?

609
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,480
Uh… it, uh, wasn't the best.

610
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,960
What did you do?

611
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,640
Well, it's more what I didn't do.

612
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
-Did you let her pay for dinner? -No.

613
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,200
I, uh… struggle, you know, sometimes to get it going in the penile department.

614
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,000
-Careful! -Oh my God!

615
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,440
Why did you tell me that?

616
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,800
Oh, the images. Jesus Christ!

617
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,160
-Sorry. I thought we tell stuff now. -Not that! Never that.

618
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,400
-I thought you took Viagra. -I do. It…

619
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,200
-Hang on. How did you know? -We're not talking about that.

620
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,600
I'll go in. We'll never talk about this again.

621
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,960
Good lesson. Sorry for oversharing. Won't happen again.

622
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,320
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

623
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,120
I… I think you've got performance anxiety.

624
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
Thinking doesn't overcome fear.

625
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,160
Action does.

626
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,080
And never take more than one Viagra.

627
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,600
Your penis will explode.

628
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,480
Gloria, it's Michael. I've got the little blue pills, and I'm feeling manly.

629
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,520
Well, it's definitely Mum.

630
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,520
And she's definitely… dead.

631
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
They said that we can go.

632
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,080
I wanna finish my crossword.

633
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,040
It's just, uh… Mo is giving me a lift.

634
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,120
-And I kinda wanna get out of here. -Mmm. It's okay. You can go. I'm fine.

635
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,840
Okay. Uh…

636
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,160
-What do you want me to tell your mates? -Tell them I'll be out in a bit.

637
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,080
Okay. Uh…

638
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,400

Uh…

660
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,880
Oh… Uh…

661
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,240
Hi there. This is your host, Dr. Jean Milburn.

662
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,640
-I love your mum. -And joining me on Sexology tonight

663
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,160
is a brilliant young sex educator and influencer, O.

664
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,800
Wow, thank you so much. That was a very warm welcome.

665
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,200
-No… No! -And quite a compliment from yourself!

666
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,160
I am so happy to be here. I can't articulate that enough.

667
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,680
And I can't wait to take some of these calls together.

668
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
-Otis. -I mean…

669
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,440
I don't know about yourself, but working out…

670
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,880
-Hi. -Hi. Um…

671
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,720
I'm gonna head off, uh, but Maeve's still in there.

672
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,520
She's just finishing her crossword.

673
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,840
Okay. Is everythin' all right?

674
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,400
No, not really.

675
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
My mum died.

676
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,200
Fuck.

677
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,240
Oh my God, Sean. I'm so sorry.

678
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,240
Should we go and get Maeve?

679
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,400
Um…

680
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I wouldn't.

681
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,240
I'd just let her do her thing.

682
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,720
Do you wanna sit with us?

683
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,320
Uh…

684
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
-No. -You all right?

685
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,560
-Yeah. No, I'm fine. -Sure?

686
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,120
Have a good day, guys

687
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,720
Ooh!

688
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,600
Mum. Hello.

689
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,040
Eric, would you like to come and help me at the soup kitchen tonight?

690
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,720
Oh… I can't. I'm going to Abbi's.

691
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,760
We're watching Jennifer's Body and gonna do pedicures.

692
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,040
But maybe next time.

693
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
♪ Yes I do, yes I do… ♪

694
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,320
See this.

695
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,280
What? No. Oh my gosh.

696
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,400
Why do birds hate me?

697
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,120
Why are you laughing?

698
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,760
This is the second bird that has pooed on me today.

699
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,280
That means you're very lucky.

700
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,040
Oh, well, dunno about that.

701
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,520
Can you spare some change for a meal tonight?

702
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,080
Oh gosh. I don't have any cash on me.

703
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,680
But there is a soup kitchen at the village hall tonight.

704
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,320
I don't know where that is. Show me?

705
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,720
I can't. I can't go dressed like this.

706
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,720
But, um… if you… if you take this street, take a left, you'll definitely find it.

707
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,200
Come on, lucky boy. You can spare a few minutes of your time.

708
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,560
I… I am late, but, yes, we're walking.

709
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,240
Was there anyone I can call for you to come and pick you up?

710
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,680
No, it's okay. I have a lift.

711
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,040
This is run by my church, so you'll get a good meal.

712
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,800
Oh my gosh.

713
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,240
Uh… Ah.

714
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,680
Okay, so this is the soup kitchen.

715
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,920
I hope you have a great meal tonight. I need to go, okay?

716
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,960
You're leaving?

717
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,240
-Yeah. -This is where you belong.

718
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,640
Eric! You changed your mind.

719
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,440
What are you wearing?

720
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,000
I wasn't supposed to be here, Mum, was I?

721
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,160
We are totally run off our feet.

722
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,480
Okay. I'll make a phone call.

723
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,720
Thank you, my son.

724
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,080
Hey, Abbi, so I'm helpin' out at the village hall,

725
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,400
at the soup kitchen tonight, and they're really short on staff, so I'm sorry.

726
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,640
Don't hate me.

727
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,680
All interpersonal relationships have boundaries.

728
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Now, they aren't often spoken about,

729
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,600
but they are mutually understood

730
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,960
to be limits within the relationship.

731
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,520
Now, if a person doesn't know their own boundaries,

732
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,160
then that can cause resentment in the relationship.

733
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,120
-The opposite-- -Uh…

734
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,560
Do you think maybe we should go to a caller now?

735
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,960
Yes, that's a great idea. Thank you, O.

736
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,240
All right. We have Martin.

737
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,840
Martin, you're on the line.

738
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,040
Yes. Yes. Ahem…

739
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,280
Yes. Hello.

740
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,240
I was calling because I was having relations

741
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,840
with a new lady friend,

742
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,560
and I was struggling to perform.

743
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,000
I used some Viagra, but it did nothing.

744
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,640
Is there a problem with my manhood?

745
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:13,160
Uh, for listeners who don't know, Viagra is the brand name of sildenafil,

746
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,680
which is a medicine used for erectile dysfunction.

747
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,200
Martin, this lady friend.

748
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,560
Could you tell us more about that situation?

749
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,440
Well, I've, um… recently separated from my wife.

750
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,200
I'm living in a new place, and I've just started a new job.

751
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Wow, sounds like a lot of change.

752
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,520
Well, I wonder if those two things are maybe related?

753
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,600
And I'm getting the nod here from Dr. Milburn, so…

754
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,520
Yes, uh, struggles with erections can often be psychological.

755
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,120
So I think it's important that you look at the emotional

756
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,480
as well as the physical.

757
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,320
Do you mind me asking where your brain went during the sex?

758
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,320
I was thinking about my wife.

759
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,680
Sorry. My ex-wife.

760
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,720
I miss her.

761
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,960
She's moved on, and I thought if I could have a fling,

762
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,680
I might be able to move on too.

763
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,760
But it was humiliating and made me feel pathetic,

764
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,280
like I'm not a real man.

765
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,600
Can I ask you a question?

766
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,680
Did the sex feel like you were cheating?

767
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,080
It did.

768
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,920
It felt like a betrayal.

769
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,760
I'm wondering, Martin,

770
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,000
if you might be someone who just operates better

771
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,120
when you have a secure connection.

772
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,000
And when you do, your penis functions properly.

773
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,640
Do you mean…

774
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,240
my penis has to be in love?

775
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,320
I think that you might need to find a way to cut all emotional ties with your ex

776
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,600
so that your penis is free to let go and move on.

777
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,080
Okay. Okay.

778
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,120
And no doubt, your manhood is still intact,

779
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,760
regardless of the blood flow to your penis.

780
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,840
-Wow. -Thanks for your call, Martin.

781
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,160
-God, they're good together. -Let's go to another one.

782
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,880
-Oh. Sorry. -Next up, we have Susan.

783
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,800
-Hello, Susan. -Hi there.

784
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,640
I wanted to talk about role play.

785
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,560
Ta.

786
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,560
-All right, Savior, where do you want me? -Hi! What are you doing here?

787
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,960
-You said you needed help. -Are you sure? You really don't need to.

788
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,400
-Yeah, I want to. -Yeah?

789
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,040
I used to do stuff like this with my church all the time.

790
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,880
Okay. Well, my mum is over there. She's in a blue jumper.

791
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,240
She's the boss. She'll tell you everything you need to know.

792
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,280
-Okay? -It's Abbi, Eric's friend.

793
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,360
-Oh, hello. -It's so nice to meet you finally.

794
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,400
How are those potatoes looking?

795
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,080
It's wonderful to have people outside the church come to help.

796
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,920
It's just so sad we've lost our funding, so this place will have to shut down.

797
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,120
Um… Sorry. Do you want some plantain?

798
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,280
-Yes please. -Yeah?

799
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,600
-Thank you. -There you go. No worries.

800
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,200
Right. Okay. So…

801
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,680
It was a real pleasure, Dr. Milburn.

802
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,800
You too, O.

803
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,320
-She's great. -Yeah.

804
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,560
And you did a lot better, too, little fella.

805
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,200
See you next time?

806
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,360
