00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,520
Hey!

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,080
I haven't seen you in ages!

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,680
Oh my God!

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,040
Do I have to go?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
Camp's only for a couple of nights.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,640
And you're with all your schoolmates. It'll be fun.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
You sure you don't want to bring the special pants?

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,360
Sh. No. It hasn't happened for ages, okay.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm going now.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,200
Have fun, Rubes!

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,160
Love you.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,120
-What is she wearing? -"Love you!"

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,040
She stinks.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,280
Been to the charity shop again, Ruby?

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,000
Ew!

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Ruby, this is Sarah. She's new. I want you to look after her, please.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,040
Hi.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,640
-Hi. -Come on.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
-Which bunk do you want? -This one looks good.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,360
Ew. Can anyone smell something bad?

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,280
-It's just Ruby Matthews. -Yeah.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
Poor people always stink.

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,320
Who was that?

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
That's Darla. She doesn't let anyone into her group.

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,040
She seems unpleasant.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,360

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
No. I spilled some water.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,400
I've got some spare pajamas.

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,200

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
No.

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,080
Um… I've gotta go.

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,760
-I'm not gonna be back till late tonight. -All right. Well, have fun.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,920
-Thanks. -Ah!

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,800
-See ya. -Where are you off to looking all fancy?

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm going to a queer night later with a friend.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,680
-I'm his wingman. -Hmm!

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,440
What do you think?

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,760
Come here.

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,280
Oh…

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,880
-I don't-- -A bit of eyeliner.

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,800
-Okay. Uh… -Lovely. And now the other side.

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,240
-Ah! Oh! Yeah, that's in my eye. -There we are.

63
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,440
-Now you're perfect. -Really?

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
Great. Thank you.

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,240
-You're welcome. -See you later.

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,720
Oh,

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,800
-Can I have my dress, please? -What dress?

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,520
-The one you're wearing. -It was on the drying rack.

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,920
There was a scarf on the drying rack too. White with flowers.

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,080
Are you gonna thank me for, uh… the cleaning?

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,160
Thank you for cleaning. And for stealing my clothes.

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,040
Oh, I've got this baby group thing. Do you want to come with me?

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Um… No. I'm good. I think I'm just gonna hang out here.

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,960
What's that creepy tree house all about?

75
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,280
My ex built it. Never really liked it.

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,360
The ex that's not Joy's father?

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,360
You can do your own washing later if you want.

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,920
-Hey. -Are you on your way?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,080
-I need help. -With what?

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,880
Decidin' what to wear.

81
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,440
I've got too many options.

82
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,760
I've confused myself, and I'm in fashion hell.

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,960
But, dude, it's… it's only two o'clock. What's the big rush?

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,760
Otis, this is my first proper gay night out.

85
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,760
It is a big deal, and I must prepare!

86
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,640
I know it's a big deal.

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I just have to go to Ruby's first.

88
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
Does Maeve know you're hangin' out?

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,880
We're not hangin' out. She's helping with my campaign.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
And, no, Maeve doesn't know.

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,920
-I told you we had a fight. -Is she still not talkin' to you?

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,240
Uh… We…

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,480
I don't know if she's not talking to me, but I'm not talking to her.

94
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,760
-We're not even officially together, so… -What time are you gonna get here?

95
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,880
I don't know, like…

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
-Seven-ish. -Seven?

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,640
Otis, I can't glam myself alone for five hours.

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,400
Well, I'll be there as soon as I can.

99
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,640
You--

100
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,520
No!

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
No…

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Go, go that way!

103
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,400
-Molloy hasn't read your chapter? -No, I haven't heard anything.

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,240
I'd ask him what he thinks.

105
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,360
No. I don't wanna seem desperate.

106
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,000
You've gotta stop being so meek and British.

107
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,080
You're in America now. You can ask for what you want.

108
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Mm-hmm. Really?

109
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,800
Guys, I got the internship.

110
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,520
Molloy just called me to his office.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm going with him to this book launch next week,

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,960
where he's gonna introduce me to his publisher.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,000
-Can you believe it? -Wow.

114
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,160
Congratulations.

115
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
Yeah. Congrats, that's amazing.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,040
I gotta go call my mom. She's gonna lose her shit!

117
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,640
Are you okay?

118
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
Yeah. How about you?

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,160
It's stupid. I convinced myself I might actually get it.

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
I kinda knew she was gonna get it.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,400
Her brother went to Wallace, and, um… her dad donated a building or somethin'.

122
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
Her chapter was about how hard it is to go to boarding school.

123
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
Yeah.

124
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,560
I mean, I… I love Ellen, but she's never gonna get

125
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,120
why an opportunity like this is such a big deal for us.

126
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,400
Don't worry about it.

127
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,480
You're an amazing writer, and there will be other things.

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,280
Hello.

129
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,120
-Hiya. I brought cakes. -Hi.

130
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,920
-What's on them? -Oh, my squirrels. I miss them so much.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,480
It's Sadie, Simon, Selina, and Bruce, 'cause he looks like my stepdad.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,920
Right. Who are you?

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,520
Oh, I'm Aimee. Is Isaac in?

134
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
I said it's for me.

135
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,760
-Aimee. -Hi.

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
This is my brother, Joe.

137
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
-Who is leaving. -Am I?

138
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,160
Yes. I said I needed the caravan today, remember?

139
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,120
-Without you playing video games in it. -Fine.

140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
I'm goin' out.

141
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Cool. Which one's Sadie?

142
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,800
Bye, Isaac.

143
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,480
Goodbye.

144
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,080
Rubes!

145
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,920
The person who I'm not allowed to mention by name is here.

146
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
How have you been?

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,360
If you make my daughter cry again, it will not be good for you.

148
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,160
-Why do you look like a French pirate? -I'm going to a--

149
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,440
No, I don't have all day. I'm meeting Anwar and Olivia.

150
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,400
You'll just have to lose the eyeliner and borrow some of Dad's clothes, okay?

151
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,960
He's helping us with the video.

152
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,040
What video?

153
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,680
Ah, yes!

154
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,920
-Hey, Savior. -Hi!

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,920
Hi!

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,040
What are you doing? We're at Roman's. Do you wanna come over?

157
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm gettin' ready to go to a queer night later.

158
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,920
Emerald City?

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,320
-Yeah. -We were thinkin' of goin'.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
-Let's all go together. -Oh my God!

161
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,040
-Please! -Come.

162
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,400
-Uh, yeah. -Please!

163
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,000
-Please! -Yeah, let's do it.

164
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,560
Do you wanna get ready together?

165
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, I'm… I'm waitin' for Otis to, uh… finish a thing.

166
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,320
-Fine. Tell him he can swing by later. -Yeah.

167
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,840
Come. It'd be fun.

168
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,680
-You know you want to. -We'll have a ball.

169
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes.

170
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,080
Yes!

171
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,600
Hmm…

172
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,760
Don't you think I should wear something a bit more hip?

173
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,080
No. This outfit is great. You could be anyone.

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,040
Which means people can project what they want onto you.

175
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Mmm.

176
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,320
Oh, whoa. I don't need that, do I?

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,000
He does need it.

178
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,840
-Your skin looks like an onion, Otis. -Um…

179
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,520
-Uh… -Thank you.

180
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,840
Smile.

181
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,240
Ugh…

182
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
Okay!

183
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280
Here?

184
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,600
Yes.

185
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,280
Okay.

186
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,080
And we're rolling.

187
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,720
Should I start?

188
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes.

189
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
Sorry, I thought you'd say "action."

190
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,160
Oh my God. Dad, please say "action."

191
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,920
And… action.

192
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,640
♪ I am Otis Milburn, and I'm here to say I'm the best therapist you'll hear today ♪

193
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
Cut!

194
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,080
What the hell are you doing?

195
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,720
I'm responding to O's video.

196
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,120
O is dynamic, interesting, and mysterious.

197
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,360
She can rap.

198
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
You are none of those things.

199
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
So, you need a clean message,

200
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,000
which is why I've made you a script.

201
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,880
Just relax and be normal.

202
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,920
And… action.

203
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,360
Hello there.

204
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm the original sex therapist, formerly practicing at Moordale Secondary.

205
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm compassionate and honest.

206
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,400
I will meet you where you're at. This is bad.

207
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,680
-Before starting my clinic… -Why does he look so startled?

208
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,480
-I don't know. -…the students were lost and uned---

209
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,680
This isn't working. This is ridiculous.

210
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,320
O is better at this than I am.

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,000
She's better at being cool. She's probably a better therapist.

212
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,320
-Otis. Otis! -I'm hot.

213
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,880
Otis.

214
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Listen to me.

215
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,640
You know you are good at talking to people.

216
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
You make them feel heard.

217
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
Now, forget the camera. Forget the script.

218
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,240
Pretend I'm a client,

219
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,480
and you're telling me why I should listen to you.

220
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay?

221
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,880
Hi, I'm Otis Milburn, and I'm running for student counselor.

222
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,480
And I am also a bit of a mess.

223
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,800
I am incredibly awkward, and I struggle with public speaking.

224
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
I suffer from anxiety.

225
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,680
And I often don't like the way my body looks.

226
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,840
I didn't kiss anyone until I was 16,

227
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,520
and I've had problems wanking and fingering.

228
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,200
I've had my heart broken by people I like, and I've hurt people who like me.

229
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,960
And I feel misunderstood a lot of the time.

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
So…

231
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,640
I am a mess, but I think all teenagers are,

232
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,360
and I think that's why it's so important that we can talk.

233
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800

Welcome to Tickle Tots.

241
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Let's start by going around the room,

242
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,800
saying you and your baby's names, their age,

243
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,520
and an interesting fact about yourself.

244
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,400
Hello.

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,680
My name's Jean, and this is Joy.

246
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,000
She's eight weeks old.

247
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,560
And, um…

248
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,920
Interesting fact, well…

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
Aah…

250
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,040
I almost died when giving birth.

251
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,360
It happened very suddenly,

252
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,640
and I thought for a very split second

253
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,880
that maybe I wouldn't get to meet my baby or see my son again.

254
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,800
And, um… well, it was terrifying.

255
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,840
But, um… but we're fine now.

256
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,280
And, uh… Well, except Joy cries quite a lot.

257
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,440
And I'm a little bit worried that it might be because of my stress

258
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,600
because of the birth,

259
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,080
and, well, my sister's staying with us,

260
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,840
and I've gone back to work.

261
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,120
Um…

262
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,960
And also, my partner left because he is…

263
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
he's not the father.

264
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,720
Sorry, um… it's not very interesting.

265
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,640
Worries, I guess.

266
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,840
Welcome, Jean.

267
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,360
-Mmm. -Hi, Jean.

268
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,360
Hi, welcome.

269
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,560
Ahem. I'm Geri. This is Marlow.

270
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,000
She's ten weeks old,

271
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,000
and I like to dip the entire digestive in the mug

272
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,320
and suck the tea through it like a biscuity straw.

273
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm the same!

274
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,280
Checks first.

275
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,120
Okay.

276
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,880
Now gently lift your left foot off the clutch.

277
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,680
Left foot. That's your right foot.

278
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,600
Yeah. Mm-hm.

279
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,080
Good. Now, stop.

280
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,520
-Stop! -You didn't teach me how to stop!

281
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,640
-Oh, Jesus Christ, Adam! -You didn't tell me how to stop.

282
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,200
This was a mistake.

283
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,080
I am capable of patience. I am trying to be a better me.

284
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,160
Adam, you're right. I didn't teach you how to stop.

285
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,400
It's my fault. I am sorry I yelled.

286
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Why do you keep saying sorry? It's freaking me out.

287
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,680
I'm doing an online course. It's called Being a Better Man.

288
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,040
It's helping, I think.

289
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
Please.

290
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,760
Shall we try again?

291
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,960
Welcome to me humble abode!

292
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,160
Hi! You look amazing!

293
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,600
-Oh, thank you. So do you. -Thank you.

294
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,080
Make yourself at home.

295
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
I forgot to say to bring swimmin' shorts.

296
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,880
But you can borrow some of mine if you feel like a dip in the pool.

297
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,560
The pool?

298
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,280
Stop it! Oi, oi! Hands up, Savior!

299
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,400
Don't even dare! Don't even dare!

300
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
No one's safe. Look.

301
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,640
-I'll get you those shorts now. -Um… Hold my flippin' glass.

302
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,760
-Are you kiddin'? -No, he's not.

303
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,880
-Yes, she is! -No, he is not!

304
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,720
Whoo!

305
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,120
So, you could do sculpture.

306
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,320
Or there's printmaking as well, here.

307
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,760
But it's about finding what's the right expression for you.

308
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,720
Yeah.

309
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,520
I don't think I get art.

310
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,080
What makes you decide how to decorate your cakes?

311
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,320
-Dunno, just what I feel on the day. -Well, that's basically art.

312
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,280
Is that someone's bed?

313
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,280
Yeah.

314
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,520
Yeah, that's Tracey Emin.

315
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,120
It's what her bed looked like after she'd had a depressive episode.

316
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,120
And then she put it in a gallery. How badass is that?

317
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,560
And this over here is Ana Mendieta.

318
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,960
She took loads of photographs of herself.

319
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,640
A lot of female artists like to use self-portraiture.

320
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,440
Maybe it's because other people don't see them how they really are.

321
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

322
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,120
Do you have a camera?

323
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,760
Um… Do you have any sort of regular income?

324
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,240
Um, I work… mainly in the wellness industry.

325
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,720
I… I do Reiki, and, um, I teach reflexology.

326
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,480
And I sold cold press juicers for a bit.

327
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,640
-Oh, okay. -And these days, I am a nanny.

328
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
Oh, I love babies. Babies are the best.

329
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,240
-Oh. -Uh…

330
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,360
Cool. Okay. So, uh… we will need to run a… a credit check.

331
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,560
I…

332
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't have a… like, a credit… score.

333
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,920
Yeah, I… I've recently just come back from overseas, so…

334
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,280
-Ah! Whereabouts? -Oh, well, um… yeah, I…

335
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,640
I've spent a lot of time in Thailand and Malaysia.

336
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
That's so cool. Uh, it's kind of my dream to go to New Zealand, if I'm honest.

337
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,120
I wanna see where they shot Lord of the Rings. It's just…

338
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,480
I know it's dumb, but…

339
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,760
"We wants it."

340
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,520
"And we needs it."

341
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,280
"We must have the precious."

342
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,880
It's such a… Ah, it's…

343
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,200
Um. Ahem. Uh, anyway, where was I? Sorry. Uh, do…

344
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
-What sort of, um… assets do you own? -Uh…

345
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,720
None. In terms of material wealth.

346
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,800
Oh.

347
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Okay, listen. I… Unfortunately, I think it's pretty unlikely

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
we're gonna be able to offer you any kind of loan today, Joanna.

349
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,400
-Can I just get a credit card? -Absolutely not.

350
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
-Right. -No. But, um…

351
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,480
What I did wonder was whether or not it would be okay to…

352
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
…ask for your number?

353
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,400
Jo? I thought you were staying at home.

354
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,000
Uh, yeah, the, uh… the bank, uh… they blocked my card.

355
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,000
Fell for one of those bloody text scam things.

356
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
Right.

357
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,960
Are you gonna take me home?

358
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,440
Nice belt.

359
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720

Oh, uh, this is my mate. Dave.

Dave.

369
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,160
Do you take any prescription medication?

370
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
Cipralex. For anxiety.

371
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Are you a smoker?

372
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,600
I had one. Once.

373
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,200
I lost my voice.

374
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,560
Do you have any health issues in your family?

375
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,520
Blood pressure problems, heart disease, cancer?

376
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,440
No. My mums are pretty healthy.

377
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,560
I don't know my dad. He was a sperm donor.

378
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,520
Okay, you're all done.

379
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,360
-Was everything all right down there? -Let's do some blood tests.

380
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,640
And I'm going to refer you for an ultrasound.

381
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,200
Just to be on the safe side.

382
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,400
Hmm.

383
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,800
Why did you ask about my parents?

384
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,160
Well, some illnesses can be hereditary.

385
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,960
You know, I thought I was gay for about a week when I was 15.

386
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
I saw this film with Clint Eastwood.

387
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,320
I couldn't stop thinking about him carrying a gun.

388
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Then I realized I just wanted to be Clint Eastwood, not have sex with him.

389
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,840
Dad, this course you're doing is making you really weird.

390
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,920
I saw your friend…

391
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,880
Eric at school.

392
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,160
He said you weren't friends anymore.

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,320
And I thought maybe you'd want to talk about it.

394
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm okay.

395
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,920
I mean, it was hard.

396
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,160
But it doesn't…

397
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,320
hurt as much as it did.

398
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,440
Also, I'm not gay.

399
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm bisexual.

400
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
They say Alexander the Great may have been bisexual.

401
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,080
What is it?

402
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,520
It's a teacher from school asking me out for dinner.

403
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,600
-A date? -No. No, just dinner, I think.

404
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,360
She sent you a winky face. She's asking you on a date.

405
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,080
You should go.

406
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,480
Is your mother seeing anyone?

407
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
Um…

408
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,720
She's taking self-defense classes,

409
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,760
and I think she might be… dating her instructor.

410
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,880
Is it serious?

411
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,240
I think she's seeing a few people.

412
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,960
This is, uh… really good.

413
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,360
I wanna wear this, but I do want somethin' sparkly.

414
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,880
-Mmm! -Oh, look who it is! Hey!

415
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,040
-No idea what to wear. -You'll find something.

416
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,960
What about this? I reckon it's more you than me anyway.

417
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,320
-Ooh, look at that. -Ooh!

418
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,800
This could be a vibe.

419
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,800
-Do you want me to help? -Yeah. Thank you.

420
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,720
-Got it? -Yeah.

421
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,680
-Stunning. -Yes!

422
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,840
That was made for you!

423
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,760
-Yes! -I need a pic of this.

424
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,760
-And pose. -Oh!

425
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,680
-Mmm! -And pose.

426
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
Oh, you look amazing.

427
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,400
-No, I love it! -Oh!

428
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,120
Your friend has put up a campaign video.

429
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,800
-Oh, okay! -He's so cute.

430
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,160
Oh!

431
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
How long have you guys been friends?

432
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,400
We've been best friends since primary school.

433
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,400
You seem really different.

434
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,400
Yeah.

435
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,520
Yeah. No, we are. Uh…

436
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,000
He's always been my person, though. But I guess…

437
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,080
I don't know. I guess, um…

438
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,360
Sometimes, I feel like he doesn't entirely get me.

439
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,120
I think that's why I don't have many straight friends.

440
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,120
Me either. So much emotional labor!

441
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Aah!

442
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,640
I also think sometimes straight people can just be a bit basic.

443
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,360
Okay, Roman. Let's not be mean. Otis is Eric's friend.

444
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,080
I was only agreeing with Eric.

445
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,880
Sometimes it's just hard to, you know, bridge the gap.

446
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,200
Okay, it's getting a bit heavy.

447
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,800
Do you know what we need? We need some of this.

453
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,240
-Do you want a snack? -I'm good. Thanks.

454
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,640
I was gonna do a face mask and watch a film later. You fancy it?

455
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
No, thanks. I'm good.

456
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,440
Okay.

457
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,440
I can't see anything.

458
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,720
The lens cap's still on.

459
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,600
Oh.

460
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,360
If you move that front dial to the left, then it will focus.

461
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The numbers behind that are the aperture.

462
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,040
The lower the number, the more light you let in.

463
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,800
And there's a self-timer you can use as well.

464
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,960
Oh, right. Okay. Um…

465
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,160
-Are these for your portfolio? -Yeah.

466
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Can I?

467
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,720
Yeah, sure.

468
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,800
We moved around a lot when we were younger.

469
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,480
-Have you always lived with your brother? -Yeah.

470
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,160
-I wanna move out on my own soon, though. -Oh.

471
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Maybe get a teaching degree and earn a bit of money that way.

472
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,680
But I just don't know how to talk to him about it yet.

473
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,920
I thought you did art just 'cause you liked painting.

474
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
-This looks very personal. -Ah…

475
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,160
Yeah, I… I suppose…

476
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,800
I've had a lot of anger growing up in care.

477
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,000
And painting helped me feel less, um…

478
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
sad.

479
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,760
Yeah.

480
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,680
When I got sad as a kid,

481
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,880
I'd bury all my mum's jewelry in the garden so she couldn't find it.

482
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,000
-It's probably still there, actually. -You're a maverick.

483
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,400
What does that mean?

484
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,760
It means that you don't think like other people.

485
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,440
I thought that was being stupid.

486
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,680
No, no, no. It means that you're your own person.

487
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm home.

488
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh.

489
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,960
Do you have any cakes left?

490
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,800
Yeah, loads. Have 'em all. Um… I've gotta go.

491
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,880
So… right now.

492
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,040
Have a nice evening!

493
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,520
-Don't forget the camera. -Oh, thank you.

494
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
-Bye! -Bye.

495
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,080
Bit of a strange fish, that one.

496
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,160
I've had problems wanking and fingering. I've had my heart broken…

497
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,320
If I was 17 and still an idiot, I'd vote for you.

498
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,640
-Ah, thanks. -…I feel misunderstood a lot of the time.

499
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,320
-Ooh. It's already got 40 views. -So… I am a mess.

500
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,680
-Forty views is shit, Otis. -All teenagers are.

501
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,120
-Yeah, well… -That's why it's so important we can talk.

502
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,680
Thanks for all the help today. You guys were great.

503
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,240
It's fine.

504
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
Righty-ho. I'm gonna get the nachos ready.

505
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,920
We're watching Third Wives of Miami tonight.

506
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,240
I thought you were seeing Anwar and Olivia tonight?

507
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,080
Oh, our plans changed. Didn't you have somewhere to be tonight?

508
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,040
Yeah, I need to find out where I'm going.

509
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,240

No, I decided not to go.

You so got uninvited.

537
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,200
Eric's friends with the popular kids now, and he doesn't want you tagging along.

538
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,880
That's harsh.

539
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,200
Even for you.

540
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
Oh my God. No, you're actually upset. Okay.

541
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,280
Do you wanna stay for nachos with me and my dad?

542
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,680
Uh…

543
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,560
I don't know, Ruby. I'm with Maeve now. Kind of. It's a bit weird.

544
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,480
-What are you trying to say? -Nothing.

545
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,680
Just that you're suddenly being very nice to me.

546
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,560
-And you're helping me with this campaign. -Don't flatter yourself.

547
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,160
If you must know, I went to primary school with O.

548
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,080
Except she was called Sarah Owen back then.

549
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,080
Never have I ever kissed Henry Gold with tongues.

550
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,040
New girl. Your go.

551
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,240
Can you not speak or something?

552
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,360
Never have I ever

553
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,400
wet the bed on school camp.

554
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,360
Oh my God. No.

555
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,200
Ruby, you need to drink.

556
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,160
She put the stinky piss sheets under her mattress.

557
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,720
-Oh my God! -I always knew she was a bed wetter!

558
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,680
-That's why she stinks. -Pisser!

559
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,480
-Please stop! -Bed wetter!

560
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,840
-Bed wetter! -Bed wetter!

561
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,040
Bed wetter! Bed wetter! Bed wetter! Bed wetter!

562
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,800
They put the video online, so everyone found out.

563
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,000
Ruby, that's awful.

564
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,160
-I'm sorry. -Bed wetter! Bed wetter!

565
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,800
You know, there's nothing to be ashamed of.

566
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,440
And being bullied can easily contribute to nocturnal enuresis.

567
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,280
-Ugh, I don't need you to go… -It's a really…

568
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,560
…into therapist mode right now, Otis.

569
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,440
I saw a specialist. Got it under control.

570
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,400
Obviously.

571
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,440
Well, I'm glad you spoke with someone.

572
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,320
I mean, primary school was… hell, anyway.

573
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,080
I was the weird girl with the weird parents whose mum made her clothes,

574
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,640
I didn't think it could get worse. And then this happened.

575
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,480
I ate lunch every day in the toilets by myself till I left.

576
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,440
Because nobody wants to sit with the bed wetter.

577
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,240
Ruby. That's not fair.

578
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,760
No, don't. Please don't look at me like that with the pity eyes.

579
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,200
-I will throw up. -Okay.

580
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,120
Looking at you with normal eyes.

581
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,360
So this is about revenge.

582
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,200
I just think it's rich that she's walking around,

583
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,760
preaching kindness, and pretending she doesn't know who I am.

584
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,120
Rubes, I feel a bit dizzy. Uh… I think I'm gonna have to lie down.

585
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,520
-Okay, Dad. Do you want some help? -No. I'm okay.

586
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,640
Uh, nachos are in the oven.

587
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,760
Look, it's fine if you can't stay. I get it's awkward with Maeve.

588
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,320
No, I want to.

589
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,040
Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

590
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,000
My mom and dad are so happy.

591
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,720
Writing's what I've always wanted to do ever since I was a kid,

592
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,560
and used to put on plays and stuff.

593
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,920
Yeah.

594
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,840
This is huge.

595
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,120
He knows everyone. It will definitely help me get into Wallace.

596
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,920
I had a pretty good chance, but now I probably will, you know?

597
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm so lucky. I am so lucky.

And then t-here were two.

612
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,080
So I was thinking we could get a head start on trigonometry?

613
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,040
-Particularly cofunctioning identities. -You're so smart.

Sorry, I know that was cringe, but I… thought I'd say it.

615

You're really beautiful. You love maths, and I love maths.

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,360

-You spoke to your dad about me? -I tell him everything.

620
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,440
We're close, but he's not been well recently, um…

621
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,600
He had a stroke, so he can't speak very well.

684

I don't think they'd vote for her.

698
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,160
I sometimes feel like I'm getting left behind.

699
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,520
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

700
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,400
I wasn't going to hang out with Anwar and Olivia this evening.

701
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,880
They have made loads of new friends,

702
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
and they don't have time to see me.

703
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,080
I'm glad we're hanging out.

704
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,520
Stop talking, Otis. You're ruining the episode.

705
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,760
Come in.

706
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,240
-Hi. -Hi, Maeve.

707
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720
Can I help you with something?

708
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,520
Yeah, um… I was wondering if you've had a chance to read my new chapter yet.

709
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,640
Yeah, I have.

710
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,360
Okay, great. Um, what did you think?

711
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,160
I thought it was a little soapy. I could see what you were doing.

712
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,840
It was like a Victorian novel set in a modern-day trailer park,

713
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,320
but it was underdeveloped, and the characters weren't fully realized.

714
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
Oh, okay.

715
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,360
I thought I'd taken on your feedback.

716
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,120
Trying to write from a more honest place.

717
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,480
What did Ellen do differently?

718
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,080
She… she just told us she got the internship.

719
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,960
I think she showed great potential.

720
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,680
Why? Do you disagree with my choice?

721
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,840
Do you somehow feel like you are more deserving?

722
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,920
No! No. I just…

723
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,680
I'd like to know what I can do to be better and get ahead.

724
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,440
Well, after reading that, and your Brontë piece,

725
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,200
I'm not sure you're cut out to be a writer.

726
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,960
We have very high standards here.

727
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,720
And like I said in our first class,

728
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,360
writing is a very tough business,

729
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,720
so I wouldn't want you to… get your hopes up.

730
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,360
Okay.

731
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,800

732
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480

People wait up to five years for their first appointment,
