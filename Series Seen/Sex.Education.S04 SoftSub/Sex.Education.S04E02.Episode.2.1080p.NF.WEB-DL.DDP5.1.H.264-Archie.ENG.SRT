Oh fuck.

00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,440
She won't stop crying.

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,680
Can you do your thing?

25
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,840
Yep. Hang on.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,600
-What's the matter? -I don't know.

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
-She's just… -Hey! What's the matter?

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
Hey, why are you crying?

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,160
I can't find anything

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,920
that doesn't have sick, or breast milk.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
-Or smell… -Yes, I can do it too.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
Ah! Bwaaaaah!

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,680
Oh, for f--

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,720
Turtle! Oh my…

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,280
Oh, well, you… you look like crap.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,600
Joanna? Why are you here?

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
Otis called me.

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
-Oh, my niece! -Hi.

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,240
When did you get so fucking tall? Shit.

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,880
-You got her? -I need to learn to not swear as much.

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,440
You called my sister?

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
We need help.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,800
We'll talk about it later.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Wow! Your house is a mess!

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,400
Can you grab my bags?

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,760
Aren't you gonna shower? Otis said you're starting a new job today.

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,040
-How long are you staying, exactly? -Well, as long as you need.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
Oh! Yes.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,240
-Oh, whee! -No, she can't really…

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,560
-Uh, she can't hold her head up yet. -I know.

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,800
I used to nanny for Bono. I'm great with babies.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,440
-Weren't you sacked? -That was because of the fire.

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
-Not the kids. -Oh.

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
Anyway, go and have a shower.

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,160
-Trust me. You need one. -Huh.

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Mm-hmm.

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Okay.

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,160
Is she doing okay? Uh…

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,360
-She's not herself. -Right.

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
And, uh… who's Joy's dad?

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Don't ask her about it. She gets very touchy.

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,040
-I've gotta go. -Bye.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,080
Hello, Joy. Hello.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,960
That's too much.

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,640
How long do you think it'll take to get some muscles?

66
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,280
Excuse me?

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,880
I'm just thinking about going to the gym.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
It's, like… it's good for your brain, exercise, so I'm gonna try it.

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,200
That's nice. And what's the real reason?

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,320
So Maeve's… Maeve made friends with this guy on her course called Tyrone,

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,440
and he's… he's ripped.

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,040
How ripped are we talking?

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,840
-Do you wanna see? -Yes.

74
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,320
-Really? -Yes.

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,200
Oh my God! He is hot!

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,200
W-- And so are you.

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
In a quiet and soft, intelligent way.

78
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,480
-Okay. -Yeah. There's no competition.

79
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,120
-Who cares about ripped bodies? -Really?

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
-No. Can I see that one more time? -You're shit.

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm sorry. I'm lying. He is so hot. My God, his body is insane!

82
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,440
His biceps have biceps.

83
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Morning.

84
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
Hey.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,760
Hey. I said, hey. Wait up!

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,280
How are you?

87
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,880
Oh, are you wanting to book an appointment?

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,760
It's me, Ruby Matthews. We went to primary school together.

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,080
I think you have me confused with someone else. Have a great day.

90
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,880
Baby, can we talk?

91
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,040
Not today, Abbi.

92
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,200
Are you okay?

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,200
Yeah. We had a little fight, but we'll be fine. It'll be fine.

94
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
I think Roman and Abbi are fighting.

95
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
What's that?

96
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh, just an ally coming through.

97
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,240
Hey.

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,720
Why do you keep blanking me? Thought we were cool.

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm just not ready to be your friend.

100
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,120
Yet.

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,880
Sorry.

102
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,240
Whoo-hoo!

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,920
-Sorry. -No, no, no.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,640
No, it's fine. I am fine.

105
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,040
Oh, thank you.

106
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm Gloria, by the way.

107
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,800
-Michael. -Nice aftershave, Michael.

108
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,080
-I'm not wearing any. -Lucky you.

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,280
Your father wants to come over and make dinner for us tonight.

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,400
-Why? -He's trying to make an effort.

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,160
-You're not getting back together? -No. We're not. I promise.

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,120
That's fine, I guess.

113
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,480
Oh, Adam.

114
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,280
Remember not to mumble.

115
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,920
Okay.

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,800
Um, what is with the original thing? I thought O started her clinic first.

118
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,120
There's no way she came up with this on her own.

119
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,640
She's obviously heard about my clinic and copied me.

120
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,600
What are you doing later?

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,120
Shall we hang out? Play Smash?

122
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,520
I'd love to, but my mum is making me go to this baptism class after college.

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm kind of dreadin' it.

124
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,120
How come?

125
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
Just, I'm not out there. It's like the only place I'm not anymore.

126
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah, it's kind of messed up.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
I don't think you should go.

128
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,200
Yeah, it's just… it's complicated.

129
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,160
-I feel like my mum is under pressure-- -Yeah. Morning, Otis.

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
Good morning.

131
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
I saw your website.

132
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,480
It was really cute. Oh, you've got a new room.

133
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,400
With biscuits. And what's that? Mint water?

134
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,200
How adorable. See ya.

135
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
-Huh. -She's really good.

136
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,640
-Hello. Jenny, good to see you. -Hmph.

137
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,080
-Thanks for comin' again. -Gah!

138
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,680
Oh God.

139
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,960
Oh.

140
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,720
-It's you again. -Hi.

141
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,320
God, is this lift broken again?

142
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,440
-You need to press the button. -Oh.

143
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
Lift going up.

144
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,800
Isaac, sometimes I say the first thing that pops into my head.

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,560
And what I said the other day, it was really, really stupid. I'm sorry.

146
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,640
Maeve thinks we'd really get on,

147
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,840
and I don't have many friends now she's gone,

148
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
so I was hoping that maybe we could start again.

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,600
Okay, let's start again.

150
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,760
Hello. Yeah.

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,640
Okay.

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,640
Good boy. Yeah.

153
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
-Good boy. -Why are you waiting out here?

154
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,840
I said to meet in the office. We were supposed to start ten minutes ago.

155
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
-Didn't know whether to go inside or not. -You coming?

156
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,400
Yeah.

157
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm assuming you ride?

158
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,480
Yep. I, uh… I ride bikes.

159
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,520
Horses.

160
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,080
Thought I'd be looking after dogs.

161
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,520
It said on the application there was kennels.

162
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,640
No. No, you'll mainly be teaching children how to ride horses.

163
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,480
You do ride?

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,640
Absolutely.

165
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,800
Love horse riding.

166
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
And you, uh, drive?

167
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,240
I am a great driver. I just… I don't have a car, though.

168
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,120
-Get the horse! -Okay. Can you muck out Midnight for me?

169
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,440
And then you can hose down the rest of the stables.

170
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,000
Mmm.

171
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,120
Would anyone like some digestives?

172
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,000
-I'm allergic to sugar. -Are they dairy free?

173
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,960
Ruby. Digestive?

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,840
I've had an idea that could help you.

175
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,720
And why would you want to help me?

176
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Because, Otis, I want us to be friends.

177
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't even keep a straight face.

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,640
No, this is purely political. Move.

179
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,880
Abbi and Roman are fighting.

180
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,800
Okay, so?

181
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,800
Every school has kingmakers, Otis, and at this college, it's them.

182
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,480
You fix their relationship,

183
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,960
everyone ditches O and comes to you instead.

184
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,880
What's in it for you?

185
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,960
Put in a good word for me with Abbi, so that she'll want to hang out with me.

186
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,440
I don't want to play games, Ruby.

187
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,000
I think if I just be myself,

188
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,640
people will eventually realize I am the better therapist.

189
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,880
Okay. Good luck with that, Otis.

190
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,560
Hey.

191
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,720
Hey. Hey, uh… I just finished this great statistics book.

192
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
Thought you might like it. Shall I send it to you?

193
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,880
-Yeah. -Uh…

194
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,160
Done.

195
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,120
Got it.

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,720
Do you wanna study with me this weekend?

197
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,840
I have to focus.

198
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,880
Oh God. No, no.

199
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,080
Did you… did you think I meant, like, a date or something? Um…

200
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,640
I ju…

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,360
-I didn't, 'cause that would be a leap. -Right. Yeah.

202
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,240
I honestly did mean for us to just study, but, um, I completely get that you can't.

203
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,800
So, yeah, hope you enjoy the book.

204
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,320
Thanks.

205
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,280

-You could seriously hurt yourself. -Okay, thanks.

218
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,760
-Okay, let's go. -Do this.

219
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,520
-Never seen you in here before. -I'm just… trying to stay fit.

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Has anyone ever put their finger up your bum before?

221
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,920
Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,960
Thought you were still doing that therapy thing.

223
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,880
I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't like you.

224
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,600
-I'm having casual sex with this girl. -Mmm?

225
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,840
And last time we did it, dude, she put her finger

226
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,080
up my bum.

227
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,920
-Okay. -I'm talking, like… like way up there.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
With no warnin'.

229
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,840
Like a ninja.

230
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,120
And now I'm feeling totally freaked out.

231
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,760
Did this act feel bad for you?

232
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,920
No, it felt great.

233
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,960
I mean, it was a shock.

234
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
But… I came.

235
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,560
Really fast. And now I'm feeling very confused.

236
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,240
Because I really didn't think I was queer.

237
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,000
But maybe, if I like this kind of thing, then I'm…

238
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,520
queerer than I thought.

239
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,440
Well, sexuality can be very fluid. And it's normal to have questions.

240
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,720
Plus, there's a lot of heterosexual men

241
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,280
who also like having their prostate stimulated.

242
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,560
-You boys using this bench? -No.

243
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,920
You all right? You seem disappointed?

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,680
I really like this person who it didn't work out with.

245
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,960
And I thought, maybe if I was, like, a little bit queer,

246
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,800
then I could get them back.

247
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,760
-We had a real connection. -You don't feel that with this new person?

248
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,200
I mean, she's nice, but there's not much conversation.

249
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,080
Even though you enjoyed yourself,

250
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,360
those things should never come as a surprise.

251
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,720
I would encourage you guys to practice enthusiastic consent,

252
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,360
which is looking for the presence of a happy yes,

253
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,000
rather than the absence of an unhappy no.

254
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,280
You might find better communication leads to a more intimate connection.

255
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,880
But being hung up on someone you still have feelings for is hard.

256
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,920
What is it you think you miss the most about them?

257
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,440
So my brain is often anxious. It's been like that since I can remember.

258
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,520
But when we were together, they kind of

259
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,960
made things go quiet for a second.

260
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,960
But I have this habit of falling for people that can't commit, so…

261
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,720
Mmm.

262
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,320
-Talking about Maeve? -Yes.

263
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,480
It always felt like she was lookin' for something better.

264
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,120
It's a shame about the whole college seeing your weird pubes thing.

265
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,240
-'Cause you're good at this. -Thanks, man.

266
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,600
Though the lead character was so unsavory, I didn't wanna leave him.

267
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,000
-I was haunted by his journey. -I agree.

268
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,000
The way you write about feeling isolated within your own community, it's, uh…

269
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
it's fascinating.

270
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,800
Brutal but eye-opening.

271
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,200
It's a little overwritten, but it's a promising start. Thank you, Tyrone.

272
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,200
Who's next? Maeve?

273
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,800
Talk to me about what you were aiming for with this first chapter.

274
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,400
So I was aiming to explore Maria Brontë's isolation through her illness.

275
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
-Um, she's the protagonist, so-- -Yeah, I--

276
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,840
I was bored.

277
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,520
-Oh. -I do not think this has a pulse.

278
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,560
Okay.

279
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,200
What does everyone else think?

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
You can be honest. We're here to help each other.

281
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
I liked that it was written from Maria's perspective.

282
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,400
I saw the world through her eyes.

283
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,800
I didn't know anything about the oldest Brontë sister.

284
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,560
Well, that's what Wikipedia's for.

285
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
There are lots of historical novels.

286
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
It's uh…

287
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,920
Okay, not trying to be mean here. I'm just trying to push you.

288
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,120
You're clearly very well-read, but this, it… it feels like imitation.

289
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,800
I wanna know who you are. I wanna hear your voice.

290
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,000
Okay? All right. We will continue this next class.

291
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,760
-We heard you and Roman are fighting. -We're sending positive thoughts.

292
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,160
Um, thank you.

293
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,240
If people focused on their own problems instead of other people's,

294
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,040
the world would be a better place.

295
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm gonna get a drink.

296
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,480
This is huge.

297
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,280
Abbi and Roman never fight.

298
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,760
-I want to know what happened so badly. -What…

299
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,640
So, what? She hasn't told you?

300
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,520
She says it's betraying Roman.

301
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,120
-Which I think is ridiculous. -Sh, she's coming.

302
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,000
-Please don't tell Abbi I gossiped. -No, no, no.

303
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,680
-I really hope you can work this out. -Thanks. I do too.

304
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,000
I booked us in with O, so hopefully, it'll be fine.

305
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
-Can I still crash at yours tonight? -Sure, any time.

306
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,600
You should come over to Aisha's later and hang out.

307
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,880
Oh, I'd love to, but I, um… I've got, like, a family thing.

308
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,360
-That's cool, next time. -Yeah.

309
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,440
I don't want to go there just yet. But did you guys just hear a fart?

310
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,920
-No! -Did someone fart?

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,520
-Wasn't me! -No!

312
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,560
You don't need to. You don't need to.

313
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Hello, hello, hello.

314
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,680
-Hey! Hello, hello. Hi. -Um…

315
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,400
-I was wondering if you'd do me a favor. -Mmm?

316
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,200
-So, you know Roman and Abbi are fighting? -Yes.

317
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,400
I was wondering if you could put in a good word for me and my clinic?

318
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,080
Ooh. I don't really know if I wanna play around in their relationship.

319
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,320
-Okay. -Know what I mean?

320
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,760
Yeah. No, that's fine. I get it. I was…

321
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,120
-It was probably a silly idea. Sorry. -No, no. No, I'm sorry.

322
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,800
-Uh… -It's fine.

323
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
-Mmm. -It's fine, honestly.

324
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,840
Um… I've gotta go. I'm gonna be late for church.

325
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,200
-But I will see you tomorrow. Yeah. -See you tomorrow, yeah.

326
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,720
-See you later. -See you later.

327
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,360
Okay, we're good to go.

328
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,920
Five, four, three, two, one.

329
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,160
You've got this, Jean.

330
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,080
Hello!

331
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,640
-I'm Dr. Jean Milburn. -Talk.

332
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,200
And I'm your host of this edition of

333
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
Sexology with Dr. Jean Milburn,

334
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,640
which is me, your host.

335
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,920
Oh, I've just said that.

336
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,640
So, call in and tell me your problems. Your sex and relationship problems.

337
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
What's the number, Jean?

338
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,480
Call in. This is the number.

339
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,640
Got it.

340
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,160

Hey…

359
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
Your mother mentioned you were havin' some doubts about gettin' baptized?

360
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,920
Oh, she did? Excellent. Thanks, Mum.

361
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,120
Sometimes it helps to talk these things through.

362
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
-I just don't feel fully accepted here. -In what sense?

363
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,440
You're a really important member of our community, Eric.

364
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,600
I have to hide parts of myself that others might not be comfortable with.

365
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,520
I see.

366
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,400
But your relationship with God is personal.

367
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,800
Other people don't need to know. Do they?

368
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,040
But it's who I am.

369
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,080
Baptism is between you and God.

370
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,360
So don't let anything hold you back.

371
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,000

Hey!

377
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,880
Oh my God! I'm just on my way to Aisha's.

378
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,120
-You have to try this. It's so good. -What is it?

379
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,240
It's like a hemp strawberry milkshake.

00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Oh my God! That is so good!

382
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,160
-How was your family thing? -Uh…

383
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,120
Do you know what? I actually… was at this baptism class at my church.

384
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,560
-Okay. -Yeah.

385
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,840
People can be a bit funny about the whole God thing, so…

386
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,720
I lied.

387
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,920
-Wanna walk with me for a bit? -Yeah.

388
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,720
I'm Christian, too, by the way.

389
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,080
-You are not? -Yes.

390
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh my gosh, Abbi!

391
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah, I had to leave my old church when I started my transition,

392
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,720
but it was tough.

393
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,960
But I still believe in God.

394
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm trying to get Roman to come with me to a more accepting church,

395
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,680
but he's so anti-religious.

396
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,400
-Oh. -So I get the whole, um, judgment thing.

397
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,800
-Trust me. -Yes.

398
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,440
Is your church more open or…

399
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,360
Uh, no.

400
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,520
So I'm finding it tough too.

401
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
You can talk to me about it if you ever need.

402
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
-Yeah. -Yeah. Come here.

403
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Aww. Thank you, Abbi.

404
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,480
Aah.

405
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,200
Here we go.

406
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,000
Ooh.

407
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,000
Looks lovely, Michael.

408
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,160
Adam started his apprenticeship today at the farm.

409
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,200
Um, I actually need to learn how to drive. I… I didn't realize when I applied.

410
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,560
Oh, okay. We can get you some lessons.

411
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,600
-What are the career prospects… -Thank you.

412
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,600
…after this apprenticeship?

413
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,280
Um… I'm learning to teach kids how to ride horses.

414
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,680
Oh. So, you want to be a riding instructor?

415
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,880
Or you want to run a farm?

416
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
Thank you.

417
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
I just like animals.

418
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,920
Well, you can't make a career just because you like something.

419
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
You're gonna have to earn money in the real world.

420
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,640
Maybe something like bricklaying

421
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,440
would be a better option.

422
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,880
-Would you like some kale? -I'm actually not hungry.

423
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,280
What did I do? He clearly hasn't thought about it.

424
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,440
I don't want it to be another thing he doesn't see through.

425
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,840
Kale?

426
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,040
No, I don't want any kale.

427
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,080
Maybe he doesn't see anything through

428
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,360
because he's so afraid of disappointing you that he doesn't try.

429
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,280
Oh.

430
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,400
Adam, I'm heading off now.

431
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
Yeah.

432
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
If you'd like, I could, um…

433
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,280
give you a driving lesson at the weekend.

434
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm, um… sorry.

435
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,920
I was too harsh downstairs.

436
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,720
I just want you to think about your future. That's all.

437
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
-Okay. -Hmm?

438
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,760
I'll, um… I'll think about the driving lesson.

439
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,680
Why is the furniture all changed around?

440
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,280
Uh, Joanna did it. She's unpacking. We heard your radio show.

441
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,920
-It was… -Disastrous.

442
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,080
I was distracted, because my sister,

443
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
who was looking after my newborn,

444
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,200
wasn't answering the phone.

445
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Hmm.

446
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,680
I can't believe that you asked her here, Otis.

447
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,040
-What were you thinking? -I was thinking you needed some help.

448
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, I don't. I'm fine. It's…

449
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,640
No, you're not fine, Mum.

450
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,320
Jakob and Ola are gone, you have a baby, and I'm in my last year of sixth form.

451
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,720
A lot's changed. You need some support.

452
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,360
-I wish you hadn't asked her. -Well, I did.

453
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,840

No, I'm…

-I don't have a good feeling about him. -You don't know him.

473
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,840
I know you keep dropping him into conversation.

474

476
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,120
Otis. He's gay.

477
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,680
He has a boyfriend back home in Illinois.

478
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,040
Okay.

479
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,080

I… should have known.

518
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,440
And then you accused Maeve of cheatin'?

519
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,160
Shut up.

520
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,960
-It's not funny. -That is so fun… No.

521
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,440
No, you're quite right. It's not funny at all.

522

Would you like to light a candle for Abbi and Roman?

524
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,960
Oh gosh.

525
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,400
They have to stay together.

526
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,320
They have an appointment with O later today to talk things through.

527
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,760
-O. -We're sending positive thoughts.

528
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,000
-Do you need a spot? -Thanks, yeah. That'd be great.

529
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,400
-Of course. -I'm tense today.

530
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,960
What's goin' on for you?

531
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,240
I don't know if you saw my speech. I'm a… I'm a therapist. Maybe I can help.

532
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,840
Oh yeah. You're Patchy Pubes Guy.

533
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,960
Uh, yeah.

534
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,120
I had a fight with me girlfriend. It's bad. I feel so betrayed.

535
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,320
What happened?

536
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,920
It was two nights ago. I asked Abbi if she wanted to have sex.

537
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
She said she wasn't in the mood, so we had a kiss good night,

538
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,720
had a cuddle, and I thought we both went to sleep.

539
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,680
But then…

540
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,800
I woke up to this strange sound and…

541
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,920
Abbi, are you… wankin'?

542
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,280
It's interesting to me you use the word "betrayed."

543
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,080
-Can you tell me more? -It feels like she was cheatin'.

544
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,840
Well, engaging in self-pleasure in a committed relationship

545
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,200
can be beneficial to a healthy sex life.

546
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,240
We don't really have sex anymore.

547
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,240
And how long's that been the case?

548
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,320
Since she moved in with me and me family.

549
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,520
I feel like she's not attracted to me anymore.

550
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,680
Has she told you that?

551
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,800
Well, no, but Abbi doesn't like to talk about negative things.

552
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,480
So even if she wasn't attracted to me anymore,

553
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,280
I feel like she wouldn't tell me.

554
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,680
She says she has a low sex drive, but then she's secretly wankin'.

555
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,280
Sex drives are a complicated thing, and lots of things can affect it.

556
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,280
There is stress or tiredness, over-familiarity, expectation.

557
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,120
It's been a tough time.

558
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,000
Abbi's family kicked her out, and she pretends she's okay, but…

559
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,960
sometimes I don't think she is.

560
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,000
Hmm.

561
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,000
Sometimes couples need to take the pressure off

562
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,640
and just go back to the basics.

563
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,040
Hugging, kissing, just spending time with each other

564
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,960
without the underlying pressures of sex.

565
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,280
I do love huggin' Abbi.

566
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,440
I mean, it seems to me that you don't really want to break up at all.

567
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,640
Do you think Abbi might be interested in having a session with you and me?

568
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Thank you.

Is that normal?

580
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,080
I pulled out and was devastated to see the condom was missing.

581
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,520

582
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,880

That is interesting. Have you thought about shadows?

597
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,680
Oh, it doesn't look right.

598
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,400
-What's it meant to look like? -Supposed to be my melon.

599
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,960
-Okay. -Yeah.

600
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
I had this friend called Melon when I was a kid.

601
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,560
-Great work. Ooh! -Took him everywhere with me.

602
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,160
But it doesn't look anything like him, so the picture doesn't mean anything.

603
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,600
-Oh, great. -Don't think I understand this art stuff.

604
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,560
Try around the corners, the edges.

605
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,680
Sorry, why did you call your childhood teddy bear Melon?

606
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,600
No, no, he wasn't a teddy bear. He was an actual melon.

607
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,560
Yeah, I loved him so much,

608
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,680
but he went all moldy and shrunk, and he smelled so bad.

609
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,720
It was my first experience of death.

610
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,040
Aimee, that's really weird.

611
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,400
-Is it? -Yeah.

612
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,880
Lovely, but just quite weird.

613
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,520
Nice and light.

614
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,760
-Do you like drawing? -Be bold.

615
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,960
Uh, it hurts my wrist, having to hold a pencil for so long.

616
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
Then you don't have to draw.

617
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,200
There's loads of ways to make art. I can show you this weekend if you like.

618
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,880
-That's interesting. -Yeah.

619
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,360
-Thank you. -Cool.

620
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,120
Her knees are a triumph.

621
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Great job. The color's very vivid.

622
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,520
See that thing on her jacket? It's a microphone.

623
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,560
And yet, she still shouts.

624
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,680
Very good instincts.

625
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,200
Hi. I'm Cal, by the way.

626
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,800
Aisha, nice to meet you.

627
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,720
Oh, stop whining.

628
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,720
I don't know what you want.

629
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,000
Afternoon.

630
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,280
Where's the coffee?

631
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,080
Why are you here, Jo?

632
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,240
To help you. I told you.

633
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,080
And, um… I broke up with Patrick,

634
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,120
so I'm… sort of in between places.

635
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,960
-When? -A few months ago.

636
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,760
He was lovely, but it started to feel like I was having sex with my brother.

637
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,280
He started pissing with the door open all the time.

638
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,160
I got back from Malaysia and haven't had a chance to find anywhere to live yet.

639
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,600
And you need my help, and I need somewhere to stay,

640
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,080
so it was meant to be.

641
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,280
Well, if you're going to be here, Jo, then properly be here.

642
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,800
Okay.

643
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,200
-I'm here. -Then, here.

644
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,200
-I will make the coffee. -Okay.

645
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,640
Come in.

646
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,600
Otis.

647
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,760
-Hey. -Hey.

648
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,000
-I wanted to talk about something else. -Of course.

649
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,440
Um, so I took your advice, and it was great.

650
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,360
Cool.

651
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,520
But then the girl who I was telling you about,

652
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,040
she told me about a lump that I've got.

653
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
On my ball.

654
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,360
-Which is normal for some guys, right? -Um, some people, it's perfectly normal.

655
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,360
But if it's a new lump, or you're just worried about it,

656
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,480
you should go and see a doctor.

657
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,360
-Okay, thanks. -All good.

658
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,040
Oh, also, that thing I said about Maeve yesterday.

659
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,640
Chattin' shit. I genuinely think she likes you.

660
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,920
I'm just feelin' lonely or something at the moment, so…

661
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,920
You all right?

662
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,400
-Yeah. -Yeah?

663
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,200
Cool, thank you.

664
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,680
Thanks.

665
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,360
Hello.

666
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,800
Can I help you?

667
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,440
-That's cute. -Mmm.

668
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,600
I have been thinking about our clinics, and maybe we should team up.

669
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,320
-Really? -You're obviously not awful at this.

670
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,120
And I could use an assistant.

671
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,280
Okay, well, I don't need to assist anyone.

672
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,120
You know, I'm running my own clinic here. I don't know if you've noticed?

673
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,520
-But it's doing pretty good. -You said it yourself.

674
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,520
Having two clinics on campus isn't really gonna work,

675
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,000
and I'm not goin' anywhere.

676
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,400
-So I'm just tryin' to find a solution. -Hmm.

677
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,560
I mean, this is a student-led campus.

678
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,080
-Mmm. -Why don't we let them decide?

679
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,200
-What, like an election? -Yeah.

680
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,000
Are you… are you bein' serious?

681
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,800
Very serious.

682
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,920
Okay.

683
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,920
-Okay. -Yeah, okay.

684
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,160
Well, I will run it by Principal Lakhani.

685
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,040
May the best sex therapist win.

686
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,480
That would be me, by the way.

687
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,920
Good work in here.

688
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,960
Saddle up Midnight for me, and you're done for the day.

689
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,520
Are you afraid of horses?

690
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,520
No.

691
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,560
No, no, no. No, of course not.

692
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,680
Their, uh… their faces are a completely normal size.

693
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,800
Okay, there we are.

694
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Okay.

695
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,040
-It's on backwards. -Right, okay.

696
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,000
Maybe I don't know anything about horses.

697
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,760
Maybe I'm a little bit scared of them. Please don't fire me.

698
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,360
I'm really good with dogs, and, um, I'm a quick learner.

699
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,680
They're just big dogs, right?

700
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,040
-I really want this apprenticeship. -For fuck's sake.

701
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,320
You do drive, though?

702
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,760
-No, you didn't! -I had a good time/

703
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,840
-Oh my God. -The lion looked line…

704
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
You seeing Anabelle tonight?

705
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,400
Nah.

706
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,480
I don't think I wanna do the casual thing.

707
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,240
And I still like Cal, so…

708
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,800
You all right?

709
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,080
How's that?

710
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,040
He asked me to study with him at the weekend.

711
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,840
Oh! So, you said yes?

712
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,280
-No. -What?

713
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,680
-I can't get distracted. -Viv!

714
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,080
-You like him, yeah? -Yeah.

715
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,760
And he clearly likes you back, which doesn't happen often.

716
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,840
Just go talk to him.

717
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,040
Now.

718
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,840
Hey, Viv.

719
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,880
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You.

720
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,760
Um, I thought I told you that I didn't want you messin' around

721
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,360
in Abbi and Roman's relationship.

722
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,040
I found a way to help them without getting you involved.

723
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,320
I thought that'd be okay.

724
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah. Yeah, no, it is, I guess.

725
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,520
Oooooooh!

726
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,520
Tings are gettin' a little bit serious!

727
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,760
-Hmm! -Hey, Eric. Comin' to that vegan place?

728
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,080
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Two seconds.

729
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,800
-See you later. -Bye.

730
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,080
Ah, thanks again, Otis. I'll maybe see you at the gym?

731
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,200
Uh…

732
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,160
No, I've… Gym's not for me. I think. Bye.

733
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,160
-You'll love the falafel. -Bye!

734
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,720
-Yes! Oh my God. -Oh my gosh! I can't wait!

735
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,920
-Yeah, I… -No! Really?

736
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,280
How on Earth did he become friends with them?

737
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,240
-I don't know. -So you took my advice.

738
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,200
Okay, an opportunity presented itself.

739
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,480
Stop talking. Did you put in a good word for me?

740
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,400
Okay, it's fine. Don't worry.

741
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,240
I don't need your help anyway, but you definitely need mine.

742
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,400
-You have no idea what you're in for. -What are you talkin' about?

743
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,120
Well, I know how things like this work. And I could be your campaign manager, hmm?

744
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,240
Well, I'm with Maeve now,

745
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,680
so I don't know if that's really a good idea.

746
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,520
Oh, I am not trying to get back with you, Otis.

747
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
You're very arrogant sometimes.

748
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,840
-I know it's probably too on the nose. -Maeve.

749
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,240
It's fuckin' brilliant.

750
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,200
And it pains me to say it because I want that internship.

751
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,560
Seriously, I feel like I've been to where you grew up now.

752
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,760
Like I know all these eccentric characters in this place,

753
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,560
but it's not sentimental at all.

754
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,200
Like, there's no anger in it about your mom or your dad not being there.

755
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,840
-How did you write this in a day? -It's what I know.

756
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,400
You should give it to Molloy.

757
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,360
He's gonna be all over it.

758
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,120
Come in.

759
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,280
Oh, sorry.

760
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,480
No, it's okay. Come in.

761
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,400
Come in. Come in!

762
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,840
-Is everything all right? -Yeah. Yeah.

763
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,720
I, uh… just got a rejection from the New Yorker.

764
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,360
You'd think at this point, I wouldn't care what people think, but, uh…

765
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,360
Fuck those assholes.

766
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,680
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure it's their loss.

767
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,120
Yeah, apparently, everyone's writing about gay shit now, so…

768
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,120
Okay. I… I can come back later.

769
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,640
Maybe I could read it to you.

770
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,360
"…not far from that bright burning furnace."

771
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
"Slow."

772
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,720
"Slow, slow."

773
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,000
"New shoots begin to root."

774
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,360
It's great.

775
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
It's… brilliant.

776
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,120
Yeah, I… I don't need you sucking up.

777
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,720
It's what I liked about you when you told me you'd read Night Tales.

778
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,680
Nobody ever wants to talk about my other work.

779
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,160
They just want me to keep rehashing Rainbow Maze.

780
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,200
And a writer has to be allowed to evolve, Maeve.

781
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,800
So please, tell me what you think.

782
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,000
The beginning really drew me in.

783
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,960
-Mmm. -Um…

784
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,680
But the middle part lost me emotionally.

785
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,920
You could make a few cuts.

786
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,560
What I love about Night Tales, for example, is that you… you…

787
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,160
you just said it like it is.

788
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,640
You didn't give a shit about making the perfect sentence.

789
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,640
You… you weren't so self-conscious when you were starting out.

790
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
It was all heart.

791
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,480
-All heart. -Mmm.

792
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,200
It's an interesting observation. Do you want me to read that?

793
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,800
Oh yeah. Um… Sorry.

794
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,840
This is, um… It's an idea I had for a new book.

795
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,640
There's… more of me in it, I think.

796
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
What is Southchester?

797
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
The name of the caravan park I grew up in.

798
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,200
Great. I'll take a look.

799
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,160
Yeah. Okay. Great, thanks.

800
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,080
I'm sorry.

801
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,680
I got carried away. And in my head, you were… having an affair or something.

802
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
-It was stupid. -It's okay.

803
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,120
Distance is hard. Just talk to me next time, okay?

804
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,840
I have something to tell you.

805
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,000
You know my teacher, Mr. Molloy?

806
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,120
He's looking for an intern. I think I've got a chance of getting it.

807
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,080
And staying in America?

808
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,040
Yeah, I guess so, if I got the position.

809
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,560
Right, right. Well, that's a big deal.

810
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,200
-Why are you being weird? -You said you were coming back.

811
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,880
Well, I might have changed my mind.

812
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Okay, I've gotta go.

813
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,960
What? For someone who's supposed to be emotionally intelligent,

814
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,280
you can be such an immature arsehole sometimes.

815
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,240
Yeah. Yeah. I'm the arsehole here.

816
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,120
If we can't call without fighting or one of us hanging up,

817
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,360
we should take some space.

818
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,360
Yeah. You know what? Good idea.

819
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,440
Seriously? Fine.

820
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,920
