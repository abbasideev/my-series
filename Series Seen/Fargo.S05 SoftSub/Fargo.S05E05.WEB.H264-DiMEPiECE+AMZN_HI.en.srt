Let me guess,
the orphans need a new roof.

199
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,654
Well, probably,
but I'm more of a

200
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,048

other for sport" kind of guy.

from over Stark County.

205
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,493

220
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,151

this high and mighty?

What's right for whom?

225
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,988
Right as in the Bible,

226
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:55,078
as in a woman swears an oath
to honor and obey her man,

227
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,298
not go out and get a six-pack
and never come home.

228
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,300
May I have the details

229
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,606
of this alleged matrimony,
please?

230
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:10,006
June 3, 2007.
We got married at the ranch.

231
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,356
My second, her first. Uh...

232
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,271
We were together about

233
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:16,578
two years, before and during,
and then, all of a sudden,

234
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,711
poof, she disappears. [sighs]

235
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,626
Gone.

236
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,499
Well, I'll tell you,
there were nights

237
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,457
I figured she must've been dead.

238
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,024
Horrible thoughts.

239
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,679
Mountain lions, Mexican rapists.

240
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,291
So you can understand my relief

241
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,685
when the report came in
said she'd been found.

242
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,906
Uh-huh.

243
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:42,778
Yeah, my first thought hearing
that she'd remarried with a kid,

244
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,215
maybe some sort of amnesia.

245
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,087
Found wandering the highway,

246
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,697
not knowing
when her birthday f...

247
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,395
All right, I-I...
I get the picture.

248
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,702
Listen, slick.

249
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:56,444
Nothing would make me happier

250
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,446
than to put that girl in a box

251
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,230
marked "return to sender,"

252
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,929
between you and me, but

253
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,366
she's married to my son,

254
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,194
and he loves her,

255
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,326
and she's the mother
to my granddaughter,

256
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,111
whom I'm fond of,

257
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,591
so you need to put
your big boy pants on

258
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,332
and take the hit.

259
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,857
Bible says the wife
is the property of the husband.

260
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,946
Therefore, that makes your son

261
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,817
a thief.

262
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,645
If we're talking about who has

263
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,342
the more legitimate claim.

264
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:28,171
You know, I've heard of you.

265
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:34,090
You're one of those
constitutional sheriffs.

266
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,831
Yes, I am.

and protector of the common man

against the tyranny of the state

269
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,057
and all its wicked demands.

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,841
- Taxes?
- Oh, yeah.

271
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,451

272
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,497
Well, I'd spit, but, uh...

one person on Earth

Oh, I'm sorry.

288

I just wanted to check, see
how the powwow went with Duggar.

What is that? Uh, Vivian Dugger?

290
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,627
The banker with a woman's name?

291
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,716
He was in my prowler once.

292
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,979
I caught him in flagrante
with a lady of the evening,

293
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,720
but we came to an arrangement.

294

Oh, was I?

299
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:53,082
Well, as I said, if you're
willing to sign some papers,

300
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:56,303
I could see my way clear
to writing a check.

301
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:57,913
I mean,
between your-your reelection

302

and my business dealings,

303
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,701
I'm sure neither of us want
any sordid details coming out.

304
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:06,922
Is that reasonable enough
for you?

305
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:12,319
So, that's who you are.

306
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,974
That's who I am.

307

And while we're talking
about property rights,

308
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,719
I'd like to be clear that,
after seven years,

00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,679

is presumed dead.

310

00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,746
You stay here.

363
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:02,837
I'm the law.

364
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,535
You...

365
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,149
I'm coming. I'm...

366
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,111
Fuck.

367
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:21,725
[narrator]
The female, or lady tiger,

368
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,859
can outsmart even
the most skilled hunters.

369
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,775
She is a literal genius
when it comes

370
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:30,299
to saving her young

371
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,954
and protecting her mate.

372
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,095

Oh, a mental patient escaped.

Mm.

376
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,408
I'm looking for my cousin,
Wayne Lyon.

377
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,150
Aren't we going?

378
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,544
Oh, yeah. We just got to make
a quick stop first.

379
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,851
Come on.

380
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,723
Oh, uh, third floor.

381
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:05,421
Oh, and, uh, check in
at the nurse's station.

00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,313
You stay in the fucking car.

387
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,618
Okay.

388
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,100
You stay in the fucking car.

Shit. Shit. Geez.

Well, about fucking time.

401
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,737
I'm supposed to get
Jell-O and broth.

402
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,870
Hey. They said I could get
some Jell-O and broth.

403
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,611
That's...

404
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,396
Sorry, let me see what I...

405
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,919
[Jordan] Two days
I'm sitting in this stupid bed

406
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:53,007
waiting for you people
to rip out

407
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,269
six feet of my intestines.

408
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,444
Least I can do
is get some Jell-O

409
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,403
and fucking broth.

410
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,361
Of course.

411
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,320
I'll check on that for you.

412
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,712
You stealing my coat?

413
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,410
What the hell
kind of place is this?

414
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:07,021
No. I'm just...

415
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm having it cleaned.

416
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:10,677
It's part of the service
we provide here.

417
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,026
I am on to you, bitch.

418
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,897
All of you people
sneaking around here

00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:16,378
pretending you're so nice,
but I know who you really are.

420
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,032
Ow! Ah!

421
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,599
- Ah! Ah!
- Why are you

422
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,514
- so rude? Hmm?
- Ah! Ah! Oh!

423
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,254
- So angry?
- [grunting]

424
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,126
All of you.

425
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:27,346

to grace and dignity?

[narrator] The tiger has been
known to set traps

to ensnare her pursuers.

430
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,247
Thus, the popular colloquialism

431
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,554
"Do not hunt the tiger

432
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,035
unless you want the tiger
catching you."

434
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,392
Money? That... Oh, hon,

435
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,785
I don't have time to go
into the whole...

436
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,136
Let's get you
to the bathroom, yeah?

437
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,095
Oh, I just went.

438

Mm. Oh.

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,013
That's good, hon.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

442
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,320
We're gonna go, though, yeah?

443
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:31,061
Mm-hmm.

444
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,107
Yeah.

Mm.

453
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,920
The nurse told me
that we're rich,

454
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,661
and I said I didn't know
what that was.

[Dot chuckles]

456
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,800
What?

457
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,584
Stay here, okay?

458
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,543
Then, you see...

459
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:21,111
...this lock?

460
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,723
Yeah.

461
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,159
Turn it when I'm gone

462
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,030
and don't come out until I say.

00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,939
Stay here.

Oh, Nadine.

00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:20,170
he means. Sorry.

00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:22,259
I'm... No. I have, I have...

00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:23,913
M-Mrs. Lyon, it's okay.
We-We're here to help you, okay?

474
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:24,914
I don't need help.

475
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,133
- I think you do.
- No.

00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:27,482
Let-Let's just...
We'll find a room

477
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,266
and we can talk.

Mrs. Lyon?

480
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:51,637
I can't. I, uh,
have to be somewhere.

481
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,988
Do you got a card I could have?

482
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,380
[Joaquin]
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,295
You were supposed to wait
in the truck.

Doesn't matter.
We got her husband.

Had to tenderize him.

00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,090
What an asshole.

489
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,961
Let's go.

00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,664
I'm Agent Joaquin.
This is my, this is my partner,

491

- Agent Meyer. Here you go.
- Hey, there.

00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:21,710
We've been looking for you.

493
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,451
Can you... We just,
we just want to talk.

494
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,801
- All right? Let's find a room.
- [elevator bell dings]

495
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,890
- Yeah, a quiet room.
- You're okay, you're okay.

496
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,153
- We're here to help you. Okay?
- It's okay.

497
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:32,373
- I meant to ask, is your,
is your husband okay? - Yeah.

498
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,462
We went by the house.
That must've been some fire.

499
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:35,594
He's...

500
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:40,076
[narrator]
Only the tiger shark

501
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,252
is a more dangerous foe.

502
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:43,645
Though, of course,
the tiger shark,

503
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,647
or any kind of shark, really,

504
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,997
would suffocate
in a hospital setting.

505
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:54,003
I'll just... I'll be quick.

506
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,314
What do you think?

507
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,794
She looks relieved.

508
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,447
No more running.

509
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,014
Honestly, I don't know how
she made it this far.

510
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,973
Hmm.

511
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:10,193
Have you seen a woman,

512
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:12,761
like, light brown hair,
maybe five-two

513
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:14,241
wearing nurse's scrubs?

514
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:16,243
She's a biter.

515
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:17,853
No. I can't help you.

516
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:20,334
- Okay.
- Wait. What's her name?

517
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,162
Mrs. Lyon?

518
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,382
Dorothy?

519
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:33,782
No more running?

520
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,698
Well, shit.

521
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:44,924

[dogs barking outside]

523
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,060
Mrs. Lyon.

524
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,758
If I could just
understand better

525
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:53,846
why you had her committed.

526
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,764
You're a debtor.

527
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:01,723
- What?
- I looked it up.

528
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:05,988
$192,000.

529
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,991

medical bills,

credit cards.

533
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:17,043
Hell, you've got it all.

534
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,088
Th-That's not...

535
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:20,960
I don't think...

536
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,570
relevant to this.

537
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,355
Don't feel bad.

538
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,270
You're not alone.

539

Over 90% of American adults
are debtors.

540

In the red,
living beyond their means.

I-I'm not...

543
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:39,152
