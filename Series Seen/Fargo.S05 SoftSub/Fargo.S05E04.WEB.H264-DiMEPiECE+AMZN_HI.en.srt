00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,081
Ma'am, this isn't a hotel.

361
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,051
You got to check in at the desk,
just like everybody else.

362
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,987
She's fired. Get her name.

363
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,922
- Mrs. Lyon.
- Yes.

364
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,058
No. Sorry, we're here
for your daughter-in-law.

365
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,426
I knew it.
You're arresting her.

366
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,629
Well, do-do something.
They're-they're arresting her.

367
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,931
[Indira]
We're not... This is Witt Farr,

368
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,967
state trooper
over in North Dakota.

369
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,434
But we'd like to talk
to Mrs. Lyon in private,

370
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,870
clear some things up.

371
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,872
My husband's unwell.
I can't leave his side.

372
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:07,606
[Indira]
Well, technically, Mrs. Lyon,

373
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,042
you're not by his side
right now, so...

374
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:10,977
Hi.

375
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,845
I got my daughter with me.

376
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,214
I'm her grandmother.
I can watch her.

377
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,016
Somebody better.

378
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,185
Her house burned down
last night, under her watch.

379
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,220
Yes, ma'am.
I heard about that.

380
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,754
Fire department's there
right now,

381
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,224
- extinguishing the embers.
- Bad wiring.

382
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,026
[Indira]
I'm sure they'll do a thorough investigation,

383
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,527
ferret out the root cause.

384
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,662
Officers,
my client would be happy

385
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,665
to schedule a sit-down, but
clearly this is not the time,

386
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,201
given the circumstance.

387
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:38,337
Well, see, I got to push back
on you there, Mr., uh...

388
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,940
Graves. Esquire.

389
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,275
I represent the family.

390
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,712
Well, Mr. Graves.

391
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,447
We've got one state trooper dead

392
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,183
with the suspect on the loose
considered armed and dangerous.

393
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,753
So there's considerable
exigency to the circumstances.

394
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,255
And, Mrs. Lyon...

395
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,557
It's good to see you again,
Mrs. Lyon.

396
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,959
That...

397
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,393
[zips loudly]

398
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,797
That's not accurate.

399
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:09,435
Ah, well, first of all,

400
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,370
I recognize you.

401
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,939
And second,

402
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,206
we pulled the security tape
from the Gas N Go,

403
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,945
so it's-it's clear
you were there.

404
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:22,114
And for the record, that's...
that's just reality.

405
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:26,318
With all due respect,
we've got our own reality.

406
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:29,855
You can't...
That's not a thing.

407
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,790
[Scotty]
Mommy?

408
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,193
Hi, baby. I'm here.

409
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,163
We're all here.
Grandma, too.

410
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:40,132
- Hi, Grandma. Our house burned down.
- No.

411
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,034
And whose fault is that?

412
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,070
Jack Skellington.

413
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,137
Who?

414
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:46,372
[Dot]
It's a character in a movie.

415
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,941
How about you go get
something to eat

416
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,742
from the vending machine?

417
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,644
- Okay?
- [Scotty] Snickers?

418
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,481
For breakfast?
Are we on welfare?

419
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,049
It's fine.

420
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,918
Snickers is fine.

421
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,188
Danish.

422
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,625
Oh. [sighs]

423
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,097
Here you go, kid.

424
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,632
[Dot chuckles forcefully]

425
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:16,702
[Witt]
Mrs. Lyon.

426
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,769
Dorothy.

427
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,305
You got to tell me,

428
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,041
who were those fellas,
and what did they want with you?

429
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,143
[Dot]
I didn't...

430
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,912
Please.

431
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,581
I need to be with Wayne
right now.

432
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,518
- Can you...
- [Marcy] Mrs. Lyon?

433
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,920
- Yes.
- Oh, I meant...

434
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,488
Your husband's awake.

435
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,889
You'll watch Scotty?

436
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,458
You don't have to tell me
to watch her.

437
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,726
She's my granddaughter.

438
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,095
You're the one
needs watching, I think.

439
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,497
I mean, I've been waiting
for four fucking hours.

440
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,133
Sir.

441
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,236
Look, they're taking six feet
of my intestines tomorrow.

442
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,471
All right? Cancer.
But not if you don't...

443
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,340
I mean,
it's on the goddamn papers.

444
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,275
- Your gal's supposed to do the enema.
- Sir, sir...

445
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,909
[patient]
Well, where is she? I'm fucking waiting there

446
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,811
- with my ass hanging out.
- Just calm down. Yeah.

447
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,449
[patient]
I mean, I've been waiting for four fucking hours.

448
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,154
Hey, baby.

449
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,561
Are you...

450
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,464
How are you?

451
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,167
Hi.

452
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,138
Is everything...

453
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,475
What did the doctor say?

454
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:31,877
Nadine.

455
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,679
No. That...

456
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm Dorothy.

457
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,621
Dot.

458
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,590
Remember?

459
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,092
Your wife.

460
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,397
My wife.

461
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:59,938
Did they put you on something?
Morphine or something?

462
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,207
[patient]
Bring me the dang thing now.

463
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,574
- I'll do it myself.
- [Marcy] Sir.

464
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,210
[patient]
Or a bottle of freaking Ex-Lax.

465
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,312
I don't care,
I need this cancer out of me.

466
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,047
- [door closes]
- Angry.

467
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,384
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

468
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,154
Some people don't know
how to wait their turn.

469
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,391
Did you...

470
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,993
I'm wondering...

471
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,730
what you remember about
what happened.

472
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:27,966
Ladder.

473
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,536
Well, no.

474
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,504
No.

475
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,508
You touched a wire, I guess.

476
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,845
Got some kind of shock.

477
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:46,452
You know, something like that
can play tricks on your mind,

478
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,955
make you think you did something
that maybe you didn't.

479
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,890
Mm.

480
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,660
Ask Scotty. She'll tell you.

481
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,663
We were out trick-or-treating,
then we came inside

482
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,466
and you went to plug in
some lights, and...

483
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,436
- My wife.
- Yeah.

484
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,576
The one.

485
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,114
I'm so sorry.

486
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,884
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

487
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,456
Our house was on fire.

488
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,494
I'm going to fix it.

489
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,196
I promise.

490
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,699
And the house.

491
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:39,305
Or we'll build a new house,

492
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,608
and we'll live just
like the fairy tale says.

493
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,845
My wife.

494
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,451
Move over, you.

♪ ♪

496
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,018
[Meyer]
Have you seen his billboards?

497
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,654
"A hard man for hard times."

498
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:31,223
Meanwhile, he refuses
to enforce the basic law,

499
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:34,092
which... [scoffs]
can you still call him a lawman

500
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,761
if he skips that part
of his job?

501
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,764
Maybe he loses the election,
and the whole thing goes away.

502
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,233
Arrest him then, you're saying?
As a private citizen?

503
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:45,571
No, I'm saying wash our hands.
Good riddance.

504
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,639
Oh, so more like
a dysfunctional family

505
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,908
than a federal law
enforcement agency.

506
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,110
Smile and pretend
Daddy didn't touch our pee-pees

507
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,579
- when we were kids?
- [clears throat]

508
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,947
- What?
- Weapons are missing, sir.

509
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,449
Tactical equipment.

510
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:58,950
We think he bought them
for his department,

511
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,986
and then gave them
to his friends in the militia.

512
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,289
- Odin Little.
- You think.

513
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,424
[Meyer]
We had an informant, but he disappeared.

514
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,459
[Joaquin]
A lot of people disappear around this guy,

515
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,461
including two of his wives.

516
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,563
Just put one of his deputies
in the ground yesterday.

517
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,365
Local coroner said car crash,

518
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,066
but they had him buried
in less than 12 hours,

519
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,535
so... [laughs]

520
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,169
Don't tell me
you want to dig him up.

521
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,339
No. What we want to do
is increase the pressure.

522
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:24,510
Send a message: respect
the rule of law, or else.

523
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,750
In 1958,

524
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,320
the Chinese went to war
with the sparrow.

525
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,423
- Sir?
- Mao gave the order.

526
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,658
The birds were eating
the people's seeds and grain.

527
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,126
They had to go.

528
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,929
So people all over the country
started beating on pots and pans

529
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,931
to drive the birds mad.

530
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,499
Death by exhaustion.

531
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,568
Two billion sparrows exterminated,

532
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,303
all praised a great leader.

533
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,405
But do you know what happens
when you remove birds

534
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,341
from a food chain?

535
