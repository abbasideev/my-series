00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:31,291
Now we're just Lindas. Or variations.

186
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:33,990
I earned my first new letter last week,

187
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,166
so you can call me Lindo.

188
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,866
I don't understand.

189
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:46,176
When you leave a man who
abuses and controls you

190
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:48,569
and you find this place,

191
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:50,397
you take on a new name.

192
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,183
A transition name. Linda.

193
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:57,056
But my Linda was named Linda before.

194
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,666
Oh.

195
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,494
That Linda.

196
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:03,802
She sent me a postcard.

197
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,988
Can I ask what that was last night?

198
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:17,903
Some kind of puppet show?

199
00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:22,560
Hungry?

200
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:26,999
It's a beautiful day.

201
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,135
Welcome, Linda.

202
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,535
Why am I so tired?

203
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,234
It's kind of a death,
what they do to us.

204
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:46,192
Our men.

205
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:49,021
The way they make us
feel about ourselves.

206
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,892
No, that's...

207
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:53,765
I love my husband.

208
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:55,897
It's been ten years of bliss.

209
00:14:57,421 --> 00:15:00,380
Honestly, I'm not here about him.

210
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:03,601
This is a long-ago story
come back to haunt me.

211
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,821
Hi, Linda.

212
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,173
That's why I need her help.

213
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:11,826
My Linda.

214
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,307
Saint Linda. That's what we call her.

215
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:15,787
[LAUGHS]

216
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:18,529
Oh, you're serious.

217
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,495
[WOMAN] Welcome, Linda.

218
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:29,801
- Welcome, Linda.
- Welcome, Linda.

219
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,150
Welcome, Linda.

220
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,674
- Welcome, Linda.
- Welcome, Linda.

221
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:35,633
This is the main house,

222
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:39,028
where we gather for
meals and conversation.

223
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,856
All of it, she built... Saint Linda...

224
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,295
so we could come and be reborn.

225
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:47,123
And every week, one of us leaves,

226
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,429
but she stays.

227
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:52,041
- Welcome, Linda.
- Welcome, Linda.

228
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,609
You say you knew her before?

229
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,785
She took me in when I was on the street.

230
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:00,005
[LINDO] Mm. [CHUCKLES]

231
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,138
So like a mother.

232
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,923
More like a Venus flytrap.

233
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,446
What?

234
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,448
- Hello, Linda.
- Hi, Lindo.

235
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,015
Welcome, Linda.

236
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:13,627
Is she here? I'd really
like to say hello.

237
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,151
Sure.

238
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:23,942
Linda, I have a visitor here
that wants to pay tribute.

239
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,032
- [SAINT LINDA] Nadine.
- [GRUNTS]

240
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,558
- Let go of me. Let...
- No, don't hurt her.

241
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,778
- It's okay.
- Let go of me!

242
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:34,996
It's okay.

243
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:39,958
You must think I deserve that.

244
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,699
We can talk about that in the car.

245
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:44,005
Am I going someplace?

246
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,616
Get your stuff.

247
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,445
He found me. Roy.

248
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,273
I need you to come and tell the cops

249
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:52,579
about all the bad he
did when you were married

250
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:53,972
so they can put him in jail.

251
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,582
Nadine...

252
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:58,411
It's Dorothy now. Dot.

253
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,152
So you made the puppet.

254
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:01,806
What?

255
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,505
I can't leave.

256
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,116
They need me here.

257
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,902
I need you more, and you owe me.

258
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,731
I gave you a home, three meals a day.

259
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,776
What could I possibly owe you?

260
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,127
You used me.

261
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,954
You fed me to him so you could escape.

262
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,218
We both made choices.

263
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:24,394
You left your boy, too.

264
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:26,178
Gator.

265
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:29,181
And just so I know,
do you have children?

266
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:30,791
I've got a daughter.

267
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:32,489
Where is she?

268
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,275
So you left her, too.

269
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,017
No.

270
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,411
I came to get you so we can...

271
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,763
I'm going back.

272
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:46,894
A trial.

273
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:49,984
- We need to have a trial.
- Yes.

274
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,073
No. What does that...

275
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:53,553
I don't have time.

276
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:55,773
When there are two
versions of the truth,

277
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:59,037
we have to reconcile them,
so we hold a tribunal.

278
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,952
I've told my truth already.

279
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,955
You tell yours, and
the Lindas will watch

280
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:07,132
and help us find the true truth.

281
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:09,090
It's the only way.

282
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,790
Fine. I'll tell the truth.

283
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,008
[LINDO] No.

284
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,923
First, you make your puppet.

285
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,549
[SCOTTY] Name two mammals that lay eggs.

286
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,943
I don't think that's how homework works.

287
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:37,815
Platypus.

288
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,513
Okay.

289
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:43,516
And like a spiny anteater.

290
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:46,563
How do you...

291
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:49,479
- Would you look at that.
- [KNOCKING]

292
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:51,176
[DARYL] Boss.

293
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,917
I got a family here with
their hearts set on a new Rio.

294
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,310
Well, heck of a nice car.

295
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:56,877
Oh, yeah. Uh, ran their credit, though.

296
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:59,053
- Not gonna happen.
- Well, that's a shame.

297
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,274
"Echidnas, sometimes
known as spiny anteaters,

298
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:04,624
are quill-covered monotremes."

299
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:07,410
Huh. Have you seen these things?

300
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:10,717
It's, uh, a mammal that lays eggs.

301
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:13,242
- Geez.
- Yeah.

302
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,418
Well, like I said, even
with their trade-in...

303
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:18,247
and they got a 2005 Sportage
in pretty good shape...

304
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,031
uh, they don't qualify.

305
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,380
Oh.

306
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,384
It's a nice-looking family.

307
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:27,168
- Right?
- Hmm.

308
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:29,083
[WAYNE] Unless, uh,

309
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,042
a car for a car.

310
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,696
Just trade.

311
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,742
E-Except that's not really
how capitalism works.

312
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:37,309
A car for a car.

313
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:39,180
- Right, but...
- Because what do we do here?

314
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:41,182
[DARYL] Well, we sell...

315
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:44,490
Well, people need a car,
and they-they come to us.

316
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,318
- To buy...
- Yeah, well, you said yourself,

317
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:49,016
the 2005's in good shape.

318
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,281
Yeah, but, boss, Blue
Book on that's 6,200...

319
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,021
So we trade.

320
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:55,588
[DARYL] And-and the Rio, that's...

321
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:58,504
- How many eggs does the, uh...
- [DARYL] 19,500.

322
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,637
- [WAYNE] The spiny anteater?
- [DARYL] Boss?

323
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,249
It says one egg makes a baby
the size of a jelly bean.

324
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:05,642
Um, so...

325
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,731
Well, you were more of a jelly donut.

326
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,254
[LAUGHS]

327
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,996
- So, on the... Boss?
- What kind of jelly?

328
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,737
- On the... [CLEARS THROAT]
- Raspberry.

329
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,434
So, on the Rio...

330
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,567
- Huh?
- The Rio?

331
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,482
Oh, we-we solved that, I thought.

332
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:22,746
Give a car, get a car.

333
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:26,445
Each has received a gift,
use it to serve one another.

334
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:29,230
That's in the Bible. Right?

335
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,190
Sure, then. Okay.

336
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:40,633
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

337
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:42,113
- [CHEERING, LAUGHTER]
- Congratulations.

338
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:46,117
[SCOTTY] Can we get doughnuts?

339
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,771
Sure can.

340
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,163
And bear claws for your mom.

341
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,557
Is she back?

342
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,999
No, hon. Sorry. I-I got confused.

343
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:03,003
No, Mom is, uh...

344
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,397
She's still out there.

345
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,752
Maybe skip the doughnuts, then.

346
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:14,624
She'd want us to eat a vegetable.

347
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,452
Yeah, she would.

348
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:18,018
Come here.

349
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,195
[LYNDA] This is your workstation.

350
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,589
Choose the wood, make the doll,

351
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,852
dress the doll, choose
some hair and makeup.

352
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:27,680
And then the final step.

353
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:29,639
They've already come for me twice.

354
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:31,118
And my family.

355
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:33,382
You tell your story, through the puppet,

356
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,558
and in this way, you expel the trauma

357
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:37,473
so you can start again.

358
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:39,475
Then you take your new name and leave.

359
00:21:39,518 --> 00:21:42,608
I've done this. I have a name.

360
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:45,524
Start by examining the wood,
really see yourself in it.

361
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:46,786
For some, this process
takes weeks, months.

362
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,918
This is...

363
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:52,792
