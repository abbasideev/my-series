1
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:21,630
[hoofbeats approaching]

2
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:40,605
ROY:
I was sheriff of this county when I was 25.

3
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,174
Hard to believe.

4
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:46,829
Grandfather was a sheriff.
Father, too.

5
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,700
Ranchers all.

6
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:51,834
Working the land through times
flush and fallow.

7
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:58,406
There's a natural order
to things.

8
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,886
We know it in our bones.

9
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,498
Jesus was a man,
not some bearded lady.

10
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,456
And just as water
flows downhill,

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,329
a husband is head
of his household.

12
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:11,375
Under him, the woman abides.

13
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:14,204
She holds her virtue close

14
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:17,425
until that matrimonial
threshold is crossed,

15
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:18,948
and then she opens to him,

16
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,255
as the flower opens to the sun.

17
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:22,560
And in exchange,

18
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:25,389
the man shelters
and protects his female,

19
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:28,218
as the sword has its sheath.

20
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,829
Okay, but what I'm saying is, you...

21
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,527
[grunts]

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,921
No. He only raises
his hand to her

23
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,880
when she forgets her place
and acts the man.

24
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:41,492
And-and then only
for instruction,

25
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:45,453
never taking any pleasure
or satisfaction from the task.

26
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,237
Whereas you, son,

27
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:50,327
seem to have played
a Tommy Lee drum solo

28
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,895
all over your missus's facade.

29
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:55,637
- This... I fell is all.
- Hey, quiet now.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,205
Sheriff's talking.

31
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:01,599
Come here. Take comfort, dear.

32
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:04,080
Daughter, these hard times
are over.

33
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,864
All right?

34
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,736
I'll see to your husband's
instruction myself.

35
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,085
What 'struction?

36
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,783
[grunting]

37
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:14,308
[choking]

38
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,223
Now, be honest.

39
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,529
Do you ever question
your man's supremacy

40
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,183
when he speaks?

41
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:22,577
Just when he drinks
or with the crank, you know?

42
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,361
I try to stay out
of the way, but...

43
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,362
[choking]

44
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,234
Don't hurt him.

45
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,540
- We got three boys
who need a daddy. - Okay.

46
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,152
Okay. Okay.

47
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:35,372
[gasping]

48
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,245
[coughing]

49
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:41,770
Yeah.

50
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,251
Thank you. You got any
of that huckleberry pie?

51
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,949
- WAITRESS: Sure.
- That's great.

52
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:52,084
Lookit, dick cheese,
I know you... [screaming]

53
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,521
Quiet.

54
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:56,001
[stops screaming]

55
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:59,483
Go home. Fix a meal.

56
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,442
Pray on it before
you take the first bite.

57
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:04,053
Forgiveness. Tend to his burns.

58
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,098
Try to be deferential.

59
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:08,666
Cater to his needs as a man
with your mouth

60
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,407
in order to sow harmony.

61
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,671
I'll come by in the morning,
see if the lesson stuck.

62
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,066
Go on.

63
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,328
Go.

64
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,069
[Josh grunts]

65
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,771
[panting]

66
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,212
They missed her.

67
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,840
[horse neighs]

68
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,929
- [rancher clicks tongue]
- ROY: What happened?

69
00:03:55,887 --> 00:04:00,196
MUNCH: You send a man to do
a job without all the information,

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,678
how can the job be done?

71
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,027
GATOR:
Yeah, what are you?

72
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,073
The Riddler?

73
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:12,121
You say the woman
is a woman, a...

74
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,992
How do you...?

75
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,647
Housewife.

76
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:22,697
Never do you mention
she is, for real, a tiger.

77
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,700
GATOR: You're saying
you couldn't handle some girl?

78
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,789
100 pounds soaking wet?

79
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,705
Huh?

80
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,798
It was on the wire this morning.

81
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,323
This half-wit shot up a
filling station outside Beulah.

82
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,194
Murdered the clerk.

83
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,371
Killed a state trooper.

84
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:45,850
Put a hole in the leg
of another.

85
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,504
[chuckles]

86
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,680
And this retard's partner
with a cracked skull

87
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,247
and his face half
burned off in the morgue.

88
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,076
You say housewife,
so I bring one guy.

89
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,513
You say tiger...

90
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:57,688
that's a different guy.

91
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,125
Cost you three times.

92
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:02,824
Did they take her? The police?

93
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,826
Fled on foot.

94
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,219
Possibly home.

95
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,960
Possibly to the wind.

96
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,615
- [laughing]
- Could you find her?

97
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,357
She could be found.

98
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,317
Where people go,
the thoughts they have,

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,884
these are known to me.

100
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,103
Instincts.

101
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,453
Who flees, who fights.

102
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:27,762
It's a question of price.

103
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:31,200
The job it was,
not the job you said.

104
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:33,289
Pain and suffering.

105
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,813
A man, missing an appendage,

106
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:38,207
self-sewing his own skin.

107
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,948
Scarred for life, he's told.

108
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:43,473
And then this new ask.

109
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,127
Hunting a tiger.

110
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,086
And it forces the man to ask:

111
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,872
why you want the tiger?

112
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,310
She's my wife.

113
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,616
Don't tell him shit.

114
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,052
I already said
I can handle this.

115
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,010
We know where she lives now.
Her alias.

116
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:06,322
She made vows to me.

117
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,063
A pledge.

118
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:11,240
In sickness and in health.

119
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:14,722
Consider it a debt unpaid,
leaving me in limbo.

120
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,377
Husband yes or husband no.

121
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:21,076
See, she hid from me
nine, ten years.

122
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:25,472
Interest accrued.

123
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,562
Until the debt could no longer
be paid with money.

124
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,091
Then, one day, there she is,
fingerprints in the system.

125
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,267
Now the limbo can end,

126
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,226
the debt can be collected.

127
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,448
Tell me something, friend.

128
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,496
If a man is pure,

129
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,281
his actions are only ever good.

130
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,327
You believe that?

131
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,941
I'm a nihilist.

132
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,682
What the fuck does that mean?

133
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,031
I believe in nothing.

134
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,380
You believe in money.

135
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,949
Yeah?

136
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,436
Well, thanks for your help.

137
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,308
Go on with Gator.
He'll get you paid.

138
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:20,614
Dad.

139
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,920
Original plus pain
and suffering.

140
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,835
Yeah, of course.

141
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,229
Take it out
of the rainy day fund.

142
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,883
Fixing place.

143
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:32,582
Fixing place. Right.

144
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,584
Come on, numbnuts.

145
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:45,769
A man is grateful.

146
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:04,179
I'm not saying sorry,
but you understand.

147
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:05,920
I had to rough you up a little
back there.

148
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:09,010
You coming up
snake eyes and all.

149
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:15,582
With her being
such a tiny bird, which...

150
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,236
[snickers]

151
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,890
You know...

152
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,677
they used to be dinosaurs.

153
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,509
Hundreds okay?

154
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,782
Surprise, shitbird.

155
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:44,698
[gunshot]

156
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,700
- [screams]
- [grunts]

157
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,093
- [crunch]
- [screaming]

158
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,009
[high-pitched ringing]

159
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,141
[gunshot]

160
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,502
- What's going on, Roy?
- Go on, get back to the house now.

161
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,078
[coughing]

162
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:36,097
DOT: Like we said,
this is all just a misunderstanding.

163
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,620
Had a bad day is all.

164
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,192
A bad day?

165
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,410
DOT:
Yeah.

166
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,587
Left the house a mess.

167
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,720
Last I checked, weren't a crime.

168
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,069
No, ma'am.

169
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:54,158
I'm a recidivist
on that count myself.

170
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,464
Laundry especially.

171
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:58,293
Oh, laundry. [chuckles]

172
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,904
But what I'm concerned
about is the blood.

173
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,950
Told you, I cut my feet up
on some glass.

174
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:04,516
You did.

175
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,389
And I see the wounds.

176
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:08,695
But what I'm dealing with
is the fact

177
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,479
that the blood
on your entry floor

178
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,176
is different than the blood type
we have on record for you.

179
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,569
Records?

180
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,745
Those...

181
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,879
You know, I heard a man went
into the hospital in St. Paul

182
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,881
fer a kidney transplant,

183
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,578
he ended up
with someone else's brain.

184
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,102
- No way.
- Yeah.

185
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,321
INDIRA:
Well, I'm not sure...

186
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:28,802
That don't sound accurate.

187
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:32,544
What I'm saying is,
hospitals make mistakes.

188
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:35,460
Then there's the hair DNA from
the balaclava in your boudoir.

189
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,288
Told you, I bought
that secondhand.

190
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,730
You know, it's my fault.
[chuckles]

191
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:47,298
You know, I came home,
front door was wide open, uh,

192
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,736
all the... blood.

193
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,956
Uh, I-I'm not ashamed
to say I panicked.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,566
But, you know, Dot's home,

195
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,438
and, uh, that's all
that matters.

196
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,745
So, uh, whatever the...

197
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:01,573
You know, she's my wife.
And I believe her.

198
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:05,273
So, if there's a form
or something I can sign to...

199
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:08,232
you know, drop the charges...

200
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,147
That's not how this works.

201
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,805
- I got to...
- Hmm?

202
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,938
It's almost time for pickup.

203
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:22,159
I told Scotty we could
go to DQ after school, so...

204
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,465
[clears throat]

205
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,382
Well, okay, then.

206
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,949
Thanks for your time.

207
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,690
Mm-hmm.

208
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,517
We're reviewing traffic cameras
in the neighborhood,

209
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:33,475
so if I have
any more questions...

210
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,955
No.

211
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:37,044
She's...

212
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,699
Wayne, she's not
listening to me.

213
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,875
Uh, Danish Graves
is our attorney,

214
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,877
so if you need
to contact us again,

215
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,575
which you shouldn't, uh...

216
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,447
Okay, then.

217
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,717
[footsteps approaching]

218
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,244
DANISH:
So, it's a puzzler.

219
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,811
Spoke to Wayne.

220
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,638
Dot's back.

221
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,205
She's what now?

222
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,251
Yeah, came home on her own.

223
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,209
A little bruised.

224
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,734
Bloody feet.

225
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,257
She escaped?

226
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,432
Well, that's the conundrum.

227
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,086
Says she wasn't taken.

228
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,176
Says it was just a driving
around type scenario.

229
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,612
Getting her head straight.

230
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,570
Bullshit.

231
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:28,312
You saw the police report.

232
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,053
Something's fishy here.

233
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,229
Agreed.

234
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,927
I smell a rat.

235
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,190
You think...

236
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,582
Well, what do you think?

237
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:40,890
A play, maybe.

238
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,588
Extortion,
but she got cold feet.

239
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,242
Kidnapped herself,
you're thinking?

240
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:48,550
I mean, what do we know
about this girl, really?

241
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:51,074
Well, I did the background check
when they got engaged.

242
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,946
Well, you said yourself,
not much there.

243
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,382
Pretty thin, for sure.

244
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,905
Just the birth certificate,

245
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,689
a few school records,
previous addresses.

246
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,822
Well, it's too good to be true,
now I'm thinking.

247
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,693
So, what do we...?

248
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:05,349
Tell you what we don't want...
police digging their noses

249
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:06,742
into other people's business.

250
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,483
Asking questions
that can't be answered.

251
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:09,789
Then what?

252
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,181
[sighs]

253
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,618
Possibly this thing
goes federal.

254
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,664
You know, wrong person
makes a phone call.

255
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,580
You don't think Wayne's...

256
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:21,061
Who knows what to think?

257
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,150
He's got the dealership,

258
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:26,022
a decent roof over their head,

259
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:31,071
but maybe she's pushing him
for more.

260
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:33,682
Putting ideas in his head.

261
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,337
Eh... I don't know.

262
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,601
So we separate 'em,
like the cops.

263
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:42,299
You brace him. I go at her.

264
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,388
Get to the bottom of things.

265
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,912
If this deal's for real

266
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,610
and they got a notion
to take what's mine,

267
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,960
we need to nip it in the bud.

268
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,570
Keep things in-house.

269
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,964
Ah, geez.

270
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,575
Everything was going
along just fine, too.

271
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:58,881
And now, what do you...

272
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:02,711
This... enemy within situation.

273
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:06,846
She made promises. To me.

274
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,499
My son.

275
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,198
To have and to hold.

276
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,765
For richer and poorer.

277
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,334
And that's a debt
we're gonna collect.

This is Agent Meyer.

316
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,093
We're new in the Fargo office.

317
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,572
We thought we'd come by,

318
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,748
see why you aren't enforcing
any of our laws.

319
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,359
What laws?

320
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,100
JOAQUIN:
Oh, you know, gun laws, drug laws.

321
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,754
Any of the half-dozen

passed and ratified

that you don't seem
to recognize.

324
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,413
Well, Agent Ja-Queen,
I think you'll find

325
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,459
that there is no one
on God's green earth

326
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:06,938
who is a greater enforcer
of the laws of this land

327
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,418
than Roy Tillman.

328
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,507
Why do I feel like
there's a "but" here?

329
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:11,639
But...

330
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:17,601
...what you need to know is
that I amthe law of the land.

331
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,387

of this county

JOAQUIN:
Mm-hmm.

335
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,787
Freedom.

336
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,311
Amen.

337
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:33,617
You know, I hear that word
a lot out here.

338
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,228
I'm curious...

339
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,056
what you think it means.

340
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,796
Agent, if you don't know
what freedom is,

341
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,102
I don't think me saying
the words out loud

342
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,886
is gonna teach you.

343
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,630
Why don't you go
and do your chores?

344
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:57,772
Seriously?

345
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,818
Do you want a towel, or...?

346
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,820
Does my discussing
matters of state

347
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:05,171
in moist repose bother you?

350
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,499
Now, what is it
you wanted to discuss?

351
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,501
JOAQUIN:
Well, like I said, we're new in town.

352
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:34,069
We thought we'd come open
a collegial dialogue.

353
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
Maybe let you know
we're looking into the practices

354
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,682
- of your office.
- Very unorthodox practices.

355
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,597
Possibly illegal.

356
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:44,166
Illegal according to who?

357
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,385
Maybe you weren't
paying attention,

358
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:46,908
but I am the law around here.

359
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,953

So you said.

360
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,695
Removable only by the governor
or my constituents,

361
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,306
who love me, by the way,

362
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,178
because I say what I want
and I do as I please.

363

between right and wrong.

364

Don't you mean legal
and illegal?

366
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,491
Well...

367
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,928
did you know that
in North Dakota it is illegal

368
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,277
for a charitable group to hold

369
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:11,498
more than two poker games
a year?

370
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,283
And similarly, it is illegal

371
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,633
to keep an elk in a sandbox
in your own backyard.

372
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,940
I shit you not.

373
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,594
Now, if you were to own a tavern

374
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,509
and serve beer and pretzels
at the same time,

375
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:23,510
I could arrest you.

376
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:26,077
And in Waverly...

377
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:31,213

from sleeping in bathtubs.

378

and to prosecute what is wrong.

383

to do with it.

to come out, huh?

392

It's my son's house.

402

Still, sorry if-if
we startled you.

my granddaughter to her room?

409

her dolls.

410

I don't have dolls, Nana.

00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:05,352
Full low tide, if you ask me.

542
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:06,657
Like the dog's breath.

543
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,529
Now, we talked about this, uh...

544
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,139
She had a bad day.

545
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,401
Son.

546
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,968
I talked to the police.

547
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,231
They got hard evidence
your wife was abducted.

548
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,146
Not to mention,

549
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,148
I just learned they think
they got one of the guys

550
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,890
on a slab over in North Dakota.

551
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:24,545
Broke his skull in the commode
of a filling station.

552
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:28,549
- G-Geez.
- Yeah, officer on the scene said

553
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:31,247
there was a female present
who matches Dot.

554
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:35,599
Get your head
out of your ass, kid.

555
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:37,906
She's making a play here,
your missus.

556
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,429
In cahoots with
the kidnappers maybe,

557
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:43,129
or maybe just seizing
the opportunity.

558
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:44,565
I'm not sure what or why.

559
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:45,740
But any way you tell the story,

560
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,698
it ends with me writing a check.

561
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:51,093
Oh, come on now, Ma,
n-not everything's about money.

562
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,269
Slap him.

563
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:56,403
I'm... sorry?

564
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:57,534
You heard me.

565
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:59,101
My son needs a slap

566
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,581
and I'm not there
to give it to him.

567
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,930
So, as my attorney,
I authorize you

568
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:04,237
to knock his fucking block off.

569
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,501
[chuckles]

570
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,373
No.

571
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,159
No, no, no, no, no, no.

572
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,725
Wait a minute... Aah!

573
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,859
Ow.

574
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,426
Listen to me, boy.

575
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,341
You're back at the kiddie table
on this one.

576
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:23,169
- That's official.
- [whimpers]

577
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:26,389
Now shut your hole
and listen to me talk.

578
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:35,877
Trooper?

579
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,792
Saved.

580
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,794
From what?

581
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,796
Concord grape, I think.

582
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,016
Hmm.

583
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,845
[groaning]:
How... may I help you?

584
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,455
Sure, well,
I'm, uh, Deputy Olmstead,

585
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,239
Scandia Police Department
over in Minnesota.

586
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,719
I wanted to ask you
some questions

587
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,068
about events that transpired
last night.

588
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,896
You and everybody else.

589
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,985
Well, sir, I think I might have
a piece of your puzzle.

590
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,814
To wit, the identity of
the missing female you assisted.

591
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,209
If I'm right,
which I think I am.

592
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,341
Color me intrigued.

593
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,735
Taken from her home yesterday
afternoon by two men, we think.

594
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:09,519
We found blood from one.

595
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:12,087
Looks like she burned the other
fella's face pretty bad.

596
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,697
Sounds like my girl. [chuckles]

597
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,221
Rambo, basically.

598
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:19,399
Or, uh, the other fella
from the TV, uh...

599
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:21,749
- MacGyver.
- Well, I got a picture.

600
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:22,881
Mm.

601
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,186
[knocking]

602
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,318
What do you know?

603
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,277
It's a party.

604
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,845
INDIRA:
Indira Olmstead, Scandia Police Department.

605
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,195
Ah. City girl.

606
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,197
Well, we prefer "women"
these days.

607
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:37,156
But the rest is accurate.

608
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,592
How can we help you, stranger?

609
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:42,335
Sheriff's Deputy, Stark County.

610
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,990
Sounds like you had a mix-up in
my neck of the woods last night,

611
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:48,036
which we run a pretty
tight ship, so...

612
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,995
I take it personal
when bad men appear.

613
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,258
This job will grind you down,
you take it too personal.

614
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,914
What can I say? I like being
on the right side of a gunfight.

615
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,916
Heard you say you had
a picture of the perps?

616
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,831
- Uh, victim. Female.
- GATOR: Right.

617
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:04,574
Saw something about, uh,
a woman got taken.

618
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,925
Or escaped or something?

619
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,318
We think these fellas grabbed
her up in Minnesota.

620
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:12,060
Taking her to points west when
the trooper pulled them over.

621
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,628
She killed one,
the recidivist Donald Ireland,

622
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:17,761
I think they said.
The other one got away.

623
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:21,069
Sounds like a real Comanche,
this female you're hunting.

624
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:24,899
Like I said, I got a photo.
Excuse me.

625
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,989
GATOR:
So, what, she some kind of criminal, also?

626
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,556
INDIRA:
Not exactly.

627
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,862
Had a mix-up at her daughter's
school this week.

628
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,299
Tased an officer by accident.

629
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:34,735
How's that happen?

630
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,215
Heat of the moment,
I'm guessing.

631
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:37,520
Used to be a saying:

632
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:40,393
"Minnesota nice."
But I was there.

633
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:42,656
Nothing nice about Minnesota
that day.

634
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:44,658
Oops. What'd I do?

635
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:47,182
- What did you...?
- I must've, I don't know, I pressed something.

636
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:50,316
Darn it, you deleted
the victim, her photo.

637
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,188
Yeah, me and technology
don't see eye to eye.

638
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:54,537
Especially now.

639
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,018
This wrist-breaker... ah.

640
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,238
INDIRA:
No, it-it's my fault.

641
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:01,414
I'm not sure what I was thinking
just bringing the one.

642
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:04,025
Well, I sure hope you find her.

643
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:06,375
If it was her,
saved my life, I think.

644
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,074
Oh, no, she's home.
A little worse for wear

645
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,379
but intact.

646
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:11,598
Strangest thing, though.

647
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:13,295
Despite all evidence,

648
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,210
she's claiming
it never happened.

649
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:17,299
Never... what now?

650
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:18,866
Says nobody broke in.

651
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,520
Says she wasn't taken.

652
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,087
Just went for a wander
for ten hours

653
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,263
and then came home
and cooked breakfast.

654
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,134
GATOR:
Cry for attention, sounds like.

655
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:29,572
Drama queen trying to make
her husband sick.

656
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,226
Who said she has a husband?

657
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,880
GATOR:
No, I mean, I'm assuming.

658
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,926
Description said 30s
in the police report, so...

659
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,624
Well, all I know is,
the woman I met broke loose

660
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,192
like somebody who knows
how small the cage can get.

661
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,369
Wish you had that picture.

662
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,371
Like to meet
that woman again, thank her.

663
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:47,373
For what? Far as I can tell,

664
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,375
she's the one got you shot
in the first place.

665
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,420
Oh, the job got me shot.

666
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,509
She was just...

667
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:55,685
trying to get free.

668
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,339
But you know what they say.

669
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:58,558
Protect and serve.

670
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,212
[chuckles]

671
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:03,084
Yeah, I'm down
with "protect," but...

672
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,738
I ain't in the service industry.

673
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:08,611
I'm in the kicking ass
and taking names business.

674
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,057
You two have a nice day.

675
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,285
[blows nose]

676
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,859
[engine starts]

677
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:41,079
Consider that bitch flummoxed.

678
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:47,259
[hammering]

679
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,925
- [hammering continues]
- [water running]

680
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:09,542
[water shuts off]

681
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,374
What the heck?

682
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,202
DOT:
Hiya, hon.

683
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:22,032
What the heck?

684
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,730
Made some shepherd's pie.

685
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:31,216
WAYNE:
Scotty.

686
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,609
What you doing there?

687
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,655
For security. Mom said.

688
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,396
- Yeah.
- WAYNE: Oh.

689
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,440
Hon...

690
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:41,226
Yeah?

691
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,793
Why is there a sledgehammer
over the front door?

692
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:46,405
Well, we talked
about an alarm system,

693
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,930
but you said we couldn't
afford a good one, so we...

694
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:51,714
Well, what the heck is...?

695
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,325
Oh, no, hon, I wouldn't touch
that. It's electrified.

696
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:54,761
It's what?

697
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,719
It's plugged into the wall.

698
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,591
Anyone tries to bust in,

699
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,636
well, they'll get
a righteous shock.

700
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,036
Hon, c-can we talk? I...

701
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,300
Wait, how, I'm just gonna...

702
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:13,910
How about you go upstairs
and, uh,

703
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,696
watch some cartoons
on your Samsung?

704
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,002
- [Dot chuckles]
- Yeah? [chuckles]

705
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,573
- Yeah.
- Let me get my apron off at least.

706
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,536
Uh, Mom came by the lot today.

707
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,452
Er, well, her man did.

708
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,888
Uh, she called in.

709
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,716
Yeah, she...

710
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,500
I saw her, too.

711
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:39,980
But don't worry.

712
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,069
I think we came
to an understanding.

713
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,679
She said that, or...?

714
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,681
- No.
- Oh.

715
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:49,032
But women understand each other.

716
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:52,122
Well, hon, I don't
think you do...

717
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,213
u-understand each other.

718
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,737
She... She's litigating
against you, see.

719
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,479
She, uh...

720
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:02,785
Well, she thinks
you made this whole thing up.

721
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:06,746
I... I mean, the whole
thing sounds... loony.

722
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,445
But she-she thinks you're
some kind of con woman.

723
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,187
Uh, playing us for our money.

724
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,971
Uh, in league
with the kidnappers.

725
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,495
I just...

726
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:20,281
Told you, there were
no kidnappers, just...

727
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:21,804
Drove around
to-to clear your head.

728
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,850
But-but, hon, the-the...

729
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:25,765
The-the car was here
the whole time.

730
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,070
Walking, I said, or I-I...

731
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:28,550
Listen, I believe you.

732
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:31,292
I'm not the one
you got to... I just...

733
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,033
And she said she can get
the cops out of the equation.

734
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:36,689
You know, her friend the
attorney general, but, hon...

735
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:39,082
You know, from-from where she's
sitting the-the whole thing

736
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,780

737
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,047
But it makes sense to us.

That's what matters, right?

739
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:53,140
Yeah, maybe.

740
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:57,753

a, a-a sledgehammer

741

in the vestibule?

742
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,280
A-And how come Scotty's
making a zombie killer?

743
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,195
Well, like she said. Security.

744
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,414

745
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,850

00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:09,591
No, I-I'm just trying
to, you know...

00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:13,421
No. You can't.
You-you weren't there.

What side you're on,
whether you're for or against,

753
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,871
I-I'm just saying... [sighs]

754
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,657
We need to wake up here.

755
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,137
Protect ourselves, in case...

756
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,922
In case what?

757
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,272
In case...

758
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,970
ruffians at the door.

759
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:44,147
Or Mr. Abernathy decides
he wants revenge.

760
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:46,019
Or a thousand other maybes.

761
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:47,673
Uh, who?

762
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,109
Scotty's math teacher.

763
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:50,415
The fella I tased
before the cop.

764
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,938
Y-You tased the math teacher?

765
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,679
Well...

766
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:55,550
I got a bad feeling, hon.

767
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:57,552
- Yeah.
- People do.

768
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,293
It's not just me.

769
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,861
And I'm, I-I'm not saying
that we should build a bunker.

770
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:05,038
Or stockpile long guns.

771
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,605
A few common sense...

772
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:09,738
Hon, y-y-y-you got electric wire
on the windows.

773
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,174
A few practical solutions.

774
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:13,046
Unless you're ready to step up

775
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:16,963
and go state of the art, really
sink some capital into it.

776
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:20,314
I-I... Should we, I don't know,
sh-sh-sh-should we get a gun?

777
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:24,100
See? Oh. Now you're thinking.

778
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:26,799
A gun is a great idea.
We should get a shotgun.

779
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:28,583
- Oh.
- And maybe a pistol for the bedroom.

780
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:31,238
- Ah.
- And maybe we could replace my Taser, too.

781
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:33,980
And, I don't know,
maybe some kind of net.

782
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:36,374
- Just in case they, uh...
- A net?

783
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,375
- Huh?
- Huh?

784

the same language.

Oh, you're such a gentle guy.

787
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:47,036
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

788
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,387
I know how hard this is.

789
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,390
I-I just want to play
floor hockey

790
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:55,697
in my socks with Scotty again
and watch Real Housewives.

791
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,177
I know.

792
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:00,746
