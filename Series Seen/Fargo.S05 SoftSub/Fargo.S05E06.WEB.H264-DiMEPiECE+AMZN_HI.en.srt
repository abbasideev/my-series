00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,743
[muffled music playing]

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,280
- [laughing]
- You're gonna get in trouble, man.

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,200
Then move to France.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,369
The French, buddy? No.
You're, like...

5
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:30,979
The French would like me
better than you.

6
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,119
- [brays]
- Well, no, I-I don't think...

7
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,647
Now, I know there's at least
one dancer in there

8
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,687
that's got a restraining order
against you, Vivian.

9
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:46,347
Five hundred feet.

10
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:49,657
That's not... W... Y-You got
old information, Sheriff.

11
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:51,826
Candy moved down to Sioux Falls
last month

12
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:53,486
- to take care of her mother.
- Oh, so now

13
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:55,916
you're keeping tabs
on the poor girl, huh?

14
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,445
Judge won't gonna like that.
Not at all.

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,234
You two kids get home safe, huh?

16
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:09,844
See you at the Elks on Thursday.

17
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,283
You got my check, right?

18
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:19,682
- The re-election fund?
- [car doors open]

19
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,632
- [car doors close]
- Had... had my girl

20
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,462
- [engine starts]
- make it out personally last week.

21
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:26,641
- What... what the fuck, Roy?
- [car departs]

22
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:28,211
- Hm?
- What...

23
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:32,121
You can't do this shit
anymore, Roy.

24
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,600
I-I know the governor now.

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,219
See, now, what happens
in moments of life and death

26
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,309
is that everything
comes into focus.

27
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,749
Are you focused, Vivian?

28
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:49,268
Y-yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:51,448
You're not gonna
sell your bank to that woman.

30
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,188
L-Lyon?

31
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:56,627
Th-Th-That's the one.

32
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,017
You're not gonna sell it,
you're not gonna negotiate,

33
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:00,667
you're not even gonna
return her calls.

34
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:02,806
W-Why?

35
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:05,016
Wait, wait, wait!

36
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,416
O-Okay.

37
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:09,196
Find some other way to get rich.

38
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,195
Foreclose on some homes,

39
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:13,505
sell raffle tickets.
I don't care.

40
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:15,765
But that woman gets nothing.

41
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,944
We're clear?

42
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,384
Yeah.

43
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:23,214
Now why don't you
do a little dance?

44
00:02:24,513 --> 00:02:25,913
What?

45
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,303
I'm just kidding.

46
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:31,952
Nobody wants to see that.

47
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:41,571
[SUV door opens]

48
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,311
[door closes]

49
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,450
[engine starts]

50
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,669
[telephone ringing]

51
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:06,898
- [beep]
- [man] We've been patient.

52
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,467
More than patient.

53
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,946
But if we can't
settle this thing today,

54
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:18,736
my next call is to
our litigation department.

55
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:21,216
Thank you, and please
make sure to give this call

56
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:23,305
- five stars on the next survey.
- [beep]

57
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:29,394
- [brakes squeal]
- [bus idling]

58
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,413
[children chattering, laughing]

59
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:51,851
Looks like you found the cereal.

60
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:53,591
Frosted Flakes.

61
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:55,721
- Your kid likes 'em?
- [bus departing]

62
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,331
- Well, kinda.
- [garage door closes]

63
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,950
My husband.
He can't get enough.

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,990
Are you taking me to school?

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,990
No school today.

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,389
Is it a holiday?

67
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,169
In a way.

68
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,519
- But I got to go to work, so...
- [door opens]

69
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:13,998
- [door closes]
- [clears throat]

70
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:16,348
Slept in the garage again?

71
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:21,527
You don't have to open the door.

72
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,577
School bus saw me in my drawers.

73
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:30,056
Plus, it's freezing out.

74
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,586
Scotty, hon, could you

75
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:32,626
take your book
to the living room, please?

76
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,975
Want me to clear my bowl?

77
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,365
Please.

78
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:46,114
I need you to watch her today.
It's just for a few hours.

79
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:47,944
- I want a wife. - Maybe you could
take her to the park or what...

80
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:50,033
Wait, what did you say?

81
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,253
I said I want a wife.

82
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,253
I am your wife.

83
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:58,392
No.

84
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,302
A wife.

85
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,651
Someone to keep the house clean
and-and cook.

86
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:05,871
I cook.

87
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:10,051
Who cooks good, you know?

88
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:13,440
Takes care of me when I'm sick
and doesn't complain about it.

89
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,320
Who wants to know
how my day was first

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,100
and listens to the answer.

91
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,489
A woman who supports me.

92
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,149
Oh...

93
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,629
I support you.

94
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,499
No, emotionally, I'm saying.

95
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:26,808
A wife who...

96
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,628
who builds my confidence,

97
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:33,587
who everything
revolves around... me.

98
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,417
Not... And I know-I know
what you do

99
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,377
is important, I do, but...

100
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,686
I'm important, too, you know?

101
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:43,646
My needs, so I can grow

102
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:45,296
and be the best.

103
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,906
Okay?

104
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,735
A cheerleader, is what I'm...

105
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:54,474
You know, a wife
who comes to the club

106
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:56,834
for the socials and doesn't

107
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:59,444
talk about what's a felony
or what's a misdemeanor,

108
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,444
but trades recipes,

109
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:03,613
right?
With the other wives.

110
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,013
[scoffs]

111
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:06,443
Who claps when I win

112
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,623
and rubs my back when I don't,

113
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:10,322
and says,
"You'll get 'em next time

114
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:13,022
because you are amazing."

115
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,761
Is that all?

116
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,680
No.

117
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,689
I want a wife who takes care
of my other needs...

118
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,469
my man needs...

119
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,509
when I feel like it,

120
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,519
and doesn't say she's tired
or that her back hurts

121
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,128
or to pull out when I finish

122
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,778
'cause she's not on the pill.

123
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:42,828
Which... I want a wife
who's on the pill.

124
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,697
I can't take the pill.

125
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:46,917
I get blood clots.

126
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,567
Well, an IUD then.

127
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,787
[scoffs]

128
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:53,926
Okay, look, look.
the-the point is I am tired

129
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,486
of feeling like I got to be
everything around here

130
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:57,756
all the time.

131
00:06:57,796 --> 00:06:59,406
The man and the wife.

132
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:03,275
Like, I got to support you
all the time, your needs,

133
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,495
'cause your job is hard
and you're always saying

134
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,064
you have to pick up
extra shifts.

135
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:12,024
We are $192,000

136
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,153
in debt.

137
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,983
And that.

138
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,373
A wife who is not

139
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:21,422
reminding me all the time
about negative...

140
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,032
negativity, you know?

141
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,862
Pressure, when I-I need
to stay positive,

142
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,512
'cause it's
a mental game, right?

143
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:28,122
How far you hit a drive,
whether you're in the sand trap,

144
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:29,601
and you just...

145
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:33,001
suck.
You suck at that.

146
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,180
So I want a wife.

147
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,140
I'm late for work.

148
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,269
We can talk about

149
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:48,319
who really needs a wife later.

150
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,888
Scotty, hon.
I got to go out.

151
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:56,238
I'll be back as soon as I can.

152
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:57,588
[Scotty]
Okay, then.

153
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:58,677
What am I supposed
to do with her?

154
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:00,327
I got physical therapy

155
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,157
and I'm supposed to walk
the green at 2:00, my guru says,

156
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:03,637
so I can play it
with my eyes shut.

157
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,766
You're a big boy.
Figure it out.

158
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,205
[windmill rattling]

159
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,842
[man]
Please, ple... [groaning]

160
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,631
[Bowman]
Say it.

161
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,460
I'm gonna call Dot
and tell her to come.

162
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,150
Who the fuck is Dot?

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,720
Listen, wait, wait!
Listen.

164
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,769
Listen.

165
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,159
I got cancer.

166
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,509
I need an operation.

167
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:00,119
You got the wrong guy.

168
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,899
You got... [groans]

169
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:04,248
- Fuck.
- [coughs]

170
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,518
[groans]

171
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,128
Fuck you, you fucking
piece of shit.

172
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,427
- Fuck you!
- [thud]

173
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:14,177
[groans]

174
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:17,217
[Donald Trump] [on TV] ...on my phone call,
but they never thought I'd release it,

175
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:18,826
so they were gonna be okay.

176
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:22,486
Eight times, quid pro quo.

177
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:24,486
Except it was no times.

178
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:28,055
Mm. They are doing it
for real this time.

179
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,755
Jackals.

180
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,794
Impeaching that great man.

181
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:35,234
Now, not too short
above the ears.

182
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,804
I got the debate coming up.

183
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:39,673
Gets my goat,

184
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,153
they're hounding that poor man
day and night.

185
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:43,803
The twins think so, too.

186
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:45,683
We want to watch cartoons.

187
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,112
Hey.

188
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,032
Don't talk back to your mother.

189
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:53,861
[Wayne] [on TV]
Down at Wayne Lyon Kia,

190
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,861
we got
the lowest prices in town,

191
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:57,821
and I ain't lyin'.

192
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:00,211
Hi, I'm Wayne Lyon
at Lyon Motors.

193
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:01,650
And I want to get you
behind the wheel of a new...

194
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,740
Aah!

195
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,350
- Oh, Roy. Honey...
- Shit, woman.

196
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,650
I am so sorry.

197
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,959
- God.
- I don't know what happened.

198
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,349
Hold on, let me just...

199
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,959
These are my mother's napkins.

200
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,619
What happened, Karen, is you got

201
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,228
all caught up in things
that don't concern you

202
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,928
and you lost sight
of the job at hand.

203
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,408
- You're right.
- Now, it's 10:00 in the morning.

204
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,237
I think these girls
have something better to do

205
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,977
than sit here, watch TV
like a couple of welfare queens.

206
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:29,547
- Girls, come on.
- [snaps fingers]

207
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,156
Come on, your daddy's right.

208
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,506
It's time to get
to your lessons.

209
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:34,066
- [Roy] Ah, dang it.
- [door opens]

210
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,205
[door closes]

211
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,595
Thought you were that
crazy Swede for a second.

212
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:45,384
On account of he's
missing half an ear.

213
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:47,084
Very funny.

214
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:52,213
Got Nadine's husband
in the box when you're ready.

215
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,783
I'm Nadine's husband.

216
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:57,483
Sure. Uh...

217
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,222
uh, what I meant was, uh,

218
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:01,922
the car salesman's
in the abattoir, ready to talk.

219
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,182
Did you soften him up
a little bit?

220
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,272
Oh, he's still
got all his teeth,

221
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:05,882
if that's what you're asking,

222
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,441
but only 'cause
they're in there pretty good.

223
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,101
Crying like a little girl?

224
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:11,841
He's pissed, I'll tell you that.

225
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,280
Called me a few names I ain't
heard since grade school.

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,840
[chuckles]

227
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,020
Swears we got the wrong guy,
which is, like,

228
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,590
nice try, asshole.

229
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,759
Thought you said he was soft.

230
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,939
Well, he had a pretty good shock

231
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,719
at the house, you know.

232
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,589
Finger in the old light socket.

233
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,069
Sometimes that
scrambles the brain.

234
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,248
You hear those stories, right?

235
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,118
"My husband
ain't the man I married

236
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,558
since the lightning struck."

237
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:38,337
What?

238
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,606
[door opens]

239
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:53,095
We've been wearing
kerchiefs on our faces

240
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,925
so he don't recognize us later.

241
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,974
[muffled, indistinct chatter]

242
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,363
...don't you understand?
I don't know

243
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:05,753
what the fuck
you're talking about.

244
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,453
Oh, who's this, then?

245
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,363
Oh, king of
the idiot brigade, eh?

246
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,113
[chuckles]
Let me tell you

247
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:13,022
what I told
these other two morons.

248
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:16,632
You kidnapped the wrong chump.
I got friends in high places,

249
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:18,722
and when they
get through with you,

250
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,291
you're gonna wish you were
the horse at a glue factory,

251
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:22,121
you... [grunts]

252
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:23,511
- Jesus!
- [animals barking, whinnying in distance]

253
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:25,601
[stilted groaning]

254
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:34,869
[exhales]

255
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,869
[Gator]
What the hot fuck, Dad?

256
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,959
I thought this one
was supposed to stay in the car.

257
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,269
Yeah.

258
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,088
So you're a leptard, too.

259
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,568
[Gator] How are we
supposed to get her back now?

260
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,358
- You killed our leverage.
- That's not him, genius.

261
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,097
You grabbed the wrong patsy.

262
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:51,577
What? No.

263
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,626
I was in the car.

264
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,416
That's his fuck up.

265
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:03,845
He was in the room, this guy.

266
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:05,985
Name was on the door.

267
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,505
- Don't know what else
I could've done. - See?

268
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:11,504
I thought you said
you saw the car salesman

269
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:13,724
- in his house on Halloween.
- Yeah.

270
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,554
Said you got a good look at him.

271
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,213
It was dark, okay?

272
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,872
And on fire, and...
[chuckles] I...

273
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,002
He grabbed him.

274
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:30,872
Said we got the guy.
It's the...

275
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:33,441
What do you...
Power of suggestion.

276
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,800
So what do we do now?

277
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,499
Son, you got a bad-luck problem.

278
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,589
Somewhere out there,
there's an upside down horseshoe

279
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:53,718
with your name on it.

280
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,328
I'm just off my game is all.

281
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:58,938
You know I'm a winner.

282
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,507
All-state quarterback,
crack shot,

283
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,337
knocking all the pins down
with my eyes closed.

284
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,117
That's your boy,

285
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,077
not this puke pile.

286
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,256
All right, I think I know
where you got

287
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:11,556
that thorn in your paw.
Get the car.

288
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,036
Where we going?

289
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,865
To pay the boogeyman.

290
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:24,614
And you're saying
that the patient had a sur...

291
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:26,354
[Briggs]
Mr. Seymour.

292
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:27,964
You're saying he had surgery
scheduled this morning,

293
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:29,224
but he checked himself out.

294
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:30,703
No, they took him.

295
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,103
Who?

296
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,403
Two men.
They said they were family.

297
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:35,663
That happens, right?

298
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:37,062
Patient gets cold feet.

299
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:39,022
Yeah, except his wife
is hysterical

300
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,842
and nobody's seen him since.

301
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:49,111
[indistinct announcement
over PA]

302
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
And on the same day,
those two FBI fellas showed up.

303
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,990
- FBI? - Oh, yeah.
They were looking for that

304
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,909
mental patient female,
the runaway.

305
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:03,209
They're down in the cafeteria
right now, talking to Mr. Lyon.

306
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,648
[Joaquin]
Well, like I said,

307
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,088
we just want
to talk to your wife,

308
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:08,778
make sure she's okay.

309
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:11,958
Are you gentlemen quite certain

310
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,657
I can't offer you a gimlet?

311
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:16,047
Uh, no, thanks.

312
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:18,877
She gave us the slip,

313
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:20,836
but we think she's running
from someone else.

314
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:25,536
I'm sorry, I had a...

315
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:29,195
I'm-I'm a little
sideways, still.

316
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:31,105
I...

317
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,805
Faulty wiring.

318
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,194
I-I think my house burned down.

319
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:37,634
And we have questions
about that.

320
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:41,334
The night in question.
What you remember.

321
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,113
Neighbors said they saw
a couple of trick-or-treaters

322
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,463
fleeing the premises
after the flames started.

323
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:47,163
That...

324
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:49,822
Fleeing?
I-I don't...

325
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,871
You ever see
that movie, The, um...

326
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:01,351
...Nightmare Before Christmas?

327
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:04,920
That-that's a weird movie.

328
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,310
I want to say
I-I dreamed it, but in...

329
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,010
real life.

330
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,839
Well, sir, there's no
easy way to say this.

331
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,929
- [clears throat]
- Um...

332
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:18,928
Your wife
isn't who she says she is.

333
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,238
Dorothy Lyon... uh,

334
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:23,278
that's what we call an alias
in our line of work.

335
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:24,418
A cover story.

336
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,457
Her real name is Nadine Bump.

337
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,417
- Nadine?
- When he was a boy,

338
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:35,906
my son wanted to be a ballerina.

339
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:37,466
I told him...

340
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,866
[clears throat]
the male of the species

341
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:41,735
is called a "ballerino,"

342
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,955
but he couldn't be swayed.

343
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:46,915
What do you mean
she's not my wife?

344
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,694
[Joaquin]
Uh, no, no.

345
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:52,434
- She's your wife.
- But also, she isn't.

346
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,354
- I'm sorry?
- [Meyer] See, she was

347
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,923
married previously.

348
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,003
Still married, some would say.
Under the law.

349
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:01,313
To a-another man.
A bad man.

350
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:02,402
So she ran away from him.

351
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,662
And found her way to you.

352
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:05,582
Posing as Dorothy.

353
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:07,802
Posing?

354
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:09,231
[Joaquin]
It's a classic scam.

355
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,191
You find a gravestone
