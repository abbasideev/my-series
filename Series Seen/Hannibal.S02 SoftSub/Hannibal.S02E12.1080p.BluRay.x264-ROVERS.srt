1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,544
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:04,837
I'm a good fisherman, Jack.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,923
You hook him, I'll land him.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,383
Never seen pigs like these.

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,468
They're a special breed.

6
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,303
Riding agrees with you.

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,805
You've got a bloom.

8
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,140
I don't get a legacy.

9
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,307
Unless you make one.

10
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,475
She's pathological.

11
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,437
I'm sure she's told you
horrible things that I've done.

12
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,566
They're going to find something wrong
with your lady parts, Margot.

13
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,693
You must be the baby daddy.

14
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,572
Dr. Lecter is the one
you want to be feeding to your pigs.

15
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,742
Can you explain my actions?

16
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,413
Can you posit my intentions?

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,126
What would be your theory of my mind?

18
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,005
I have an understanding
of your state of mind.

19
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,132
You understand mine.

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,842
We're just alike.

21
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,637
This gives you the capacity to deceive me

22
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,057
and be deceived by me.

23
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,933
I'm not deceiving you, Dr. Lecter.

24
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:04,271
I'm just pointing out
the snare around your neck.

25
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,192
What you do about it is entirely up to you.

26
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,154
You put the snare around my neck.

27
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,368
Why did you tell Mason Verger
I want to kill him?

28
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,125
I was curious what would happen.

29
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,005
It's true, isn't it?

30
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,634
You do want to kill him.

31
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:39,098
Or you want me to kill him.
Either way, you'd like him dead.

32
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,682
I'm just

33
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,894
giving you a little nudge.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,314
Mason is discourteous.

35
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,528
And discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

36
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,825
Are you thinking about eating him?

37
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,122
Whenever feasible,
one should always try to eat the rude.

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,042
Free-range rude.

39
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,881
Would you join me at the table?

40
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,594
Mason Verger is a pig

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,431
and he deserves to be somebody's bacon.

42
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,107
Maybe you should kill Mason
during your next session.

43
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,277
He may be intending to kill me
during our next session.

44
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,863
Then you'll have to kill him first.

45
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,702
You said you were curious
what would happen.

46
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,623
I want you to close your eyes, Will.

47
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,376
Imagine what you would like to happen.

48
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,482
What did you see?

49
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,855
Good.

50
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,525
Garbage.

51
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,155
Shall we talk about
what happened to poor Margot?

52
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,617
- We can get to that later.
- We can get to it now.

53
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,997
Family affairs are best left
to the family, Dr. Lecter.

54
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,707
You interfered.

55
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,125
I provided counsel.

56
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,877
You subverted me.

57
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,256
While you were subverting
the underprivileged children

58
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,633
at your summer camp,

59
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,177
what did you learn?

60
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,476
Keen student of the Bible that I am,

61
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,064
I learned about suffering.

62
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,904
Not mine, mind you, but the general conceit.

63
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,579
God's choices in inflicting suffering
are not satisfactory to us,

64
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,708
nor are they understandable,

65
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,087
unless innocence offends him.

66
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,886
Clearly, he needs help
in directing his blind fury

67
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,430
with which he flogs this earth.

68
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,684
Margot's happiness is more important
than her suffering.

69
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,688
You say that as though
the two are mutually exclusive.

70
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,067
I believe they are.

71
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,653
Can never say to a certainty.

72
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,990
It is one of those things that is hid,

73
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,494
as the Bible says.

74
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,707
Papa taught me how to hide

75
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,794
all sorts of things.

76
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,303
This was his knife.

77
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,099
I carry it around with me

78
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,309
to remind me of him.

79
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,814
Whose fat are you planning
to measure today, Mason?

80
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,065
Mine?

81
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,901
No fat on you.

82
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,488
Take more than a flesh wound
to make you squeal.

83
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,203
What game of chicken

84
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,791
are you and the sperm donor
playing, Dr. Lecter?

85
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,502
Don't get me wrong.

86
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,464
I play chicken with Margot all the time.

87
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,134
I just don't tell her I'm playing.

88
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,264
I'm good at chicken, Dr. Lecter.

89
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,851
I never blink.

90
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,730
Just send me the bill.

91
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,523
I'm so sorry.

92
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,171
He could have done
what was done laparoscopically,

93
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,883
but my brother told them to leave a scar.

94
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,095
He branded you.

95
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,224
Mason wants you to know
this can never be undone.

96
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,227
Mason can be undone.

97
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,522
Not without taking
everything I have with him.

98
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,900
He's all I've got now.

99
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,236
That's exactly what he wanted.

100
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,072
He won.

101
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,825
He always wins.

102
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,496
This won't make you human, Margot,

103
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,542
so much as give you the ability
to make yourself human and move on.

104
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,878
There's no resolve to this.

105
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,757
There's no resolution.

106
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,927
Moving on isn't just a distraction.

107
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,722
It's a rebuke.

108
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,311
Show your brother how strong you are.

109
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,233
Survive him.

110
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,283
Hannibal has a certain personality style
we can all learn from.

111
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,869
In moderation, of course.

112
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,331
All I want to do is catch him.

113
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,418
He's given me nothing, Jack.
Nothing actionable.

114
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,794
He has confessed to nothing.

115
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,548
He's acknowledged only vagaries.

116
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,134
I need more than vagaries.
You have killed someone, Will.

117
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,427
Who was trying to kill me.

118
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:59,055
I don't know if I can prove that.
You mutilated the body.

119
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,727
We made a public spectacle
of Freddie Lounds' death.

120
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,855
I'm out on a limb here,
and the limb is going to break.

121
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,899
I've only told the OIG
what they need to know.

122
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,193
Now, what haven't you told me?

123
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,661
Hannibal is trying to manipulate me
into murdering one of his patients.

124
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,080
Mason Verger.

125
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,251
But I can manipulate Hannibal
into killing him instead.

126
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,254
What's Verger done?

127
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,010
Hannibal considers him rude.

128
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,347
It's motive enough.

129
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,144
It's as though committing murders
has purged him of lesser rudeness.

130
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,521
We're talking about putting
a man's life in danger.

131
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,734
You know, sometimes, Jack, a good plan
is less about finding the best alternative

132
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,778
than it is about finding one that works.

133
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,738
Don't let empathy

134
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,282
confuse what you want

135
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,077
with what Lecter wants.

136
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,207
I told you, Jack, I'm a good fisherman.

137
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,126
We have to use the right bait.

138
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,588
When Hannibal tries to kill Mason Verger,
I'll arrest him,

139
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,466
and you'll have two witnesses.

140
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,552
We might have three.

141
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,390
I'm a good fisherman too, Will.

142
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,949
They tell me you were hard to find.

143
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,035
That was the idea.

144
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,874
Thank you

145
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,502
for visiting me in the hospital

146
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:39,466
and for what you said.

147
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,427
I didn't say enough.

148
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,850
And now's your chance to say it all.

149
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,439
You've been granted immunity
from prosecution

150
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,941
by the US Attorney from District 36,

151
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,320
and by local authorities
in a memorandum attached,

152
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,322
sworn and attested.

153
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,339
Let's talk about Hannibal Lecter.

154
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,346
Some psychiatrists are so hungry for insight

155
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,475
that they may try to manufacture it.

156
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,357
How deadly that can be
for the patient who believes them.

157
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,152
You were Dr. Lecter's psychiatrist.
He wasn't yours.

158
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,531
I told myself that,

159
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,993
but I was under Hannibal's influence.

160
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,873
What he did to you
made that abundantly clear.

161
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,337
You were attacked

162
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,967
by a patient who was formerly
under Dr. Lecter's care.

163
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,470
That patient died during the attack.

164
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,848
Report said he swallowed his tongue.

165
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,768
It wasn't attached at the time.

166
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,566
How

167
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,026
exactly

168
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,904
did your patient die?

169
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,285
I killed him.

170
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,340
I believed it was self-defense.

171
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,136
And to a point, it was.

172
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,098
But beyond that point,

173
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,809
it was murder.

174
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,191
Hannibal influenced me
to murder my patient.

175
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,111
Our patient.

176
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,616
You weren't

177
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,619
coerced?

178
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,456
What Hannibal does is not coercion.

179
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,084
It is persuasion.

180
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,968
Has he ever tried to persuade you
to kill anybody?

181
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,766
He will.

182
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,646
And it will be somebody you love.

183
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,485
And you will think
it's the only choice you have.

184
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,495
How would you catch him?

185
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,498
Hannibal can get lost

186
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,001
in self-congratulation

187
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,923
at his own exquisite taste and cunning.

188
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,635
Whimsy.

189
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,391
That will be how he will get caught.

190
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,491
We're maintaining our position
on the event horizon of chaos.

191
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:40,164
Your veneer of self-composure gives
a strong sense of the surreal.

192
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,964
So much about this feels like a dream.

193
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,802
Dreams prepare us for waking life.

194
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:59,475
It's one thing to dream, it's another to
understand the nature of the dream.

195
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:06,649
You're waking up to who you are.
That's all you need to understand.

196
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,534
There are extraordinary
circumstances here, Will.

197
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,412
And unusual opportunities.

198
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,206
For whom?

199
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,250
For both of us.

200
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,711
Mason Verger is an opportunity?

201
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,840
Mason Verger is a problem.

202
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,010
Problem solving is hunting.

203
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,556
It's a savage pleasure, and we are born to it.

204
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,101
A pleasure we can share.

205
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,526
You're fostering codependency.

206
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,782
Is that what I'm doing?

207
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,287
Isn't that what you did to Abigail?

208
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,334
Got her to take a life so she'd owe you hers?

209
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,096
I bond with Abigail,

210
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,182
you take her away.

211
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,434
I bond with

212
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,439
barely more than the idea of a child,
you take it away.

213
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,108
You saw to it that

214
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,318
I alienated Alana,

215
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,987
alienated Jack.

216
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,745
You don't want me
to have anything in my life

217
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,372
that's not you.

218
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,042
I only want what's best for you.

219
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,585
Please.

220
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:56,384
Every moment of cogent thought
under your psychiatric care

221
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,386
is a personal victory.

222
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,101
You're applying yourself to my perspective

223
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,021
as I've been applying myself to yours.

224
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,777
You're right.

225
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,739
We are just alike.

226
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,537
You're as alone as I am.

227
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:30,001
And we're both alone without each other.

228
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,721
So you managed to avoid prosecution.

229
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,693
I gave you every opportunity
to tell the truth, but you ran.

230
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,281
How do you think
the FBI could have protected me?

231
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,744
You couldn't protect Will Graham.
You still can't.

232
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,874
Nothing makes us more vulnerable
than loneliness, Agent Crawford.

233
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,126
Will's not alone.

234
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,921
No, he's not.

235
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,092
Hannibal thinks Will is a killer.

236
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,805
Do you still believe he is your killer?

237
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,934
I have to believe.

238
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,104
Hannibal's only crime I witnessed

239
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,273
was influence.

240
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,028
Influence works best when we're unaware.

241
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,033
Will Graham has been very aware.

242
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,910
Meaning?

243
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,997
Meaning maybe Mr. Graham
doesn't know himself

244
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,041
as well as Hannibal does.

245
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,087
Will has more reasons
to see Hannibal caught

246
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,546
than any of us.

247
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,884
If you think you're about to catch Hannibal,

248
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,845
that's because he wants you to think that.

249
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:11,060
Don't fool yourself into thinking
he's not in control of what's happening.

250
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,701
Kholodets.

251
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,955
A Ukrainian dish whose outcome
can never be predicted.

252
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,465
The Latin word "gelatus"

253
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,216
translates as "frozen."

254
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,220
Here, the aspic provides
a three-dimensional canvas

255
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,222
in which one may stage a scene.

256
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,183
The eternal chase.

257
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,477
An evocative shape,

258
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:38,814
in that at a certain point,
it becomes unclear who's pursuing whom.

259
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,486
Well, in isolation,

260
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,989
a moment can't really speak
to motive, intent or aftermath.

261
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,575
Aspic is derived from bone

262
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,370
as a life is made from moments.

263
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,832
So, tell me, Hannibal,

264
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,835
what moment are we in now?

265
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,421
You, me, Will?

266
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,635
Still harboring doubts about Will?

267
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,557
Alana Bloom isn't harboring any doubts.

268
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,769
She's convinced
that he murdered Freddie Lounds.

269
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,231
And you?

270
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,693
I am convinced of
my general lack of trust in other people.

271
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,281
Lack of trust in other people
increases the need for religion.

272
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,076
If you can't rely on others,

273
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,994
you have to rely on God.

274
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,041
I'm relying on myself.

275
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,421
And yet in this moment,
I have to confess that

276
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,427
I don't know who's pursuing whom
any more than these fish do.

277
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,058
Whomever is pursuing whom
in this very moment,

278
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,644
I intend to eat them.

279
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,518
All right, guys. Eat up.

280
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,620
Mr. Verger wants your company.

281
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,456
Please, come with us.

282
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,638
Matteo.

283
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,185
He shouldn't have done that.

284
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,930
You are Sardinian.

285
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,810
If you have to be kidnapped for ransom,

286
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,149
a wealthy Italian will tell you
it's better to fall into the hands of the Sards.

287
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,903
And you're a professional revenger
as well, I suspect.

288
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,655
With you

289
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,241
it is personal now.

290
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,164
I take it Matteo didn't make it.

291
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,875
Did he foul himself?

292
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,211
I imagine he smells worse than you by now.

293
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,674
Kill him and you will get no money! Carlo!

294
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,009
Carlo!

295
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,532
Those little piggies are gonna go
"whee" all the way home.

296
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,493
Yes!

297
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,789
The swine may be shy

298
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,959
with starting with the toes,
so we need to encourage them

299
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,212
with a little sauce.

300
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,800
So we're gonna cut your throat.

301
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,261
Padrone, he killed Matteo.

302
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,598
We can give Matteo's family

303
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,727
Doctorone's cojones for comfort.

304
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,646
Capisci?

305
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,403
He likes to cut low.

306
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,993
You are an odd psychiatrist.

307
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,498
We could've had
some good, funny times together.

308
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,710
It's a damn shame!

309
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,672
I've muzzled the dog.

310
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,342
Now, it's time for you to put him down.

311
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,271
Don't bleed him out! Just...

312
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,774
Just a little nick.
Just enough to give the pigs a taste.

313
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,115
Carlo!

314
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,830
Mason, I must ask you to be quiet.

315
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,457
You'll frighten the animals.

316
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,462
Piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy.
Piggy, piggy. Here, piggy, piggy.

317
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,966
What?

318
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,053
What have you given me?

319
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,765
A variety of psychedelic compounds.

320
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:38,854
Psychedelic, so named from the Greek
for "mind revealing."

321
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:45,861
You need to write me
a prescription for this, Doctor.

322
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,038
Patients rhapsodize about
the life-changing insights they achieve.

323
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,917
I am enchanted and terrified.

324
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,677
The world presents itself
as a cacophony of sights, sounds, smells,

325
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,804
and recollections.

326
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,976
I want you to recall your education
in stockyards and slaughterhouses.

327
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:25,025
Show me how Papa would check
the depth of a pig's fat.

328
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,407
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

329
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,867
No, Mason.

330
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,202
No.

331
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,790
Show me on you.

332
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,435
Hey, Winston.

333
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,481
Where's everyone else?

334
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,716
I just love your dogs.

335
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,970
How is that? Is that good?
Do you want another piece?

336
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,639
How about you? That's a good girl.

337
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,307
Sit! Sit!

338
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,559
Mason?

339
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,729
I adopted some dogs from the shelter,

340
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,231
two dogs, that were friends.

341
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:50,652
I had them in a cage together
with no food and fresh water.

342
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,196
One of them died hungry.

343
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,908
The other had a warm meal.

344
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,664
I should have put you
in a cage with Dr. Lecter.

345
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm curious what would've happened.

346
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,129
What are you feeding my dogs?

347
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,260
Just me.

348
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,770
Sit. Sit.

349
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:41,703
What Mason is experiencing
isn't restricted to reality.

350
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,166
So reality has to be forced to adapt.

351
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,668
He fed his face to my dogs.

352
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,922
He broadened their palates
as I broadened yours.

353
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,429
Murder or mercy?

354
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,810
There is no mercy.

355
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,938
We make mercy,

356
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:14,945
manufacture it in the parts
that have overgrown our basic reptile brain.

357
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,074
Then there is no murder.
We make murder, too.

358
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,119
It matters only to us.

359
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,541
You know too well you possess
all the elements to make murder.

360
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,837
Perhaps mercy too, but murder
you understand uncomfortably well.

361
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,880
I'm hungry.

362
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,676
Eat your nose then.

363
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,511
Eat my...

364
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,223
Eat my nose?

365
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,618
I have a taste and consistency

366
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,455
that's similar to that of a chicken gizzard.

367
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,293
Taste is housed in parts of the mind
that precedes pity.

368
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,087
Pity has no place at the table.

369
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,881
I'm full of myself.

370
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,468
I'm not gonna kill him.

371
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,721
So full of myself.

372
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:28,226
He was going to feed you to his pigs
after he fed them me.

373
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,645
Weren't you, Mason?

374
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,274
I was.

375
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,196
He's your patient, Doctor.

376
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,366
You do what you think is best for him.

377
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,957
Good afternoon. Agent Crawford?

378
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,417
Yes. Good afternoon, Mr. Verger.

379
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,922
What a magnificent creature.

380
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,840
Oh, thank you.

381
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,135
It's a Muraena kidako.

382
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,014
Its common name is Brutal Moray.

383
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,726
Would you like to see why?

384
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,772
No, thank you.

385
00:37:56,482 --> 00:38:00,151
I don't want to take up too much
of your time, Mr. Verger.

386
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,321
I realize that you probably need
to get your rest.

387
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,951
But I would like to ask you
just a few questions about

388
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,662
what happened to you.

389
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,749
Took a tumble in the pig pen.
Broke my neck.

390
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,002
Embarrassing, really.

391
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,713
Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.

392
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,215
If my sister hadn't found me,

393
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,010
the pigs would have eaten
more than my face.

394
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,262
Pigs did this to you?

395
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,515
Yes, the pigs certainly did.

396
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:40,400
Mr. Verger, you are a patient
of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, isn't that right?

397
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,695
Dr. Lecter, yes, yes.

398
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,782
Have you ever seen or met
another patient of Dr. Lecter's,

399
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,326
a man called Will Graham?

400
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,329
Will Graham.

401
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,708
The man that didn't kill all those people.

402
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,044
- That Will Graham?
- Yes.

403
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,463
Can't say that I've had the pleasure.

404
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,051
Do you find that Dr. Lecter's therapy
has been helpful to you?

405
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,637
I've benefited greatly
from Dr. Lecter's therapy.

406
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,639
I'm still benefitting from it.

407
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,435
I will always be grateful
for how he's helped me.

408
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,856
I only hope that I may repay him one day.

409
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,866
Now, if you don't mind, I am rather tired.

410
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,370
Thank you for your time, Mr. Verger.

411
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,017
Is it time to talk about what Margot wants?

412
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,521
What Margot wants

413
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,108
is to take care of you, Mason, dear.

414
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,362
Just as you took care of me.

415
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,964
Achilles lamenting the death of Patroclus.

416
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,385
Whenever he's mentioned in The Iliad,

417
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,346
Patroclus seems to be defined
by his empathy.

418
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,892
He became Achilles on the field of war.

419
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,313
- He died for him there, wearing his armor.
- He did.

420
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,401
Hiding and revealing identity

421
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,112
is a constant theme
throughout the Greek epics.

422
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,532
As are battle-tested friendships.

423
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,288
Achilles wished all Greeks would die,

424
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,250
so that he and Patroclus
could conquer Troy alone.

425
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,256
Took divine intervention
to bring them down.

426
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,181
This isn't sustainable.

427
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,895
We're going to get caught.

428
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,195
Jack already suspects
you killed Freddie Lounds.

429
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,406
If Jack told you he suspects me,
that means he suspects you.

430
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,532
I know.

431
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,875
You should give him what he wants.

432
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,589
Give him the Chesapeake Ripper?

433
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,594
Allow him closure.

434
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,475
Reveal yourself.

435
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,395
You've taunted him for long enough.

436
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,983
Let him see you with clear eyes.

437
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,447
Jack has become my friend.

438
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,994
I suppose I owe him the truth.
