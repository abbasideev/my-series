1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,043
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,295
I've given my life to death.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,839
And now death has followed you home.

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,507
I don't think I want to do chemotherapy.

5
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,718
- Well, do I have any say in this?
- No.

6
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,053
I'm devoting a lot of time to this mural, Will.

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,221
Could use your help.

8
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,265
What was the cause of death
in the bailiff's murder?

9
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,307
A bullet.

10
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,809
And in Will Graham's victims?

11
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,852
Mutilation.

12
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,312
There are clearly two different killers
and two different cases.

13
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,065
Will claimed someone else
committed the crimes he's accused of.

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,275
He said that person was you.

15
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,651
Perhaps he was half right.

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,913
Wrap the leader around the tippet.

17
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:46,170
Four, five, six times.

18
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,132
Tuck the end between the lines.

19
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,885
Tighten.

20
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,970
And trim.

21
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,598
It's called a blood knot.

22
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,313
Your father taught you how to hunt.

23
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,774
I'm going to teach you how to fish.

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,860
Same thing, isn't it?

25
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,362
One you stalk, the other you lure.

26
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,824
One you catch, the other you shoot.

27
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,079
What are you trying to catch?

28
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,874
The one who caught you.

29
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,877
The one that got away.

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,007
Catch a fish once and it gets away,
it's a lot harder to catch again.

31
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,520
Everybody thinks you're lying
about the one that got away.

32
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,065
That's why I have to catch him.

33
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,739
Last thing before casting a line,

34
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,910
name the bait on your hook
after somebody you cherished.

35
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,329
To say goodbye?

36
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,166
The person you name it after cherished you,
as the superstition goes,

37
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,334
you will catch the fish.

38
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,798
And what did you name it?

39
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,301
Abigail.

40
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,622
You were right. Killer was in the mural.

41
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,001
Just where you said he'd be.
His name was James Gray.

42
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,253
We found his vehicle outside the farm.

43
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,798
Enough DNA on the bed of his truck
for us to be confident he's the Muralist.

44
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,467
You found as much evidence on him
as you did on me.

45
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,344
I'm glad you said it.

46
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,639
Who stitched him into the mural?

47
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,017
We don't know.

48
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,437
He may have had a partner. Another killer.
Maybe they had a suicide pact.

49
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,731
No. There was no partner.

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,235
This artist worked alone
until he was stitched into his own creation.

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,738
- No signs of a struggle.
- No.

52
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,908
So, this second killer, whoever he is,

53
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,828
understood the Muralist well enough
not just to find his canvas,

54
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,497
but well enough to convince him
to be part of it.

55
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,750
- You have an idea who that might be?
- I do.

56
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,254
- Don't say Hannibal Lecter.
- I'm saying Hannibal Lecter.

57
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,131
Didn't you stop ringing that bell?

58
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,926
I'm not asking you to believe
anything you can't prove.

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,677
I'm just asking you to prove it.

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,971
- Hannibal Lecter has no reason...
- That is exactly right.

61
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,765
He has no discernible reason

62
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,684
other than his own amusement
and curiosity.

63
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,312
That's hard to prove.

64
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,900
There will be a very clever detail
to find on James Gray.

65
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,902
He wouldn't be able to resist it.

66
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,488
Probably something that was overlooked.

67
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,281
Something hidden.

68
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,078
I'll look for clever details.

69
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,956
But I'm not looking for Hannibal.

70
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,917
Just as long as you're looking.

71
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,420
You look out there.

72
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,299
I'll look in here.

73
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,784
I'll give you the same deal
I gave Beverly Katz.

74
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,538
Oh, you know what it is.

75
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,790
You've been recording our conversations.

76
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,585
Or are we pretending you didn't?

77
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,589
What this are you offering
in exchange for my that?

78
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,551
I'm quite the topic of conversation
in psychiatric circles.

79
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,225
I shared my diagnosis of you
on the witness stand.

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,981
Your personality disorders,
neurosis, all forgeries.

81
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,234
Even if that were true,
I'd still be a psychopath of some interest.

82
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,945
Quite a manipulative one at that.

83
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,656
Poor, confused, wounded bird

84
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,826
for Agent Crawford
and Doctors Lecter and Bloom.

85
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,789
But for me, well,
I get the psychopath's triumvirate,

86
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,001
charm, focus and ruthlessness.

87
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,087
The charm being debatable, of course.

88
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,966
So either I'm a psychopath
or I am delusional.

89
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,428
Or I'm right about Hannibal Lecter.

90
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,639
Aren't you curious which one it is?

91
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,811
- Will you allow me to test you?
- Test me?

92
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,647
I'll take them all.

93
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:44,194
You will be the first and last word
in the mind of Will Graham.

94
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,696
God, you could dine out on that for years.

95
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,158
What about Dr. Lecter?

96
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,371
Shouldn't you be
my one and only psychiatrist, Dr. Chilton?

97
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,164
Ideally.

98
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,293
Well then, as to your that for my this.

99
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:06,716
Do not discuss me or my therapy
with Hannibal Lecter.

100
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,430
Tell him that you've decided
I am no longer any of his business.

101
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,437
I am now under your exclusive care.

102
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,402
Lazarus had it good.

103
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,573
My social circle doesn't include
a friend with power over death.

104
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,328
I suppose I should've embraced Facebook
while I had the chance.

105
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,011
I never should have let Jack
talk me into taking chemo.

106
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,181
He's trying to extend your life.

107
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:58,351
He's trying to extend the quality of life
that's not worth the effort.

108
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,313
Jack's efforts or yours?

109
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,151
I'm vomiting my stomach lining.

110
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:15,535
On a good day, I sleep 15 to 18 hours.

111
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,705
On a bad day, I don't sleep.

112
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,753
My best-case scenario
is prolonged pain management.

113
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,215
Jack will help you manage.

114
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,552
He loves you, Bella.

115
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,807
When you are gone,
he will feel your silence like a draft.

116
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,228
My silence is inevitable.

117
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,648
The war is over.

118
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,277
The cancer is an occupying force.

119
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:55,325
I want to surrender
while I still have my dignity.

120
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,873
You are considering ending your life?

121
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,253
Suicide seems like a valid solution
to my problem.

122
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,299
How does that make you feel?

123
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,597
Alive.

124
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,603
How does it make you feel?

125
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,651
I've always found
the idea of death comforting.

126
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,530
The thought that my life
could end at any moment

127
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:38,285
frees me to fully appreciate the beauty
and art

128
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,039
and horror of everything
this world has to offer.

129
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,499
A death benefit?

130
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,918
Upon taking his own life,

131
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,047
Socrates offered a rooster
to the god of healing, Asclepius,

132
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,091
to pay his debt.

133
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,385
What debt might that be?

134
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,888
To Socrates, death was not a defeat

135
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,309
but a cure.

136
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,903
Gentlemen.

137
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,948
Local police were supposed to
exterminate the bees

138
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,241
so we could work the crime scene.

139
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,784
Apparently, someone shut that down.

140
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,369
- I did.
- He did.

141
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,537
Jimmy?

142
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,748
Well, I love bees.

143
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,250
Did you know that the drone

144
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,754
is nature's
most talented suicidal swordsman?

145
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,756
When the drone mates with the queen,

146
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,676
his ejaculation is so explosive
it's audible to the human ear.

147
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,095
All right.

148
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,639
How long has he been out here?

149
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,892
From de-comp, I'd estimate two weeks.

150
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,353
Which makes sense
with how much honey is being produced.

151
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,649
Do bees naturally hive
in human carcasses like this?

152
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,653
No. The victim was purposely repurposed
as a human apiary.

153
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,237
Purposely.

154
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,116
Somebody removed the eyes
and part of the brain

155
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,534
to make room for the hive.

156
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,540
Zeller's out in the field,
otherwise I'd ask him to help me with this.

157
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,793
You were a surgeon, right?

158
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,462
I was a surgeon and a doctor, yes.

159
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,173
Have you found any evidence
on the Muralist's friend?

160
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,343
That's what I need your help with.
Might not have been a friend.

161
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,679
Might not have even been an acquaintance.

162
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,806
Whoever killed him, understood him.

163
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,519
So often you open your mouth
and I hear Will Graham's words come out.

164
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,315
I have an arrangement with Will.

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,484
He's agreed to consult with me on cases,

166
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,903
if I keep investigating
the murders he's accused of.

167
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,156
I'm happy to hear that.

168
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:45,662
- Will needs a champion now more than ever.
- He has you, doesn't he?

169
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,332
You think there's a chance
he could be innocent. I know you do.

170
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,253
I believe there is a possibility.

171
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,715
I'm just relieved he's not saying
the killer is you anymore.

172
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,926
At least not to me.

173
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,264
Who does Will believe killed the Muralist?

174
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,765
Doesn't know.

175
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,185
He thinks if James Gray's killer
hid him in the mural,

176
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,770
he may have hid something else.

177
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,605
A signature?

178
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,569
What kind of killer
seeks to depict the unconscious,

179
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:22,866
instinctual striving of his victim
by sewing him into his own human mural?

180
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,077
It wasn't just for appearances.

181
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,998
You have to get to the truth
beneath the appearances.

182
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,042
Only by going deep beneath the skin

183
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,546
will you understand
the nature of this killer's pathology.

184
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,223
Before I start asking you questions,
I need some confidence

185
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,477
that you will be telling the truth
when you answer.

186
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,438
- What's this?
- A consent form.

187
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,982
You're agreeing to a narcoanalytic interview.

188
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:00,069
You, me and our old friend, sodium amytal.

189
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,030
A little something to loosen my tongue?

190
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:06,034
Something lawfully used
in the evaluation of psychotic patients.

191
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,498
What would you use to induce memory loss
in a patient, psychotic or otherwise?

192
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,128
The protein synthesis that moves memories
from short-term to long-term

193
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,422
can be interrupted,

194
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,383
but that requires tools and skills.

195
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,094
And a certain level of unorthodoxy.

196
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,889
Does Hannibal Lecter
possess those tools and skills?

197
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,227
Dr. Lecter has indicated to me
that he is open to the unorthodox

198
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,521
when it comes to treating patients.

199
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,397
I wonder how that subject came up.

200
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,442
Sharing stories of the unorthodox?

201
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,110
Sign here.

202
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,428
I want you to draw a clock for me.

203
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,730
Did Dr. Lecter administer any drug therapies
during your sessions together?

204
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,034
The strobe causes neurons to fire en masse,

205
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,203
like striking many piano keys at once.

206
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,252
The strobe causes neurons to fire en masse,

207
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,379
like striking many...

208
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,052
The dissonance might foster
a change in your mind.

209
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,225
Is something wrong?

210
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,566
Will?

211
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,697
He was inducing the seizures.

212
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,534
He was encouraging them,
blackouts, the lost time.

213
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,913
It was strategic. It was planned.

214
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,960
You would only see a seizure response

215
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,587
in a brain afflicted
with photosensitive epilepsy.

216
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,173
Or afflicted by something just as damaging.

217
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,009
Like encephalitis.

218
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,143
That would suggest
a radically unorthodox form of therapy.

219
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,354
Yes, it would.

220
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,072
Dr. Lecter.

221
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,909
I am so embarrassed.

222
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,953
You didn't get my message?

223
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,832
I canceled your appointment
with Will Graham.

224
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,375
Is everything all right?

225
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,252
I can explain. Shall we?

226
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,634
Will is at a delicate point in his therapy.

227
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,762
I don't want to confuse him
any more than he already is.

228
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,930
Confuse him?

229
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,474
Isn't it your opinion
he's an intelligent psychopath?

230
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,811
It was, but my opinion is evolving.

231
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,189
After administering
a narcoanalytic interview,

232
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,027
therapeutically vital information
has come to light.

233
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,987
What sort of information?

234
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,741
What Will Graham suffers from
may not be a single condition,

235
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:19,370
but a continuum of illnesses,
all with different neurological mechanisms.

236
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,749
Some naturally occurring,
others appear to have been induced.

237
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,584
Induced?

238
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,502
Induced by whom?

239
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,090
Did you ever use any kind of
light stimulation in your treatment?

240
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,719
Light stimulation
is a standard tool for neurotherapy.

241
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,972
Evidently, it was
overloading his visual cortex.

242
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,893
Creating seizures, time loss,
gaps in his memory.

243
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,521
Almost strategically, it seems.

244
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,859
You're suggesting it was intentional?

245
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,195
All our conversations about psychic driving,

246
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,697
you were so curious and eager
to hear what I had to say

247
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,199
while saying very little yourself.

248
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,909
I had very little to say.

249
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,953
I have been thinking about the possibility

250
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,290
that you may have been
psychic driving Will Graham all along.

251
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,878
A bold accusation, Frederick.

252
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,131
You are not the only psychiatrist
accused of making a patient kill.

253
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,345
We have to stick together.

254
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,398
Last time I did this, this isn't how I did this.

255
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,153
The young man at the dispensary
calls this Purple Kush.

256
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:50,837
He says all his cancer patients
love its "deep body stone."

257
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,172
Okay.

258
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,341
May I?

259
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,304
- Do you still get drug tested?
- Oh, come on, give me that thing.

260
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,854
I'm supporting my wife.

261
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,990
I filled out my advance directive today.

262
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,200
I added a DNR.

263
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,620
Oh, you are harshing my buzz right now.

264
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,251
I read an article the other day
about magnetic hyperthermia.

265
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:36,757
It's looking promising
as a treatment for lung cancer.

266
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,143
Come here.

267
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,566
I know what to expect from lung cancer.

268
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,569
I am my mother's daughter,

269
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,157
and I watched her go through
exactly what I am going through now.

270
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,450
I know.

271
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:07,747
Hey. I remember sitting by her bed

272
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,961
when she woke up in so much pain
that all she could do was scream my name.

273
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,090
I didn't know how to help her.

274
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,259
So I did nothing.

275
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,928
There was nothing you could do.

276
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,599
And there will be a time
when there is nothing you can do.

277
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:33,147
And I don't want you to remember me
pleading with you to make the pain go away.

278
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,611
Oh, I'm not going to remember you that way.

279
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,114
First of all, I'm going to remember you

280
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,867
walking along the quays of Italy
in the sunshine

281
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:49,664
with a trail of signori behind you
shouting, "Bella, Bella, Bella."

282
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,127
And I'm going to remember that your hands,

283
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,174
they smelled of thyme
when you came in from the garden,

284
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,303
and garlic and onions
every time you left the kitchen.

285
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,811
I'm going to remember you
as beautiful as you are right now.

286
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,065
Well, good.

287
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,236
Good.

288
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:40,006
Duncan Halloran, 52, divorced, bankrupt.
Reported missing six months ago.

289
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,924
And what do we know about his death?

290
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,593
Considering any post-mortem
morphological changes,

291
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,263
this guy's white blood cell count
was through the roof when he died.

292
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,224
You're telling me his killer was a fever
and/or a massive infection?

293
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,101
Lock them both up.

294
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,271
No family. No money. No reason to live.

295
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,690
Alive, dead or dying,
who put him under the tree?

296
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,610
It's possible we're dealing with
a highly motivated religious individual here.

297
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,487
- Explain.
- In Hinduism,

298
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,990
honey is one of the
five elixirs of immortality.

299
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,785
In Christianity, the bee is considered to be
an emblem of Christ,

300
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,246
his mildness and mercy on one side,

301
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,207
- his Old Testament justice on the other.
- Okay.

302
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,251
The orbital bone, his sphenoid,

303
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,504
behind where the eyeballs would usually be,
there's tiny punctures.

304
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,799
Something long and sharp
was pushed in his brain.

305
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,719
Jack, this guy was lobotomized.

306
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,894
- How are you feeling today?
- Not well.

307
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:39,231
My arthritis is killing me.
I can't take much more of it.

308
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,569
A course of bee venom therapy
would soothe the inflammation.

309
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,739
I can barely afford this treatment.

310
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,450
That's a problem for another day.

311
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,789
Now, you just quiet your mind.

312
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,709
Just live in the present.

313
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,547
- You feel that?
- No.

314
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,758
Good.

315
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,178
- You feel that?
- No.

316
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,430
Good.

317
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,185
Feel that?

318
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,479
I can't feel anything.

319
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,233
Good.

320
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,863
Then you won't feel this.

321
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,204
Mister, you're not supposed to
stare at the sun.

322
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,332
It'll hurt your eyes.

323
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:36,182
Multiple holes in this guy.
Over a dozen. Both eye sockets.

324
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,729
The lesions have severed
most of the nerve tract to the frontal lobe.

325
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,940
He's covered in bee stings
like he got swarmed.

326
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,027
Must be floating in apitoxin,
probably doesn't feel a thing.

327
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,613
Yeah, him not feeling anything
has got nothing to do with bee stings.

328
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,449
Welcome to the world of the living dead.

329
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,992
There's a pattern.

330
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,078
- Hey.
- Hey.

331
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,831
- Look what the cat's dragged in.
- What are you looking at?

332
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,541
- A pattern.
- A pattern.

333
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,463
See, some of the bee stings
triggered an allergic reaction, others didn't.

334
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,299
The inflamed bee stings
were all in line with the body's meridian,

335
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,176
on acupuncture points.

336
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,596
The bee stings are hiding the needle marks.

337
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,598
What did you say?

338
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,101
The bee stings are hiding the needle marks?

339
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,550
The stitches are hiding stitches.

340
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,389
Only by going deep beneath the skin

341
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,559
will you understand
the nature of this killer's pathology.

342
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,031
He took his kidney.

343
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,493
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

344
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,413
Tell me if he's real.

345
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,501
- I don't see anyone.
- No, he's right there.

346
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,337
- There's no one there. We're alone.
- What are you talking about? You're lying.

347
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,381
You came here alone.
Do you remember coming here?

348
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,259
- Please don't lie to me.
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs is dead.

349
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,054
- You killed him. You watched him die.
- What's happening to me?

350
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,264
Will.

351
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,685
Will, you're having an episode.
I want you to hand me the gun.

352
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,062
Will, I want you to hand me your...

353
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,188
Will.

354
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,877
He's had a mild seizure.

355
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,340
That doesn't seem to bother you.

356
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,842
I said it was mild.

357
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,147
Are you the man who claimed
to be the Chesapeake Ripper?

358
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,235
Why do you say "claimed"?

359
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,363
Because you're not.

360
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,449
You know you're not,
and you don't know much more

361
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,326
about who you are beyond that.

362
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,872
Are you the Ripper?

363
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,669
A terrible thing.

364
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,423
To have your identity taken from you.

365
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,991
Whoever killed James Gray
didn't just take his leg.

366
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,911
Sutures hidden beneath the stitching
that wove him into the mural.

367
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,746
One crime made to look like another.

368
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,748
Like the copycat.

369
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,796
And the Chesapeake Ripper.

370
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,925
Now you're saying
Hannibal Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper?

371
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,594
I'm saying also the Chesapeake Ripper.

372
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,101
- Were the kidneys surgically removed?
- Yes.

373
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,854
- Dr. Lecter was a surgeon.
- I know he was.

374
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,064
I asked him to consult
on James Gray's autopsy.

375
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,277
You what?

376
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,865
If you invited him with an actual agenda,
Hannibal would know it.

377
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,575
He pointed me to the evidence.

378
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,661
He pointed you to an absence of evidence.

379
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,830
He's baiting a hook, Beverly.

380
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,625
He's toying with you.
Go to Jack. Tell him everything.

381
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,628
I can't bring this to Jack
until I can back it up.

382
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,049
Stay away from Hannibal Lecter.

383
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,972
The Chesapeake Ripper
kept surgical trophies.

384
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,309
If Hannibal's the Ripper,
what's he doing with his trophies?

385
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,126
He's eating them.

386
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,409
- Katherine Pimms?
- Yes.

387
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,995
I'm Special Agent Jack Crawford
with the FBI.

388
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,248
This is Agent Zeller and Agent Price.

389
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,917
We'd like to speak with you
about two of your former patients.

390
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,669
Would you like to come in?

391
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,297
When was the last time
you saw Duncan Halloran or Lloyd Roat?

392
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,842
Whenever our last appointments were.

393
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,303
- I can check in my calendar, if you want.
- Sure.

394
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,139
- Have you found them?
- Yes, we have.

395
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,727
Mr. Halloran is deceased.
And Mr. Roat might as well be.

396
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,941
Poor Mr. Halloran.

397
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,902
What were you treating him for?

398
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,406
That man trudged from disease to disease.

399
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,909
He had severe combined immunodeficiency.

400
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,621
Life didn't seem to be going his way.

401
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,540
- Please.
- Thank you.

402
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,758
I find that people don't get their own way

403
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,056
because they often don't know themselves

404
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,268
where that way leads.

405
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,899
Mr. Halloran, he couldn't envision
a dignified end of life.

406
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,361
So it's much nicer to die,

407
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,573
well, for him, to die in a meadow,

408
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,784
a head full of bees.

409
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,124
- Have you tried the honey?
- No.

410
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,545
I couldn't bring myself to either.
It seemed too morbid.

411
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,342
So you left him in the field to die?

412
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,471
I brought him to the field to die.
I didn't kill him.

413
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,143
I quieted his mind
so that he could die in peace.

414
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,439
And Mr. Roat? You quieted his mind, too?

415
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,149
Oh, him.

416
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,819
He suffered crippling arthritis.

417
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,949
After he was quieted,

418
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,247
I saw him walk pain-free
for the very first time in his life.

419
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:46,630
I can't make pain go away,
but I can make it so that it doesn't matter.

420
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,426
I protected them.

421
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:57,015
I protected these people from hopelessness.

422
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,518
And that's beautiful.

423
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,362
Please come in.

424
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,364
It's a little unnerving,

425
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,117
not being able to walk across the floor.

426
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:21,456
Nothing can be so unnerving
for someone strong as being weak.

427
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,712
I was so weak after chemotherapy,

428
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,674
Jack had to physically pick me up.

429
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,679
It was the second time
he carried me across the threshold.

430
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,393
I brought you something.

431
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,395
A gift?

432
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,235
Paying my debt.

433
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,031
Coq Gaulois.

434
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,324
For helping me understand

435
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,453
that death is not a defeat

436
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,663
but a cure.

437
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,302
What have you taken, Bella?

438
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,054
My morphine.

439
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,307
Every bit of it.

440
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,564
I didn't want to die at home.

441
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,568
I didn't want Jack to find me.

442
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,865
I didn't want him to make that call,

443
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,370
be in the room with my body,

444
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,457
waiting.

445
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,339
For it to become some ceremonial object

446
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,132
apart from him,

447
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,804
separate from who I was.

448
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,350
Someone he can only

449
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,939
hold in his mind.

450
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,615
You denied him his goodbye.

451
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,702
I denied him

452
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,582
a painful goodbye

453
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,922
and allowed myself a peaceful one.

454
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,846
Tell Jack

455
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,728
I love him very much.

456
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,524
Yes.

457
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,032
Goodbye,

458
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,036
Dr. Lecter.

459
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,646
Goodbye, Bella.

460
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,984
No.

461
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,085
Hey. Have you seen Jack?

462
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,547
Oh. No, no, no,
there was some emergency with his wife.

463
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,716
Dr. Lecter called from the hospital,
asked him to come down.

464
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,552
- Is Mrs. Crawford okay?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

465
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,515
So Hannibal's at the hospital, too?

466
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,290
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

467
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,335
I'm here.

468
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,880
I'm here.

469
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,983
What are you doing here?

470
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,113
I want to apologize.

471
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,410
I couldn't honor what you asked of me.

472
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,422
I'm sorry.

473
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Get out.

474
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,332
Gotcha.

475
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,733
Oh, my God.
