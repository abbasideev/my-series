1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,627
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,421
This killer doesn't think
like anyone else, Jack.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,299
You'll have to find someone who
doesn't think like anyone else to catch him.

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,510
- There's no evidence I did this.
- Let him go.

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,845
You're making a mistake, Jack.

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,181
I know what it's like
to point at a killer and have no one listen.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,641
You pointed in the wrong direction.

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,477
Don't lie to me, Dr. Lecter.

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,354
I believe my brother won't stop.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,148
If you really want
to kill your brother, Margot,

11
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,649
wait until you can get away with it.

12
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,443
Or find someone to do it for you.

13
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,153
You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.

14
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,238
I believe you.

15
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,701
Which answer is it you want to hear, Will?

16
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:41,915
What's happening now
and about to happen is an answer.

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,628
I want an admission.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,008
I want you to admit what you are.

19
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,677
Must I denounce myself as a monster

20
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,930
while you still refuse to see
the one growing inside you?

21
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,073
Why not appeal to my better nature?

22
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,950
I wasn't aware you had one.

23
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,244
No one can be fully aware

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,246
of another human being
unless we love them.

25
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,294
By that love we see potential in our beloved.

26
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,632
Through that love,
we allow our beloved to see their potential.

27
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:45,270
Expressing that love,
our beloved's potential comes true.

28
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,751
I promised you a reckoning.

29
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,422
Here it is.

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,105
That smells wonderful.

31
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,194
Sacromonte omelet
with liver and sweetbreads.

32
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,364
Sacromonte was
the Gypsy hood of Granada.

33
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,451
I visited Granada when I was a young man.

34
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,581
- I've never been.
- No?

35
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,919
I fell in love with many things,
in particular, this dish.

36
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,340
I remember my time there so vividly,

37
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,383
like I frescoed the walls of my mind.

38
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,804
I used to be afraid of losing my memory.

39
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,642
What I wouldn't give to forget
a thing or two now.

40
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,233
My compliments
to the Gypsy hood of Granada.

41
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,529
Memory gives moments immortality,
but forgetfulness promotes a healthy mind.

42
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,241
It's good to forget.

43
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,703
What are you trying to forget, Jack?

44
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,957
Doubt. I let doubt in.

45
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,584
About me?

46
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,795
About Will.

47
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,011
I can no longer discuss
Will's state of mind with you

48
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,639
or anyone else without his consent.

49
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,060
Will's officially my patient.
He employs me now, not the FBI.

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,064
Well, let's hope your therapy works.

51
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,566
Therapy only works when
we have a genuine desire

52
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,985
to know ourselves as we are,

53
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,779
not as we would like to be.

54
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,777
Do you have any regrets?

55
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,823
With every choice lies
the possibility of regret.

56
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,703
However, if I choose not to do something,
it's usually for a good reason.

57
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,081
I'm...

58
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,835
Riddled with regrets.

59
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,508
A life without regret would be no life at all.

60
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,348
I regret what I did in the stable.

61
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,643
Then you were lucky I was there.

62
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,564
No, no, no.

63
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,610
Being lucky

64
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,862
isn't the same as making a mistake.

65
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,037
The mistake was allowing you to stop me.

66
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,791
So, it's not pulling
the trigger that you regret...

67
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,712
It's not pulling it effectively.

68
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,760
That would be more accurate.

69
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,351
You must adapt your behavior
to avoid feeling the same way again, Will.

70
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,729
Adapt.

71
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,858
Evolve.

72
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,030
Become.

73
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,535
Yes.

74
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,748
I want you to close your eyes.

75
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,002
Imagine a version of events
you wouldn't have regretted.

76
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,404
What did you see?

77
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,784
A missed opportunity...

78
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,996
To feel...

79
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,292
Like I felt when I killed Garret Jacob Hobbs.

80
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,337
To feel like...

81
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,136
Like I felt when I thought I'd killed you.

82
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,058
And what does that feel like?

83
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,646
I felt...

84
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,485
A quiet sense...

85
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,154
Of...

86
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,990
Power.

87
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,869
Good.

88
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,832
Remember that feeling.

89
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,381
I tend to walk out of this building
in a very similar state.

90
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,717
You must be a patient of Dr. Lecter's.

91
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,677
I'm sorry?

92
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,596
You look familiar.

93
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,266
I either know you or I know of you.

94
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,935
I'm the guy who didn't kill all those people.

95
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,573
We all have a gauge
for humanity that twitches

96
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,283
when we see other people.

97
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,830
Tell me, Margot, what twitches
when you see your brother?

98
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,626
Not my gauge for humanity.

99
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,215
You don't recognize in
your brother basic human traits.

100
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,717
You dehumanize him

101
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,011
as much as he dehumanizes you.

102
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,056
At least, I'll never be
the worst person I know.

103
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,853
The tendency to see others as less
human than ourselves is universal.

104
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,356
My brother is less human.

105
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,608
And you are less human from it.

106
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,569
Did you just dehumanize me?

107
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,323
Psychiatrists who dehumanize patients
are more comfortable

108
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,034
with painful but effective treatments.

109
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,331
I met a patient of yours. Will Graham.

110
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,920
Wonder what sort of painful
but effective treatment you prescribed him?

111
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,215
What do you imagine?

112
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,261
You're very supportive
of me killing my brother.

113
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,806
And I appreciate that support, I really do.

114
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,976
But I can only imagine
what you'd be supportive

115
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,769
of Will Graham doing.

116
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,815
What kind of psychiatrist are you?

117
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,985
You already had my reputation
and bona fides verified.

118
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,279
You know what kind of psychiatrist I am.

119
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,992
I'm beginning to.

120
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,764
Since when did the FBI get involved
in animal attacks, Jack?

121
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,226
When there's somebody holding the leash
of whatever it is that's doing the killing.

122
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,772
Esophagus is destroyed.
The bite almost severed his head!

123
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,484
Whatever it was, it's not afraid of humans.
Not anymore.

124
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,652
So I'm thinking a bear or a wolf.

125
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,156
Wolves or bears don't eat where they kill.
It'd have dragged him off.

126
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,909
There's no eating here.
We're gonna find everything.

127
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,661
The viscera's exposed, the belly's laid bare,

128
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,623
but there's no sign
of rutting or gnawing, Jack.

129
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,126
A rabid animal attacks victims at random
and doesn't eat any part of them.

130
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,003
Found the same wound patterns

131
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,798
on a series of livestock mutilations
in the area.

132
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,718
Evisceration, dismemberment,
yet everything accounted for.

133
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,972
Livestock mutilations... That was practice?

134
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,934
He's going to kill again.
And he's gonna get better at it.

135
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,020
And he's urbanizing his animal,

136
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,689
moving it closer to the city...

137
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,110
Adapting it for bigger prey.

138
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,780
And he's not denying its natural instincts,

139
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,698
he's evolving them.

140
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,536
It's blood sport.

141
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,471
A wolf or a bear?

142
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,856
Hey, this is Kevin.

143
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,819
Try not to stare
or they'll take him away from me.

144
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,112
Sorry.

145
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,824
It's okay.

146
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,459
Bear. Wolf.

147
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,338
Do bears and wolves hunt together?

148
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:47,343
You could train a bear to be a wolf,
or a wolf to be a bear.

149
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,512
Train them long enough,

150
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,764
and they will hunt together, feed together.

151
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,184
Okay.

152
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,732
Enough time...

153
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,193
There's a great deal

154
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,863
I could train even you to do, Will.

155
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,958
That kind of friendship can
keep you on your toes.

156
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,423
Animals, they do have...

157
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,760
They have friendships just like us.

158
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,183
We're the same.

159
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,651
Yeah, I'll try to remember that.

160
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,030
Please, don't blame the animals.

161
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,448
- No.
- Don't.

162
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,577
Man is the only creature that kills to...

163
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,329
Kill.

164
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,737
Kill.

165
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,348
It's not an animal.

166
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,684
It's a man who wants to be an animal.

167
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,777
Does he believe he's an animal?

168
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,154
It's not what he believes,
it's what he imagines.

169
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,281
Well, what does he want?

170
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,326
He wants to maul.

171
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,331
Nothing personal about this.

172
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,418
He doesn't know them.
He doesn't need to know them.

173
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,462
They're just...

174
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,631
Meat to him.

175
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,716
Prey.

176
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,804
This kind of psychosis
doesn't just slip through the system.

177
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,015
Somewhere,
someone would have noticed this.

178
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,270
If it is psychosis,
he got inside of it somehow,

179
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,981
tamed it,

180
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,984
made a suit out of it.

181
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,945
He's an engineer...

182
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,489
Or he understands engineering.

183
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,785
He knows how to build.

184
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,997
He built his beast.

185
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,834
He is a student of predators.

186
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,687
"No beast is more savage than man,

187
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,857
"when possessed with power
answerable to his own rage."

188
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,942
It's not rage.

189
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,446
Rage is an emotional response
to being provoked.

190
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,072
This is something else.

191
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,574
What is it?

192
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,202
Instinct.

193
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,957
- It's the way he thinks.
- The way any animal thinks

194
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,376
depends on limitations of mind and body.

195
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,089
If we learn our limitations too soon,

196
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,383
we never learn our power.

197
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,387
His victims are torn apart,
I'd say he learned his power.

198
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,890
He claimed his power.

199
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,727
Can you imagine tearing someone apart?

200
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,357
Or would you prefer to use a gun?

201
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,777
Guns lack intimacy.

202
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,947
You set an event in motion with a gun,
you don't complete it.

203
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,576
You fantasized about killing me
with your hands.

204
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,789
Wouldn't that be more satisfying
than pulling a trigger?

205
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,918
Yes.

206
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,968
When you sent the man to kill me,
were you imagining killing me yourself?

207
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,472
Living vicariously through him as if...

208
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,559
Your hands tightened
the noose around my neck?

209
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,938
Or were you simply hiding?

210
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,236
I wasn't hiding from anything
the first time I tried to kill you.

211
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,779
You were hiding...

212
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,740
Behind the gun.

213
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,876
You must allow yourself to be
intimate with your instincts, Will.

214
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,510
The closest comparative bite radius
we could match

215
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,138
to the victims' wounds is a cave bear.

216
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,432
Even the dire wolf,
which is the largest species

217
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,101
of the genus Canis,
is itty-bitty by comparison.

218
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,602
But a cave bear did not do this.

219
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,563
Mostly because they're vegetarian,

220
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,190
and have been extinct for 28,000 years.

221
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,652
Mostly because the bite force
relative to the skull size

222
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,946
doesn't match the kind of damage
we've been seeing.

223
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,364
What could?

224
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,491
Pull-ratchets and pneumatics, maybe.

225
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,996
Pretty sophisticated ingenuity
for any kind of animal, man or beast.

226
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,249
Animals are far more like humans
than we ever realized.

227
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,960
And humans are far more like animals.

228
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,212
One thin barrier between us.

229
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,591
And for some, that barrier is way too thin.

230
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,178
Hello, Dr. Lecter.

231
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,223
How does something like this present?

232
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,269
Someone affected by
this kind of species dysphoria

233
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,770
typically has other conditions.

234
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,774
Mood disorders, clinical depression,

235
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,527
- schizophrenia.
- Typically?

236
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,572
They may not present at all.

237
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,283
Your killer could have
built a bridge between

238
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,869
who he appears to be and
what he now knows he's become.

239
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,787
He didn't build a bridge, Doctor...

240
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,623
He built a suit.

241
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,418
What he seeks is transformation.

242
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,048
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

243
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,143
This threatens to be a violation of
doctor-patient confidentiality,

244
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,437
so I will tread carefully.

245
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,147
You've seen something like this?

246
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,566
Years ago, I treated a patient
who fits the profile.

247
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:33,739
A teenage boy who suffered from what
I would describe as an identity disorder.

248
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,825
This boy fancied himself a beast?

249
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,913
During our therapy,
he reported a moment of clarity.

250
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,124
He understood in that moment,
he was an animal

251
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,584
born in the body of a man.

252
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,588
He kept a solitary life.

253
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,384
He would hide and behave in ways
resembling animal behavior.

254
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,720
- He was delusional.
- Not necessarily.

255
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,182
He didn't believe metamorphosis
could physically take place,

256
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,726
but that wouldn't stop him
from trying to achieve it.

257
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,314
He'd be a grown man now?

258
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,527
And as he grew in wisdom and confidence,

259
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,071
he would no longer feel he had
to meet his needs in hiding.

260
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,407
What are his needs, Dr. Lecter?

261
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,494
Savagery.

262
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,761
Museum's closed.

263
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,649
Hello, Randall.

264
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,071
Dr. Lecter.

265
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,578
You will always be ruled
by your fascination with teeth.

266
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,125
That's what you said to me
when they brought me in your office

267
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,294
the very first time.

268
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,671
Is that what I said?

269
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,341
Yeah.

270
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,885
I was crying.

271
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,347
I was dreading telling you
what was wrong with me and...

272
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,308
You made it easier.

273
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,103
Other visits too.

274
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,277
A therapist's life is equal
parts counsel and curiosity.

275
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,573
We set a patient on a path,

276
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,700
but are left to wonder
where that path will take them.

277
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,207
You've come so very far, Randall.

278
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,379
A long time since you treated me.

279
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,009
Which is why I wanted to talk to you
about your wonderful progress,

280
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,388
just for a moment, privately.

281
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,061
I've seen what you've done.

282
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,649
What have I done?

283
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,902
You bore screams...

284
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,615
Like a sculptor bears dust
from the beaten stone.

285
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,996
That crying boy doesn't
cling to you anymore.

286
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,501
What clings to you now?

287
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,089
What clings to your teeth?

288
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,470
Ragged bits of scalp...

289
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,934
Trailing their tails of hair like comets.

290
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,772
Beautiful.

291
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,777
They are looking for you.

292
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,531
I don't think I can stop.

293
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,866
I don't want you to.

294
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,411
But they will find you, Randall.

295
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,334
When they do,
it's important you do exactly what I say.

296
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,316
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Randall Tier.

297
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,027
Special Agent Jack Crawford with the FBI.

298
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,361
This is Will Graham.

299
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:45,741
Did you... Put all that together?

300
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,495
- Yes, I did.
- Nice work.

301
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,251
- What is that?
- That is a cave bear.

302
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,629
You put together
a lot of cave bears, do you?

303
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,465
Yeah. I put them together, take them apart,
put them back together again.

304
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,426
You understand their mechanics
and how they're engineered?

305
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,345
We understand a lot about cave bears.

306
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,973
Their fossils have been found in the tens
of thousands, all over southern Europe.

307
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,099
Very common.

308
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,393
The reason I ask is because a...

309
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,938
A cave bear skull...

310
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,982
Was used recently as a murder weapon.

311
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,693
Prehistoric jaws and claws

312
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,904
are designed to do what they do best.

313
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,406
The victims were torn apart.

314
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,828
Used the right tool for the job.

315
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,665
Well, look inside the skull
and you'll find what the job is.

316
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,127
You have a history of trouble
with things inside your head.

317
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,879
Isn't that right, Mr. Tier?

318
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,509
Is that what this is about?

319
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,596
You think I killed someone with a fossil?

320
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,102
I had an identity disorder.

321
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,190
The doctors told me the internal map
of my body didn't match reality.

322
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,153
Do you know what it's like
when the skin you're wearing doesn't fit?

323
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,114
I can imagine.

324
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,825
I know who I am now.

325
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,494
And I'm doing much better.

326
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,290
I'm socializing. I take my medication.

327
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,585
I'm employed. And I work very hard.

328
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,338
And I'm proof that
mental illness is treatable.

329
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:48,614
Hi. I don't know if you remember me,
but I met you outside of Dr. Lecter's office.

330
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,075
I remember it. How did you find me?

331
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,954
Well, as it turns out, you are famous.

332
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,126
You're not exactly anonymous yourself,
Margot.

333
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,671
Did you sneak a peek
inside Dr. Lecter's calendar?

334
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,467
That is exactly what I did.

335
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,098
It's cold. Do you have any whiskey?

336
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:26,026
What is the heir to
the Verger Meat Packing dynasty

337
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,653
doing at my door?

338
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,156
My brother is the heir, not me.

339
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,577
I have the wrong parts and
the wrong proclivity for parts.

340
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,293
You didn't answer my question.

341
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,005
Came for a character reference.

342
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,716
Patient-to-patient.

343
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,678
What do you think of Dr. Lecter's therapy?

344
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,848
It depends what you're in therapy for.

345
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,310
I'm in therapy for all kinds of reasons.

346
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,439
The Vergers slaughter 86,000 cattle a day

347
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,901
and 36,000 pigs, depending on the season,

348
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,862
but that's just the public carnage.

349
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,033
What's your private carnage?

350
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,870
I tried to kill my brother.

351
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,543
Well, I assume he had it coming.

352
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,046
Did he ever.

353
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,553
What's your private carnage?

354
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,644
I tried to murder Dr. Lecter.

355
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,398
Did he have it coming?

356
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,779
What do you think?

357
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,575
I can't say that I know.

358
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,995
Neither can I.

359
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,125
We have some very similar issues.

360
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,587
Although I doubt that Dr. Lecter

361
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,964
gave you the same advice
on murder that he gave me.

362
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,758
And what's that?

363
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,719
He said...

364
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,265
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."

365
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,279
I'm curious what would happen

366
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,449
if your patients started
comparing notes, Dr. Lecter.

367
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,080
What would Randall Tier have to say to me?

368
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,624
What did Randall Tier say to you?

369
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:51,213
He said he was much better now,
that mental illness was treatable.

370
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,590
Randall Tier is a success story.

371
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,927
You believe he's innocent?

372
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,595
I believe...

373
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,389
Your therapy was successful.

374
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,226
You can be persuasive.

375
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,274
How many have there been?

376
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,693
Like Randall Tier?

377
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,655
Like me?

378
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,492
Every patient is unique.

379
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:30,377
Your psychiatrist came to visit me
at the hospital before my trial.

380
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,925
Dr. Du Maurier.

381
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,261
She told me she believed me.

382
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,350
She knew there were others like me.

383
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,643
Fascinating.

384
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,896
Did you kill her?

385
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,815
No.

386
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:05,036
What do you think about
when you think about killing?

387
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,836
I think about God.

388
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,464
Good and evil?

389
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,718
Good and evil has nothing to do with God.

390
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,848
I collect church collapses.

391
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,434
Did you see the recent one in Sicily?

392
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:34,357
The facade fell on 65 grandmothers
during a special mass.

393
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,447
Was that evil? Was that God?

394
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,577
If he's up there, he just loves it.

395
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,626
Typhoid and swans,
it all comes from the same place.

396
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,092
Does Randall Tier believe in God?

397
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,724
Perhaps you should have a more
personal conversation with Mr. Tier

398
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,185
and ask him what he believes.

399
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,549
The solitude of what you do
is to be respected,

400
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,426
and I intend to honor that.

401
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,346
I've only come to offer
words of encouragement.

402
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:54,312
You are becoming, Randall,
and this beast is your higher self.

403
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,483
Your bodies, voices and wills are one.

404
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,322
Revel in what you are.

405
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,514
Hey!

406
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,688
Buster! Buster!

407
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,734
Buster! Buster!

408
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,887
I'd say this makes us even.

409
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,059
I sent someone to kill you...

410
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,312
You sent someone to kill me.

411
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,485
Even Steven.
