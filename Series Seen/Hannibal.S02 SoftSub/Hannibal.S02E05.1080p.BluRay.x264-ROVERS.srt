1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,502
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:04,795
Who stitched him into the mural?

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,714
- You have an idea who that might be?
- I do.

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,424
He consults me with cases

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,968
if I keep investigating
the murders he's accused of.

6
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,761
Good. It seems you have an admirer.

7
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,222
You think someone sent me an ear
because they admire me?

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,598
This killer wrote you a poem.

9
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,600
This is, of course,
Freddie Lounds, who you know.

10
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,644
She will be assisting me today,
or assisting you.

11
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,687
What have you taken, Bella?

12
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,813
My morphine.

13
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,897
- Have you seen Jack?
- No.

14
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,607
There was some sort of emergency
with his wife.

15
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,985
If Hannibal's the Ripper,
what's he doing with his trophies?

16
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,945
Stay away from Hannibal Lecter.

17
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,704
You have to eat something, Jack.
You've been up all night.

18
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,797
Feed the body, feed the mind.

19
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,137
She knew she couldn't beat the cancer,

20
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,891
so she decided to beat it to the finish line.

21
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,022
I suppose I can't blame her
for wanting to control how she dies.

22
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:52,027
I believe those who can no longer function
at an acceptable level have the right to die.

23
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,073
She cast you as an executioner.

24
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,118
She wanted to die.

25
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,373
I can't tell you how grateful I am
that you didn't allow it to happen.

26
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,168
As a doctor, I had no choice.

27
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,505
As a philosopher, I had too many.

28
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,511
It wasn't what I could do for Bella,
it was what I couldn't do to you, Jack.

29
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,349
I guess I'm a better friend than therapist.

30
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,354
You're a great friend, Hannibal.

31
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,989
Send someone else, Jack.

32
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,118
She's one of yours.

33
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:04,363
At approximately 9:00 a. m. this morning,
I received a phone call from Freddie Lounds.

34
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,325
Acting on an anonymous tip,
she discovered a female body,

35
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,660
immediately contacted my office.

36
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,580
I was amongst the first on the scene.

37
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,166
The victim has been identified
as our colleague,

38
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,377
Special Agent Beverly Katz.

39
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,382
She will be memorialized at
FBI Headquarters and Field Offices

40
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,386
so that her ultimate sacrifice
will always be remembered.

41
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,681
That's all.

42
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,017
I want to see her.

43
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,608
Leave us alone.

44
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,610
Let's go!

45
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,842
You said you just interpret the evidence.

46
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,095
So interpret the evidence.

47
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,781
I strangle Beverly Katz,

48
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,826
looking in her eyes.

49
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,454
She knows me.

50
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,459
And I know her.

51
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,672
I expertly squeeze the life from her

52
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,717
rendering her unconscious.

53
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,104
I freeze her body,

54
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:35,318
preserving shape and form
so I can more cleanly dismantle her.

55
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,370
She cuts like stone.

56
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,667
I pull her apart,

57
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,877
layer by layer,

58
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,924
like she would a crime scene.

59
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,220
This is my design.

60
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,600
I will leave no usable evidence.

61
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,438
But she found something.

62
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,857
She found me.

63
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,777
What she found is already gone.

64
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,449
What did I take from her?

65
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,758
It's the Chesapeake Ripper.

66
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,471
It's the Ripper

67
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,515
and the copycat.

68
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,977
Same killer,

69
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,438
two masks.

70
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,818
Beverly helped me see it.

71
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,949
Help me see it.

72
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:10,955
She was looking for a connection
between the copycat and the Ripper.

73
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,875
You think she found it.

74
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,214
She found something.

75
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,471
Where were you last night?

76
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,351
In the hospital.

77
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,228
With my wife.

78
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,606
I told Beverly to go to you,

79
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,694
tell you everything she knew.

80
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,578
Instead, she went looking for evidence.

81
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,668
She met the Ripper last night, Jack. She...

82
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,714
She will be missing organs.

83
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,595
- He had to take his trophies.
- Who is he, Will?

84
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,778
Beverly made her connection to the Ripper.

85
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,367
You have to make your own, Jack.

86
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,872
Then what did I bring you here for?

87
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,753
To say goodbye.

88
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,439
Would you like to talk about
what happened at the observatory?

89
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,611
You discussed my therapy
with Hannibal Lecter, Frederick.

90
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,446
Counter to our agreement.

91
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,490
I gave him a peek
before I snatched down the shades.

92
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,868
I have appearances to maintain.

93
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,958
Beverly Katz paid you a visit
before she was murdered.

94
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,378
- What did the two of you discuss?
- What, you weren't listening to that one?

95
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,215
You met her in the privacy room.

96
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,345
It is the only room in the facility
I am not legally allowed to monitor.

97
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,472
And you let that stop you?

98
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,395
We talked about the Chesapeake Ripper.

99
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,190
Then she went and found him.

100
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,820
Psychopaths can be indifferent
to those sorts of setbacks.

101
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,158
I know something of the monster
you are dealing with.

102
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,620
He is a well-educated man.

103
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,705
A socially competent man.

104
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,918
He has surgical experience
or, at the very least, know-how.

105
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,712
You thought Abel Gideon
was the Chesapeake Ripper.

106
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,966
- Evidently, I was wrong about that.
- Yeah.

107
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,010
- Gideon knows who the Ripper is.
- I suppose you do, too.

108
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,182
Wouldn't it be interesting
if we both said it was the same man?

109
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,269
Yes, it would.

110
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,649
It's a shame we can't talk to Abel Gideon
about the Chesapeake Ripper.

111
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,819
Well, just think, Frederick,

112
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,406
you could be the one
who catches him after all.

113
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,381
Beverly isn't your responsibility.

114
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,217
You should be allowed to grieve.
You shouldn't have to wade through it.

115
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,178
We're not running away from this, Jack.

116
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,805
Beverly wouldn't.

117
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,934
- Good.
- I double-checked the autopsy report.

118
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,146
What you found in that observatory
wasn't all Beverly.

119
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,814
What do you mean?

120
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,985
These kidneys, they were placed
inside her body after she was killed.

121
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,156
I typed them against DNA samples
and they belong to the Mural Killer.

122
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,574
- James Gray.
- James Gray.

123
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,951
So whoever killed James Gray
and sewed him into his mural

124
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,871
also murdered Beverly,
swapped out their kidneys.

125
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,917
Right now, the only thing we have to go on
is we find her kidneys and we find her killer.

126
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,470
Mr. Graham.

127
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,184
You always did look like the boy next door.

128
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,146
Is it true you ate that poor Hobbs girl?

129
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,151
You can call me Will.
Now we're of equal social standing.

130
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,990
Is this Frederick's idea of punishment?

131
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,452
Group therapy with the man
who tried to kill me.

132
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,496
No. I'd like to talk to you,

133
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,666
about the Chesapeake Ripper.

134
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,210
I thought I was the Chesapeake Ripper.

135
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,921
No, you are the pretender to the throne.

136
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,174
What did you offer Frederick
to bring me back?

137
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,678
I'm the last person he wants to see.

138
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,599
I give him a visceral chill in the guts,
whatever's left of them.

139
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,227
You know who the Chesapeake Ripper is.
You've met him.

140
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,857
So Frederick gets
to catch the Ripper after all.

141
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,067
What do you get?

142
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,868
I remember that night at Dr. Lecter's.

143
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,829
- The night I brought you there.
- The night you tried to kill me.

144
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,123
Yes, how do you think I found you?

145
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,709
He sent me to kill you, Abel.

146
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,630
Am I your evidence?

147
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,301
Oh, you're in trouble, Mr. Graham.

148
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,971
Why would you protect him?

149
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,892
You were quite happy
to try and kill me yourself.

150
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,145
You have it in you, as they say.

151
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,612
He is the Devil, Mr. Graham.

152
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,989
He is smoke.

153
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,161
You'll never catch the Ripper.
He won't be caught.

154
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,623
If you want him,

155
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,585
you will have to kill him.

156
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,590
Fair enough.

157
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,684
You and I are both proponents
of unorthodox treatments of the mind.

158
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,897
Strategies others might not
choose to understand.

159
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,196
What I'm trying to understand
is why you would transfer Abel Gideon

160
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,115
back to your hospital
for the unworried unwell.

161
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,328
- It was not for selfish reasons.
- Selfishness.

162
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,624
The original sin of man,
according to Judeo-Christian morality.

163
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:56,128
We are not talking about morality
or ethics here, are we, Dr. Lecter?

164
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,298
But rather, concealing their absence.

165
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,553
Gideon disemboweled you, Frederick.

166
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,931
Brave of you, or perhaps wise,

167
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,351
to keep the evidence of your misdeeds
under your own roof.

168
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,311
My misdeeds and yours.

169
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,065
Neither of us controls
our stories well enough

170
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,485
to get anything from exposing
the other's misdeeds.

171
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,366
Here's to that.

172
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,876
I brought Gideon back

173
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,549
because I thought he may be useful
in Will Graham's therapy.

174
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,554
He shot Gideon, yet he has no memory of it.

175
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,849
We know memories, emotions

176
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,937
and even spiritual experiences
can be manipulated while under hypnotics.

177
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:59,191
I'm trying to set Will on the path
to rebuilding his broken brain.

178
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,028
Picking up your pieces, as it were.

179
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,700
You've analyzed my patient.

180
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,244
Perhaps you'll allow me to analyze yours.

181
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,416
I'd like to interview Abel Gideon.

182
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,518
You don't need to stand way over there.

183
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,729
I'm a cutter, not a pisser.

184
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,360
Hello, Dr. Gideon.

185
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,781
Our brains devote more space
to reading the details of faces

186
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,741
than any other object.

187
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,452
Dare I say,

188
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,538
I've never seen yours before.

189
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,293
I'm Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

190
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,880
I was Will Graham's psychiatrist.

191
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,426
Well, he's not a very good advertisement
for your abilities, Dr. Lecter.

192
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,261
That remains to be seen.

193
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,934
I bet you're a devil at the bridge table.

194
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,189
- It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- The pleasure's mine.

195
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,024
But now I know your name.

196
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,151
Of course, I am aware of you by reputation,

197
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:29,281
and I see why Chilton
both reveres you and resents you.

198
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,951
Esteem in psychiatric circles
still eludes him,

199
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,121
yet it clings to you
like soap to a baby's eyes.

200
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,791
He very much wants to be you.

201
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,086
He should be more careful
what he wishes for.

202
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,214
And you should have been
more careful with Will Graham.

203
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,883
That young man has got a bone to pick.

204
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,219
As a therapist,
I'm concerned with finding ways

205
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,805
of overcoming resistance,

206
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,683
not building it up.

207
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,646
Well, you built up something, Dr. Lecter.

208
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,822
That was rude, Miss Lounds.

209
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,284
Did you really think
I was above that sort of thing?

210
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,037
You seem disappointed.

211
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,748
We evolved the ability
to communicate disappointment

212
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,917
to teach those around us good manners.

213
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:26,714
Well, unfortunately, I did not evolve
the ability to feel shame.

214
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,758
You should explore that in therapy.

215
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,095
I saw a psychiatrist once
and it was under false pretenses.

216
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,141
Happy to entertain you
for a more genuine conversation.

217
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,185
So, what brings you

218
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,646
to the Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane?

219
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:47,026
I am interviewing Will Graham,
at his request.

220
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,236
Imagine that.

221
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,198
I'm trying.

222
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:56,160
Do not pass anything but soft paper.
No pens, no pencils.

223
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,705
Do not accept anything he gives you.
Do not let him touch you.

224
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,624
You do not touch him.

225
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,422
- I will be right outside.
- I know the drill.

226
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,303
It's good to see you again, Will.

227
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,138
Let me rephrase that.

228
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,183
It is good to see you in here,
where you belong.

229
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,101
Thank you for coming.

230
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,064
- Why am I here?
- I have an admirer.

231
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,652
And he seems to fit your demographic.

232
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,989
My demographic is murderers
and people obsessed with murderers.

233
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,951
I'm talking about the man who killed
the bailiff and the judge at my trial.

234
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,582
And you think he's your admirer?

235
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,255
He killed the bailiff to give me an alibi.

236
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,093
He killed the judge
because he threw that alibi out so...

237
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,680
So is your admirer crazy?

238
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,350
I don't think anybody as careful as he is
could be crazy.

239
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,143
I think he's different.

240
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,521
Maybe a lot of people
believe him to be crazy,

241
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,899
and the reason for that is he hasn't
let people understand much about him.

242
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,443
- But you understand him.
- Well...

243
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:19,743
Are you trying to catch him or contact him?

244
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,126
I would like to establish
a line of communication.

245
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,213
And your website seems like
a good place to do that.

246
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,425
I could open it up for you.

247
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,555
Ads, editorial, online chat rooms,
monitoring incoming mail.

248
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,764
I could be discreet.

249
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,268
In exchange for?

250
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,145
Exclusive rights to your story.

251
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,283
It's all yours, Freddie.

252
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,788
You want to talk to your admirer,

253
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,459
we'll have to send an invitation.

254
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,631
"Sadly, other killers have
drawn inspiration from Graham.

255
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,716
"As he stood trial for his life,

256
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,304
"one such killer even constructed an ode
to Graham's grisly techniques.

257
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,348
"Graham believed this man wanted to help,

258
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,933
"even though his motives
for that are unclear.

259
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,479
"He killed people in his name,
and he'd like to ask him why."

260
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,070
Would you like a book, Mr. Graham?

261
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,823
I have my imagination.

262
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:46,163
I read your Tattlecrime interview.
You're a very articulate man.

263
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,083
I agreed with a lot of what you said.

264
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,045
You're right.

265
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,007
People don't understand much about me.

266
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,718
Or about you.

267
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,305
But at least we understand each other.

268
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,101
There's something we don't have.

269
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,021
Or maybe we just evolved not to need.

270
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,859
You were hiding in the FBI.

271
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,904
That's talent.

272
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,074
If you hadn't gotten sick,
they never would've found you.

273
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,246
You found a great place to hide.

274
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:32,042
When you spend time in a mental hospital,
you pick up the drill.

275
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,255
You could pass as an orderly,
get a job doing it when you get out.

276
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,174
They may never know you were in.

277
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,095
Obviously, you realize
Chilton records every word said in here.

278
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,222
Who do you think wired the mics?

279
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,225
Or unwired the mics, as they currently are.

280
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,438
- You killed the bailiff during my trial.
- I thought it would exonerate you.

281
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,733
I had read your file often enough.

282
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,235
Easy to recreate your work.

283
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,738
It was so specific.

284
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,324
Though the bailiff was a bitch
to get on that stag's head.

285
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,120
- And the judge?
- I killed the bailiff.

286
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,957
The judge was somebody else.

287
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,367
Why are you trying to help me?

288
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,580
Have you seen the way that smaller birds
will mob a hawk on a wire?

289
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,042
You and me, we are hawks, Mr. Graham.

290
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,752
Hawks are solitary.

291
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,879
And that's their weakness.

292
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,677
Enough of those smaller birds get together,
and they chase hawks away.

293
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,767
Imagine if the hawks
started working together.

294
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,109
Why did you want to talk to me?

295
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,154
I need a favor.

296
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,953
I'm always happy to do a favor for a friend.

297
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,373
Just say the words.

298
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,217
I want you to kill Hannibal Lecter.

299
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,861
Will?

300
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,156
Hi.

301
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,408
Hi.

302
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,744
I'm sorry to drop in unannounced like this.

303
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,330
- What's on your mind, Dr. Bloom?
- You.

304
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,041
You gave an interview to Freddie Lounds.

305
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,419
You despise Freddie Lounds.
It just seemed...

306
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,088
What, suspicious?

307
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,384
And slightly worrying.

308
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,472
You don't have to worry about me.

309
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,144
I know you feel powerless
about what happened to Beverly,

310
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,939
and you want to do something about it.

311
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,941
Would that be so bad?

312
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,194
Depends on what
you're thinking about doing.

313
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:32,157
But there's no solution to grief, Will.
It just is.

314
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,701
Beverly died because of me.

315
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,081
Because she listened to me.

316
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,001
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

317
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,756
Will, what have you done?

318
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,137
What I had to do.

319
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,118
What is it about you, Dr. Bloom?

320
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,162
The most sinister neurochemistry
in the field

321
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,999
cannot help percolating in your presence.

322
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,252
The interesting ones all fall at your feet.

323
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,715
Will Graham, Abel Gideon,
they're chatty as can be.

324
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,718
You are like catnip for killers.

325
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,595
I see Abel Gideon has returned to the roost.

326
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,224
I believe you and I
are his only surviving psychiatrists.

327
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,560
Pulled the tongues out of all the rest.

328
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,312
Pulled more than that out of you.

329
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,401
Have you noticed anything different
about Will since Gideon arrived?

330
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:54,031
Gideon is here as part of Will's therapy,
helping him reclaim his past.

331
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,493
Can I see him?

332
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,749
Dr. Bloom, you are like a flower
blossoming amongst the weeds.

333
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,585
I'm glad to see you alive, Dr. Gideon.

334
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,921
Well, Mr. Graham didn't do
a particularly good job of killing me.

335
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,050
He was sick, and a very poor shot.

336
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,762
Good enough shot to get a bullet in you
before you put a blade in me.

337
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,057
And for that, I am sincerely grateful.

338
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,685
Been wondering about that night.

339
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,271
How do you know where I live?

340
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,566
I think a little birdie wanted me to kill you.

341
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:34,738
Or a little birdie wanted Mr. Graham
to have reason to kill me.

342
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,242
Either way,
you and I are equally expendable.

343
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,578
You were trying to find
the Ripper that night.

344
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,623
- Did you?
- I found Will Graham.

345
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,541
Will isn't the Chesapeake Ripper.

346
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,877
Not yet.

347
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,008
All the things that make us who we are,

348
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,387
what has to happen
to make those things change?

349
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,391
So much has happened to Mr. Graham.

350
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,936
He is a changed man.

351
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,525
- Maybe he's looking for redemption.
- He's not looking for redemption.

352
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:17,572
But revenge,
now that is a trinket he could value.

353
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,452
He thinks that he knows
who killed Beverly Katz.

354
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,414
For the courtesy
you have always shown me,

355
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,917
I'm going to give you a gift.

356
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,796
I'm going to give you a chance
to save Will from himself.

357
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,007
How?

358
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:41,805
He is in a biblical place right now,
but that rage will pass, and when it does,

359
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,349
Will Graham will either be a murderer
or he will not.

360
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,017
Up to you.

361
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,061
He's institutionalized.

362
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,564
He's really in no position
to be killing anyone.

363
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,024
Not with his own hands.

364
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,112
But if he only had a little birdie,

365
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,948
who could whisper murder
into a sympathetic ear.

366
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,786
Who does he want to kill, Doctor?

367
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,083
He's not here.

368
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,794
There's nothing in his calendar.

369
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,797
What is it you think Will's done?

370
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,632
Hold that thought.

371
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,300
This is Jack Crawford.

372
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,970
Yes. Thank you.

373
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,098
We've got a trace on his cell phone.

374
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:50,201
Judas had the decency
to hang himself in shame at his betrayal.

375
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,997
But I thought you needed help.

376
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,251
Did you know that the phrase
"to kick the bucket"

377
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,045
came from exactly this situation?

378
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,048
You could kick it out right now yourself
and it would all be over.

379
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,133
Quicker than bleeding out.

380
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,723
You're a nurse at the hospital.

381
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,061
You're setting a new standard of care.

382
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,777
Will Graham is not what you think.

383
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,864
He's not a murderer.

384
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,240
He is now.

385
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,577
By proxy.

386
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,831
He asked you to do this?

387
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,833
What are friends for?

388
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,505
Now I'm going to ask you
a few yes or no questions

389
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,840
while you still have enough blood
coursing through your brain

390
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,425
to answer them.

391
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,552
You ready?

392
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,430
Ready.

393
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,892
Did you kill that judge?

394
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,272
I can ask you yes-or-no questions.

395
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,441
You don't have to say a word

396
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,361
and I'll know what the answer is.

397
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:10,532
The pupil dilates
with specific mental efforts.

398
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,951
You dilate, that's a yes.

399
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,870
No dilation equals no.

400
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,168
Are you the Chesapeake Ripper?

401
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,218
How many times have you watched
someone cling on to a life

402
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,178
that's not really worth living?

403
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,973
Eking out a few extra seconds.

404
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,144
Wondering why they bother.

405
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,855
I know why.

406
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,232
Life is precious.

407
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,137
The Chesapeake Ripper.

408
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,932
I wonder what they're gonna call me.

409
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,479
You know, the Iroquois used to
eat their enemies to take their strength.

410
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,609
Maybe your murders
will become my murders.

411
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,613
I'll be the Chesapeake Ripper now.

412
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,531
Only if you eat me.

413
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,168
Put your hands where I can see them.

414
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,253
He's got a gun, Jack!

415
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,606
Hold on!

416
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,942
Hold on, hold on.

417
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,778
Get an ambulance!
