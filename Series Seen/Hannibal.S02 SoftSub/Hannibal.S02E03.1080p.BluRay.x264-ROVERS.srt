1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,210
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:06,547
Four of the lures are made from
materials including human remains.

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,384
Kade Prurnell, Office of
the Inspector General, FBI Oversight.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,219
I'm pleading innocent.

5
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,264
You'll be found guilty
and given the federal death penalty.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,307
What defense do you think I have?

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,351
You had no control of what you were doing,

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,353
much less remember doing it.

9
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:26,066
Betrayal was
the only thing that felt real to me.

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,901
I trusted you.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,278
Let me help you.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,488
I need your help.

13
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,283
We investigated your claims
about Dr. Lecter.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,118
We found nothing.

15
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,037
You stood over
Cassie Boyle's body in that field

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,122
and you described yourself to me.

17
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,915
No, I described Hannibal Lecter.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,167
You think Will is innocent.

19
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,918
I don't know what I think.

20
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,212
I think he still wants to save lives.
That's what I think.

21
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,536
Mr. Graham, it's time.

22
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,257
Let me tell you the story
of a mild-mannered FBI instructor

23
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,635
who was asked to create
a psychological profile of a murderer,

24
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,973
Garret Jacob Hobbs, the Minnesota Shrike.

25
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,977
He killed young women
that looked just like his daughter.

26
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,270
He killed them

27
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,772
and he ate them.

28
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,483
Will Graham
understood the way Hobbs thought.

29
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,985
That's how he caught him.

30
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,238
He shot Hobbs dead
while he cut his daughter's throat.

31
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,492
So Will Graham
was able to save Abigail Hobbs' life.

32
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,162
But the profile that he created

33
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:29,208
of her father was so vivid
that he couldn't escape it.

34
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,418
See.

35
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,670
See.

36
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,760
And in an unconscious state,
he killed four more women.

37
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,806
Cassie Boyle.

38
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,935
Marissa Schurr.

39
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,271
Georgia Madchen.

40
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,608
Abigail Hobbs.

41
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,612
He was able to save Abigail Hobbs
from her father,

42
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,114
but he wasn't able to save her from himself.

43
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,576
He killed her and he ate her.

44
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,121
At the very least, he ate her ear.

45
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,958
What happened to the rest of Abigail Hobbs

46
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,087
is locked away in the recesses
of Will Graham's traumatized mind,

47
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,130
or so he would have you believe.

48
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,842
Something else you should know
about Will Graham.

49
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,763
He has remarkable visual memory,

50
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,975
he's keenly insightful
to the human condition

51
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,062
and I would argue,
the smartest person in this room.

52
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,734
He's capable of creating
a psychological profile

53
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,737
of a completely different kind of murderer.

54
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,285
One that would become his alibi.

55
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,507
Moment of truth.

56
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,177
If I only knew what the truth was.

57
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,596
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.

58
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,932
My instincts have not yet
arrived at conviction.

59
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,270
Mine have,
with the benefit of no previous involvement

60
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,605
and no personal connections
to the accused.

61
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,982
Meaning I can't be impartial?

62
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,277
Of course, you can be impartial,
but right now you're not.

63
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,362
You have to believe something,

64
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,532
as long as there is reason
and evidence to believe.

65
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,535
You've got reason, you've got evidence.

66
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,538
Will Graham is playing a game.

67
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,208
I understand why
that might be hard for you to accept.

68
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,418
Do you?

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,547
It's easier to be a man
who missed his friend's suffering

70
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,009
than it is to be
the head of Behavioral Sciences at the FBI,

71
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,511
who missed a killer
standing right in front of him.

72
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:52,142
There's a reason that you're a witness
for the prosecution, Agent Crawford.

73
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,227
Remind me what that reason is.

74
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,232
If you can't represent your own beliefs,
represent the Bureau's.

75
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,777
Agent Crawford?

76
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,200
Let yourself off the hook, Jack.

77
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,411
How did you meet Will Graham?

78
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,039
I met him at the opening
of the Evil Minds Research Museum.

79
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,750
He didn't agree with what we called it.

80
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,962
He told me that the title
mythologized banal and cruel men

81
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,882
who didn't deserve
to be thought of as super-villains.

82
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,759
And what was your first impression?

83
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,762
He was intelligent and arrogant.

84
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,099
And very likely on the spectrum.

85
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:38,105
Which is why he wasn't real FBI.
He didn't pass the screening procedures.

86
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,731
Yes.

87
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,025
But you felt that he was qualified
to work in the field.

88
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,151
Under my supervision.

89
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,446
And you believed that he was valuable
because he could think like a killer.

90
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,448
He could think like anybody.

91
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,783
Sounds like a super-villain.

92
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,454
Five horrendous murders,

93
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,374
over 40 different pieces
of forensic and physical evidence

94
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,877
that tell us that Will Graham
can think like a killer because he is one.

95
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,423
Rather than feel tormented
by the work he did,

96
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,300
Will Graham enjoyed the cover

97
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,595
his role at the FBI gave him
to commit his terrible crimes.

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,848
I don't believe that to be true.

99
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,521
Agent Crawford?

100
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,858
Will hated every second of the work.
He hated it.

101
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,152
He didn't fake that.

102
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,779
He hated it and I kept making him do it.

103
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,615
Why then is it that when you offered him
an opportunity to quit, he refused?

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,826
Because he was saving lives.

105
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:41,042
I had been warned by more than one person
that if I pushed Will, I'd break him.

106
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,550
I put those checks and balances in place,
then ignored them.

107
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,137
And here we are.

108
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,695
COURT HOUSE

109
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,534
LEONARD BRAUER
PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL

110
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,454
What does Jack Crawford drink?

111
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,999
Whatever it is,
I need to send him a very expensive bottle.

112
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,210
He said I'm a killer
because he drove me insane.

113
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,505
- No, he paved the road for your defense.
- Well, he didn't say I'm innocent.

114
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,133
Innocence isn't a verdict, Mr. Graham,
but "not guilty" is.

115
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,553
This isn't law, it's advertising.

116
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,517
Advertising trivializes, it manipulates,
it's vulgar.

117
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,435
Boo-hoo. So is the law.

118
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,397
We had to create desire
to find you not guilty,

119
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,526
which is nonexistent
in this courtroom right now.

120
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,819
We're manipulating people
into buying something they don't need.

121
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,655
- Mr. Brauer?
- They don't want your innocence.

122
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,739
Thank you.

123
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,116
Unconsciousness in a pretty package,

124
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,452
that I can sell.

125
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:03,124
If I take the moral high ground with you,
I'll get you killed.

126
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,556
I think I opened your mail.

127
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,327
HANNIBAL

128
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,016
That was a good and brave thing
you did for Will today.

129
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,018
It may have cost me my job.

130
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,481
The prospect doesn't seem to trouble you
as much as I would have thought.

131
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,694
Haven't felt better in weeks.

132
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,405
Clarity will do that.

133
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,998
Tell me, Jack.

134
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,917
Was your testimony
meant to be a resignation?

135
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,840
There is something appealing
about walking away from all of the noise.

136
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,848
I'm content to let the chips fall.

137
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,811
The magic door is always attractive.

138
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,107
Step through
and leave all your burdens behind.

139
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,530
I've given my life to death.

140
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,785
And now death has followed you home,

141
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,330
come to live in your house.

142
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,339
Bella has kept our bedroom
from looking too much like a sickroom.

143
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,051
There are flowers, but not too many.
You know.

144
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,763
She insists that there are no pills in sight.

145
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,559
So, I've been thinking about
taking her to Italy where we met.

146
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,938
We could...

147
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,569
She could die there.

148
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,868
Jack.

149
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,871
You're not sick.

150
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,709
You don't have to go
into the ground with her.

151
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,632
When Bella's lost to you,
the FBI could still be there.

152
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,013
You're telling me
not to commit professional suicide?

153
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,686
As a friend,
I'm telling you not to force an issue

154
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,982
for the short-term emotional satisfaction
it can have.

155
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,085
Shrunken capillaries.

156
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,671
The ear was cut from a corpse
no more than 48 hours ago.

157
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,214
Before the trial started.

158
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,299
We fumed it all,

159
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,968
ear's clean,
no prints on either of the envelopes,

160
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,721
besides the courier, paralegal and lawyer.

161
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,556
We know Will Graham didn't do it.

162
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,933
- It wouldn't surprise me.
- The timing's deliberate.

163
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,937
It was choreographed to drop the ear
at the beginning of Will's trial.

164
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,650
Such a gift has great significance.

165
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,110
A gift from who?

166
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,363
Will claimed someone else
committed the crimes he's accused of.

167
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,409
He said that person was you.

168
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,662
Perhaps he was half right.

169
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,628
You've gotta be kidding me.

170
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,756
BALTIMORE STATE HOSPITAL
FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE

171
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,051
It seems you have an admirer.

172
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,720
You think someone sent me an ear
because they admire me?

173
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,433
The boundaries of what's considered normal
are getting narrower.

174
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,312
Outside those boundaries,
this may be intended as a helpful gesture.

175
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,690
How far would you go to help me?

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,236
It hadn't occurred to me to send you an ear.

177
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,532
But I'm grateful someone has.

178
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,286
Gratitude has a short half-life.

179
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,831
So can doubt.

180
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,708
I have new thoughts about who you are.

181
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,255
There may very well be another killer.

182
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,843
I want there to be.

183
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,641
Some part of you still suspects me.

184
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,644
I don't know what anyone
is capable of anymore,

185
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,145
least of all myself.

186
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,695
I know there is no evidence against you.

187
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,364
There never was.

188
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,285
And accusing you makes me look insane.

189
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,249
I'm not insane.

190
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,211
Not anymore.

191
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,465
And you may not be guilty.

192
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,769
This ear you were sent is an opportunity.

193
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,733
If someone else
is responsible for your crimes,

194
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,444
perhaps he now wants to be seen.

195
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,780
Why would he want to be seen now?

196
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,409
He cares what happens to you.

197
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,626
The prosecution calls
Freddie Lounds to the stand.

198
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,727
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
nothing but the truth.

199
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,030
Could you please describe
your relationship with Abigail Hobbs?

200
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,574
We were very close.

201
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,327
I was helping her write a book
about surviving her father.

202
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,205
Did you ever discuss
Will Graham with Abigail?

203
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,998
Abigail told me

204
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,127
she believed Will Graham
wanted to kill her and cannibalize her

205
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,338
like her father wanted to do.

206
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,674
She was right.

207
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,178
I should've listened to her.

208
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,848
Do you blame yourself for her death?

209
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,938
I blame Will Graham.

210
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,735
Thank you.

211
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,862
Your witness.

212
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,035
Miss Lounds.

213
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,205
Could you please

214
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,668
remind me how many times
you've been sued for libel?

215
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,048
- Six.
- Sorry?

216
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,802
Six.

217
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,845
Six.

218
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,180
And how many times did you settle?

219
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,225
Six.

220
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,145
Six.

221
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,232
Thank you. Nothing further.

222
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,403
The defense calls Dr. Alana Bloom.

223
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,281
I believe Will's empathy disorder

224
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,577
combined with the effects
of viral encephalitis...

225
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,248
Do we have to do this like this?

226
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,919
I don't want the first time you do this
to be in court.

227
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,592
Dr. Bloom, weren't you and the accused
romantically involved?

228
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:41,142
- How is this relevant to the case?
- It's relevant to your testimony.

229
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,020
In that court, your feelings, your emotions,

230
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,023
your pro-everything Will Graham
will be on trial.

231
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:51,319
You get all starey and non-blinky like that,
it'll undermine you and me, but mainly him.

232
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,237
My testimony is based on my professional...

233
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,323
You are smitten with the accused,
Miss Bloom,

234
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,326
and it is adorable,
but not our brand of defense.

235
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,536
And Ms. Vega will smell it on you,

236
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,165
like you stepped in Young Adult
and tracked it into the courtroom.

237
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,419
Were you and Will Graham
involved romantically?

238
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,973
I have no romantic feelings for Will Graham.
I have a professional curiosity.

239
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,355
I like that. "Professional curiosity."
It seems so...

240
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,400
It seems so indifferent.

241
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,070
Unless you look like you're lying
when you say it.

242
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,322
But you didn't.

243
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,174
- You've identified the ear?
- We identified the knife that cut it off.

244
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,425
It's Will Graham's.

245
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,428
The blade matches the cuts
on Abigail Hobbs's ear and on this one.

246
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,848
It was presented in court as evidence,

247
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,599
then it was sent
to the courthouse evidence room

248
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,435
where it was checked out
by the bailiff in Will's trial, Andrew Sykes,

249
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,728
and it never went back.

250
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,023
Pretty good, right?

251
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,528
MILFORD MILL, MARYLAND

252
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,622
Go.

253
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,736
They wanted to give us a warm welcome
and to make sure we found something.

254
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,614
An arresting piece of theater.

255
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,282
Our bailiff was mounted on a stag's head.

256
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,367
A. SYKES

257
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,701
Glasgow smile.

258
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,204
Killer lopped off his ear and set him on fire.

259
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,914
Will Graham's greatest hits.

260
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,377
- Could we have been that wrong?
- About Will Graham? No.

261
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,796
We could not.
He practically takes selfies with his victims.

262
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,757
The evidence we found was immediate
and almost presentational.

263
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,841
May as well have been gift-wrapped.

264
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,845
That's what Will said about Cassie Boyle
when we found her in that field.

265
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,347
"Field Kabuki."

266
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,307
There was no evidence
before Will was apprehended

267
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,725
and there hasn't been any since.

268
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,060
He ate a girl's ear!

269
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,896
It was in his stomach.
God knows what else of her was in there.

270
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,773
We should've taken a stool sample.

271
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,067
Yes! We should have. Well, why didn't we?

272
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,568
I was the one that said we should have.

273
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,529
Knock it off.

274
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,408
What impact could this have on Will's trial?

275
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,583
This murder raises serious doubts
about the case against Will Graham.

276
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,794
Your team provided the evidence.

277
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,504
The overwhelming evidence.

278
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,840
So you understand the significance
of my questioning it.

279
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,759
Agent Crawford,
we all heard your testimony.

280
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,262
Are you sure you're not just trying
to assuage your own guilt?

281
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,681
- Yes, I'm sure.
- I'm not.

282
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,808
Andrew Sykes was mutilated

283
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,478
in the exact same manner
Will Graham allegedly mutilated his victims,

284
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,105
ways that have not been made public.

285
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,025
Will Graham isn't saying
he didn't kill those people.

286
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,694
His lawyer is running
an unconsciousness defense.

287
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,197
In effect, he's admitting the acts,
but just not the responsibility.

288
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,993
Will's maintained his innocence all along,
in spite of memory gaps.

289
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,829
Whatever Mr. Brauer's strategy is,
this will offer a new line of defense.

290
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,249
That's for Mr. Brauer to tell me,
Agent Crawford, not you.

291
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,046
Yes, Your Honor.

292
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,223
Will Graham manifests publicly
as an introverted personality.

293
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,726
He would like us to believe
he places on the spectrum

294
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,354
somewhere near Asperger's and autism.

295
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,690
Yet he also claims an empathy disorder.

296
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,070
You choose your words
very carefully, Dr. Chilton.

297
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,655
You chose the word "claims."

298
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,325
Will Graham has never been diagnosed.

299
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,036
He will not allow anyone to test him.

300
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,999
He has carefully constructed a persona
to hide his real nature from the world.

301
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,003
He wears it so well
even Jack Crawford could not see past it.

302
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,505
But you did?

303
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,800
Mr. Graham and I
had no personal relationship

304
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,676
for him to manipulate.

305
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:12,556
I have objectively examined him
and the crimes of which he is accused.

306
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,561
These murders were measured
and controlled.

307
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,564
The confused man
Will Graham presents to the world

308
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,942
could not commit those crimes,

309
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,611
because that man is a fiction.

310
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,535
So you discount the encephalitis
he was suffering as a cause?

311
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,205
He managed his illness
with the help of his neurologist,

312
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,041
whom he murdered for his trouble.

313
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,295
Is Will Graham an intelligent psychopath?

314
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,716
There is not yet a name
for whatever Will Graham is.

315
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,511
He kills methodically

316
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,473
and I believe would kill again,
given the opportunity.

317
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,311
Thank you, Dr. Chilton.

318
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,022
Your witness.

319
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:12,616
Dr. Chilton, Will Graham spent his time
catching murderers for the FBI.

320
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,827
You don't see a contradiction between that

321
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,745
and your description
of a coldblooded killer?

322
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,706
No, I do not.

323
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,376
Will Graham is driven by vanity
and his own whims.

324
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,337
He has a very high opinion
of his intelligence.

325
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:30,301
Ergo, he caught the other killers
simply to prove

326
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,553
he was smarter than all of them, too.

327
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,142
Saving lives
is just as arousing as ending them.

328
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,686
He likes to play God.

329
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,827
- My admirer?
- Yes.

330
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,419
The forensic report from the crime scene.

331
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,880
What do you see?

332
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,494
I shoot Mr. Sykes once, collapsing lungs,

333
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,956
tearing through his heart's aorta
and pulmonary arteries.

334
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,341
He will die believing we were friends.

335
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,677
It is his last thought.

336
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,859
His death isn't personal.

337
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:50,000
He is merely the ink
from which flows my poem.

338
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,266
My tribute.

339
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,397
This is my design.

340
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,359
It's not the same killer.

341
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,489
He murdered his victim first
and then mutilated him.

342
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,496
Cassie Boyle's lungs were removed
when she was still breathing.

343
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,540
Georgia Madchen was burned alive.

344
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:35,629
What I found of Abigail was cut off
while her heart was beating.

345
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,552
Then this is blunt reproduction?

346
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,429
You knew that already.

347
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,766
Would've liked to have been wrong.

348
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,936
Occam's broom.

349
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,274
You intentionally ignored facts
that refute your argument

350
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,276
hoping nobody'd notice.

351
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,402
You noticed.

352
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,953
I wanted to dispel your doubts
once and for all.

353
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,040
My doubts about what?

354
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,917
Me.

355
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,800
I want you to believe in the best of me,

356
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,345
just as I believe in the best of you.

357
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,641
This crime offered us both
reasonable doubt.

358
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,935
It offered us a distraction.

359
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,107
Maybe this acolyte
is giving you your path to freedom.

360
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,817
Even Jack is ready to believe, Will.

361
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,995
It would be a lie.

362
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,756
- I don't want you to be here.
- I don't want me to be here either.

363
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Then you have a choice.

364
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,052
This killer wrote you a poem.

365
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,600
Are you going to let his love go to waste?

366
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,529
I'm confused.

367
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,698
You're going to abandon
your defense strategy,

368
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,536
the entire case you've built, mid-trial.

369
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,871
Exciting, isn't it?

370
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,624
And this seems reasonable to you?

371
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,459
It's not only reasonable,

372
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,045
it's fashionable.

373
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,256
There's a killer on the loose,

374
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,592
demonstrating all the hallmarks
of Will Graham's alleged murders.

375
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,512
Do you think this killer committed
the crimes that you're accused of?

376
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,682
Don't answer that, not in front of me.
It's inconsequential.

377
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,891
But is it true?

378
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,018
You're being awfully high and mighty,
Dr. Bloom.

379
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,062
Very ivory tower, very reductive.

380
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,147
Very far from the point,

381
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,650
which is the exoneration of your friend
Will Graham.

382
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,194
And the point you're trying to make
is reasonable doubt.

383
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,487
That's a win, yes.

384
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,322
The best you can hope for is mistrial.

385
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,574
That's also a win.

386
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,076
You won't be able to plead
unconsciousness again.

387
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,539
Your fast, triumphant diagnosis of
unconsciousness was the best play we had.

388
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,957
Now we have a better play.

389
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,836
Needless to say,
I won't be calling you to the witness stand.

390
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,964
Who's taking the stand in my place?

391
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,031
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

392
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,282
so help me God.

393
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,000
Good morning, Doctor.

394
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,129
Please describe your relationship
with Will Graham.

395
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,925
I was asked by Jack Crawford
to monitor Will's emotional well-being

396
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,801
while he worked on cases.

397
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,262
I was never officially his psychiatrist.

398
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,306
If you weren't his psychiatrist,
what were you?

399
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,224
I was meant to be his stability.

400
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,647
- I failed him in that.
- How did you fail him?

401
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,110
I was unable to determine if Will's condition

402
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:31,073
was due to mental illness
or stress from his work at the FBI.

403
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,994
My mistake was
never considering his innocence

404
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,331
until the murder of a bailiff
from this courthouse.

405
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,460
And how did you know about that,
Dr. Lecter?

406
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,089
I have been asked to consult
on the case by Jack Crawford.

407
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,675
He wanted a profile of the bailiff's killer.

408
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,930
So you believe the bailiff's murder
was committed by the same person

409
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,265
guilty of Will Graham's alleged crimes, yes?

410
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,852
Profiles aren't evidence, they're opinion.
This is hearsay.

411
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,854
I will allow it.

412
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,690
Thank you, Your Honor.

413
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,361
I believe there are alarming similarities
in the crimes, yes.

414
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,824
Will Graham accused you of the crimes
for which he now stands trial,

415
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,870
and yet here you are, testifying
on his behalf for the defense.

416
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:24,042
Will rightfully
couldn't accept these actions to be his.

417
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,964
A mind faced with the possibility
of committing such deeds

418
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,591
will find an alternative reality to believe in.

419
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,303
- You don't blame him for that?
- No.

420
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,642
Will Graham is and will always be my friend.

421
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,186
Your witness.

422
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,064
Dr. Lecter,

423
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,068
what was the cause of death
in the bailiff's murder?

424
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,405
A bullet to the heart.

425
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,200
And in Will Graham's victims,
or alleged victims,

426
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,494
what was their cause of death?

427
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,706
Mutilation.

428
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,750
That's very different from a bullet.

429
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,004
No two crimes of any killer
are going to be exactly the same.

430
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,172
The similarities...

431
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:15,802
Your Honor, the witness's personal beliefs
and biases are driving his conclusions.

432
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,430
There are clearly two different killers
and two different cases.

433
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:22,184
Your Honor, there are sufficient similarities
to consider this a defense.

434
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,481
I'm ruling this defense
inadmissible, Mr. Brauer.

435
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,900
Thank you, Your Honor.

436
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,613
All previous testimony on the matter
will be stricken from the record.

437
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,216
So, it appears that the judge
was murdered in his chambers

438
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,303
and then he was hauled out here
to be put on display.

439
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,473
Not only is justice blind,
it's mindless and heartless.

440
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,809
How did the killer get so close?

441
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,729
No sign of a struggle.
Mutilation was post-mortem.

442
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,648
He was shot in the chest just like the bailiff.

443
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,401
Can't see the entry wound
because he removed the heart.

444
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,361
But there is an exit wound.

445
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,197
No slug, must have taken it with him.

446
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,406
A trophy.

447
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,034
Doctor.

448
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,248
With this judge's death,
there will be no verdict.

449
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,127
No ending. It'll start again,
like the trial never happened.

450
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,254
But why?

451
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,842
Psychopathic violence
is predominantly goal oriented,

452
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,094
a means to a very particular end.

453
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,264
So the killer wanted a mistrial?

454
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,144
It's an elegant,
if rather unorthodox solution.

455
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,522
He spares Will a guilty verdict
and his life for the moment.

456
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,690
Yes.

457
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,818
The question is, is it the same killer?

458
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,279
Is Will still on trial in your mind?

459
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:25,784
The use of a gun, death first, mutilation last.

460
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,748
I feel like St. Peter
ready to deny Will for the third time.

461
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,210
I'm not sure this is the same killer, Jack.

462
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,382
Excuse me.

463
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,183
The killer exerted
careful control of the environment.

464
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,727
He left very little evidence behind.

465
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,688
Jeez, Jack.

466
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,732
The trial was supposed to put an end to this.

467
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,026
Instead, the circus
has just added another ring.

468
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,403
And we're the clowns.

469
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,406
Who's "we," Jack?

470
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,784
I got off track.

471
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,372
You have to force yourself
out of this train of thought.

472
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,208
The trial was going wrong
before this murder.

473
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,212
The trial was going wrong
because you wanted to believe Will Graham.

474
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,799
Who is he to you that makes you
want to risk everything for him?

475
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,928
A very cogent reminder of the pitfalls of
having faith in one's fellow man, thank you.

476
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:31,558
Everyone, at one point or another,
has to leave somebody behind.

477
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,601
You've got to cut him loose.

478
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,731
Otherwise the someone being left behind,
today or tomorrow,

479
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,191
is gonna be you.

480
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,946
Will.

481
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,793
I was hoping the verdict would have
helped focus your mind to get better.

482
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,798
Make what happened to you
less terrifying and confusing.

483
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,803
I can't exactly blame your lawyer.

484
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,389
Faith in any sort of legal justice

485
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,475
has never been any more comforting
than a nightlight.

486
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:44,858
There are so many miscarriages of justice
when it comes to identifying a psychopath.

487
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,987
You could easily have been misdiagnosed.

488
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,866
I've already been misdiagnosed.

489
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,201
Not by the court.

490
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,703
No.

491
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,330
Not yet.

492
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:08,173
I walked out of that courtroom
and I could hear my blood,

493
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,262
like a hollow drumming of wings.

494
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:21,895
And I had the absurd feeling
that whoever this killer is,

495
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,859
he walked out of that courtroom with me.

496
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,658
He's gonna reach out to me.

497
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,871
What does he want?

498
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,588
He wants to know me.

499
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,972
What do you want?

500
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,729
I want to save you.
