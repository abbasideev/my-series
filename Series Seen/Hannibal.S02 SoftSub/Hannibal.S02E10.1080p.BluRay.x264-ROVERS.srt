1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,419
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,878
I want you to admit what you are.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,048
You still refuse to see
the monster growing inside you.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,466
I want exclusive rights to your story.

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,802
It's all yours, Freddie.

6
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:16,473
What is the heir to the Verger Meat Packing
dynasty doing at my door?

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,643
We have some very similar issues.
I tried to kill my brother.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,353
I assume he had it coming.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,688
They are looking for you.

10
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,898
It's important you do exactly what I say.

11
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,683
I'd say this makes us even.

12
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,229
I sent someone to kill you...

13
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,441
You sent someone to kill me.

14
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,614
Even Steven.

15
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,951
Consider it an act of reciprocity.

16
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,999
Polite society normally places
such a taboo on taking a life.

17
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,418
Without death, we'd be at a loss.

18
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,423
It's the prospect of death
that drives us to greatness.

19
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,469
Did you kill him with your hands?

20
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,056
It was...

21
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,439
Intimate.

22
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,069
It deserves intimacy.

23
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,781
You were Randall Tier's final enemy.

24
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,399
Don't go inside, Will.

25
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,403
You'll want to retreat.

26
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,323
You'll want it

27
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,703
as the glint of the rail tempts us
when we hear the approaching train.

28
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,664
Stay with me.

29
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,916
Where else would I go?

30
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,503
You have everywhere to go.

31
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,506
You should be quite pleased.

32
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,967
I am.

33
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,845
Of course you are.

34
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,269
When you killed Randall,

35
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,355
did you fantasize you were killing me?

36
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,454
Most of what we do,

37
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,206
most of what we believe,
is motivated by death.

38
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,672
I've never felt as alive
as I did when I was killing him.

39
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,928
Then you owe Randall Tier a debt.

40
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,020
How will you repay him?

41
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,731
The killer chose not to dispose of the body,

42
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,443
but to display it.

43
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,988
A jarring reminder
of the informality of death.

44
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,411
Randall Tier was denied the respectful end
that he himself denied others.

45
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,000
This is a humiliation, a final indignity.

46
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,793
He isn't mocking him.

47
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,546
This isn't disdain.

48
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:49,009
He's... Commemorating him.

49
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:53,305
This killer has no fear
for the consequences of what he's done.

50
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,182
No guilt.

51
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,172
Hello again.

52
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,308
Come closer.

53
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,228
I want to see you.

54
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,779
Can you see you?

55
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,824
Clearer and clearer.

56
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,837
You forced me to kill you.

57
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,090
I didn't force you to enjoy it.

58
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,302
You made me a monument.

59
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,304
You're welcome.

60
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,101
The monument is not to me, it's to you.

61
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,729
I gave you what you want.

62
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,191
This is who you are.

63
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:33,947
What you feel finally matches
the reality of what I see.

64
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,450
This is my becoming.

65
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,537
And it's yours.

66
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,210
This is my design.

67
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,756
He knew his killer.

68
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:57,095
There's a... Familiarity here.

69
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:02,851
Someone who met him, understood him.

70
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,145
Someone like him.

71
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,940
Different pathology, same instinct.

72
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,861
His killer empathized with him?

73
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,405
Don't mistake understanding
for empathy, Jack.

74
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,907
No, if there's anything, it's...

75
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,368
It's envy.

76
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,704
Envy?

77
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:28,293
Randall Tier came into his own
much easier than whoever killed him.

78
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,006
This was a fledgling killer.
He's never killed before,

79
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,426
not like this.

80
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,846
Not like this, no.

81
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,726
This is the nightmare that
followed him out of his dreams.

82
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,628
I've upped the ante on my publishing deal.

83
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,672
There's been movie interest.

84
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,217
Hollywood is a fine place
for the obnoxious and wealthy.

85
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,970
You're not wealthy, Freddie.

86
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,556
I will be.

87
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,559
Though I am a pariah among journalists

88
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,520
because I took a different faith,

89
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,355
but I am putting that faith in you.

90
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,194
Let's talk about the Chesapeake Ripper.

91
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,948
Frederick Chilton. Who knew?

92
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,325
Who knew?

93
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,787
No one did. No one would, not even you.

94
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,625
You were so certain the Chesapeake Ripper
was Hannibal Lecter, you tried to kill him.

95
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,336
You neglected to say "allegedly."

96
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,921
No, I didn't.

97
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,759
Hannibal Lecter is your psychiatrist again.

98
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,094
What's up with that?

99
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,888
I was wrong about him,
that's what's up with that.

100
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,017
Maybe you were.

101
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,854
Maybe you weren't.

102
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,778
Dr. Chilton was the Chesapeake Ripper.

103
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,073
The Chesapeake Ripper had surgical skills,
Dr. Chilton did not.

104
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,034
- They had the same profile.
- Dr. Chilton was

105
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,829
a woeful surgeon, dangerous, even.

106
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,707
I've been chatting with some
of his old medical school chums.

107
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,711
They say he fled to psychiatry
to avoid embarrassment.

108
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,931
My story with the Chesapeake Ripper
already has an ending, Freddie.

109
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,312
Mine doesn't.

110
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,484
Do you really think Dr. Chilton
killed Abigail Hobbs?

111
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,488
I don't.

112
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:07,744
Even if I let this story go,
I will never let that go.

113
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,543
Trust me, Freddie...

114
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,089
Neither will I.

115
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,767
You know you will have to kill him, Margot.

116
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,937
You've known it for years.

117
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,819
I may have missed my opportunity.

118
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,947
Do you know why you failed
to murder him, Margot?

119
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,992
Poor planning.

120
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,040
You failed to murder your brother
because you still love him.

121
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,087
In love, you take leave of your senses,

122
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,841
but in hatred, you must be present
to calculate your actions.

123
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,053
Allow yourself to hate him.

124
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,307
Do you think Mason will just
give you what you want?

125
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,977
You'll be begging him
for the rest of your life.

126
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,146
Did begging help when he tore you?

127
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,111
Same thing as taking his chocolate
and letting him have his way.

128
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,115
I'm lucky I didn't kill him.

129
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,618
Papa's will was very clear.

130
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,997
Upon the passing of his beloved son Mason,

131
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:37,250
in the absence of a legitimate male heir,

132
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,921
the sole beneficiary shall be
the Southern Baptist Convention.

133
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,384
Even in death, Mason would
take everything from you.

134
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,640
One of the most powerful forces
that shapes us as human beings

135
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,268
is the desire to leave a legacy.

136
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,147
What legacy would you leave behind?

137
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,026
I don't get a legacy.

138
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,946
Unless you make one.

139
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,524
Have a good ride?

140
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,029
Here, put him away.

141
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,451
What do you want?

142
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,667
What do I want? What do I want?

143
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,585
What do I want? What do I want?

144
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,798
I want to...

145
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,761
Share something with you.

146
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,141
This is Pavlov. Say hello, Pavlov.

147
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,267
Say hello.

148
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,312
Margot, say hello to Pavlov.

149
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,272
Hi, buddy.

150
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,735
After Papa died, I had a Christmas epiphany.

151
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:32,323
I've seen exotic pigs from all over the world.

152
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,536
What would happen if I brought together

153
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,289
the best of all that I had seen?

154
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,501
You built a maze.

155
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,878
I shudder to think.

156
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,048
I feel like Stradivarius.

157
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:55,722
Our father was a pioneer
in livestock production. I think he'd be...

158
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,267
He'd be proud of my efforts.

159
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,897
A pig is not like other animals.

160
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,068
There is a spark of intelligence,
a terrible practicality in pigs.

161
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,411
Well, you do have an unparalleled
understanding of piggishness.

162
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,750
Your mouth gets rough
when you're scared, Margot.

163
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,505
Tough as a livery pony
who is resentful of the bit.

164
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:36,596
The structure is designed
to excite and antagonize the pigs.

165
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,685
It's taken a while to find the perfect mix.
Any pig will eat a dead man,

166
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,687
but to get him to eat a live one...

167
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,609
Some education is required.

168
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,696
Carlo is experienced in this field.

169
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:58,576
He actually fed a man to pigs
in Tuscany. 20 years ago?

170
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,789
That's one of my suits.

171
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,666
I'll buy you a new one.

172
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,669
We stuff the clothes with meat,

173
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:14,634
scent it with human smells, and play
the screams every time they are fed.

174
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,638
Come the real thing,
we won't need the recording.

175
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,737
It's not just about making Papa proud,

176
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,489
it's about us.

177
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,118
It's about family.

178
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,624
I want you to be proud of me too, Margot.

179
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,671
You're all I have.

180
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,342
And I'm all you have.

181
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,107
And this little piggy went,

182
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:16,696
"Whee!" all the way home.

183
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,630
- It sounds like I'm killing it.
- You are killing it.

184
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,549
Don't kill it.

185
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,052
A theremin is an instrument
that can create exquisite music

186
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,889
without ever needing to be touched, but...

187
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,476
It requires the rare gift
of perfect pitch to play properly.

188
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,752
I've come to replenish your stores.

189
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,885
Feel the vibration moving through you.

190
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,847
Feel it here.

191
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,063
And here.

192
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,151
It's like composing in thin air.

193
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,364
Thin air is a musician's canvas.

194
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,621
What happened to your window?

195
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,583
A stag got lost in the storm,
came through there.

196
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,797
Got a few scratches getting him out.

197
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,551
Are you scarred?

198
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,930
Probably more than I know.

199
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,688
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

200
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,112
I don't have the right parts
for your proclivities, Margot.

201
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,537
It's a very psychological instrument.

202
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,790
Yes, we work with people the same way.

203
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,170
Never touching...

204
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,924
- Yeah.
- ... but guiding them from

205
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,511
dissonance toward composition.

206
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,069
But people are not instruments.

207
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,365
Whatever it is you're playing, Hannibal,

208
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,119
you have to listen very carefully

209
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,371
to what you're creating.

210
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,499
I'm listening.

211
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,461
I'm listening to you.

212
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,052
You and I went so long in our friendship

213
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,930
without ever touching,
yet I always felt attuned to you.

214
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,104
Who did this to you?

215
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,108
My brother.

216
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,197
Who shot you?

217
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,701
A friend.

218
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,421
I've always admired teachers,
molding impressionable young minds.

219
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,008
But you can only learn so much and live.

220
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,469
No one likes a know-it-all, Freddie.

221
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,473
Hannibal Lecter taught you when you
were an impressionable young mind.

222
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,309
Your book's about Will Graham,
it's not about me.

223
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,937
Were you sleeping with Hannibal Lecter
when you were his student,

224
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,939
or is that a recent development?

225
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,402
You are sleeping with him.
I was just guessing.

226
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,195
Figured you had to be sleeping
with one of them.

227
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,197
Maybe that's why you can't see it.

228
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,116
See what?

229
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,119
Will Graham was right
about Hannibal Lecter...

230
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,539
And I was right about Will Graham.

231
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,336
I'm not having this
or any other conversation with you, Freddie.

232
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,756
Hannibal Lecter had four patients die
while under his care.

233
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,719
Three former patients die after his care,
and then there's Will Graham.

234
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,889
All that fuss about Dr. Lecter.
Will even tried to kill him.

235
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:45,352
And now they're back in therapy together
and another former patient is dead.

236
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,314
Will understands that
Hannibal Lecter can help him.

237
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,902
Maybe what Will understands is,
if you can't beat Hannibal Lecter,

238
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,988
join him.

239
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,361
Dr. Lecter.

240
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,113
Mason Verger.

241
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,115
So very nice to meet you.

242
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,326
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

243
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,912
I'm prone to Old World politeness.

244
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,705
Would have seemed rude to say no.

245
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,624
Since I'm paying for Margot's therapy,

246
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,960
I thought I should at the very least
meet her psychiatrist.

247
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,962
I enjoy putting a face to the name.

248
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,717
Your swine are exceptional.

249
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,512
Never seen pigs like these.

250
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,973
They're a special breed.

251
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,227
Product of many years, many litters.

252
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,939
What's your ground note?

253
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:18,112
We started with giant forest pigs,
6 teats, 38 chromosomes,

254
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,197
a resourceful feeder,

255
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,033
and an opportunistic omnivore.

256
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,577
Just like man.

257
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,373
You must know pigs
as well as you know people.

258
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,876
- I do know pigs.
- Papa would've loved you.

259
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,922
He could feel the face of a hog and tell
by the bone structure its genetic makeup.

260
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,008
Breeding was very important to my father.

261
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,428
Margot really pissed him off with all her...

262
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,304
Button stitching.

263
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,223
No breeding there.

264
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,020
Do you have a sister, Dr. Lecter?

265
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,647
I had a sister.

266
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:58,026
Then you understand my need
to protect Margot, mostly from herself.

267
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,903
She's pathological.

268
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,782
I'm sure she's told you
horrible things that I've done.

269
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,785
I can't tell you
what Margot's confessed to me.

270
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,206
Fortunately for you, I can't tell anyone.

271
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,631
Got me.

272
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,388
Even the worst of us need
someone to talk to, Mason.

273
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,308
Have you ever considered
therapy for yourself?

274
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,978
Maybe I should.

275
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,692
Can I have Carlo slaughter you a hog?

276
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,321
A token of my appreciation
for all that you do for Margot.

277
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,741
Please.

278
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,160
But I must insist on selecting my own pig.

279
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,996
Always do.

280
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,718
Brined and roasted

281
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,346
whole suckling pig.

282
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,937
A gift from a friend.

283
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,901
A friend of yours, not a friend of the pig's.

284
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,321
There are those who raise livestock
and have a genuine affection for them.

285
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,575
The farmer who hand rears
lambs loves them

286
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,453
and sends them to slaughter.

287
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,748
They love and kill what they love.

288
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,750
And eat what they love.

289
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,421
It's a paradox.

290
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,218
Freddie Lounds thinks
the two of you are a paradox.

291
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,846
She sees something no one else sees.

292
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,890
What's that?

293
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,771
That neither of you is the killer
she's writing about,

294
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,523
but together, you might be.

295
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,862
Freddie Lounds must consider
you a bland interview subject

296
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,906
if she's already resorted to fiction.

297
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,497
She won't be fenced in by
something as malleable as the truth.

298
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,040
Freddie has no boundaries.

299
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,459
Someone with no boundaries
is a psychopath...

300
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,337
Or a journalist.

301
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,095
Freddie isn't the only one
without boundaries.

302
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,435
Your relationship doesn't
seem to know many.

303
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,022
Patient and therapist,

304
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,941
friend and enemy.

305
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,195
Crossing boundaries is
different than violating them.

306
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,828
Boundaries will always be
subject to negotiation.

307
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,336
It's just hard to know
where you are with each other.

308
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,214
We know where we are with each other.

309
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,218
Shouldn't that be enough?

310
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,143
Better the devil you know.

311
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,692
There really is a very good
explanation for all this.

312
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,569
I don't want to hear it.

313
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,697
Not just a little bit curious?

314
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,866
Get away from the door.

315
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,202
I can't let you go, Freddie.

316
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,249
Not till you've heard what I have to say.

317
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,214
I know you're scared.

318
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,552
You only have to be scared
a moment longer.

319
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,557
Give me the gun.

320
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,071
No!

321
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,153
Freddie Lounds left me
that message three hours ago.

322
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,863
Her cell signal is dead now.

323
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,991
Last call was traced
to the nearest phone tower in,

324
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,160
Wolf Trap, Virginia.

325
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:32,040
We have her on security cameras
at a gas station, filling up her car...

326
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,209
Six miles from your farm.

327
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,547
Freddie was supposed to interview me.

328
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,966
She never showed up.

329
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,053
Why are you granting interviews
to Freddie Lounds?

330
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,639
I owed her one.

331
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,392
Surely, Freddie Lounds
has more enemies than Will.

332
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,353
Not in Wolf Trap, Virginia.

333
00:37:55,731 --> 00:38:00,026
I live in the middle of nowhere, Jack,
if someone wanted to take her, it's...

334
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,945
Not a bad place to do it.

335
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,495
And I provide the ingredients.

336
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,582
You tell me what we should do with them.

337
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,085
What's the meat?

338
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,131
What do you think?

339
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,016
Veal?

340
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,562
Pork, perhaps?

341
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,525
She was a slim and delicate pig.

342
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,155
I'll make you lomo saltado.

343
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,366
We will make it together.

344
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,202
You slice the ginger.

345
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,257
The meat has an interesting flavor.

346
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,844
Its braising...

347
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,931
Notes of citrus.

348
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,683
My palate isn't as refined as yours.

349
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,148
Apart from humane considerations,

350
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,569
it's more flavorful for animals
to be stress-free prior to slaughter.

351
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,954
This animal tastes frightened.

352
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,249
What does "frightened" taste like?

353
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,919
It's acidic.

354
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,133
The meat is bitter

355
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,843
about being dead.

356
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,271
This meat is not pork.

357
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,448
It's long pig.

358
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,052
You can't reduce me to...

359
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,264
A set of influences.

360
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,392
I'm not the product of anything.

361
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:24,856
I've given up good and evil for behaviorism.

362
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,698
Then you can't say that I'm evil.

363
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,994
You're destructive.

364
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,789
Same thing.

365
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,875
Evil is just destructive?

366
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,879
Storms are evil, if it's that simple.

367
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,674
And we have fire, and then there's hail.

368
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,596
Underwriters lump it all
under "Acts of God."

369
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,894
Is this meal an act of God, Will?
