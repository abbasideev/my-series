1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,544
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,629
Can I have Carlo slaughter you a hog?

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,382
A token of my appreciation
for all that you do for Margot.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,134
Was Will aware of your intention
to get pregnant?

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,719
I'm all you have.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,138
Will understands that
Hannibal Lecter can help him.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,516
What Will understands is,
if you can't beat Hannibal,

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,642
join him.

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,519
Freddie was investigating a story

10
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,689
about Will and Hannibal
committing murders together.

11
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,108
She was a slim and delicate pig.

12
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,901
You slice the ginger.

13
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,267
Among gourmands, the ortolan bunting

14
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,395
is considered a rare
but debauched delicacy.

15
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,483
A rite of passage, if you will.

16
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,823
Preparation calls for the songbird
to be drowned alive in Armagnac.

17
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,160
It is then roasted
and consumed whole in a single mouthful.

18
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,666
Ortolans are endangered.

19
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,212
Who amongst us is not?

20
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,384
I haven't been gorged, drowned,
plucked and roasted.

21
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,178
Not yet.

22
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:23,016
Traditionally, during this meal,
we are to place shrouds over our heads,

23
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,520
hiding our faces from God.

24
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,064
I don't hide from God.

25
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,329
Bones and all?

26
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,665
Bones and all.

27
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,762
After my first ortolan, I was euphoric.

28
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,183
A stimulating reminder
of our power over life and death.

29
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,814
I was euphoric
when I killed Freddie Lounds.

30
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,112
Tell me, did your heart race
when you murdered her?

31
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,700
No, it didn't.

32
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,454
A low heart rate is a true indicator
of one's capacity for violence.

33
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,916
Your design is evolving.

34
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,337
Your choices affect
the physical structures of your brain.

35
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,716
Killing is changing the way I think.

36
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,886
Yes.

37
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,231
You must understand that blood and breath

38
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,859
are only elements undergoing change
to fuel your radiance.

39
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,738
Just as the source of light is burning.

40
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,271
Orthodontics confirmed.

41
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,192
It's Freddie Lounds.

42
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,403
A little bit of kerosene,
incendiary journalism.

43
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,906
See? No scabrous crust on her chin.

44
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,407
She was dead before the match was struck.

45
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,451
Blood's already pooled
to the lowest parts of her body.

46
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,578
She's been dead at least 24 hours.

47
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,082
Freddie had a longing to be noticed.

48
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,794
She was noticed.

49
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,712
Freddie Lounds' ultimate failing

50
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,299
was her inability to keep herself
out of her own stories.

51
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,135
You know, there's more to this story.

52
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,470
Check it out.

53
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,349
Severely-burned bodies
tend to split along lines of musculature,

54
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,434
but that looks like an incision.

55
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:39,356
That is right. He cut out her psoas muscles
with what looks like a hunting knife.

56
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,108
A peculiar trophy.

57
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,152
Why did he burn her?

58
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,781
How many people has Freddie Lounds
burned in her career?

59
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,699
Whoever did this was not striking out

60
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,369
against Miss Lounds'
exploitative brand of journalism.

61
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,079
This is something else.

62
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,373
This is something sacred.

63
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,667
Freddie Lounds had to burn.

64
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,505
She was fuel.

65
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,928
Fire destroys and it creates. It is mythical.

66
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,810
She won't rise from the ashes,
but her killer will.

67
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,233
He's the one to be noticed now.

68
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,327
There's no baby.

69
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:41,835
It isn't even an embryo yet,
but here I am, feeling maternal.

70
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,549
You conspired with your unborn child
to liberate yourself.

71
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,511
You've made Will an unknowing accomplice.

72
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,639
I got what I wanted from Will,

73
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,812
but I didn't understand what I was taking
until the strip turned blue.

74
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,028
I'm not proud of myself.

75
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,531
Nor should you be.

76
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,534
- You said...
- I lied.

77
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,044
Did you know?

78
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,547
I was aware of Margot's goal
of having a child.

79
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,133
I was not aware
you were the means to achieving it.

80
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,432
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing.

81
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,810
Or as much as you'd like to give.

82
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,648
As much as I would like to give?

83
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,735
I always thought men were an optional extra
in childrearing, so...

84
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,488
I'm not opposed to a male influence.

85
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,990
As long as it's not my brother.

86
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,244
He's not good with children.

87
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,710
Come along, children.

88
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,258
What's your name?

89
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,926
Franklin.

90
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,011
Do you like horses, Franklin?

91
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,601
Whoa!

92
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,825
Where do you stay, Franklin?

93
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,744
With Mama and Shirley.

94
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,247
Mama is not your real mama, is she?

95
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,457
She's my foster.

96
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,087
- Do you love Mama and Shirley?
- And Kitty Cat.

97
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,632
And Kitty Cat, yes.

98
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,886
Franklin,

99
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,977
you can't stay there anymore
with Mama and Shirley and Kitty Cat.

100
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,229
You have to go away.

101
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,565
- Who says?
- The government says.

102
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,485
Mama lost her job
and her approval as a foster home.

103
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,574
You can't see her after this week.
You can't see Kitty Cat after this week either.

104
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,700
Why not?

105
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,496
Maybe they just
don't want you anymore, Franklin.

106
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,336
Is there something wrong with you?

107
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,175
There is, isn't there?

108
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,677
Oh, here. Here now.

109
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,514
Here we go.

110
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,267
Can you put your head back?

111
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,394
Just like that. Perfect.

112
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,854
Yes.

113
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,398
Perfect.

114
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,579
Have a chocolate.

115
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,473
Do we do friendly visits anymore?

116
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,351
This isn't a friendly visit.

117
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,606
What kind of visit is it?

118
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,277
I guess I'm trying to
convince myself of something.

119
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,532
You're worried I killed Freddie Lounds.

120
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,493
Did you?

121
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,749
What do you think?

122
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,003
I think that's the wrong answer
to tell somebody

123
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,964
who is already wondering
what you're capable of.

124
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,180
I told everyone Hannibal was a killer,
and no one believed me.

125
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,685
Just like no one would believe you
if you said I was a killer.

126
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:57,734
I don't think Hannibal is good for you,
and I think your relationship is destructive.

127
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,069
Hannibal's good enough for you.

128
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,243
You should be afraid.

129
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,795
I want you to have something.

130
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,646
Whoever you are afraid of,

131
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,484
don't be afraid to use it.

132
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,029
It takes 9mm rounds.

133
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,989
Buy a box,

134
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,325
find a range.

135
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,041
Practice.

136
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,726
Please.

137
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,481
I would like to tell you about camp.

138
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,777
It was a wonderful childhood experience
that keeps coming back to me.

139
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,613
Papa paid for the whole thing,
every summer,

140
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,409
all 125 campers on Lake Michigan.

141
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,245
Your father was a generous man.

142
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,331
I've continued his charitable work today.

143
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:40,086
Most of the campers are unfortunates
who will do anything for a candy bar.

144
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,052
Maybe I took advantage.
Maybe I was rough with them.

145
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,431
I'm not holding anything back.

146
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,517
It's all okay. I got a walk on the charges.

147
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,437
What was your penance?

148
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,689
I got 500 hours of community service.

149
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:04,402
I worked at the dog pound,
and I received some court-ordered therapy.

150
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,614
Was therapy helpful?

151
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,326
I got the doctor involved
in something unethical,

152
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,328
so he'd cut me some slack.

153
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,457
That's not helpful.

154
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,877
Papa called it "altruistic punishment."

155
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,006
Mason. Please.

156
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,568
Papa was a prodigy in the field of meat,

157
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:50,448
but his real genius was for human nature.

158
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:56,496
He could look at a man
and see his weakness.

159
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,998
Your father's dead.

160
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,170
A boy's illusions
are no basis for a man's life, Mason.

161
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,051
Margot is the only family you have left.

162
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,981
My sister loves me, Dr. Lecter.
She has to or she's destitute.

163
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,279
Vergers are noted expansionists.

164
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,369
And I am the sole Verger heir.

165
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,834
Unless biology provides another.

166
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,222
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

167
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,768
"Thou anointeth my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

168
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,773
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life

169
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,736
"And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

170
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,668
I'm here to mourn Freddie Lounds.

171
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,838
Can't imagine that's why you're here.

172
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,925
There's all sorts of reasons
why I'd go to Freddie Lounds' funeral.

173
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,097
It's common for a killer
to revisit their victims after death,

174
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,559
attend funerals, return to crime scenes.

175
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,022
- Anyone suspicious?
- Besides me?

176
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,148
That was implied.

177
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,445
You were expecting me.

178
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,742
It's common for a killer
to revisit their victims after death.

179
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,995
I'm not here to dance
on Freddie Lounds' grave,

180
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,789
if that's what you're getting at.

181
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,917
You're not here looking for her killer, either.

182
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,378
You don't seem
particularly interested in the crowd.

183
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,342
Are you profiling me, Dr. Bloom?

184
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,144
I'm here because

185
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,651
my psychiatrist suggested
it would be therapeutic.

186
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,878
I've been so preoccupied with taking a life,

187
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,508
I'm having trouble
wrapping my head around making one.

188
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,095
When men become fathers,

189
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,807
they undergo biochemical changes
that affect the way they think.

190
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,436
You said the same thing happens
when men become killers.

191
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,397
Fathers can be killers.

192
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,236
What sort of father would you be?

193
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,032
I'd be a good father.

194
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,204
How quickly we form attachments
to something that does not yet exist.

195
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,331
No. I'm not attached.

196
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,711
I'm only anticipating attachment.

197
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,426
We have a deep-seated need
to interact with our children.

198
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,929
It helps us discover who we are.

199
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,057
Have you ever been a father?

200
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,728
I was to my sister.

201
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,774
She was not my child,
but she was my charge.

202
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,155
She taught me so much about myself.

203
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,910
Her name was Mischa.

204
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,705
Was?

205
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,332
She's dead.

206
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,044
Abigail reminded me so much of her.

207
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,594
Then why did you kill her?

208
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,974
What happened to Abigail had to happen.

209
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,061
There was no other way.

210
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,439
There was.

211
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,028
But there isn't now.

212
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,076
Would you protect this child
in the way you couldn't protect Abigail?

213
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,041
I still dream about Abigail.

214
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,799
I dream that I'm teaching her how to fish.

215
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,098
I'm sorry. I took that from you.

216
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,439
Wish I could give it back.

217
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,776
So do I.

218
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,121
Occasionally, I drop a teacup
to shatter on the floor.

219
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,164
On purpose.

220
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,005
I'm not satisfied
when it doesn't gather itself up again.

221
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,263
Someday perhaps, a cup will come together.

222
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,134
Extra parts were harvested onsite.

223
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,763
Just one night in the ground,
that beats Jesus by 48 hours.

224
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,767
Never thought Freddie Lounds would
make it to heaven, much less get deified.

225
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,906
This killer is trying
to get somebody's attention.

226
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,827
He has direction.

227
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,081
His chaos is getting more orderly.

228
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,751
So first, he burns effigies,
and now he's assembling them.

229
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,630
Burning Freddie Lounds
wasn't his first effigy.

230
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,092
Whoever killed Freddie killed Randall Tier,

231
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,596
mutilated him, dismembered him
and put him on display.

232
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,849
Randall Tier and Freddie Lounds
have a connection.

233
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,017
Will.

234
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,023
Randall Tier was his suspect
and Hannibal's patient,

235
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,653
and Freddie Lounds
was investigating his murder when she died.

236
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,117
Freddie Lounds was investigating
a lot of things when she died.

237
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,750
This psychopath
was incubating fantasies about killing

238
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,794
and is building himself up.

239
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,965
Or someone's building him up.

240
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,761
He has a benefactor
who admires his destruction.

241
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,227
Shiva is both destroyer and benefactor.

242
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,482
He's being guided.

243
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,486
Is this some kind of signpost?

244
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,159
Maybe Freddie's killer didn't do this.

245
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,205
Maybe his benefactor did.

246
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,833
Why?

247
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,255
It's a courtship.

248
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,266
Good morning!

249
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,402
Riding agrees with you.
Puts color in your cheeks.

250
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,864
You've got a bloom. Really.

251
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,741
It's chilly.

252
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,494
You're frequently chilly, Margot.

253
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,040
I was lying in bed,

254
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,460
composing in my mind,
like the deaf Beethoven,

255
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:11,300
and it occurred to me that for a family
who owns breeding stock,

256
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,094
we don't do much of it ourselves.

257
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,766
I'm concerned about the next generation
of Vergers. Aren't you?

258
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,562
I'm just trying to survive this generation.

259
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,443
Meat is, at base, a people business.

260
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,948
Nobody understood that better than Papa,
except now for me, of course.

261
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,326
Papa would take me out of school
for weeks at a time

262
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,539
while he conducted my real education

263
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,959
in livestock, slaughterhouses.

264
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:54,426
I need to share this wealth
with a little Verger.

265
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,640
- "A little Verger."
- Don't you want an heir, Margot?

266
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,102
I want a baby Verger.

267
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,563
My own baby.

268
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,898
I have viable sperm.

269
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,110
I think I'd have a son. It'd be your heir, too.

270
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,071
Auntie Margot.

271
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,370
I think a child,

272
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,041
it may be what we need
to bring us closer together.

273
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,712
Maybe it is.

274
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,927
I've said it before, you've got a bloom.

275
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,764
Rosy.

276
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,478
Positively radiant.

277
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,274
What is your secret?

278
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,285
Every creative act
has its destructive consequence, Will.

279
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,832
The Hindu god Shiva
is simultaneous destroyer and creator.

280
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,172
Who you were yesterday is laid waste
to give rise to who you are today.

281
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,012
How many lies have had to be sanctified?

282
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,893
How many consciences devastated?

283
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,188
As many as were necessary.

284
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,402
You sacrificed Abigail.

285
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,617
You cared about her as much as I did.

286
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,745
Maybe more.

287
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,210
But then, how much has God sacrificed?

288
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,633
What god do you pray to?

289
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,260
I don't pray.

290
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,640
I have not been bothered
by any considerations of deity,

291
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,435
other than to recognize
how my own modest actions pale

292
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,646
beside those of God.

293
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,691
I prayed

294
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,320
I would see Abigail again.

295
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,991
Well, your prayer
did not go entirely unanswered.

296
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,493
You saw part of her.

297
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,372
Will.

298
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,958
Should the universe contract,

299
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,296
should time reverse
and teacups come together,

300
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,802
a place could be made
for Abigail in your world.

301
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,598
What place would that be?

302
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,811
You've lost a child, Will.

303
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,732
It seems you're likely to gain one.

304
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,448
God is beyond measure in wanton malice

305
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,618
and matchless in his irony.

306
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,144
No, no, no. Cancel that one.

307
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,903
I remember

308
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,616
walking the swine fairs with my father,

309
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,369
looking over the competition.

310
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:55,751
Papa's little silver knife ever ready
to slip out of his waistcoat

311
00:29:55,835 --> 00:30:00,005
and stick into the back of a pig
to check the depth of fat.

312
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,926
Your education was an odd one.

313
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,475
Those were good, funny times.

314
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:17,439
Papa would stab 4-H show pigs
who thought everyone was their friend,

315
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,025
scrubbed in milk and baby powder.

316
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,028
Such coddled little things.

317
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,035
Part of a show pig's consideration
is its happiness.

318
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,123
If we were truly considerate
of a pig's happiness,

319
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,502
we wouldn't eat them.

320
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,880
What about Margot's happiness?

321
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,051
Papa taught me how to stick the knife in
only as deep as necessary,

322
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,387
to test the thickness of her skin.

323
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,141
You miscalculated.

324
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,936
Struck a nerve.

325
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,731
Margot would love to stick a knife into me,

326
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,943
and it wouldn't be to test
the thickness of my skin.

327
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,946
She tried to kill you once already.

328
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,576
"To a male heir
confirmed as my descendent..."

329
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,746
It's a very clever loophole
she's found in Papa's will.

330
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:20,627
Clearly, he did not take into account
how resourceful she is.

331
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,256
Neither did you.

332
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,800
I can be resourceful, too.

333
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,264
If she's not pregnant, she will be.
Margot's very tenacious that way.

334
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,644
This child would be a Verger.

335
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,357
You would have an heir
to carry on the family name,

336
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,235
to carry on your name.

337
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:49,197
I'd have an heir only if I die.

338
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,249
One observes only things
which are already on the mind.

339
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,212
What's on your mind?

340
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,467
I'm feeling pressure
to believe something I don't trust,

341
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:12,220
and that pressure is making me paranoid.

342
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,350
Who's pressuring you?

343
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,646
Will.

344
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,571
We'll never really be alone, will we?

345
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,658
He'll always be in the room.

346
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,664
Do you feel like you're helping him?
Making progress?

347
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,418
Will is finally finding himself.
He's getting better.

348
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,171
Doesn't seem to be getting better.

349
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,343
Are you questioning my therapy?

350
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,764
I'm questioning everything.

351
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,519
It's all blurry and subjective.

352
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,565
I feel empty,

353
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,402
like I've given blood.

354
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,951
Alana, you've given more than blood.

355
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,952
Have you been firing a gun?

356
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,290
I told you, I was feeling paranoid.

357
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,551
Poor Margot.

358
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,221
You just can't win.

359
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:56,278
I have to remove this temptation.

360
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:14,045
They're going to find something wrong
with your lady parts, Margot.

361
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,174
Or so the record will state.

362
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,888
The doctor will advise me that it's best

363
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,974
if they take

364
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,560
everything.

365
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,982
I'm afraid the only person
you'll be celebrating Mother's Day with

366
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,568
is me.

367
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,189
The most terrifying thing in the world
can be a lucid moment.

368
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,403
What are you up to?

369
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,951
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about, Dr. Bloom.

370
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,043
I think you know.

371
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,880
You're not fooling me, Jack.

372
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,633
- I'm not trying to fool you.
- You're lying.

373
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,970
You're all lying.

374
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,973
Will. Hannibal.

375
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,518
You're lying to each other,
and they're lying to you.

376
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,562
Tell me what you believe is happening.

377
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,064
What do I believe?

378
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,109
What do you believe?

379
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,739
Do you believe Will killed Freddie Lounds?

380
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,116
No, I don't.

381
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,703
Do you think Dr. Chilton's
the Chesapeake Ripper?

382
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,330
- There was overwhelming...
- Stop lying, Jack!

383
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,675
You think you've moved
your pieces around so cleverly.

384
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,388
What's changed, Alana?

385
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,184
I have no confidence
that I know Hannibal Lecter anymore.

386
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,606
Even with as much as you know
or think you know Hannibal,

387
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,733
you don't know him either.

388
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,154
You don't know Will.

389
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,866
You are going to lose, Jack.

390
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,080
If you haven't lost already.

391
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,051
I want you to come with me.

392
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,780
How was my funeral?

393
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,476
Carlo?

394
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,230
Carlo, I don't think they've had enough to...

395
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,325
You must be the baby daddy.

396
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,205
Excuse me if I don't offer you a cigar.

397
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,845
I'm gonna feed you to my pigs.

398
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,305
Carlo!

399
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,690
Do you think it was Margot's idea
to have an heir?

400
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,529
You think it was your idea
to take it from her?

401
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,618
My idea to come here and kill you?

402
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:43,625
The only thing that you, your sister and I
have in common

403
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,212
is the same psychiatrist.

404
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,729
If Dr. Lecter had his druthers,

405
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,567
you'd be wrapped around a bullet right now.

406
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,413
Dr. Lecter is the one
you want to be feeding to your pigs.
