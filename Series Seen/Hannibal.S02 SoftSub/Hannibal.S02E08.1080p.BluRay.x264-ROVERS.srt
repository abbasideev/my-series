1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,502
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,796
You wanted me to
embrace my nature, Doctor.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,716
Are you going to try to hurt Hannibal again?
Is he safe?

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,300
From me or for you?

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,052
I'd like to resume my therapy.

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,220
Where shall we begin?

7
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,597
I'm going to prove Hannibal Lecter
is the Chesapeake Ripper.

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,682
It's not him.

9
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,476
I could hear his voice.
I could not see his face.

10
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,645
You will not see it until it is too late.

11
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,689
You trust her, Jack?

12
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,899
You can't trust any of this
to be what it seems.

13
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,871
I get it, the great outdoors.

14
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,832
I get the attraction.

15
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,250
In summer.

16
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:51,592
Well, it's a lot harder to catch trout
when the water is really cold.

17
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,510
That's another argument for summer, Will.

18
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,346
But trout are supposed to be hunters.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,057
Like, they should be
chewing on my hook here.

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,141
Yeah, when it's cold,

21
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,519
their metabolisms drop
and they're not as hungry.

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,856
Yeah, so how do you catch a fish
that isn't hungry?

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:13,489
Change your tactics. Use live bait
that moves and excites them to action.

24
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,950
You gotta make him bite,
even though he's not hungry.

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,371
You make him act on instinct.
He's always a predator.

26
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,084
You have to create a reality
where only you and the fish exist.

27
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,964
Your lure is the one thing he wants,
despite everything he knows.

28
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,760
Make a wrong move, he swims away?

29
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,928
Yeah.

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,515
I'm a good fisherman, Jack.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,226
You hook him, I'll land him.

32
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,947
Truite saumonée au bleu.

33
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,909
Vegetables and broth,

34
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,454
served with a hollandaise sauce on the side.

35
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,541
Beautiful fish, Will.

36
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,003
It was my turn to provide the meat.

37
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,925
More flavorful and firm
than farmed specimens.

38
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,513
I find the trout
to be a very Nietzscheian fish.

39
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,934
Trials of his wild existence
find their way into the flavor of the flesh.

40
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,482
I hope providing the meat

41
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,153
doesn't mean you still harbor doubts
about what I serve at my table.

42
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,365
No doubts, Dr. Lecter.

43
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,492
Only the wounds we dealt each other

44
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,828
until we got to the truth.

45
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,665
Which is why we need to
move past apologies and forgiveness.

46
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,129
Chilton has many victims besides the dead.

47
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,926
We will absorb this experience.
It will change us.

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,386
Well, we are all Nietzscheian fish
in that regard.

49
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,180
Makes us tastier.

50
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,933
None of our actions were personal.

51
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,561
I tried to have Hannibal killed.
Isn't that personal?

52
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,104
You thought I was a killer.

53
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,106
The greatest crime now

54
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,611
would be to walk away
from what we've shared and suffered.

55
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,779
In many ways, we need each other.

56
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,115
We are the only ones
who will know what this feels like.

57
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,702
This fish is delicious.

58
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,205
Isn't it?

59
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,925
I came in this morning,
and I found all the horses with hoods on.

60
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,927
She was lying dead in her stall.

61
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,596
She had a foal two days ago?

62
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,308
Yeah, born dead.
She hasn't eaten since, pining I guess.

63
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,324
Feels like she's still pregnant.

64
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,410
Did they check for twins?

65
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,333
Who performed this C-section?

66
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,545
She didn't have a C-section.
Those weren't there yesterday.

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,617
Yeah, there's something in here all right.

68
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,573
I agree with the pagans. The horse is divine.

69
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,078
All beasts of burden are sacred animals.

70
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:15,332
This kind of mutilation
usually presents as cult activity.

71
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,293
When an animal is sacrificed,
it's presumed the power of the beast

72
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,506
will be psychically transported
to whoever's offering up the goods.

73
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:28,428
Which is why sacrificial animals
should be healthy, without any defects.

74
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,263
This horse was sick.

75
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,516
The womb's more or less intact.

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,976
The victim was deceased
before she was enwombed.

77
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,397
The ecchymosis of the
subcutaneous tissue is consistent with...

78
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,273
She was strangled.

79
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,358
That's a little wordy.

80
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,153
Yeah.

81
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,031
She was scrappy. She put up a fight, Jack.

82
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,368
The horse is a chrysalis.

83
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,081
A cocoon meant to hold the young woman
until her death could be transformed.

84
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,207
Transformed into what?

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,043
Life.

86
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,503
A new life.

87
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,214
This is a birth.

88
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,592
Or it was intended to be.

89
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,513
This is every bit as much about
giving life as it is taking it.

90
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,307
What's the thinking here, Doctor?

91
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,517
Conflicted.

92
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:21,148
I see what he's done.
I don't understand why he's done it.

93
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,276
This killer doesn't think
like anyone else, Jack.

94
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,947
You'll have to find someone who
doesn't think like anyone else to catch him.

95
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,709
You should have taken the chocolate,
Margot.

96
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,337
You are no more at fault
for what happened to you

97
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,341
than if you had been bitten by a mad dog.

98
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,301
Mad dogs are put down.

99
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,305
Is that what you hoped to accomplish
when you attacked your brother?

100
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,143
Well, apparently, I went about
putting him down the wrong way.

101
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,562
He's still alive.

102
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,526
Doing bad things to bad people
makes us feel good.

103
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,905
What's your relationship with him now?
Has it changed?

104
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,825
I think he thinks I've calmed down.

105
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,661
Have you?

106
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,371
I'm calm.

107
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,542
Are you going to try again?

108
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,926
This is where therapy gets a little tricky.

109
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,973
It doesn't have to be tricky.

110
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,475
I could confess to a murder.

111
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,851
You can't say a word.

112
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,231
I could've murdered someone this morning
and you can't say a word.

113
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,192
But if I'm planning to commit a murder...

114
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,613
I am ethically obliged to take action
to prevent that murder.

115
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,656
But be that as it may,

116
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,119
if there's no one else to protect you, Margot,
you have to protect yourself.

117
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:44,708
It would actually have been
more therapeutic if you had killed him.

118
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,063
I'm not complaining, but part
of me suspects we ended up here

119
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,565
to avoid where our conversation was going.

120
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,944
As long as you're not complaining.

121
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,407
Too much has happened for us
not to talk about this.

122
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,076
However pleasant the distractions.

123
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,871
Well, I am recovering
from all that has happened. So is Will.

124
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,127
So are you.

125
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:19,052
I would change many things,
but not that we ended up here.

126
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,013
Or that Will is back in therapy.

127
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,313
The only thing stranger
than finding a woman inside a horse

128
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,650
is seeing you back in therapy
with Will Graham.

129
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,947
Is it really so strange?

130
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,907
He tried to murder you.

131
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,414
Do you know why Will tried to kill me?

132
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,878
It wasn't to avenge Beverly Katz's death.

133
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,966
It was to prevent yours.

134
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,761
He was protecting you in the only way
he felt he had left to him.

135
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:11,187
I'm afraid Will opened a door inside himself,

136
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,274
and no one knows if it closed again.

137
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,900
Especially not Will.

138
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:22,282
Then it's healthy he's back in therapy.

139
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,034
With a good psychiatrist.

140
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,423
Her name is Sarah Craber.

141
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,259
She was a horse groom at the stables
where her body was found.

142
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,303
She was reported missing last week.

143
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,804
Got a hand spread on her neck.

144
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,849
We didn't find anything else on her,
except horse uterus.

145
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,312
The uterus isn't always such
a safe, forgiving environment.

146
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,939
Shark fetuses cannibalize
each other in utero.

147
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,359
And chances are very good everybody
in this room absorbed a twin.

148
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,861
Mine survived.

149
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,156
- Her throat's obstructed. Do you wanna...
- Yep.

150
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,868
It's soil...
Someone packed it in there real good too.

151
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,244
It's not even on her teeth.

152
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,875
You dropped it. I'll get it.

153
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,377
- Thanks.
- I'll test the PH levels,

154
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,339
see what kind of organic matter
or trace elements we come up with.

155
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,509
Should be able to figure out
where it came from.

156
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,470
- She has a heartbeat.
- What?

157
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,224
- She's in rigor mortis...
- She doesn't have a pulse.

158
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,726
She has a heartbeat.

159
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,811
She doesn't...

160
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,272
She has a heartbeat.

161
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,781
Something's beating.

162
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,371
I don't want you to see me.

163
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,625
I don't want you to see what I do.

164
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,629
I want to calm you, comfort you.

165
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,048
There's so much comfort in darkness.

166
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,220
But not for one of you.

167
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,746
I took your life...

168
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,917
And then tried to give it back to you.

169
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,465
I find the womb

170
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,550
and place you inside.

171
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:25,692
I hope that the forces of death and biology

172
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,112
will bring you rebirth.

173
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,454
It was a coffin birth.

174
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,795
Decomposition builds up gasses
inside the putrefying body,

175
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,591
which force the dead fetus
out of its mother's corpse.

176
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,552
It's really more of a prolapse than a birth.

177
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,389
Whoever did this knew the horse.

178
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:02,395
Knew she was dying
because her foal was born dead.

179
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:06,024
He knew Sarah Craber.

180
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,068
He was familiar with the stables.
He knew when he wouldn't get caught.

181
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,656
And he works here,
or maybe used to work here.

182
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:18,619
He has medical knowledge of animals,
but he's not a veterinarian.

183
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,247
He considers himself a healer.

184
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,083
How is this healing?

185
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,002
Sarah Craber was reborn.

186
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,131
This wasn't murder, Jack.

187
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,967
This was grief.

188
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,711
Scare them when ya knock like that.

189
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,046
Peter Bernardone?

190
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,555
Sir?

191
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,898
You don't seem to be curious
about who we are.

192
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,986
Who are you?

193
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,032
I'm Agent Jack Crawford, with the FBI.

194
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,826
This is Will Graham.

195
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,494
We're here to ask you
some questions about someone

196
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,706
you may have had contact with
when you worked at the Blackbriar Stables.

197
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,125
A woman named Sarah Craber.

198
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,921
Her body was recently found in

199
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,214
- unusual circumstances.
- I know.

200
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,508
I know. I heard.

201
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,844
There was a bird in her chest.
Did you hear about that?

202
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,930
Was the bird alive?

203
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,309
Yes.

204
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,857
Who taking care of the bird?

205
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,944
- How well did you know Sarah Craber?
- I didn't know her.

206
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,366
Would you mind looking at a photograph?

207
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,827
I...

208
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,413
I know who she is.

209
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,456
I just didn't know her.

210
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,299
Just take a look to be sure.

211
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,666
Did you get your head injury when you were
working at the stables, Peter?

212
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,170
Yeah, I was kicked... Kicked by a horse.

213
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:18,007
That's an atypical motor response.

214
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,011
Peter's abilities to look and touch
can only happen as separate events.

215
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,514
It's aggravated by stress, right?

216
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,519
Are you feeling under stress?

217
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,773
Yeah, I'm worried about the bird.

218
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,899
Worried about the bird.

219
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,110
I'm sad for her,
sad for the horse, but I...

220
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,032
I can only help the bird.

221
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,583
Well, he knew the victim.
He knew the animals involved.

222
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,169
We'll need a warrant.

223
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,214
I don't know if he's the killer, Jack.

224
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,760
If he is, he never meant to be. And if he isn't,

225
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,262
he knows who is.

226
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,642
You were able to reconstruct

227
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,103
this killer's fantasies.

228
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,357
One dead creature giving birth to another.

229
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,568
The bird, his victim's new beating heart.

230
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,863
Her soul given wings.

231
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,701
Rebirths can only ever be symbolic.

232
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,537
You've been reborn.

233
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,248
Wasn't that the goal of my therapy?

234
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,922
How does it feel consulting again
with Jack Crawford and the FBI?

235
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,633
Last time, it nearly destroyed you.

236
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,803
Last time, you nearly destroyed me.

237
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,224
After everything that has happened, Will,

238
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,642
- you still believe...
- Stop right there.

239
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,522
You may have to pretend,

240
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,648
but I don't.

241
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,695
No, you don't.

242
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,946
Not with me.

243
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,117
I don't expect you to admit anything.
You can't.

244
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,496
But I prefer sins of omission

245
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,248
to outright lies, Dr. Lecter.

246
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,129
Don't lie to me.

247
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,135
Will you return the courtesy?

248
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,183
Why have you resumed your therapy?

249
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,103
Can't just talk to any psychiatrist
about what's kicking round my head.

250
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,524
Do you fantasize about killing me?

251
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,695
Yes.

252
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,200
Tell me. How would you do it?

253
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,455
With my hands.

254
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,002
Then we haven't moved past
apologies and forgiveness, have we?

255
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,672
We've moved past a lot of things.

256
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,054
I discovered a truth about myself
when I tried to have you killed.

257
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,684
That doing bad things to bad people
makes you feel good?

258
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,980
Yes.

259
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,362
I need to know if you're going
to try to kill me again, Will.

260
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,411
I don't want to kill you anymore, Dr. Lecter.

261
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,291
Not now that I finally find you interesting.

262
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,548
Will...

263
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,468
I owe you an apology.

264
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,679
You don't owe me anything.

265
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,848
I thought you were a killer.

266
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,183
I didn't want to hear anything else.

267
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,935
So, I wouldn't consider anything else.

268
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,107
The evidence was compelling.

269
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,276
That didn't stop Beverly from questioning it.

270
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,738
Maybe if she thought we would've listened,

271
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,824
she would have come to us.

272
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,992
She didn't.

273
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:06,504
We traced the soil we found
in Sarah Craber's throat to this vicinity.

274
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,255
The methane probes did the rest.

275
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,299
We found her empty grave

276
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,551
and 15 others that are not so empty.

277
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,722
If Peter Bernardone
knew about Sarah Craber's grave,

278
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,057
then he knew about all the others.

279
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,362
Every human being is capable
of committing acts of great cruelty.

280
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,364
Your brother dehumanized you,

281
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:39,578
and your family unfortunately fosters that
climate of disrespect.

282
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,871
They think I'm weird.

283
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,126
I'm much weirder than
you will ever be, Margot.

284
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,545
It's fine to be weird.

285
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,011
They've already forgiven him.

286
00:25:56,096 --> 00:26:00,474
Talk shows and self-help books,
they thrive on this sort of thing.

287
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,561
Everybody loves a sinner redeemed.

288
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,942
The prodigal son
set about repairing his ways.

289
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:14,947
He may have made bad choices before,
but now he can make new, better choices.

290
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,784
Do you believe that?

291
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,452
Do you believe me?

292
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,288
Well, it's not my role to believe you, Margot,

293
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,082
it's my role to help you
understand what you believe.

294
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,294
I believe my brother won't stop.

295
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,672
How does it make you feel?

296
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,801
Angry.

297
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,053
Anger is an energizing emotion,

298
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,307
prompts action against threat.
If you're angry,

299
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,559
you're optimistic you can
stop this from happening again.

300
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,894
I know how to stop it.

301
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,691
If you really want
to kill your brother, Margot,

302
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,528
wait until you can get away with it.

303
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,530
Or find someone to do it for you.

304
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,369
You said you were worried about the bird.

305
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,455
Thought you might like to see it.

306
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,837
But isn't it evidence?

307
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,507
I'm not FBI.

308
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,178
I used to sort of be FBI,
but now I'm really not.

309
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,309
I didn't kill anyone.

310
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,435
I know that.

311
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,855
But...

312
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,274
Yeah. It's not always relevant.

313
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:38,530
They found Sarah Craber's grave.

314
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,282
How'd you find it?

315
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,334
She's already speaking to me.

316
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,505
This one's spoken to you before?

317
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,513
At some point,

318
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,975
almost every society believed
birds carried our souls to the afterlife.

319
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,732
You think I think

320
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,235
this bird is Sarah?

321
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,737
She's gone.

322
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,325
She's everywhere and nowhere.

323
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,705
Tell me who killed her.

324
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,257
I just wanted something beautiful for her.

325
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,427
You were grieving her.

326
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,264
You couldn't save her,

327
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,059
but you could bring poetry to her death.

328
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,770
I wanted you to find me.

329
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,107
I wanted you to find me
'cause if you could find me, you could...

330
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,276
You could find

331
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
him.

332
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,614
Do you have a shadow, Peter?

333
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,159
Someone only you can see.

334
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,329
Someone you considered a friend.

335
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,752
He made you feel less alone.

336
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,008
Until you saw what he really is.

337
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:26,263
No one will believe me.

338
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,391
He'll make sure no one will believe me.

339
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,021
I'll make sure they do.

340
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,199
Every social worker enjoys
certain aspects of the job more than others.

341
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:50,370
There are cases that you reach
and cases you don't reach.

342
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,793
Your notes on Peter Bernardone's file
are drastically different

343
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,836
than the ones from his last case worker.

344
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,131
The social services system
is far from perfect.

345
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,052
It's common to omit certain information
on difficult cases

346
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,973
in order to clear a path in the world
for those stuck in the weeds.

347
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,976
Peter's had persistent cognitive problems.

348
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:17,648
Confusion, paranoia, rage.

349
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,025
Would have refused his case if I had known.

350
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,321
You don't seem to feel sorry for your client.

351
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,949
A surprising lack of empathy
in a social worker.

352
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,494
Peter Bernardone has accused me
of killing the 16 women.

353
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,747
How does that make you feel?

354
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,211
Right now I'm feeling inconvenienced.

355
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm being detained on the word
of one very damaged individual.

356
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,094
You're not being detained,
you're being interviewed.

357
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,972
The FBI is just being thorough.

358
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,518
What are you writing down?

359
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,602
An observation.

360
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,979
About me?

361
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,816
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to make you feel uncomfortable.

362
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,736
That's smart.

363
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,948
She keeps pushing him
on his feelings, not on the facts.

364
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,743
She's trying to gauge how comfortable
he is with emotion, if he has any.

365
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,328
He couldn't bear being touched by her.

366
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,915
Yes, his responses are typical
of psychopaths during interviews,

367
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,834
but could also be resentment.

368
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,422
No, his eyes are dead.

369
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,048
He's a predator.

370
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,011
- Did you know Sarah Craber?
- No.

371
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,805
Peter talked about her extensively, though,
during our house visits.

372
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,181
I'd say he was obsessed with her.

373
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:38,437
Do you think Peter Bernardone
is capable of murder?

374
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,023
I'm not a psychiatrist, Dr. Bloom.

375
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,611
I'm curious, Mr. Ingram.

376
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,529
Why did you become a social worker?

377
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,867
Society needs caring people.

378
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,203
It also needs a few psychopaths

379
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,248
to keep the rest of us on our toes.

380
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,549
There is no evidence I did this.

381
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,344
And if you'd like to know how I feel,

382
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,306
I feel like I don't want to be here anymore.

383
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,476
So, if you're not detaining me,

384
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,227
I'd like to be on my way now.

385
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,651
Let him go.

386
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,903
You're making a mistake, Jack.

387
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,489
I've got nothing to hold him on.

388
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,825
Peter Bernardone
is psychologically disadvantaged.

389
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,035
He's been manipulated.

390
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,996
As his social worker,
this man is in a position of trust,

391
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,833
and he has betrayed that trust.

392
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,504
I know what it's like
to point at a killer and have no one listen.

393
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,257
You pointed in the wrong direction.

394
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,201
What have you done, Peter?

395
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,369
I'm worried about you.

396
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,415
You've been expressing
a lot of rage recently.

397
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,628
So often in my line of work,

398
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,174
I see people take out their resentments
on those closest to them.

399
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,595
It's a sad fact of human nature.

400
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,765
And you're prone to extremes of emotion.

401
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,768
The way you think is compromised.

402
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,145
You're destroying your life.

403
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,858
Sarah was a bitter reminder
of everything you'll never have.

404
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,986
And this is the very horse that
kicked you in the head.

405
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,031
Didn't mean to, she was just scared.

406
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,869
Some will say this was a long time coming.
I know I will. I already have.

407
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,207
Sixteen women, Peter.

408
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,793
You killed them because...

409
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,462
- You weren't worthy of them.
- You killed them.

410
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,339
You killed them.

411
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,053
If I had killed them, it would be because

412
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,347
they were worthy of me.

413
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,333
You look like a man
who has suffered an irrevocable loss.

414
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,879
I'm trying to prevent one.

415
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,759
Do you think if you save Peter Bernardone,
you can save yourself?

416
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,761
Save myself from what, Dr. Lecter?

417
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,931
From who you perceive me to be.

418
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,395
I'm afraid I need to be saved
from who you perceive me to be.

419
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:53,525
Many troublesome behaviors strike
when you are uncertain of yourself.

420
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,570
Peter Bernardone lies in the same darkness
that holds you.

421
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,700
No, I'm alone in that darkness.

422
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,784
You're not alone, Will.

423
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,079
I'm standing right beside you.

424
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,170
Peter...

425
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,842
Is your social worker in that horse?

426
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,139
Yes.

427
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:12,062
I used to have a horrible fear of...

428
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,814
Of hurting anything.

429
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,359
But...

430
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:21,112
He helped me get over that.

431
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,118
Feels so abnormal.

432
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:31,790
An abnormal reaction
to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.

433
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,170
I think he deserves to die.

434
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,966
But...

435
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,884
But you didn't deserve to kill him, Peter.

436
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,139
I want you to come with me.

437
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,684
What was done to you

438
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,229
was cruelty for cruelty's sake.

439
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,989
I think I hate him.

440
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,201
I envy you, your hate.

441
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,497
It makes it easier
when you know how to feel.

442
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,837
What... Makes what easier?

443
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,301
Killing.

444
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,807
I didn't kill him.

445
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,563
I just wanted him to understand

446
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:24,194
what it's like to suffocate and to experience

447
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,655
the destiny that he created.

448
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,248
Mr. Ingram.

449
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,000
Might want to crawl back in there
if you know what's good for you.

450
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,510
Officer...

451
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,559
I'm the victim here.

452
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,645
I'm not an officer.

453
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,938
I'm Peter's friend.

454
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,525
Peter's confused.

455
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,490
I'm not.

456
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
Pick up the hammer.

457
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,455
Will.

458
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,957
Pick it up.

459
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,629
It won't feel the same, Will.

460
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,590
- It won't feel like killing me.
- It doesn't have to.

461
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:15,263
You did the best anyone could do for Peter,
but don't do this for him.

462
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,183
If you're going to do this, Will,

463
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,436
you have to do it for yourself.

464
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,938
Please don't.

465
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,941
You would be wise
to remain silent, Mr. Ingram.

466
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,614
Will, this is not the reckoning
you promised yourself.

467
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,356
With all my knowledge and intrusion,
I could never

468
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,942
entirely predict you.

469
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,112
I can feed the caterpillar,

470
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,699
and I can whisper through the chrysalis,

471
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,201
but what hatches

472
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,830
follows its own nature and is beyond me.
