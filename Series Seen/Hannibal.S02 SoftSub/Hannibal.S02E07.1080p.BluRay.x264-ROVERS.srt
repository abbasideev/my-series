1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,627
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:04,795
Where were you last night?

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,547
I was with Hannibal all night, Jack.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,258
- My name is Miriam Lass. I'm with the FBI.
- Come in.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,511
The Chesapeake Ripper
recorded Miriam Lass two years ago.

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,054
Jack, I was so wrong.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,931
You said yourself, there's no body.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,433
Miriam Lass is dead!

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,767
Found something else in the lures.

10
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,019
Madrona bark.

11
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,562
Will didn't kill any of these people.

12
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,272
There's a small stand in Virginia.

13
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,793
Jack, it's Miriam.

14
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,213
I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.

15
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,882
I was so wrong. I was so wrong.

16
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,513
Please, Jack. I don't want to die like this.

17
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,348
Jack, it's Miriam.

18
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,476
I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,978
I was so wrong. I was so wrong.

20
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,247
Thank you.

21
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,585
I knew you'd never stop looking.

22
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,427
Can I see him?

23
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,599
We haven't caught the Ripper.

24
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,313
He's still...

25
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,609
We need your help, Miriam.
You know who he is.

26
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,696
I don't know who he is.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,033
You found him.

28
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,912
I don't remember finding him.

29
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,750
He got inside my head.

30
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,011
I remember a dream about drowning.

31
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,641
And then being awake.

32
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,643
And not awake.

33
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,896
Being myself, and not myself.

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,986
I'd wake up to the smell of fresh flowers
and the sting of a needle.

35
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,909
I wasn't afraid.

36
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:30,167
Fear and pain were so far away.

37
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,297
I was reckless with your life.

38
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,759
I was reckless with my life.

39
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,012
I saw what I needed in you, and I used you.

40
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,349
I let you break the rules on my behalf
while I hid behind deniability.

41
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,019
Agent Crawford, please do not
apologize to me for my mistakes.

42
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,314
He treated me very well,

43
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,943
until the end, until he put me in the ground.

44
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,906
Even when he took my arm.

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,366
He told me what he was going to do.

46
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,119
I went to sleep, woke up, it was gone.

47
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,125
He said he wanted to give it to you.

48
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,424
Can you identify him?

49
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,637
I could hear his voice.
I couldn't see his face.

50
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,641
All I could see

51
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,478
was light.

52
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,783
Why didn't he kill you, Miriam?

53
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,246
Why were you spared?

54
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,791
I wasn't spared.

55
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,627
He was saving me for last.

56
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,639
They found a witness.

57
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,184
A survivor.

58
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,521
The only victim of the Chesapeake Ripper,
who lived to tell.

59
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,818
Is this witness watching me now?

60
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,904
Yes.

61
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,368
It seems I am the usual suspect.

62
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,501
I keep having angry,
imaginary conversations

63
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,045
with Jack Crawford about that.

64
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,384
I wish I could tell you
why this is happening.

65
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,225
This witness must not be able
to identify the Ripper by sight.

66
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,400
Jack wants them to hear my voice,
otherwise, I'd be in here alone.

67
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,485
Right?

68
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,409
Still,

69
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,080
I appreciate your company.

70
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,773
It's not him.

71
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,238
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

72
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,448
He's not the Ripper.

73
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,001
This is very sudden.

74
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,420
The federal prosecutor dropped all charges.

75
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,174
Since you were not convicted
of killing anyone,

76
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,679
the basis for your sentencing
to this institution is null and void.

77
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,350
The Chesapeake Ripper has set you free.

78
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,187
Mazel tov.

79
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:16,953
I would love nothing more
than to see you trade places with Dr. Lecter.

80
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,124
I have no intention
of ending up on his menu.

81
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,752
Well, then confess, Frederick.

82
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,546
Might be the only thing saves your life.

83
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,006
Confess to what?

84
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,634
Confess to bonding with Hannibal Lecter

85
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,553
over your shared practice
of unorthodox therapies.

86
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,723
Dr. Lecter with me, you with Abel Gideon.

87
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,225
Gideon is playing his own game,

88
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,685
was wheeled out of that hospital
by the Chesapeake Ripper.

89
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,312
Curious what bargain they struck.

90
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,356
No, there's no bargaining with smoke.

91
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,399
No, Gideon's dead.

92
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,818
You're next.

93
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,238
Unless I unburden myself?

94
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,074
Confession is good for the soul.

95
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,954
Shine a light on your relationship
with Hannibal Lecter.

96
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,915
He works in the shadows.

97
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,041
Deny them to him.

98
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,795
Tell Jack Crawford everything.

99
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,506
Are you suggesting I kill my career
before Hannibal can kill me?

100
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,592
I'm suggesting you convince
Jack Crawford however you can.

101
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,015
Like your life depends on it.

102
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,772
Why did Hannibal not just kill you?

103
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,362
Because he wants to be my friend.

104
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,462
You need a ride?

105
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,925
I was gonna call a cab.

106
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,803
We found Miriam Lass.

107
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,139
Alive.

108
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,270
You catch the Ripper?

109
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,193
How is she? Miriam.

110
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,156
Traumatized.

111
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,994
Miriam thanked me after we found her.

112
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,873
Thanked me for not giving up on her.

113
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,833
But I had.

114
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,295
I had given up on her.
And I gave up on you, too.

115
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,881
I thought she was dead.

116
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,176
I thought you were crazy.

117
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,055
And I gave up on trying
to find the both of you.

118
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,439
You didn't have to find me, Jack.

119
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,237
You just had to listen to me.

120
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,326
I put Miriam in a room with Hannibal Lecter.
She stated definitively he is not

121
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,244
the Chesapeake Ripper.

122
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,664
That definitive enough for you?

123
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,208
No.

124
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,169
It wasn't.

125
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,386
Where'd you find Miriam, Jack?

126
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,691
The property was condemned years ago.

127
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,319
Apparently, the Ripper
has been using it since that time.

128
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,562
Will.

129
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,731
In here.

130
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,221
It's Beverly Katz's blood.

131
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,517
He drained her before he froze her
before he cut into her.

132
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,355
Chesapeake Ripper's latest victim,

133
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,191
he was found in the other cistern.

134
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,485
The water in his lungs is what led us here.

135
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,368
We found Miriam down there.

136
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,246
She believed the Ripper
brought her here to kill her.

137
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,748
He was saving her to be his last victim.

138
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,545
He knows we're close to catching him.

139
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,714
He's been caught before.

140
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,053
Catch a fish once and it gets away.

141
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,223
It's a lot harder to catch a second time.

142
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,078
I sowed the seeds

143
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,582
and watched them grow.

144
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,420
I cultivated.

145
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,257
A long chain of events leading to this.

146
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,762
All of this

147
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,435
has been my design.

148
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,906
It's theater.

149
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,412
Every time the Ripper kills someone,
it's theater.

150
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,706
The Ripper didn't bring Miriam here
to kill her.

151
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,126
He brought her here for you to find.

152
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,633
But the Ripper's not self-destructive.
He doesn't want to get caught.

153
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,259
He wants you to catch someone.

154
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,638
Like he wanted you to catch me.

155
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:38,061
Somewhere, in all of this evidence,

156
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,440
you will find something that will
lead you away from Hannibal Lecter.

157
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,818
Miriam Lass has already done that.

158
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,362
Two years.

159
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,907
It's a long time
to have Hannibal in your head.

160
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,410
You can't trust her, Jack.

161
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,873
You can't trust any of this
to be what it seems.

162
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,943
Hey.

163
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,284
Welcome home.

164
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,871
Thank you.

165
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,209
Thank you for looking after them.

166
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,919
They seem happy.

167
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,089
Happy to see you.

168
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,550
Who's this?

169
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,218
Applesauce. She's mine.

170
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,513
She likes applesauce.

171
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,349
I rescued her.

172
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,230
Picking up some of my bad habits?

173
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,109
Picking up your good habits.

174
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,781
You challenged my whole framework
of assumptions about the way you are.

175
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:19,120
- The way I think you are.
- Well, the way you think I am

176
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,664
isn't always a reliable guide to who I am.

177
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,667
I was wrong about you.

178
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,130
Because you didn't believe me or in me?

179
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:36,804
Because you let me question my sanity,
my sense of reality?

180
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,348
Because you tried to kill Hannibal.

181
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,270
You're wrong about him, Will.

182
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,231
No, you're wrong about him, Alana.
You see the best in him.

183
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,026
I don't.

184
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,073
Hey?

185
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,451
What was done to you
doesn't excuse what you did.

186
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,791
Are you going to try to hurt Hannibal again?

187
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,834
Is he safe?

188
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,299
From me or for you?

189
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,977
He's dangerous, Alana.

190
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,147
I suggest you stay as far away
from Hannibal Lecter as you can.

191
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,115
Come on.

192
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,206
What can I do for you, Dr. Chilton?

193
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,874
It is what I can do for you.

194
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:52,213
I would like to offer my services
on the Ripper case, pro bono, of course.

195
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,048
I see.

196
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,384
You wish to be helpful expediting
Hannibal Lecter's arrest?

197
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,971
I have consulted with the FBI
on previous Ripper murders.

198
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,556
You have an agenda with this case, Doctor.

199
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,309
Yes, I have an agenda, living.

200
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,354
I should be assigned an FBI escort.

201
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,316
Everyone who believed Will Graham
about Hannibal Lecter is dead.

202
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,486
- Except you.
- Except me.

203
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,490
I would like to remain not dead
for the foreseeable future.

204
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,620
Do you have something substantial
to contribute or just an opinion?

205
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,206
- I have a witness.
- A witness?

206
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,709
If Will is not a suspect, then he is a witness.

207
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,919
To his own manipulation?

208
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,131
We have had remarkable success
recovering memory.

209
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,427
He remembers so much
of what was done to him.

210
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,887
Why hasn't Will told me this himself?

211
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,389
Because you told him
his memories were meaningless.

212
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,686
I imagine Hannibal Lecter used
the same coercive techniques

213
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,231
on Miriam Lass that he used on Will Graham.

214
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,859
He buried memories in both of them.

215
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,866
Jack, I dug those memories out of Will.
I can dig them out of Miriam.

216
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,329
Miriam Lass is not your patient, Doctor.

217
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,756
Over your shoulder...

218
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,907
Are you an FBI agent?

219
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,158
No.

220
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,079
I used to teach at the Academy.

221
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,082
And two days ago,

222
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:56,379
I was an inmate at the Baltimore State
Hospital for the Criminally Insane.

223
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,299
Courtesy of the Chesapeake Ripper.

224
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,429
Well, the Guru told me the only person

225
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,891
who had any practical understanding
of the Ripper was you,

226
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,810
but he didn't mention that you were a victim.

227
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,853
Guru?

228
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,438
Jack Crawford.

229
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,650
He has a peculiar cleverness.

230
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,321
The Guru tells me

231
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:27,326
that you don't remember much
about what the Ripper did to you.

232
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,289
I couldn't remember either.

233
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,707
Couldn't?

234
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,292
I remember now.

235
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,670
Not all of it. Pieces.

236
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:43,342
I was under his influence.

237
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:51,183
He used some kind of light
to induce a seizure response in my brain.

238
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,396
It created blackouts and lost time.

239
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,153
I remember the light.

240
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,700
He would stand in front of it
at a distance from me,

241
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,413
silhouetted, very still.

242
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,957
He would listen to chamber music.

243
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,085
I still hear that.

244
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,503
You're waking now.

245
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,674
And his voice, low and even,
would pull me to him.

246
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,509
Waking in a pleasant room, safe.

247
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,635
Like a current.

248
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,724
You're waking now. Waking, calm.

249
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,227
Waking in a pleasant room, safe.

250
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:43,069
You and I are part of his design.

251
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,575
He wanted you to be free.

252
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,954
He wanted me to be free too.

253
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,458
Neither of us are really free.

254
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,669
He's not done.

255
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,775
The same unfortunate aftershave.

256
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,824
Too long in the bottle.

257
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:41,794
Our last kitchen conversation
was interrupted by Jack Crawford.

258
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,672
I'd like to pick up where we left off.

259
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,968
If memory serves, you were asking me

260
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,597
if it would feel good to kill you.

261
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,060
You've given that some thought.

262
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,521
You wanted me
to embrace my nature, Doctor.

263
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,775
I'm just following the urges
I kept down for so long,

264
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,528
cultivating them as the inspirations they are.

265
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,989
You never answered my question.

266
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,411
How would killing me make you feel?

267
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,830
Righteous.

268
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,416
Aren't you curious, Will?

269
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,793
Why you?

270
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,087
Why Miriam Lass?

271
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,797
What does the Chesapeake Ripper want
with you?

272
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,757
No, you tell me.

273
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,350
How did Miriam Lass find you?

274
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,687
You made sure
no one could find you that way again.

275
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,526
If I'm not the Ripper,
you murder an innocent man.

276
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:53,365
You better than anyone know what it means
to be wrongly accused.

277
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,160
You were innocent, and no one saw it.

278
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,704
No, I'm not innocent. You saw to that.

279
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,875
If I am the Ripper, and you kill me,
who will answer your questions?

280
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,007
Don't you want to know how this ends?

281
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,207
My name is Miriam Lass. I'm with the FBI.

282
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,960
I would show you my credentials,
but I'm actually just a trainee.

283
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,338
Never just a trainee, an agent in training.

284
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,090
Please, come in.

285
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,894
I would have been happy
to come to your office, Jack.

286
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,189
I understand, but I wanted to do this here.

287
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,108
I'm sure you have your reasons.

288
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,528
The most-important aspect
of a successful recovery is

289
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,531
recognizing that life will never be the same.

290
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,785
Then I must be well on my way
to a successful recovery.

291
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,552
It's beautiful.

292
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,637
- Yours?
- Yes.

293
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,640
I enjoy portraiture.

294
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:46,729
A subject's mental process betrayed
only by the expression on their face.

295
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,901
Miriam, the Chesapeake Ripper
sent me a message from you.

296
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,072
It was recorded shortly after you were taken.

297
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,866
It's me? My voice?

298
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,868
Yes.

299
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,995
I want to hear it.

300
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,167
Very well.

301
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:15,299
Jack, it's Miriam. I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.

302
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,594
I was so wrong. I was so wrong.

303
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,890
Please, Jack, I don't wanna die like this.

304
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,312
I don't remember.

305
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,942
Would you like to try?

306
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,821
You're waking now.

307
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,407
Waking, calm.

308
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,829
Waking in a pleasant room.

309
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,039
Safe.

310
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,171
Open your eyes.

311
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,390
Jack. Jack, it's Miriam.

312
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,267
Tell me where you are.

313
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,770
I don't know where I am.

314
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,108
What do you see?

315
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,735
I can't see anything.

316
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,571
I was so wrong.

317
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,158
Jack, please, I don't wanna die like this.

318
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,203
Miriam,

319
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,165
what was the last thing you remember
before making the call?

320
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,258
The Wound Man.

321
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,347
We found a fingerprint on a flower petal.

322
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:49,226
A partial, smudged.
Not enough points for a courtroom,

323
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,688
but it triggered a match in the system.

324
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,523
Hannibal Lecter.

325
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,361
After all these murders,
the Ripper's gonna leave a print now?

326
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,490
Will said whatever evidence we found,
it would lead us away from the Ripper.

327
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,953
We also found sodium amytal
and scopolamine in Miriam's blood.

328
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:12,291
Dr. Chilton used scopolamine
and sodium amytal

329
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,878
on both Gideon and Will
during their therapy.

330
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:20,090
One claimed to be the Chesapeake Ripper,
and the other accused Hannibal.

331
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,427
"You've got the right box,
but you're looking in the wrong corner."

332
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:29,808
Gideon pointed me at Chilton,
told me that he was the Ripper.

333
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,021
Wait. I'm confused. So, who are we saying
is the Chesapeake Ripper?

334
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,190
Dr. Lecter or Dr. Chilton?

335
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,487
Bring them both in.

336
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,859
Hello, Frederick.

337
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,486
Oh, my God.

338
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,491
That will be the FBI.

339
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,624
When you wake up,
your only choice will be to run.

340
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,920
One moment, please.

341
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,536
May I use your shower, please?

342
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:27,087
Gideon hasn't been dead for long,
no more than a couple of hours.

343
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,881
Chilton's been carving the steaks
off of him for days.

344
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,760
Chilton's shelves are filled
with a lot of old medical books.

345
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,012
The Wound Man.

346
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,682
This illustration shows up
in a lot of early texts.

347
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,851
It's the Ripper's sixth victim.

348
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,354
Chilton was consulting on the Ripper case
when Miriam disappeared.

349
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,231
She must've talked to him,
made the connection.

350
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,817
Beverly made a connection too.

351
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,694
Chilton's been a part of the Ripper case

352
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:55,407
since before Will Graham,
Hannibal Lecter, Miriam Lass.

353
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,326
He had access to case files.

354
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,664
He would know everything
the Ripper would need to know.

355
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:11,048
I have the same profile as Hannibal Lecter.

356
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,051
Same medical
and psychological background.

357
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,556
We are both doctors of note in our field.
Of course it would be me!

358
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,728
Hannibal was never going to kill me.
I'm his patsy.

359
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,399
I have to leave the country.
I am leaving the country.

360
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,193
No, if you run, you look guilty.

361
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,862
You did not run,
and you looked plenty guilty.

362
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,574
Abel Gideon was half-eaten
in my guest room.

363
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,161
I have corpses on my property.

364
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,872
You just threw up an ear.

365
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,540
There's an APB on you right now.

366
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,085
They've canceled credit cards.
They're tracing your phone.

367
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,254
I have cash, and I tossed my phone.

368
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,299
Jack Crawford thinks I killed
two agents, three agents.

369
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,511
You know what tends to happen
to people who do that? Shoot on sight.

370
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,431
I'm going to prove Hannibal Lecter
is the Chesapeake Ripper.

371
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:07,312
I know you will. And when you do,
I will read about it from a secure location,

372
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:11,316
and I will reintroduce myself
to society at that time.

373
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:30,127
Will, what have you done?

374
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,172
- I called Jack Crawford.
- No.

375
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,011
No. No.

376
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,847
No.

377
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:47,144
No! No! No, stay there!

378
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,566
You're not a killer, Frederick.

379
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,697
- Why'd you come alone, Jack?
- Where is he?

380
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,823
- Why'd you come alone?
- Where is he?

381
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,993
Hey, I told you,
everything is not what it seems.

382
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,245
The Chesapeake Ripper
is still playing with us, all of us.

383
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,166
The Chesapeake Ripper is not playing
all of us, Will. He's playing you.

384
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,918
Jack, wait. I'll bring him out.

385
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,171
He's got a gun.

386
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,297
Good.

387
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,699
Chilton!

388
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,763
Chilton, stop where you are!

389
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,336
Please.

390
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,222
One navy blue sweater,

391
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,850
one pair of men's dress pants
in charcoal gray,

392
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,353
one black and red pea coat,

393
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,403
one black leather billfold containing
$443, various credit cards,

394
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,364
one set of car keys.

395
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,907
I need to speak to Will Graham.

396
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,576
I don't care what you need.

397
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,913
One Montblanc fountain pen
in silver and black.

398
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,085
Does it have to be you?

399
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,713
It seems like one final indignity.

400
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,218
Not like you to hide an achievement.

401
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,638
The achievement is not mine.

402
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:33,601
Whose is it? Hannibal Lecter's?

403
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,315
Those are just words
coming out of your mouth.

404
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,402
No weight to them.

405
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,697
No consideration they may be true.

406
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,657
They're not true.

407
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,827
You were using coercive therapies,

408
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,163
influencing Abel Gideon and Will Graham

409
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,458
to point the Ripper investigations
in false directions.

410
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,170
You cannot see it,
and you will not see it until it is too late.

411
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,548
Don't say I did not warn you, Dr. Bloom.

412
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,261
In fact, I believe,

413
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,764
these should be my last words
on the subject of the Ripper

414
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,766
until my lawyer arrives.

415
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,186
You're waking now.

416
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,230
Waking, calm.

417
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,900
Waking in a quiet room.

418
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,368
You're waking now.
Waking in a quiet room, safe.

419
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,997
It's him. It's him.

420
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,832
It's him. It...

421
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,339
It's all right.

422
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,760
Hello, Will.

423
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,388
May I come in?

424
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,767
Do you intend to point a gun at me?

425
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,939
Not tonight.

426
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,947
Are you expecting someone?

427
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,034
Only you.

428
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,704
Kept my standing appointment open?

429
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,125
And you're right on time.

430
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,173
I have to deal with you

431
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,843
and my feelings about you.

432
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,140
I think it's best if I do that directly.

433
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,440
First you have to grieve for what is lost
and what has changed.

434
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,943
I've changed. You changed me.

435
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,032
The friendship that we had is over.

436
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,577
The Chesapeake Ripper is over.

437
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,538
It had to be Miriam, didn't it?

438
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,917
She was compelled to take his life

439
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,294
so she could take her own back.

440
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,465
How will you take your life back?

441
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,558
I'd like to resume my therapy.

442
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,708
Where shall we begin?
