1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,627
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,880
The light from friendship won't reach us

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:07,965
for a million years.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,675
That's how far away from friendship we are.

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,845
It would seem Jack Crawford
is less suspicious of me than you are.

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,180
Jack Crawford doesn't know
what you're capable of.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,265
Neither do you.

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,810
You maintain an air of transparency,

9
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,521
while putting me
in the position to lie for you.

10
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,814
Someone went through a lot of trouble

11
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,524
to make sure that they were well preserved.

12
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,900
They've been coated in some kind of resin.

13
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,193
There are a lot of people missing.

14
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,987
You want to know
how he's choosing them, don't you?

15
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,071
Tell me what you see.

16
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,463
I've lost the plot.

17
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:26,390
I am the unreliable narrator of my own story.

18
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,185
You have an incomplete self.

19
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,980
There are pieces of you

20
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,982
you can't see.

21
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,484
I'm afraid to see.

22
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,280
I don't know who I am anymore.

23
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,869
And I'm afraid.

24
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,415
Without remembering,
you're seized by something imagined.

25
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,002
I don't know which is worse.

26
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,672
Believing I did it

27
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,426
or believing that you did it,

28
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,515
and did this to me.

29
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,518
Hannibal isn't responsible, Will.

30
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,772
And neither are you. We have to
get to the truth of what happened.

31
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,607
It's the only way you can move forward.

32
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,741
I felt so betrayed by you.

33
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,289
Betrayal was
the only thing that felt real to me.

34
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,376
I trusted you.

35
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,423
And I needed to trust you.

36
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,884
And you can trust me.

37
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,059
- I'm very confused.
- Of course you are.

38
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,729
Will, let us help you.

39
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,065
Let me help you.

40
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,492
I need your help.

41
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,726
What a pleasant surprise.

42
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,067
Please. Sit down.

43
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,319
I won't be staying long.

44
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,198
I'm curious,
what couldn't wait until our next session?

45
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,700
We don't have a next session.

46
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,204
I am no longer your therapist.

47
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,542
May I ask why?

48
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,338
I have reached the limit of my efficacy.

49
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,675
I don't believe I can help you.

50
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,346
Are you giving me a referral?

51
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,265
No.

52
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,811
I am simply ending
our patient-psychiatrist relationship.

53
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,027
You tried to end it before.

54
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:17,662
I am grateful for your persistence
in engaging me after my attack.

55
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,250
However, in light of everything
that has happened with Will Graham,

56
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,297
I have begun to question your actions.

57
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:33,887
Particularly your past actions
with regards to me and my attack.

58
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,891
Did you share these questions
with Jack Crawford?

59
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,268
No.

60
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,395
And nor will I.

61
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,439
I would look just as guilty as you.

62
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,485
But perhaps that is what you intended.

63
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,321
What exactly am I guilty of?

64
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,865
Exactly, I cannot say.

65
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,288
I've had to draw a conclusion

66
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:05,502
based on what I glimpsed through the
stitching of the person suit that you wear.

67
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,258
And the conclusion that I've drawn

68
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,762
is that you are dangerous.

69
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,933
I'm sorry you feel that way.

70
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,229
Please don't come to my home again.

71
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,486
I will see myself out.

72
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm resuming Will Graham's therapy.

73
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,665
To what end?

74
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,001
Besides your own.

75
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,796
He asked for my help.

76
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,842
Then maybe you deserve each other.

77
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,066
His name is Roland Umber,
same profile as the other victims.

78
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,277
Lived alone, disappeared from home,

79
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,988
had a large dose of heroin in his system.

80
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:19,034
This victim wasn't unstrung,
he was ripped from his moorings.

81
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,827
Whatever his imperfection, it was enough

82
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,954
to aggravate the killer
into tearing him down.

83
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,000
He was discarded in a tributary
over 400 miles away from anything

84
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,336
that feeds into the dam
where the first victims were found.

85
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,087
Like dandelion seeds,

86
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,466
casting bodies
in every direction but his own.

87
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,592
Very poetic.

88
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,970
The buffeting in the current
causes so many postmortem injuries,

89
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,350
it's impossible to tell them
from the ones they got when they were alive.

90
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,061
Excuse me.

91
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,563
Doctor, join me over here.

92
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,984
There may be trace evidence
preserved in the craquelure.

93
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,319
What?

94
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,988
Craquelure. It's French.

95
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,033
For the cracks that appear
on an oil painting as it dries

96
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,660
and it becomes rigid with age.

97
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,245
Cracks are not always weaknesses.

98
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,623
A life lived accrues in the cracks.

99
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,375
Could be something in there,

100
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,085
fiber, debris.

101
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,337
Might help track where
the bodies were before they got dumped.

102
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,922
What do the victims have in common?

103
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,007
What if it isn't what they have in common?

104
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,385
What if it's what makes them different?

105
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,887
Each of these people
has a slightly different flesh tone.

106
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,515
It could be like a color palette.

107
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,894
The color of our skin is so often politicized.

108
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,480
It would almost be refreshing
to see someone revel

109
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,857
in the aesthetic for aesthetics' sake.

110
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,527
If it weren't so horrific.

111
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,153
We're supposed to see color, Jack.

112
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,989
That may be all
this killer has ever seen in his fellow man,

113
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,785
which is why it is so easy
for him to do what he does to his victims.

114
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,205
Which is why there'll be
a lot more bodies on his color palette.

115
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,335
A fascinating insight, Ms. Katz,

116
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,546
as if Will Graham himself
were here in the room.

117
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,383
Yes, it is.

118
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,971
How's Will Graham?

119
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,306
Shut your mouth.

120
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,896
Is there a reason you didn't come to me
before you decided to go talk to him?

121
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,734
- I figured you'd say no.
- You figured correctly.

122
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,569
But I knew you'd want to say yes.

123
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,779
You knew that?

124
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,949
You put me in an awkward position, Jack.

125
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,784
I had to go because I knew you wouldn't.

126
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,953
If you had gone like you wanted,
I wouldn't have had to.

127
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,915
Why didn't you?

128
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,793
Because Will Graham is either delusional
or he's a psychopath,

129
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,503
neither of which I can trust.

130
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,757
Fine, so don't trust him, just listen to him.

131
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,384
I'm listening. This is what I'm hearing.

132
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,887
If he's delusional,
it's because I made him that way.

133
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,474
If he's a psychopath,
it's because everything in my gut is wrong.

134
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,809
You think he's innocent.

135
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,853
I don't know what I think.

136
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,317
I think he still wants to save lives.
That's what I think.

137
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,321
I have bent the rules here
in the name of saving lives.

138
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:06,326
Now, there is an internal investigation.
I'm under the microscope.

139
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,371
The Office of the Inspector General
has ordered a psych eval

140
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,874
to determine
my competency to sit in this chair.

141
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,709
Well, what do you want me to do?

142
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,295
If you don't want me to go back, I won't.

143
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,680
We didn't have this conversation.

144
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,520
And since we didn't have this conversation,
I want you to go

145
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,939
and do whatever it is you believe
it is your job to do.

146
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,359
Do you know what your job is?

147
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,196
Yes, I do.

148
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,365
Then do it.

149
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,560
I've been advised
to stay on this side of the line.

150
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,606
Select patients
have taken to urinating on the therapists.

151
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,359
I would argue drawing a line
might encourage a pissing contest.

152
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,280
I'm not interested
in a pissing contest with you, Dr. Lecter.

153
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,450
Please, pull up your chair.

154
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,088
You said the light from friendship
won't reach us for a million years,

155
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,341
that's how far away we are.

156
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,594
I hope our friendship feels closer today.

157
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,221
Friends have a symmetrical relationship.

158
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,934
Psychiatrist and patient, that's unbalanced.

159
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,647
There is a power differential
between psychiatrist and patient,

160
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,068
one that I'm well aware of,
particularly with my own therapist.

161
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,987
But we're just having conversations.

162
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,911
- You threatened me with a reckoning.
- I did.

163
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,997
I can't claim unconsciousness on that one.

164
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,419
You were searching for something
in your head to incriminate me.

165
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,714
I can only assume you didn't find it.

166
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,884
There's not much in there I recognize.

167
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,761
Whatever you remember,

168
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,264
if you do remember,
will be a distortion of reality,

169
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,100
not the truth of events.

170
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,019
I'm realizing that.

171
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,193
Beverly Katz has come to see you?

172
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,697
Yes.

173
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,493
Wouldn't want Alana Bloom to worry
about you dwelling on anything morbid

174
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,203
in what's to be a time of recovery.

175
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,831
It's the only thing that feels normal.

176
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,957
The violence?

177
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,419
The structure of understanding the violence.

178
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,795
You're missing pieces of yourself.

179
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,547
Careful what you replace them with.

180
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,720
What did you see in the pictures?

181
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,934
This killer, he's not stringing his victims up,

182
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,437
he's stitching them together.

183
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,732
Each body is a brushstroke.

184
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,069
He's making a human mural.

185
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,281
Why does he do it?

186
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,242
He's missing pieces, too.

187
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,255
Dr. Lecter has advised me
against dwelling on anything morbid.

188
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,759
I know you want to stop
these murders as much as I do.

189
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,555
Reasons for stopping multiple murders
do readily occur to me,

190
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,102
but I'm going to need something in return.

191
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,021
There are things you don't have?

192
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,647
I can talk to the chief of staff.

193
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,233
- Chilton?
- He's being very cooperative.

194
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,778
Of course he is.
He loves when I have visitors.

195
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,780
He's recording every word.

196
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,616
He's gossipy that way.

197
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,659
What do you want, Will?

198
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,246
I'm wondering
if you can get me the thing I really want.

199
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,915
Try me.

200
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,919
I want you to ignore
all the evidence against me.

201
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,798
You're right. I can't get that.

202
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,305
How many colors
will this killer add to his box of crayons?

203
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,018
Say I ignore the evidence against you.
What then?

204
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,312
Strike it from your mental record.

205
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,606
Start over.

206
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,317
If I'm guilty, you'll find more evidence.

207
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,320
If I'm not guilty, you'll maybe find that, too.

208
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,657
All right.

209
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,575
I'll keep looking.

210
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,495
Good.

211
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,956
Give me the file, I'll tell you what I think.

212
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,262
Do you mind if I do this privately?

213
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,638
Yes.

214
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,069
The skin isn't as discolored
as the other victims'.

215
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,990
Looks fairly well preserved,

216
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,575
all things considered.

217
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,702
Why would I throw you away?

218
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,088
Did Roland Umber
have priors with substance abuse?

219
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,467
He was in an outpatient treatment program
for drug addiction.

220
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,260
Heroin?

221
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,929
Among others.

222
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,558
He had a high tolerance for opiates.

223
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,810
The overdose didn't kill him.

224
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,522
He survived what was done to him.

225
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,568
He tore himself free.

226
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,115
He ran.

227
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,410
- How did he end up in the water?
- Killer didn't put him there.

228
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,455
He'd have put him back
in the mural if he caught him.

229
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,708
Other bodies were dumped,
Roland Umber got away.

230
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,085
Got away from where?

231
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,630
This killer, he needs someplace private
to do what he does.

232
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:02,426
A warehouse, a farm, someplace abandoned,
upstream from where the body was found.

233
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,511
It'll be close to the water.

234
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,847
Thank you.

235
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,853
I'm curious.

236
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,315
What did Hannibal Lecter have to say
about Mr. Umber?

237
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,486
He thinks the killer tore him down,
dumped his body like the others.

238
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,115
That may be what he said,

239
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,617
it's not necessarily what he thinks.

240
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,677
Hello.

241
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,473
I love your work.

242
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,036
However did you find this place?

243
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,540
You and Will Graham are a good team.

244
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,084
You gave us the "what" we were looking for,
he gave us the "where."

245
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,920
Corn dust on the craquelure.

246
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,964
Yes, Will and I do make a good team.

247
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,967
Will didn't think
Roland Umber was discarded, he escaped.

248
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,345
We just went upstream from where
the body was found until we hit corn.

249
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,561
Hey, Beverly.

250
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,728
Dr. Lecter.

251
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,149
Follow me, please.

252
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,693
You might want to prepare yourself.
You've never seen anything like this.

253
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,778
I'm sure I haven't.

254
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,843
How could a human being go so bad?

255
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,265
When it comes to nature versus nurture,
I choose neither.

256
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,811
We are built from a DNA blueprint

257
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,356
and born into a world of
scenario and circumstance we don't control.

258
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,693
Praise the mutilated world, huh?

259
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,321
What did it look like from above?

260
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,704
Fascinating.

261
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,123
Ritual human sacrifice.

262
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,461
I'm not sure if it's an offering,
but it's certainly a gesture.

263
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,545
To whom?

264
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,884
The eye looks beyond this world
into the next,

265
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,596
and sees the reflection of man himself.

266
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,933
Is the killer looking at God?

267
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,061
Maybe it's some sick existential crisis.

268
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,854
If it were an existential crisis,

269
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,525
I would argue there wouldn't be
any reflection in the eye at all.

270
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,819
A person who could do this kind of thing,
would they be likely

271
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,530
to continue doing it?

272
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,781
This could be his beginning.

273
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,076
And/or his end.

274
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,328
He may never kill again.

275
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,875
You said he doesn't see people,
that he sees material.

276
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,630
Those in the world around him
are a means to an end.

277
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,883
He uses them to do what he's driven to do.

278
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,262
Will Graham was a means to an end.

279
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:01,350
I used him to do what I was driven to do,
to save lives at the expense of his.

280
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,353
I thought whatever I could put him through,

281
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,522
he would be strong enough
to fight his way back to himself,

282
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,648
and I was wrong.

283
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,441
Maybe he's still fighting.

284
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,735
Maybe he's not.

285
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,406
Point is, you don't know.

286
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,033
It's okay not to know.

287
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,204
You can't know everything.
You can't be certain of it all.

288
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,373
Knowing that Will descended
into such savage behavior

289
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,418
has changed the way that I see him,

290
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,296
the way that I see other people.

291
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,464
The world feels much darker.

292
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,885
It's not just
the guilt of what I did to Will Graham,

293
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,015
it's the guilt of watching all these other
lives fall apart based on what I did.

294
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,808
- What did you do?
- I pushed him.

295
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,394
When I was warned to back off,
I kept pushing him.

296
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,563
- You miscalculated.
- I failed.

297
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,481
I failed.

298
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,780
We all fail, Jack.

299
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,995
I look at my friend and I see a killer.

300
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,665
I'm failing to reconcile those two things.

301
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,045
Forty-seven bodies.
We've identified 19 of them,

302
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,464
- but not this one.
- No record of fingerprints.

303
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,008
He was never arrested or in any kind of a job

304
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,761
that required any type of security
clearance or background check.

305
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,220
Hopefully he's been to a dentist.

306
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,473
Why am I looking at this man?

307
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,017
Stitch patterns on John Doe 21
match Roland Umber.

308
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,313
John Doe 21
is Roland Umber's replacement in the mural.

309
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,106
What happened to his leg?

310
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,193
Maybe the killer had to cut off his leg
just so he'd fit.

311
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,825
He changed colors mid-brushstroke.

312
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,335
What did Dr. Lecter say?

313
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,134
"The eye looks beyond this world
into the next,

314
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,470
"and sees a reflection of man himself."

315
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,437
There was never supposed
to be a reflection.

316
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,649
The killer's
having an existential crisis after all.

317
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,192
The question is,

318
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,861
how did he find his faith?

319
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,034
Hello, Doctor.

320
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,954
What can I help you with?

321
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,790
Closure.

322
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,294
I think perhaps this should,

323
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:21,091
or may have to be, our last conversation.

324
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,802
At least on the subject of Hannibal Lecter.

325
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,807
Are you pleading the Fifth?

326
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,851
No.

327
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:36,482
I simply can't offer you any more insight
than I already have.

328
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,818
Not accounting for future insight?

329
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:46,658
I feel it would be irresponsible
if I continue to see Dr. Lecter.

330
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,162
Irresponsible?

331
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,747
For who?

332
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,832
For me.

333
00:29:55,543 --> 00:30:00,798
I can only help Hannibal
if I'm feeling secure, emotionally.

334
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,385
I'm not feeling secure right now,

335
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,848
so I am recusing myself from the situation.

336
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,935
I hope you understand.

337
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,813
I'm not sure I do.

338
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:23,779
Hannibal and I were both traumatized
by dangerous patients.

339
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,992
Hannibal had his Will Graham,
and I had mine.

340
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,287
It has been a necessary,

341
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:37,835
albeit unpleasant, reminder
that I have unresolved issues.

342
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,754
Maybe Hannibal
can help you resolve these issues.

343
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,257
He is very good.

344
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:50,013
I am doing my best to avoid working
through my issues with Hannibal Lecter.

345
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,976
- Goodbye, Agent Crawford.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

346
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,480
Obviously, I cannot control
whether or not the FBI contacts me.

347
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,566
I can only tell you what I told Hannibal,

348
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,570
I prefer that you don't.

349
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,580
Now you're just taking advantage.

350
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,417
You're going to burn me out before my trial,
and then where will I be?

351
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,587
What would Jack say?

352
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:28,051
Jack's excellent administrative instincts
are not often tempered by mercy.

353
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,177
Clearly.

354
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,763
I'm devoting a lot of time to this mural, Will.

355
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,183
It's hard for me to focus on anything else
I've been tasked to do.

356
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,602
Could use your help.

357
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,866
In the 19th century, it was wrongly believed

358
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,535
that the last image seen
by the eyes of a dying person

359
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,037
would be fixed on the retina.

360
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,667
What would be the last image
fixed on this dying eye?

361
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,988
I made you pliable.

362
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,951
Molded you.

363
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,829
Set and sealed you where you lay.

364
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,333
This is my design.

365
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:46,004
A dead eye of vision

366
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,507
and consciousness.

367
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,344
I am fixed and unseeing.

368
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,434
Unless someone else sees me.

369
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,735
One of these things

370
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,072
is not like the others.

371
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,785
One of these things just doesn't belong.

372
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,207
Who are you?

373
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,631
Why are you so different
from everyone else?

374
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,758
I didn't put you here.

375
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:36,763
You are not my design.

376
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,169
Killing must feel good to God, too.

377
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,881
He does it all the time,

378
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,259
and are we not created in His image?

379
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,937
The killer is in the mural.

380
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,439
What do you mean? Literally?

381
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,526
I mean the man you're looking for
is sewn into his own mural, this man.

382
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,612
What happened to his leg?

383
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,032
Whoever sewed him in took a piece of him.

384
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,367
As a trophy.

385
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,955
He must have had a friend.

386
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,168
You're not alone, you know?

387
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,378
In The Resurrection,

388
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,215
Piero della Francesca
placed himself in the fresco.

389
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,716
Nothing flattering,

390
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,220
he depicted himself
as a simple guard asleep at his post.

391
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,019
Your placement
should be much more meaningful.

392
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,897
It's not finished.

393
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,273
I'm finishing it for you.

394
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,735
We'll finish it together.

395
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,991
When your great eye looked to the heavens,
what did it see?

396
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,327
Nothing.

397
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,871
Not anymore.

398
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,166
There is no God.

399
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,544
Certainly not with that attitude.

400
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,838
God gave you purpose,

401
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,758
not only to create art, but to become it.

402
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,970
Why are you helping me?

403
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,643
Your eye will now see God reflected back.

404
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,190
It will see you.

405
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,444
If God is looking down at you,
don't you want to be looking back at Him?

406
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,728
Will Graham.

407
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:36,234
Kade Prurnell, Office of
the Inspector General, FBI Oversight.

408
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,112
Am I still an FBI employee?

409
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,073
Or is that pending the outcome of my trial?

410
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,826
The point of the trial
isn't so much whether or not you did it,

411
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,787
it's whether or not you knew what
you were doing when you did it.

412
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,333
Sounds like I'm unemployed.

413
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:57,088
Dr. Bloom is hard at work
on your unconsciousness defense.

414
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,674
Yes, yes, the FBI made me do it.

415
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,301
The FBI made you a murderer.

416
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,137
Yes, that is Dr. Bloom's position.

417
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,973
As you can imagine, she's not popular.

418
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,433
What's your position?

419
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,187
Our point of view is that
you were already a murderer.

420
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,857
The prosecution will paint a picture of you

421
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,776
as an intelligent psychopath.

422
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,696
You conspired with your neurologist
to cultivate an illness

423
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,865
that would ultimately be your alibi.

424
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:29,120
And then I killed my neurologist
to broom the footprints behind me?

425
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,206
That's what everyone
in the courtroom will hear

426
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,417
when you take the stand,
regardless of what you say.

427
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,087
Well, what's to be done about that?

428
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,299
Let's discuss it.

429
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,849
If you plead guilty, you'll spare us all a trial.

430
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,396
And I personally will see to it
that you're comfortable here.

431
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,692
I'm pleading innocent.

432
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,737
You very publicly lost your mind,

433
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,656
some would argue theatrically.

434
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,284
The prosecution certainly will.

435
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,119
All part of the performance,

436
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,579
it's just not my performance
you're watching.

437
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,000
You'll be found guilty
and given the federal death penalty.

438
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,503
I'm trying to save your life.

439
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,716
I guess I'll have to save my own life.

440
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,429
I don't know you.

441
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,433
My name is Bedelia Du Maurier.

442
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,895
You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.

443
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,817
What's that like?

444
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,988
I've heard so much about you,
I feel I almost know you.

445
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,239
You don't?

446
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,949
No, I don't.

447
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,622
But I understand you better than I thought.

448
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,169
I wanted to meet you before I withdraw.

449
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,216
What are you withdrawing from?

450
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,927
Social ties.

451
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,556
Well, you're a psychiatrist. Isn't our sense
of self a consequence of social ties?

452
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,434
They certainly are in your case.

453
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,896
It may be small comfort,

454
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,025
but I am convinced Hannibal has done

455
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,237
what he honestly believes is best for you.

456
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,072
No, that isn't small comfort,

457
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,199
that would be no comfort.

458
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:16,704
The traumatized are unpredictable
because we know we can survive.

459
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,500
You can survive this happening to you.

460
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,755
Happening to me.

461
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,510
Stay behind the white line, ma'am!

462
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,723
Ma'am!

463
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,352
Step away from the bars.

464
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,979
Ma'am!

465
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,483
I believe you.

466
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,695
Come on, ma'am, let's go.

467
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,363
Step away.

468
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,913
And the conclusion that I've drawn

469
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,835
is that you are dangerous.
