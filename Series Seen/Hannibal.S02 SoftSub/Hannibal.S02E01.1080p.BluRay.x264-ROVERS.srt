1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,210
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,087
I hallucinated that I killed her.

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,839
Will Graham, you're under arrest for murder.

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,175
Four of the lures are made from
materials including human remains.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,177
According to the evidence...

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,929
I killed Abigail Hobbs.

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,848
I feel wounded.

8
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,850
I guess you dodged a bullet with me.

9
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,059
I kept pushing him

10
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,562
because he was saving lives.

11
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,355
I told you not to put him out there!

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,690
I didn't kill any of them.

13
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,193
And somebody is making sure
that no one believes me.

14
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,155
You catch these killers
by getting into their heads,

15
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,032
but you also allow them into your own.

16
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,576
- I'm trying to help you, Will.
- I know who I am.

17
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,910
I'm not so sure

18
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,829
that I know who you are anymore.

19
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,789
Are you a killer, Will?

20
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,915
Will.

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,879
- Hello, Will.
- Hello, Dr. Lecter.

22
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,111
This course is called Mukozuke.

23
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,362
Seasonal sashimi,

24
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,740
sea urchin, water clam, and squid.

25
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,035
What a beautiful presentation, Doctor.

26
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,829
Kaiseki.

27
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,122
A Japanese art form that honors

28
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,040
the taste and aesthetic of what we eat.

29
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,254
I almost feel guilty about eating it.

30
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,881
I never feel guilty eating anything.

31
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,643
I can't quite place the fish.

32
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,937
He was a flounder.

33
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,361
I last prepared this meal for my aunt,

34
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,738
Murasaki.

35
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,158
Under similarly unfortunate circumstances.

36
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,577
Well, what circumstances were those?

37
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,412
A loss.

38
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,208
This is a loss.

39
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,129
Will is a loss and we're mourning a death.

40
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,257
Will's death is on me, not you.

41
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,468
It's on both of us.

42
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,346
I can't stop thinking that Will
may be convicted of five murders

43
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,265
while I am only maybe convicted of one.

44
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,060
But you're not on trial.

45
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,188
I will be.

46
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,024
In the halls of the FBI.
And so will you.

47
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,362
I mean, according to Will Graham,
this was all you.

48
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,198
Will was your bloodhound.
You can't ignore where he points.

49
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,949
I'm not ignoring it.

50
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,790
You have to investigate me.
It's in my best interest and yours.

51
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,625
Yes, it is.

52
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,211
But I also can't ignore

53
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,713
the fact that my bloodhound went mad

54
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,423
before he pointed in your direction.

55
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,719
We can't define Will
only by his maddest edges.

56
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,599
We can't define Will at all.

57
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,381
What did you say?

58
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,218
I said, how does that make you feel?

59
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,389
That makes me feel like

60
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,726
I'm sitting in a dunking tank

61
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,189
and you're lobbing softballs,
hoping to make a splash,

62
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,441
but you keep missing the target.

63
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,068
Fortunately, I have time for a few more lobs.

64
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,070
You are in my hospital.

65
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,408
You're my patient now, Will.

66
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,454
I'm not talking to you, Frederick.

67
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,920
I want to talk to Dr. Lecter.

68
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,808
According to Dr. Bloom,

69
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,271
you were warned against putting someone
with Will Graham's issues into the field.

70
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,941
Yes. That's correct.

71
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,528
Were you aware that Dr. Bloom
would be filing this report?

72
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,281
Yes, she told me what she was going to do.

73
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,867
Did you advise her against it?

74
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,035
I told her she should do

75
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,204
whatever she felt was necessary.

76
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:46,251
Evidently, she felt it was necessary
to file the report.

77
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,087
These are allegations of misconduct.

78
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,714
It's damning stuff, Jack.

79
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,174
I never stated anywhere
that this was misconduct.

80
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,343
In my opinion, it was a lapse in judgment.

81
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,596
A lapse in judgment is misconduct.

82
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,641
There'll be an internal investigation.

83
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,518
There should be.

84
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,442
A federal examiner is someone
who arrives at a battlefield

85
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,320
after the battle and bayonets the wounded.

86
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,115
You have wounded Agent Crawford.

87
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,369
Who do you think
is gonna be getting the bayonet?

88
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,753
There is a general desire

89
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,630
to see this go away,

90
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,716
quickly and quietly.

91
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,801
In light of that, Dr. Bloom,

92
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,845
I would greatly appreciate it

93
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,181
if you would recant your report.

94
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,808
No. Will Graham's life has been destroyed.

95
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,478
How that happened
has to be a matter of record.

96
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,731
I'm sorry, Jack.

97
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,403
Dr. Bloom is not easily swayed.

98
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,240
This is going to get ugly.

99
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,493
It already has.

100
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,709
Was there a storm?

101
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,835
It looks like someone's

102
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,837
blasting beaver dams again.

103
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,922
Man!

104
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,971
It smells real bad down here!

105
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,390
Probably dead beavers!

106
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,704
Get me out of here!

107
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,708
Go!

108
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,135
Will Graham has asked to see me.

109
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,849
I would like to see him.

110
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,187
I continue to be curious
about the way he thinks,

111
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,982
despite all that's happened.

112
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,527
He's still influencing you.

113
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,948
Will Graham asking to see you

114
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,826
betrays his clear intent to manipulate you.

115
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,955
And if I agree to see Will?

116
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,251
It betrays your clear intent
to manipulate him.

117
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,922
I miss him.

118
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,136
You are obsessed with Will Graham.

119
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,516
I'm intrigued.

120
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,144
Obsessively.

121
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,773
And he will take advantage of that.

122
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,443
Will is my friend.

123
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,780
Why?

124
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,699
Why is he your friend?

125
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,039
He sees his own mentality
as grotesque but useful.

126
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,959
Like a chair of antlers.

127
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,587
He can't repress who he is.

128
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,173
There's an honesty in that I admire.

129
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,760
I imagine there's an honesty
in that you can relate to.

130
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,808
What can't you repress, Hannibal?

131
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,137
Hello, Will.

132
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,683
Dr. Lecter.

133
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,314
Lost in thought?

134
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,402
Not lost.

135
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,697
Not anymore.

136
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,453
I used to hear my thoughts inside my skull

137
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,455
with the same

138
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,041
tone,

139
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,209
timbre, accent,

140
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,004
as if the words were coming out
of my mouth.

141
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,465
And now?

142
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,384
Now...

143
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,848
My inner voice sounds like you.

144
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,730
I can't get you out of my head.

145
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,737
Friendship can sometimes involve
a breach of individual separateness.

146
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,614
You're not my friend.

147
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,911
The light from friendship won't reach us

148
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,995
for a million years.

149
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,331
That's how far away from friendship we are.

150
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,252
I imagine it's easier to believe
I am responsible for those murders

151
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,171
than it is to accept that you are.

152
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,756
Sure is.

153
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:34,641
Your inner voice can provide a method
of taking control of your behavior.

154
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,143
Accepting responsibility
for what you've done.

155
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,106
Giving your thoughts words
encourages clarity.

156
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,942
I have clarity.

157
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,654
About you.

158
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,241
Our conversations, Will,

159
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,286
were only ever about you opening your eyes
to the truth of who you are.

160
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,831
What you did to me

161
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,459
is in my head,

162
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,836
and I will find it.

163
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,177
I'm going to remember, Dr. Lecter.

164
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,596
And when I do,

165
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,058
there will be a reckoning.

166
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,147
I have huge faith in you, Will.

167
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,567
I always have.

168
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,813
I'm amazed what falls off the best of us
when moving through a room.

169
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,065
Lessons learned from cellular decay.

170
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,400
Enjoy the world while we have it

171
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,818
and give a little bit back.

172
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,862
When possible,
I try to leave an indelible mark

173
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,238
wherever I go.

174
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,240
Hopefully not with your DNA.

175
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,831
How long will you have my suits?

176
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,958
You might want to think about
supplementing your wardrobe.

177
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,044
I frequently do.

178
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,256
You know, this is just a formality.
Nobody expects to find anything.

179
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,592
Except for maybe Will Graham.

180
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,886
He'll have to be disappointed.

181
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,847
The beauty of what you do, Ms. Katz,

182
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,140
is in its certainty.

183
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,893
It'll be your evidence that convicts Will.

184
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,396
Well, I found enough of it.

185
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,442
No need to infer or intuit or trust.

186
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,944
So much simpler than psychiatry.

187
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,656
Will is doing his best
to understand where he is

188
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,325
and why.

189
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,079
You were supposed to protect him.

190
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,456
From himself?

191
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,874
Yeah.

192
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,794
I'm not mad at you.

193
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,420
Not anymore than I'm mad at myself.

194
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,298
We all missed it, whatever it was... Is.

195
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,384
We all are not suspects.

196
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,221
You're not a suspect,

197
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,056
you're the new Will Graham.

198
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,962
Thank you for coming, Dr. Lecter.

199
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,965
Jack, what can I do for you?

200
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,510
I was hoping you would help me
with the psychological profile.

201
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,637
We found another body.

202
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,099
This way, Doctor.

203
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,113
This is the fourth body
we've recovered so far.

204
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,198
There's at least one more down there.

205
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,491
How long have they been here?

206
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,994
Hard to say,
but someone went through a lot of trouble

207
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,662
to make sure that they were well preserved.

208
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,789
They've been coated in some kind of resin.

209
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,126
The big one was partially sealed,
rotting from the inside out.

210
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,919
The other three look like
they were embalmed.

211
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,048
Whatever he's doing,
he's still figuring out how to do it.

212
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,885
Were they injected with silicone?

213
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,013
They were injected with something.

214
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,097
Silicone?

215
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,267
A technique for making
resin-coated models out of fish.

216
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,395
Helps the body retain shape in death.

217
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,525
He's making human models.

218
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,195
You make models of things
that you want to keep.

219
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,654
These were tossed in the river.

220
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,408
Maybe they were imperfect.

221
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,621
These are his discards.

222
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,301
I'm giving you informed consent
to discuss me as your patient.

223
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,221
With whom?

224
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,805
Jack Crawford.

225
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,563
Disclosure of patient information
should be limited

226
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,316
to the requirements of the situation.

227
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,070
What is the situation, Hannibal?

228
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,574
Will Graham made accusations.

229
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,409
Jack's only being thorough.

230
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,081
You're keeping Agent Crawford close.

231
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,208
We share an obsession.

232
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,507
I got to be Will Graham today.

233
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,302
I consulted at an FBI crime scene.

234
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,766
I stood in Will's shoes,

235
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,936
looked through his eyes and I saw death.

236
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,692
How I imagined he would see it.

237
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,659
Why would you be inviting
the scrutiny of the FBI?

238
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,413
I'm being as open and honest
as I know how.

239
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,836
You maintain an air of transparency,

240
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,175
while putting me
in the position to lie for you.

241
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,468
Again.

242
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,389
You're not just lying for me.

243
00:21:56,064 --> 00:22:00,067
How far will this flirtation with the FBI go?

244
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:07,241
It would seem Jack Crawford
is less suspicious of me than you are.

245
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,952
Jack Crawford doesn't know
what you're capable of.

246
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,583
Neither do you.

247
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,097
Come on! Come on!

248
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,023
How are the dogs?

249
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,191
Good.

250
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,277
Well, Winston keeps running away,
but the others are adjusting.

251
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,154
Where does Winston go?

252
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,159
Home.

253
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,371
Well, he's not gonna find me there.

254
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,455
Not today.

255
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,209
But maybe someday he might.

256
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,710
With the right defense.

257
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,923
I don't currently have legal representation.

258
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,466
You keep firing your lawyers.

259
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,052
Yeah, they're the FBl's lawyers.

260
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,806
Then I'll find you a lawyer
who's not affiliated with the FBI.

261
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,438
What defense do you think I have?

262
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,066
Automatism.

263
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,569
Allows a defendant to argue
they shouldn't be held criminally liable

264
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,822
for their actions due to unconsciousness.

265
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,698
Unconsciousness?

266
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,825
Will,

267
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,246
your mind was on fire.

268
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,207
You had no control of what you were doing,

269
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,167
much less remember doing it.

270
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,711
What if I could remember?

271
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,509
What if I could remember
how this was done to me?

272
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,097
What if you could remember how you did it?

273
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,683
You believe Hannibal.

274
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,396
I believe the Will Graham
standing in front of me now

275
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,064
is incapable of that violence.

276
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,192
I believe you lost your mind,

277
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,696
and for periods of time,
you weren't the Will Graham I know.

278
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,739
I hear Hannibal's voice

279
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,784
in the well of my mind.

280
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,454
I hear him saying words
that he's never said to me.

281
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,498
It isn't my imagination. It's something else.

282
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,383
Have you ever helped
a patient recover memories?

283
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,396
Close your eyes.

284
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,740
Feel the heaviness in your limbs.

285
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,831
Imagine yourself in a safe

286
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,501
and relaxing place.

287
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,801
Safe to relax completely.

288
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,684
No matter how deeply you go

289
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,272
my voice will go with you.

290
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,778
This isn't working.

291
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,532
What did you see?

292
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,744
Will...

293
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,997
What did you see?

294
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,596
Salted and ash-baked celeriac

295
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,473
with foraged sel fou.

296
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,018
Frederick, you have tested me.

297
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,439
It's rare that I cook a meatless meal.

298
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,482
I lost a kidney.

299
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,276
I have to watch my protein intake.

300
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,612
You didn't lose it, Frederick.
It was taken from you.

301
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,948
I remain impressed with your recovery.

302
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,159
One can grow to love beets.

303
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,705
Alana Bloom

304
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,832
was visiting with your former patient today.

305
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,459
Will was never my patient.

306
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,337
The irony is that he is my patient,

307
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,714
but he refuses to speak to me.

308
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,801
Makes me feel like
I'm fumbling with his head

309
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,262
like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.

310
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,350
Will is going to be a challenge
for any psychiatrist.

311
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,602
He is so lucid, so perceptive.

312
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,480
He's trained in criminal psychology,

313
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,774
and he is a mass murderer.

314
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,567
He's a prize patient.

315
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,152
Or should be.

316
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,405
How was Dr. Bloom's visit?

317
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,367
He asked her to hypnotize him,

318
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,327
so he could recover his memories.

319
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,787
This is delicious.

320
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,792
Was he successful?

321
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,502
Only in playing Dr. Bloom.

322
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,047
It's sad to see a brilliant psychiatrist

323
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,216
fall for such hoary old chestnuts.

324
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,009
She wants to believe him.

325
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,094
I do too.

326
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,806
You do realize you're his favorite topic
of conversation.

327
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,516
Hannibal, Hannibal, Hannibal.

328
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,558
Not with me, of course.

329
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,477
But with everyone else who'll listen.

330
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,480
He tells everyone that you are a monster.

331
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,277
Well, in that case, you are dining
with a psychopathic murderer, Frederick.

332
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,975
You have nice skin.

333
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,950
Dental and medical records

334
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,117
placed the six.

335
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,744
All adults, both men and women,

336
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,205
different ages, different ethnicities,
all from different states.

337
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,289
Nothing in common

338
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,917
except they all disappeared
from their homes with their vehicles.

339
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,670
And they all had large amounts
of heroin in their systems.

340
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,088
Enough to be the cause of death?

341
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,923
And then some.

342
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,343
What's this strange
skin discoloration on these bodies?

343
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,513
We found traces of BHT,
which is a color preservative.

344
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,432
He wants them to look alive.

345
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,476
Shot them up with a little China white,

346
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,061
injected them with preservatives,

347
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,273
then filled the bodies
with silicone so they don't emaciate.

348
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,024
Then he seals them

349
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,193
with, like, a hard resin shell.

350
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,321
What are these puncture wounds?

351
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,156
Those are like eyelets.

352
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,869
Something was threaded through.
They were strung up, mounted, presented.

353
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,120
So how's he choosing them?

354
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,454
We got nothing.

355
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,831
Appears to be random,

356
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,542
but if this is the discard pile,

357
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,045
I'm curious to know
how many were keepers.

358
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,589
All right, I want a list
of any missing persons

359
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:27,009
that disappeared along with their vehicles
in the neighboring states.

360
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,135
Got it?

361
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,303
Got it.

362
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,526
It's good to see you.

363
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,155
Don't know how I feel about seeing you.

364
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,364
I'll let you know when I do.

365
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,658
Does Jack know you're here?

366
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,619
No, but he shouldn't be surprised.

367
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,621
I'm surprised.

368
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,458
I'm compartmentalizing.

369
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,586
There are a lot of people missing.

370
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,682
- You have the file with you?
- Yes.

371
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,354
And pictures?

372
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,898
Yes.

373
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,150
The first six bodies

374
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,485
were found in the same place.

375
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,820
Dumped in a river, caught in a beaver dam.

376
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,742
What does he do to them?

377
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:38,246
He targets them, follows them home,
abducts them and preserves them.

378
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,375
You want to know
how he's choosing them, don't you?

379
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,211
I thought you would have some ideas.

380
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,674
These are DMV pictures
of people who are still missing

381
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,717
under similar circumstances

382
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,095
from three different states.

383
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,433
Tell me what you see.

384
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,441
It's a color palette.

385
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,241
Hi, Winston.

386
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,952
Come here, boy. There you go.

387
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,499
I suppose you blame me too?

388
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,470
Hello, Jack.

389
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,479
You need to take better care of this dog.

390
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,607
I feel horrible.

391
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,902
I got all the dogs chipped,

392
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,155
but at least they're not running away
to anywhere I can't find them.

393
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
He's just looking for Will.

394
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,576
Yeah.

395
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,204
Isn't that why you're here?

396
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,458
Listen...

397
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,796
I understand why you felt
you had to file that report.

398
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,216
You questioned my judgment
when it needed to be questioned.

399
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,093
Yes, it did.

400
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,764
And it will help in Will's defense
if it's in the record.

401
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,477
Declaring Hannibal's guilt
is more important to Will

402
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,187
than establishing his own defense.

403
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,356
Hannibal's not guilty.

404
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,733
Neither is Will.

405
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,777
But he's clinging to the hope

406
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,030
Hannibal did this so
he doesn't have to face what he did.

407
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,618
Convince me he didn't know
what he was doing.

408
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,122
I would really like to be convinced, Alana.

409
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,667
A psychopath wouldn't be
so scared of the truth, Jack.

410
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:20,839
Will's terrified, but that's not
stopping him from trying to find it.

411
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,174
Somebody's got to find the truth, Winston?

412
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,554
If Will doesn't remember what he did,

413
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,057
he'll never accept the truth.

414
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,572
Will?

415
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,451
Will?

416
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,914
Hey, Will.

417
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,378
Hi, Jack.

418
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,589
Where were you just now?

419
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,924
Gone fishing.

420
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,427
What are you doing here?

421
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,972
I needed to remind myself
of who you once were.

422
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,557
You know, that man

423
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,435
whose classroom I walked into months ago.

424
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,312
I remember that man.

425
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,399
Memories are all I have.

426
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,781
Imagine how nice it is
to stumble on a new one.

427
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,328
I was

428
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,997
almost certain

429
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,707
Hannibal Lecter did this to me.

430
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,001
And it's a funny thing, doubt.

431
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,714
I had nothing to prove to myself
or anyone else

432
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,051
that Hannibal was responsible
not even a memory.

433
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,596
You have something now?

434
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,723
You've recovered a memory?

435
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,849
Yes.

436
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,602
That's meaningless.

437
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,396
Not to me.

438
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,358
He did it so well.

439
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,613
There wasn't an orgy of evidence.

440
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,990
There was just enough to convince you.

441
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,828
We investigated your claims
about Dr. Lecter, Will,

442
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,912
thoroughly.

443
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:19,124
We went over every fiber
of every stitch of clothing.

444
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,500
We took his DNA.

445
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,419
We took his fingerprints.

446
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,504
We found nothing.

447
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,423
You let the fox into the henhouse.

448
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,007
You stood over
Cassie Boyle's body in that field

449
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,009
and you described yourself to me.

450
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,178
No, I described Hannibal Lecter.

451
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,514
I can't hear this anymore.

452
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,769
I am not the intelligent psychopath
you are looking for.

453
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,318
Goodbye, Will.

454
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,908
You may not believe me now.

455
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,620
You will.
