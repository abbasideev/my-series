1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,585
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,712
We're just alike.

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,839
This gives you the capacity to deceive me

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,549
and be deceived by me.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,595
Have you been firing a gun?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,222
I told you, I was feeling paranoid.

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,766
All I want to do is catch him.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,809
He's given me nothing.

9
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,936
I know what to expect from lung cancer.

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:25,357
And there will be a time
when there is nothing you can do.

11
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,317
No.

12
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,444
What are you up to?

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,695
I want you to come with me.

14
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,156
Alana Bloom isn't harboring any doubts.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,491
She's convinced
that he murdered Freddie Lounds.

16
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,617
How was my funeral?

17
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,994
We're going to get caught.

18
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,246
Jack already suspects
you killed Freddie Lounds.

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,622
That means he suspects you.

20
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,790
I know.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,167
You should give him what he wants.

22
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,502
Give him the Chesapeake Ripper?

23
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,964
Dr. Hannibal Lecter, requests the pleasure
of my company for dinner.

24
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,015
You sit in that chair, Will,
as you have so many times before.

25
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,146
It holds among its molecules
the vibrations of

26
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,650
all our conversations
ever held in its presence.

27
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,987
All the exchanges,

28
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,700
the petty irritations,

29
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,162
deadly revelations,

30
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,333
flat announcements of disaster.

31
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,129
The grunts and poetry of life.

32
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,298
Everything we've ever said.

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,676
Listen.

34
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,180
What do you hear?

35
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,855
A melody.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,525
We're orchestrations of carbon.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,863
You and me.

38
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,368
And Jack.

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,414
And Jack.

40
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,379
All our destinies flying and swimming
in blood and emptiness.

41
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,554
Everybody's settling in for dinner.

42
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,265
I'm wearing a wire.

43
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,476
I have sharp shooters on the roofs
of neighboring houses

44
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,062
with lines of sight to all the windows.

45
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,775
He'll try to kill you in the kitchen,
for convenience.

46
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,779
Make it easier to prepare the tartar.

47
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,203
Jack won't be easy to kill.

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,623
He'll be armed.

49
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,585
He's strong, well-trained.

50
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,006
We can't hesitate.

51
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,260
Hannibal thinks you are his man
in the room.

52
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,764
I think you're mine.

53
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,311
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes running.

54
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,605
But not to help.

55
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,402
When you hear Jack scream,
why will you come running?

56
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,618
When the moment comes...

57
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,578
When the moment comes...

58
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,834
...will you do what needs to be done?

59
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,301
Oh, yes.

60
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,167
See?

61
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,586
See?

62
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,160
Forgiveness is such a profound,

63
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:15,749
conscious and unconscious state of affairs.

64
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,254
You can't actually choose to do it.

65
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,967
It simply happens to you.

66
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,932
Does forgiveness happen to you?

67
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,105
I died.

68
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,944
I'm between deaths.

69
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,827
The punctuation at the end of a sentence
gives meaning to every word.

70
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,372
Every space that preceded it.

71
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,503
You moved my punctuation mark, Dr. Lecter.

72
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,634
You moved my meaning.

73
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,625
I'm not here because I want to be.

74
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,712
You saw to that.

75
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,173
I'm here

76
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,553
because I can't abandon Jack.

77
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,391
Not again.

78
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:03,482
Love and death are the great hinges
on which all human sympathies turn.

79
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,114
What we do for ourselves dies with us.
What we do for others, that's beyond us.

80
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,991
You saved me for Jack.

81
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,459
Will you save him, for me,

82
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,463
when I'm gone?

83
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,308
I'm going to enjoy my resurrection.

84
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,479
Nothing sells better than a survival story.

85
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,732
I wouldn't count us as survivors
just yet, Freddie.

86
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,318
I'm counting me as a survivor.

87
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,489
I started as a cancer editor
at a supermarket tabloid.

88
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,618
Cancer is very lucrative media.

89
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,245
Ain't that the truth?

90
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,414
"New Cures for Cancer"
"Cancer Miracle Cure."

91
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,168
We're all desperate for a little hope.

92
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,803
I want to ask you
to do something for me, Freddie.

93
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,597
Or rather, don't.

94
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,938
Don't write about Abigail.

95
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,568
You can write about me.

96
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,779
You can write about Hannibal.

97
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,783
But leave Abigail alone.

98
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,167
You really don't know
if you're going to survive him, do you?

99
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,131
Just let her rest in peace.

100
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,992
These are your notes on me.

101
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,871
So they are.

102
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,791
Won't your patients need these
after you're gone?

103
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,295
The FBI will pore over my notes
if I left them intact.

104
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,173
I will spare my patients the scrutiny.

105
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,552
I'm dismantling who I was
and moving it brick by brick.

106
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,312
When we have gone from this life,

107
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,440
Jack Crawford and the FBI behind us,

108
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,944
I will always have this place.

109
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,987
In your memory palace?

110
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,284
My palace is vast,
even by medieval standards.

111
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,913
The foyer is the Norman Chapel in Palermo.

112
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:53,420
Severe, beautiful and timeless,
with a single reminder of mortality.

113
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,424
A skull, graven in the floor.

114
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,434
All I need is a stream.

115
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,523
In those moments when
you can't overcome your surroundings,

116
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,776
you can make it all go away.

117
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,528
Put my head back,

118
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,280
close my eyes,

119
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,616
wade into the quiet of the stream.

120
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,751
If I'm ever apprehended,

121
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:37,046
my memory palace will serve
as more than a mnemonic system.

122
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,298
I will live there.

123
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,803
Could you be happy there?

124
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,975
All the palace chambers are not lovely,
light and bright.

125
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,271
In the vaults of our hearts and brains,
danger waits.

126
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,025
There are holes in the floor of the mind.

127
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,398
In the few jerky seconds of sleep I do get,

128
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:26,656
all I see is dark,
swarming behind my eyelids.

129
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,829
I dream darkness comes into me.

130
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,500
It comes and it's insidious.

131
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,547
Up my nose, into my ears.

132
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,764
I feel poisoned.

133
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,190
We've all been poisoned.

134
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,946
You saw what no one else could.

135
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,622
All it took was the traumatic.

136
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,835
We're still in the thick of it.

137
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,133
We're getting through the worst of it.

138
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,730
You've set some sort of trap
and you're goading Hannibal into it.

139
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,237
How can you be sure he's not goading you?

140
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,285
I can't.

141
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,996
Do you know what an imago is, Will?

142
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,040
It's a flying insect.

143
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,546
It's the last stage of a transformation.

144
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,049
When you become who you will be?

145
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,471
It's also a term from the
dead religion of psychoanalysis.

146
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,936
An imago is an image of a loved one,
buried in the unconscious,

147
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,982
carried with us all our lives.

148
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,817
An ideal.

149
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,446
The concept of an ideal.

150
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,036
I have a concept of you,
just as you have a concept of me.

151
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,080
Neither of us ideal.

152
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,799
Both of us are too curious
about too many things for any ideals.

153
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,559
Is it ideal that Jack die?

154
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,775
It's necessary.

155
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,654
What happens to Jack
has been preordained.

156
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,622
We could disappear now.

157
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,874
Tonight.

158
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,172
Feed your dogs,

159
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,510
leave a note for Alana
and never see her or Jack again.

160
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,515
Almost polite.

161
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,188
Then this would be our last supper.

162
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,320
Of this life.

163
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,324
I served lamb.

164
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,159
Sacrificial.

165
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,497
I don't need a sacrifice.

166
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,667
Do you?

167
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,547
I need him to know.

168
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,054
If I confess to Jack Crawford right now...

169
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,852
I would forgive you.

170
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,482
If Jack were to tell you all is forgiven,

171
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,195
would you accept his forgiveness?

172
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,538
Jack isn't offering forgiveness.

173
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,794
He wants justice.

174
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,799
He wants to see you.

175
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,387
See who you are.

176
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,348
See what I've become.

177
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,482
He wants the truth.

178
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,457
To the truth, then.

179
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,128
And all its consequences.

180
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,981
This is entrapment, Jack.

181
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,318
You can't entrap someone
into committing premeditated murder.

182
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,112
Yes, you can. You're doing it.

183
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:45,409
You conspired to violate
Dr. Lecter's property and personal rights.

184
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,872
And for the record,
the only one involved in this investigation

185
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:54,293
we can confirm actually having
killed someone is Will Graham.

186
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,046
It was self-defense.

187
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,970
Hannibal Lecter is being induced
to commit murder

188
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,515
by an undercover FBI informant.

189
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,310
This is outrageous government conduct.

190
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,439
You would never get a conviction.
You're not thinking clearly, Jack.

191
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,485
We are as close as we are ever going to get
to catching this man.

192
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,908
I understand that your wife is very ill.

193
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,869
You're distracted.

194
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,498
After an inquiry, I'm putting you
on forced compassionate leave.

195
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,109
This is just staggering.

196
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,449
What are you going to do
about Hannibal Lecter?

197
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,284
What Jack should have done.

198
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,455
We've frozen his passport
and we're getting a search warrant.

199
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,665
Hannibal already opened his doors
to the FBI.

200
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,542
There won't be physical evidence.

201
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,212
The only way to catch him is in the act.

202
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,216
Are you saying we should have
just let Jack hang himself?

203
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,051
And everyone else in his department?

204
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,222
No. But Will and Jack are still
your best chance to catch Hannibal.

205
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,269
This man that Will Graham
killed in self-defense,

206
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,148
he was mutilated.

207
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:25,319
At a certain point, self-defense stops.
Will Graham didn't stop.

208
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,533
Jack Crawford sanctioned this
and then he hid it from us.

209
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:37,790
I have to believe that Will was trying
to maintain his cover identity.

210
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,960
Reality doesn't go away
because you stop believing in it.

211
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,087
It's stubborn like that.

212
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,713
The reality of this situation

213
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,842
is Jack Crawford misused
the power of his office.

214
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,762
Miss. Prurnell, they are desperate.

215
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,517
They are breaking the law.

216
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,981
I'm bringing these men up on charges.

217
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,484
They're not going to stop.

218
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,113
That's why they're being
brought into custody.

219
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,700
Jack knows what you'll find.
He knows what you have to do.

220
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,162
That won't stop him
from doing what he has to do.

221
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,064
- Hello?
- It's Alana. Is Jack with you?

222
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,858
No.

223
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,067
Why?

224
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,489
They've issued a warrant
for your arrest, Will.

225
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,035
For acting as an accessory to entrapment.

226
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,041
And for the murder of Randall Tier.

227
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,920
They're going to arrest Jack as well.

228
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,508
Will?

229
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,677
Goodbye, Alana.

230
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,736
Hello?

231
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,449
They know.

232
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,438
Hello, Jack.

233
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,232
You're early.

234
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,360
I couldn't wait to get here.

235
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,198
Would you care to sous-chef?

236
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,580
I want to thank you
for your friendship, Hannibal.

237
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,672
The most beautiful quality
of a true friendship is to understand

238
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,301
and be understood with absolute clarity.

239
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:45,644
Then this is
the clearest moment of our friendship.

240
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,230
I'd like to report gunshots.

241
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,000
Hannibal.

242
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,130
Hannibal!

243
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,141
Where's Jack?

244
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,644
In the pantry.

245
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,486
I was hoping you and I
wouldn't have to say goodbye.

246
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,156
Nothing seen nor said.

247
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,286
You may have found that rude.

248
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,829
Stop!

249
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,169
I was so blind.

250
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,925
In your defense,
I worked very hard to blind you.

251
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,511
You can stay blind.

252
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,515
You can hide from this.

253
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,185
Walk away.

254
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,271
I'll make no plans to call on you.
But if you stay,

255
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,607
I will kill you.

256
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,492
Be blind, Alana. Don't be brave.

257
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,508
I took your bullets.

258
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,934
I found more bullets!

259
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,171
Abigail?

260
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,799
I'm so sorry.

261
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,372
This is Will Graham.
I need ERT at 5 Chandel Square.

262
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,584
Jack is inside.

263
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,385
Go.

264
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,310
Abigail?

265
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,984
I didn't know what else to do,
so I just did what he told me.

266
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,990
Where is he?

267
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,632
You were supposed to leave.

268
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,474
We couldn't leave without you.

269
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,591
Time did reverse.

270
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,095
The teacup that I shattered
did come together.

271
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,226
The place was made for Abigail
in your world.

272
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,730
Do you understand?

273
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,360
That place was made for all of us, together.

274
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,576
I wanted to surprise you.

275
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,914
And you,

276
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,210
you wanted to surprise me.

277
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,888
I let you know me.

278
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,601
See me.

279
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,938
I gave you a rare gift.

280
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,777
- But you didn't want it.
- Didn't I?

281
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,448
You would deny me my life.

282
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,410
No. No. Not your life, no.

283
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,121
My freedom then.
You would take that from me.

284
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,584
Confine me to a prison cell.

285
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,763
Do you believe you could change me,
the way I've changed you?

286
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,724
I already did.

287
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,112
Fate and circumstance
have returned us to this moment

288
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,825
when the teacup shatters.

289
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,125
I forgive you, Will.

290
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,089
Will you forgive me?

291
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,091
Don't.

292
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,510
Don't.

293
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,103
Abigail, come to me.

294
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,698
No, no, no!

295
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,507
You can make it all go away.

296
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,843
Put your head back.

297
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,638
Close your eyes.

298
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,518
Wade into the quiet of the stream.

299
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,976
Hello? Jack.
