So you don't wanna date?

366
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,226
Right.

367
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,980
But you don't wanna not date.

368
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,273
Right.

369
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:52,320
Essentially, you wanna not not date.

370
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,699
I think so.

371
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,117
But...

372
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,662
you wanna not not date anyone else?

373
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:02,789
No.

374
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,333
(CHUCKLES)

375
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,128
I mean...

376
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,423
Yeah, I'm...

377
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:13,675
I'm down with that.

378
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:15,969
Cool.

379
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:18,680
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
You want cheese in yours?

380
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,848
Duh!

381
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,893
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
Uh, you can just turn that off.

382
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,978
Yeah, I think I will.

00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,231
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
Jesus.

384
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,942
How did you get so many matches on this?

385
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:32,861
I'm a catch.

386
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:33,945
Obviously.

387
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,531
No, you wanna know my secret?

388
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
Yes, please.

389
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,576
Uh, I just...

390
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,788
I think about the kinda tale
I wanna land, right?

391
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,082
And then I just sort of

392
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:48,960
cater my profile to the customer.

393
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,005
Sorry, like, you make stuff up, or...

394
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,551
Uh, I mean, it's more like,
I just sort of tell them

395
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,345
what they wanna hear,
then they come to you.

396
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,973
Have I ever volunteered
at an animal shelter?

397
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,808
I mean, no,

398
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,935
but I don't want them gassed either.

399
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,856
And once you figure it out,
it's like shooting fish in a barrel.

400
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,525
And I'm no, like, coder,

401
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,570
but I don't want some algorithm telling me
who I should be with.

402
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,240
Ooh!
Oaxacan street corn.

403
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:21,242
Um, Dad hates that cheese.

404
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,952
She is not wrong.

405
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,038
I'll make coleslaw.

406
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,624
Then, after dinner, you and Stan can be
on the same team.

407
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,753
For what?
Scattergories.

408
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,298
Wait, now we're doing a game night?

409
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,050
We just need to be normal
around each other.

410
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,135
We've never played Scattergories.

411
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:40,887

412
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,141
You guys, I can get us into that office.

413
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,687
We've been using my hoo-ha all wrong.

414
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,611
Hey, Sara, how are you?

415
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,114
It's a little late
for you to be up, isn't it?

416
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,449
Well, my bedtime's not
for another two hours.

Go to your room.

418
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,503
What?

(LAUGHS) I can't believe
I finally met a girl who butt chugs.

420
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,969
Well, how else are you gonna
pound a White Claw?

421
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,263
Cheers.

422
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,435
So what did you major in at Michigan?

423
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,187
Oh, um, science.

424
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,106
God, how did you get through organic chem?

425
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:37,235
I just really love organic stuff.

426
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,987
It's actually pretty easy at Whole Foods.

429
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,956
You know, most girls are
turned off by my profile.

You're kidding me. Why?

431

The get all uptight about
the hating kids stuff.

432

I! mean, kids suck.

433
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,631

To not remembering anything
tomorrow morning.

437
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,183
I will drink to that.

438
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,481

They go down easier the more you do 'em.

441
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:28,203
Oh, no, uh, I'm just...
I'm cold.

442
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,413
Should've brought a jacket.

443
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:34,083
Wanted you to, uh, have the full picture.

444
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,961
Appreciate it.

445
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:39,589
Now that you've had a preview...

446
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,134
Can I borrow yours?

447
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,260
Seriously?

448
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,346

449
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,183
Fine.

adding a jacket to the uniform,

You have a Campaign to win.

724
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,147
And then, when we're done,

725
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,816
you roll me up in a carpet for trash day?

726
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,610
Relax. Please.

727
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,695
No, that's not my style.

728
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:48,408
I'm more the guy that
makes things difficult.

729
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,036
I Know people, right?

730
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,373
You got a husband
that's facing a long stretch.

731
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:57,501
Sister's got a record.
I mean, those two are low-hanging fruit.

732
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:59,211
And there's no way that

733
00:38:59,294 --> 00:39:01,713
that friend of yours can pay for
her son's private school.

734
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,258
That's just a quick call to state,
get her tax returns.

735
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,342
You know how that goes.

736
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:09,388
Yeah, can't let you off that easy, Beth.

737
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,139
You have a lot of work to do.

738
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,893
(ACOUSTIC FOLK SONG PLAYING)

739
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,357
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Stop. Right there.

740
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,276
Zug Island Holdings.

741
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,360
DAVE: Where does it go?

742
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,701
Romeo Pipe Fitters
and B and J Construction.

743
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,705
Could make a case from the numbers that
it's padded for kickbacks.

744
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,582
But none of it goes back to him.

745
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,417
Just leave it on the table, man.

746
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,796
Beth wanted to, you know,
make sure you guys still had it, so...

747
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,010
That's a lot of slaw, bruh.
It's the half of what she made.

748
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,178
(CHUCKLES)

749
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,847

750
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:37,059
Listen, man, I'm sorry...

(MUSIC STOPS)

752
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,945
We're in a cult, dude.

753
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:49,988
Yeah, they got us good.

754
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,328
(SIGHS)

755
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,582
You wanna...
You wanna take the brotherhood down?

756

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

757
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:36,493
Now you're knocking?

758
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:38,286
You said to.

759
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,288
(SCOFFS) When have
you ever listened to me?

760
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,957
Nah, don't be like that.

761
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,250
What do you want?

762
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:47,504
I'll take an apology.

763
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,799
What did I do now?

764
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:52,426
You hurt my feelings.

765
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:54,219
How's that?

766
00:41:58,056 --> 00:42:00,684
If you need something,
darlin', all you gotta do is ask.

767
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,688
He's your brother.

768
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,148
Cousin.

769
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,816
Family.

770
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,279
He's in our way.
