Yeah, neither are you.

we're going to turn this around.

I thought he was the problem.

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,315
He's just the excuse.

13

546
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,790
All right.

547
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,083
Good to go.

548
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,344
It's like, no biggie at all.

549
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,138
Well, we really appreciate it.

550
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:16,973
Anything to help a friend.

551
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,601
But we're going to need
our expenses covered.

552
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,104
I thought this was a favor.

554
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:25,815
And what expenses?

555
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:29,652
You know, the car is super heavy,
so it uses more gas.

556
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,320
Okay. Can we just do this already?

557
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:33,281
Okay.
How much?

558
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:34,991
5%.

559
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,164
Of what?

560
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,124
Um, just, like whatever's in the cooler.

561
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,502
That's not our money.

562
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:48,171
It's not our problem.

563
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,215
BETH: Ok... Okay.

564
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:52,633
Okay.

565
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,261
5%.

00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,846
(SCOFFS)

567
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:01,893
How are we going to give them 5% of a cut
we don't even have?

568
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,187
How are we going to drop a cooler
that we don't have?

569
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,980
I don't like this SUV.

570
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,567
BETH: Why?
'Cause it's silver?

571
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,987
Because it hasn't moved.

572
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,572
It is a parking lot.

573
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:17,784
Let's roll, bitches!

00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:20,828
DEAN: How bad Is it?

575
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,288
Remember Payne Stewart?

576
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,582
Isn't he a golfer?

577
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,125
Try US Open champion.

578
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,585
Okay.

579
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,128
He's up in his private jet, right?

580
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:31,047
On top of the world.

581
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,716
Tower loses communication.

582
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:36,427
So they scramble
some F-16s to check it out.

583
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,764
It turns out, the hull was breached.

584
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:43,518
Everyone inside was sound asleep
from no oxygen.

585
00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:47,480
So what did they do?

586
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,983
Plane's on autopilot, just cruising.

587
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,236
All they gotta do...

588
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:56,447
is wake up.

589
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,120
And what happened?

590
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,082
After three and a half hours,
it runs out of fuel.

591
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,501
And they crash into a cornfield
in South Dakota.

592
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,214
Jesus.

593
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,300
That's not going to be you.

594
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,927
I already pled guilty.
I know.

595
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,637
And they want to move the trial date up.

596
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:21,347
Yeah.
So...

597
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,599
How do I not end up in the cornfield?

598
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,852
VANCE: Her.

599
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,230
It's not an option.

600
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,191
So are you the one printing fake money?

601
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,985
I already know where you're going
with this.

602
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,820
Cooking the books, committing wire fraud?

603
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm not going to turn on my wife.

604
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:38,364
She did it.

605
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,033
I have kids.
So?

606
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:42,702
They need their mother.

607
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,787
Oh.

608
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,747
Okay.

609
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,378
So, what's Plan B?

610
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,005
Who taught them how to ride their bikes?

611
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,381
I mean, I did.

612
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:58,426
Who taught your son how to do a slapshot?

613
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,764
Worked on that for months.

614
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,058
Who built the tree house
in your backyard?

615
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:11,314
I bet they'd say
all that stuff is pretty important, too.

616
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,736
There's no plan B, man.

617
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,487
Come on, you guys.

618
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,114

620
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:24,952

Wasn't our plan, either.
