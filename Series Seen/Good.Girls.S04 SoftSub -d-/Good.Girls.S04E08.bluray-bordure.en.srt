Yeah.

365
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:12,799
How about the splits?

366
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:15,135
Okay, we're trying to do some
business here.

367
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,390

369
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,980
Throw this in the microwave, would you?

370
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:29,482
MERCEDES: How long?
Baked potato, 30 seconds.

371
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:38,950
Looks like a fair amount.

372
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,702
Twice as much as he owes you.

373
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,954
Must really be worth it.

374
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,873
The best.

375
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,291
The greatest.

376
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:47,751
I agree.

377
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,338
Great. We have a deal.

No.

You can't replace the greatest.

380
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,769
Fine. What's your number?

381
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,688
It's not possible.
Triple?

382
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,940
Serious flex.

00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,359

Got dolla', dolla' bills.

386
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,158
Where do a bunch of bitches
like you get a bunch of money
like this, though? Huh?

387
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,327
Oh, now you've got a moral code?

388
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,373
I just don't do business
with bitches. That's all.

389
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,460
I'll take it upstairs, baby doll.

BETH: That guy's a giant turd.

392
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,848
What?
Nothing.

393
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,351
I just have never
heard you say the word "turd" before.

394
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,852
Well, he is.

395
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,021
Way more than that.
He's a giant piece of...

396
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,107
Do you think he knew the money was fake?

397
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,192
That turd just gets off

398
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,485
on keeping a good man down.

399
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,781
Okay.

400
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,283
So we break into his car

401
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,661
and we load up the trunk.

402
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,455
How's that get it in the club?

403
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,711
Well, he parks it
right outside, in his spot.

404
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,462
Then Rizzoli and Isles know it's a setup,

405
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,005
because of the lojack or whatever.

Ladies.

407
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,136
What if we just mailed a box of fake dough

408
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,470
to the club?

409
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,555
ANNIE: Ladies?
No, because then we're gonna

410
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:24,723
get busted for mail fraud

What?

415
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:34,983
The problem-solving principle that says

416
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,276
that entities should not be multiplied

417
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,027
without necessity?
Come on.

She gets her GED
and now she's Stephen Hawking?

419
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:47,954
ANNIE: Sometimes,

420
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:51,458

Thank you.
Yeah.

Fine, yes, it's a sack,
