Not anywhere he says he is.

to leave any cash around?

00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:36,409
Okay.

435
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,794
Well, I guess you could say
for protection.

What do you want me to do?

441
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,105
Maybe shoot her a quick call?

442
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:07,899
Sure.

443
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:10,026
Yeah, I'll just have the nurse
hold up the phone

444

to her dialysis machine,
and you can shake it down.

"diaper cream."

There are two.

00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,935
Why?

547
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:03,105
Because I left a child with a child.

548
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,108
Okay. Almost.

I guess just to know I could.
