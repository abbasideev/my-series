00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,297
BETH: Previously on Good Girls...

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,258
GENE: A few weeks ago,
that thing with the bank truck
burning up,

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,426
crazy how much it cost me.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,553
I can't do another one.
I have a wife.

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:13,721
Oh, the bitch who stole my money?

6
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:16,516
STAN: Convince women these are real,

7
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,808
you get 10 times the money.

8
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,228
He didn't know any women
who could afford a real one.
And we do?

9
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:21,479
We might have to find them.

10
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:23,606
We could send him to private school,
St. Anne's.

11
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:24,690
Did you see the game?

12
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,109
Dude, you were so good.
You scored, like, 20 goals.

13
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,486
I at least want my husband out.

14
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:29,862
Not until we know where the money goes.

15
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,822
I made a deal to get you out.

16
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,324
(DOOR BUZZES)

17
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,159
What did he make you do this time?

18
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,327
It's not him.

19
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,662
Do you want this over or not?

20
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:38,746
What if he finds it?

21
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,956
DAVE: Improvise.

22
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,958
Grandma loves Grisham.

23
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:53,928
Let me ask you all something.

24
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,475
What are we doing here?

25
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:07,900
Like, right now?

26
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,153
I mean this operation.

27
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:15,908
Yes, you.

28
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:19,412
Trying to get the bad guy.

29
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:20,913
Ah, how?

30
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,041
Yes, yes, go ahead.

31
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,751
Uh, by following the money.

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,088
And what would get in the way of that?

33
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,383
Um...

34
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:37,179
If you don't what?

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,431
We don't...

36
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,516
If you don't...

37
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,684
Show up on time?

38
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,271
'Cause today we got here before you did.

39
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:46,606
No, no, uh-uh.

40
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:50,901
If you don't tell us...

41
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,741
That you're screwing the target.

42
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,076
(GASPS)

43
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,913
Yeah. Why didn't you tell us?

44
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,416
Um, because I'm not?

45
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,543
Your wire would disagree.

46
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:12,798
Okay.

47
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,635
I'm not screwing anyone, all right?

48
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:18,638
Except your friends,
if you want to keep this deal.

49
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,806
You did it with him again, dude?

50
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,350
Not it.

51
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,434
Then what?

52
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,062
You know, the other thing.

53
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,522
Did it involve your vagina?

54
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,899
Sort of.

55
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,193
And his penis?

56
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:33,569
No.

57
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,946
So his, um...

58
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,114
No.

59
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,158
So his, uh...

60
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,828
Okay, I was trying to distract him.

61
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,997
By trapping his fingers?

62
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,041
Because he was going to see your wire.

63
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,376
Unbelievable.

64
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,045
In his abuelita's house.
ANNIE: Ugh.

65
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,714
I really don't care
how many bases you rounded.

66
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,965
They just call her Grandma.

67
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,926
Oh, the boss, right?

68
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,719
How was I supposed to know?

69
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,513
Now we're right back where we started.

70
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,889
None of this is my fault.

71
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:04,016
Okay, just what are we supposed
to do now?

72
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,768
'Cause, like, we really need this deal.

73
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,062
You are back on the bench.

74
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,398
One of you two will have to pinch-hit.

75
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,359
Now I'm getting confused
because the baseball stuff

76
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,861
is blurring with the sexy stuff and...
(STAMMERS)

77
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,073
No part of that man
is getting any of this.

78
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:25,454
Her wire's still hot.

79
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,123
Anything good?

80
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,625
Well, Grandma loves Two and a Half Men.

81
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,836
Um, she's totally sick of CPK,

82
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,171
and her foot doctor
appointment's on Tuesday.

83
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,631
DAVE: What about our guy?

84
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,758
Oh, he's gonna need her.

85
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,806
Just don't ask me to wear a wire again.

86
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,935
What were you guys talking about?

87
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
STAN: Hey.

88
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,365
Little Money wants me
to cut the crusts off now.

89
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,201
You thought about how
we're gonna sell these things?

90
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,453
You ask me, it's the best part.

91
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,789
All right. Check this.

92
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,044
Hmm, that's swank.

93
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,839
Four bedrooms, open floor plan,

94
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,090
mad curb appeal.

95
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:19,383
Yeah, who's staying there?

96
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,219
We are.
It's right by Harry's school.

97
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,554
With all those rich moms,

98
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,514
it's the kind of place
you buy a top-notch purse.

99
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,683
Yeah, if you got two G's a night.

100
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,018
One of the girls at the salons

101
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,728
cleans these pads in-between guests.

102
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:31,979
Well, won't they know
that we don't live there?

103
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,355
Not if we say we do.

104
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,566
Nuh-uh, I can't fake that kind of money.

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,068
All these bitches
care about are their houses,

106
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,904
their charities,
and what everyone else has.

107
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:40,988
Exactly.

108
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,240
Okay, you can just be my arm candy.

(SIGHS)

110
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,744
Hey, it's your ass on the line.

(SIGHS)

112
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:55,503
Beth can't be a part of this.

113
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,797
Okay.
I mean, she makes everything about her.

114
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,423
You're right.
No, I don't think you're
hearing what I'm saying.

115
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,926
I am.
She does whatever she wants,
whenever she wants.

116
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,469
I know.
And the rules don't ever apply.

117
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,678
You're right.
Next thing you know,

118
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,514
you got a bullet in your other knee,
I'm back in jail...

119
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,390
And she's living large.
Yes.

120
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:12,144
She can't even hear about this.

121
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,312
I agree.

122
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,609
You know I'm talking
about Beth Boland, right?
Yup.

123
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,902
Your homie.
Got it.

124
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,029
Really?

125
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,697
She doesn't tell me everything she does.

126
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:28,118
Huh. Okay.

127
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:30,454
Good.

128
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,790
They were out of Windex.

129
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,337
That boy's onto something.

130
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,965
That's good as hell.

131
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,677
Oh, no.

132
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,095
Oh, yeah.

133
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,221
Mugs?

134
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,973
Sit down.

135
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,349
I was really hoping for more of

136
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:52,434
a to-go kind of coffee situation.

137
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:55,437
(SIGHS)

138
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,273
Just, uh,

139
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:58,816
just lay it on me, bruh.

140
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,487
You were right.

141
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,781
Oh, exciting.
About what?

142
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,160
I want to pull Ben out of St. Anne's.

143
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,495
Wait, what?

144
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,622
I don't want him to turn into a rich dick.

145
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,666
But you wanted him
to go in the first place.

146
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,376
Well, I changed my mind, okay?

147
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:18,919
What, now that he has friends?

148
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,337
This place is evil.

149
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:21,881
He has teachers that love him.

150
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:23,632
His teachers will love
him in public school.

151
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,925
But what about lacrosse?

152
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,802
He could play lacrosse anywhere.

153
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,137
They just got into the playoffs.

154
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,805
It's fine, all right, fine,

155
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,849
but you deal with all the birthday stuff.

156
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,268
What does that have to do with anything?

157
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,395
You remember Keeley Shukert's
birthday last weekend?

158
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,981
The Swifty karaoke?
Mmm-hmm, yeah.

159
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,524
Well, it turns out
that it wasn't a themed party.

160
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,859
Taylor Swift actually showed up.

161
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,279
Taylor Swift came to a 14-year-old's
birthday party?

162
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:48,616
Yeah, and she played
the whole 1989 album.

163
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:50,826
Did she do Out of the Woods?

164
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,620
The whole album.
What about Clean?

165
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,747
The whole 1989
album, okay?

166
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,582
All of it.
Every single song.

167
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,042
And then she stayed and ate cake.

168
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,627
Oh my God.

169
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,462
Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,840
So, you know, what's Ben gonna expect
for his birthday?

171
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,925
Selena Gomez?

172
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:07,968
You think she charges by the song

173
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,053
or by, like, the hour, or by...

174
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:10,137
Who cares?
That's not the point.

175
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,891
The point is Ben can't think this is
what birthday parties are.

176
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,603
I mean, he can't be a dick.

177
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,396
No, so we gotta pull him out.

178
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,608
Right.

179
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:23,692
Stat.

180
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,195
What's faster than stat?

181
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,072
I don't know.

I spoke to the manager yesterday

Why doesn't that count?

541
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,878
Change the whole Thanksgiving game.

542
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:15,424
How'd we do?

543
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,635
You mean how did I do?

544
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,139
I had a situation.

545
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,145
Do you know how hard
it is to pretend you're
someone you're not?

546
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,189
Oh. Every day.

547
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,234
Yeah, well, I'm not
used to having two ovens

548
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:35,111
two sinks, two dishwashers...

549
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:36,654
They got two dishwashers?

550
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:37,780
Two fridges too.

551
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,323
Dang.

552
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,409
Your pal, Michelle,

553
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,912
she was asking me who
our interior designer was.

554
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,207
What did you say?
Jovann.

555
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:51,335
Who the hell's that?

556
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,963
That cologne you gave me for Christmas.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, Jesus.

557
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,214
You threw me to the wolves.

558
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,924
It was a situation.

559
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,509
So, what, yours is worse than mine?

560
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,677
The life and death kind.

561
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,596
Or is it because she always comes first?

562
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,144
(SIGHS)

563
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:09,979
Well, it looks like you
did just fine on your own.

564
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,023
Well, I'm short.

565
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,941
How?

566
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,112
Didn't sell enough.
Priced them too high.

567
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:21,782
Well, we'll have another party.

568
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,744
Well, what am I supposed to tell Gene?

569
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:26,537
That it's coming.

570
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,457
Well, and that might
put me in a situation.

571
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,085
Life and death kind.

572
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,094
What's that? Caribou?

573
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,805
Two of everything.

574
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,396
(DOOR OPENS)

575
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,315
Hey. Soft serve.

576
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:59,820
So not fair.

577
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,530
Well, pardonnez-moi,

578
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,824
we are out of foie gras.

579
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,618
It's about school.

580
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,495
Oh, you know, it's funny.

581
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:10,039
I actually wanted
to talk to you about that. Um...

582
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,459
Dad won't let me go to DC.

583
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,378
Why?

584
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,171
He says you don't actually learn anything.

585
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,339
It's just a giant party.

586
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:19,715
(CHUCKLES)
Well, duh, yeah.

587
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,259
That's, like, why field trips
were invented.

588
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,886
I will literally
be the only one in my grade not going.

589
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,388
Okay, and?

590
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:27,223
And I want to be with my friends.

591
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:32,144
Well, maybe this is a chance to, like,
make some new friends.

592
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,438
What are you talking about?
Just take a breath, okay?

593
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,983
Have some pate d'Annie...
Mom, tell me.

594
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:48,286
I will talk to your dad about DC.

595
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:50,579
Really?

596
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:52,873
I mean, it's DC.

597
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,710
We can't be letting down
our founding fathers, can we?

598
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:58,337
It's kind of your constitutional duty.

599
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,463
Mmm.

600
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:05,928
Mmm.

601
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,013
Mmm.

602
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,057
Mmm. Sick nails.

603
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:11,183
Nancy did 'em.

604
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,518
You mean her fancy person.

605
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,186
She doesn't come any more.

606
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:17,148
What, she's slumming it at the salon?

607
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,275
She's doing it herself.

608
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:23,070
You mean like at home?

609
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,740
Bought me cosmic blue on Amazon.

610
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:31,203
Why does the cheap stuff
always taste the best?

611
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,497
ANNIE: They're having money problems!
Shh.

612
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,124
The kids.

613
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:36,292
She's doing her own nails,

614
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,044
hasn't been to Whole Foods in months,

615
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,920
and she's picking up her own takeout.

616
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,088
Who?

617
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,257
The Duchess of Winchester.

618
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:44,925
Who's that?

619
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,844
(SIGHS) Nancy, Gregg, hello?

620
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:48,262
Otherwise, why would I be so excited?

621
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,139
Wow, imagine how excited you're gonna be

622
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,974
when you drive by
their tent under the freeway.

623
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,684
Oh, amen to that.

624
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:00,691
Um, how are you all doing?

625
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:02,693
You know, moneywise.

626
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:05,529
Well, I'm not in a tent.

627
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,073
Yet.

628
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,786
Can you spare any this month?

629
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:17,208
What's going on?

630
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,085
I got some extra bills.

631
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,753
ANNIE: How much?

632
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,007
Six grand.
Jesus!

633
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,967
What did you buy?
Another jazzy?

634
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,557
We're hustling these janky-ass purses

635
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,309
for Stan's boss, and I'm short.

636
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,644
Okay?

637
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,942
What?

638
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,903
How many scams are you running?

639
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,948
Why does it matter?

640
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,118
Because it's kind of weird
that you didn't tell us.

641
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:53,536
It doesn't involve you.

642
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,248
It kind of does if you're doing
something sketch.

643
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,959
We do sketch stuff every day.

644
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,377
Yeah, because that's part of our deal...

645
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,753
We do so much sketch stuff...

646
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,923
Which we won't have if they find out that
you're doing something sketch.

647
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,135
She does kind of have a point.

648
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,682
I mean, excuse me,
but what about your sex tape?

649
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,559
Not the same.

650
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:17,768
It's exactly the same.

651
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,853
I did that to protect us.

652
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,771
'Cause the rules don't
ever apply when it's you.

653
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,523
You think I wanted to do that?

654
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:25,734
Way to take a finger for the team.

655
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,779
You know, I can kind of see
it from that perspective.

656
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,823
Would you please take a side already.

657
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,547
So what happens if you don't get it.

658
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,424
That'd be bad.

659
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,302
How bad?

660
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,263
Like, gang friend level.

661
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,743
You're really gonna do this, huh?

662
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,495
What do you mean?

663
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,207
Noticed how things are different now,
that's all.

664
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,505
If Carolyn makes you...

665
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,801
I know she can be a lot,
so I've got other friends...

666
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,470
Is she FBI or Secret Service?

667
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,644
She's a mom

668
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,312
in my gardening group.

669
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,522
Found the wire.

670
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,736
Behind Pelican Brief.

671
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:57,243
Don't. Don't do that.

672
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,418
Open the glove.

674
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,638

(INAUDIBLE)

677
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:11,752
I need more time to give this love of mine

678
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:17,216
That I have for you

679
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,595
Then I would love you

680
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,015
Over and over

681
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,268
Over and over

682
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,063
Over again

683
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:35,025
Yes, I would love you

684

Over and over

Over and over

686
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:50,833
Yes, over again

687
00:36:55,379 --> 00:37:01,719
Over, over again

688
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:08,600
You blew it, Carolyn.

689
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:21,655
And so now whenever I plug my phone in,

690
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,657

692
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,370
Yeah, I played the damn thing one time

693
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,122
for this bitch who can't
get going without it

694
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,082
and now it's all I hear.

00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,712

696
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:38,380
Yeah, stuck with it forever.

698
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,428
How'd we do?

699
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:47,681
Well, I hate to say it,

700
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:51,852
but I'm afraid you crushed it.

701
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,813
Good.

702
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:55,898
It wasn't easy.

703
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:57,858
Should make you guys
partners in the club too.

704
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,487
Hey, that would be awesome.

705
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,739
I said I should, not that I would.

706
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,699
But what I am gonna do...

707
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:07,117
Appreciate it.

708
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,078
Is invest it back into the company.

709
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,539
What company?

710
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,875
Our fake handbag company.

711
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,503
We'd just rather take our cut.

712
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,712
It's gonna be big, though.

713
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,298
Yeah, we're all set.

714
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:22,758

719
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:31,475
Yeah. Real sure.

720

So you don't want to be the next Google?

00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:37,564
We'll take our chances.

You know what?

00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,947
I care about you guys too much
to let you do that.

724
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:51,995
I mean, we don't have
any real investments.

725
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,248
That fool's going down.
Yeah, all right.

726
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:55,499
(ENGINE STARTS)

727
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,383
Oh, no.

728
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,344
Sit down.
Mugs, huh?

729
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,683
You loved that eighth grade
field trip to DC.

730
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:16,270
You had that insane hookup
with Melissa Thomas at the Smithsonian.

731
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,146
Yeah, right by Lincoln's hat.

732
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,398
(LAUGHS)

733
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,610
There's only one reason
why you wouldn't let him go.

734
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,867
Is this drip?

735
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,201
Get used to it.

736
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,835
Nancy tried to grow the business too fast.

737
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,295
What's the damage?

738
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:44,089
We're totaled.

739
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:47,593
Want some cream?
It's free.

740
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,972
What about school?

741
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,811
It'd be nice if he could
finish out the school year.

742
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,105
He loves his dick friends.

743
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:02,482
And those dick parents.

744
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,987
Maybe, maybe I can try
to help with the tuition.

745
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:08,906
It's not cheap.

746
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:11,241
(SARCASTICALLY) Really?
'Cause I thought a school

747
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,368
named after a saint would be free to all.

748
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,913
You make minimum wage.

749
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,790
It's more than you now.

750
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:22,044
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

751
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,046
I am never going to live this down.

752
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:26,548
No you are not.
I am just getting started.

753
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:28,342
(GROANS)

754
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,218
(LAUGHING)

755
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,067
DEAN: Bad day?

756
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,862
Wanna turn it around?

757
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,239
(WATER JETS RUMBLING)

758
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,330
Hop in.

759
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,166
Tell me all about your bad day.

760
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,210
'Cause they...

761
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,506
(RUMBLING INCREASES)
Won't hear a thing.

762
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:10,175
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

763
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:14,262
Come on!

764
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,602
Yes, ma'am. Oh!

765
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,020
(LAUGHING)

766
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,565
Oh.

767
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:28,318
So what happened?

768
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,989
It's complicated.
(SIGHS WEARILY)

769
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,213
I didn't have a choice.

770
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,048
You got one now.

771
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,553
The way I see it, you got the angel
on one shoulder

772
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:55,762
and the devil on the other.

773
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,643
Damned either way.

774
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,191
So what's it gonna be?
