Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.

181
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,157
They threatened to call the cops.
What did you say?

182
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,241
It was a mistake.

183
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,243
That's good.

184
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,953
And I refunded all her money.

185
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,288
Not good.

186
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,165
Well, what else was I supposed to do?

187
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,417
This was our way out.
It was.

188
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,169
And not just for us.

189
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:50,839
Do you feel that?

190
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,719
What?
The deja vu.

191
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,806
This isn't Beth's fault.

192
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,973
Yeah, you go out
with your girl for one night,

193
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,934
and then you come back
with problems that last you forever.

194
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:03,977
So we'll find another way out.

195
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,270
She'll screw that up, too.

196
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,066

what is he even doing in there?

200
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,085
BETH: Well, he's probably
built up more filth

201
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,586
'cause he's been homeless for so long.

202
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,005
ANNIE: Ugh! He might as well
be showering in Cristal

203
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,173
for what it's costing me.

204
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,008
What if he took baths?

205
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,635
He moved out.

206
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,429

211
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:50,232
Totally.

212
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,817
Get something on the books.

213
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,571
It might not be right away.

214

How come?

215
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,828
Just... you know, some issues.

216
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,454
What kind of issues?

217

It is now.

237

We know nothing about
running a strip club.

238
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,473
Didn't know much about cars
or hot tubs either.

239
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,895
How much?

240
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,193
How much what?

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,404
Our cut.

Don't be mad.

250
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,529
I'm not mad.

251
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:01,613
She's mad.

252
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:03,198
We were out.

253
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,616
Not exactly.

254
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,493
We were more out than in.

256
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,956
By doing exactly what he says.

257
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,459
At least now we're getting paid.

258
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,712

I said a thing.

(TYLER SCREAMING)

720
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,231
Dennis, stop whipping Tyler.

721
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:15,566
Oh.

722
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,778
If I'm gonna have your back,
I'd want to know that you'd have mine.

723
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,659
I'll do whatever it takes.

724
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:30,914
Let's talk at the next meeting.

725
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,585
All right.
See you there.

726
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:35,919
Yeah, you will.

727
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,799
(BLOWS WHISTLE) Let's go.
Line up. (CLAPS)

728
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,219
(DOOR OPENS)

729
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:51,560
I fixed the lock.

730
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,441
What are you doing?
Hungry?

731
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,819
I mean, yeah, always, but... (SIGHS)

732
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:04,323
We're having citrus braised lamb shanks.

733
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:09,411
Uh, what's...

734
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,663
What happened with Angela?

735
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,209
I mean, she's not really
roommate material.

736
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,752
Oh.

737
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,464
What is she, like,
a clean freak, or something?

738
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,343
You ever see that episode of Hoarders

739
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,928
with the woman who kept dead cats?

740
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:27,221
Of course.

741
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,723
That's Angela?

742
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,227
Yeah, but instead of dead cats,
it was rotisserie chickens.

743
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:36,313
She would eat off 'em for weeks.

744
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,024
They were all over the place.

745
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,946
You like mint jelly with lamb?

746
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,989
No.

747
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:47,157
Good.

748
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,953
So, why did you leave?

749
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:55,541
Isn't that what you wanted?

750
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,252
I mean...

751
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:02,047
why else would you do
something this crazy?

752
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:07,469
Are you mad?

753
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,056
I was, at first,

754
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:16,395
but then I thought about it, and...

755
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:22,150
No one's ever really needed me before.

756
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:29,324
No one's ever needed me, either.

757
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,666
Oh, um...

758
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,168
You got any cumin?

759
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,837
Uh...

760
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,383
Does taco seasoning count?

761
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:49,761
It's close enough.

762
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,516
Also, it's so nice to have my bucket back.

763
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,351
Thank you.

764
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,605
(SIGHS)

765
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,898
NICK: This is older than me.

766
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,901
Well, I figure it's what
fancy politicians drink.

767
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,277
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you.

768
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:11,491
So, how does it feel
being Tax ID number 49-3451299?

769
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,368
Overwhelming.

770
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:14,578
(CHUCKLES)
Why is that?

771
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:16,914
There's a lot more people to answer to.

772
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,791
Based on the other night,
I think you handled it pretty well.

773
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,085
What was the vote?

774
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,503
Four-three.

775
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:25,797
Close.

776
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,466
There's always someone to convince.

777
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:30,010
Not if you had my vote.

778
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,179
You serious?

779
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:34,723
You think a strip club owner has a shot?

780
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:37,643
(CHUCKLES)
You're of the people.

781
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,478
I'll need lots of advice.

782
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:40,562
(NICK CHUCKLES)

783
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,066
What changed your mind?

784
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:49,112
(MOODY POP SONG PLAYING)

785
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:12,719
You.

786
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,098
Wait, Beth.

787
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,434
Let's crack this open.

788
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,061
Ah, I haven't earned it yet.

789
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,021
You're gonna win.

790
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,565
Share it with someone who already has.

791
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,962
Pour that out.
