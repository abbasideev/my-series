00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,548
Is all that from one night?

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,634
I would love to hear
about them private parties

4
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:10,968
you've been running behind my back.

5
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,470
Ben threw a rager at our house.

6
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:13,971
You didn't want your cool,
fancy new friends

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,389
to know about your broke-ass mom, right?

8
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,600
You called them douchebags
and date rapers.

9
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,727
If you're unhappy here,
you can always stay at your dad's.

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,604
Big Kahuna, they want to meet with us.

11
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,232
Kahuna Spas would love
to be part of the ride.

12
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,400
DEAN: I got the account.
That's great!

13
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,277
I also had to give them the books.

OFFICER: Dean Boland?
(HANDCUFFS CLICKING)

15
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:33,157
Tell me one thing.
Was he part of it?

16
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,951
There's gotta be a way to get him out.

17
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,494
Why? He's the perfect fall guy.

18
00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:38,037
BETH: /t all started about a year ago.

19
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,205
Doesn't matter.

20
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:40,873
Your husband pled guilty today.

21
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,334
We pop gang friend, all of this goes away.

You're gonna need a sniper.
I Know a guy.

00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,131
What do you want?
Pull up your pants like a big boy

24
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,883
and do your job.

25
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,303
Dear Dean, I'm gonna tell you
exactly what to do and how to do it.

26
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:34,385
What's it gonna be?

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,511
Pop-Tarts.

28
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:37,263
We don't have Pop-Tarts.

29
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,390
Yes, we do.
Dad hides them at the top.

30
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,820
Wash them down with some OJ.

31
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,072
Dad lets us have soda.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,888
Hi. We haven't actually met.

34
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,557
Aren't you the Big Kahuna?

35
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,601
Just Dave.

36
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,438
Is Dean okay?

37
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,316
That depends on you.

38
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,906
I only see whole milk.

39
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,324
He'll kill me.

40
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,408
You have any almond or soy?

41
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,994
We'll protect you.
He has people everywhere.

42
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,829
DAVE: No one will know you're with us.

43
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,499
Except for your entire department.

44
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:47,917
It'll just be me.

45
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,377
And me.

46
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,756
This boat, airtight.
No holes.

47
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,344
What could I even get on him?

48
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,514
Looks like plenty.

49
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,309
We need to Know what
he does with the money.

50
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,853
Okay. Well, I'll just
text him and ask, then.

51
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,106
Seriously?

52
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:12,191
I can't do this.

53
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,943
Okay.

54
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,278
Okay...

55
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,240
Just might wanna give the
rest of your posse a heads-up.

56
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,783
Why?

57
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,369
Because now, we have
to round up everyone.

Okay, I'm a mom.

59
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,415
Who's gonna believe that I wrote that?

60
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,960
That's the gamble. Right?

61
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,427

I hope he's paying you overtime.

Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,043
I made a frittata.

00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,294
Gutsy.
Yeah.

92
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,171
I don't have to wake up
at the crack anymore.

Why?

Yeah, I got all the time in the world.

Sounds like you're adjusting well.
Mmm-hmm.

97
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,682
It's almost as if I never gave birth.

98
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,352
What's in a frittata?

99
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,980
You know, eggs.

100
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,399
Well, how's it different from an omelet?

101
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,488
I wanted to make
a frigging frittata, okay?
I actually did.

102
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,323
But we don't get
cell reception in my apartment,

103
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,118
and the Internet was down,
and only Ben knows how to reset the box.

104
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,536
And I have this ringing in my ear,

105
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,205
so I wanted to look that up,
but I couldn't because the Internet

106
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,373
and the resetting.
Tinnitus.

107
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,583
Sure. Whatever.

108
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,543
The point is is that if Ben was here,

109
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:18,878
I! wouldn't have even had to look it up

110
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,297
because he's so much smarter
than me and better than me,

111
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,341
and everything in my life
is just a lot better

112
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,302
whenever he's with me.

113
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,306
You don't have tinnitus.

114
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:36,562

115
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,023

Dad and I used to collect butterflies.

And I know you're gonna say
that I'm bribing him,

120
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,113
but I'm telling you, it works.

121
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,032
I would run around the field, scooping up
as many as I could,

122
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,492
and the net would snap
their little wings.

Jesus. No wonder you became a therapist.

124
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:55,164
Dad would just stand
perfectly still, so they'd land on him.

125
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,624
And then what, you'd take them home

126
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,667
and let them fly around
your house like a weird pet?

127
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,711
Mount them in decorative shadow boxes.

128
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:04,423
The point is, you can't use
a net to get what you want.

129
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,302
That's really an elaborate metaphor.

130
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,847
You can't make someone like you.

131
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,738

was a collector, too.

132

135
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,381
I do.

Because he's gonna...
I know.

137
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,676
Like, for real.
BETH: I Know.

138
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,344
We're dead.

139
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,472
Okay, let's focus on the positive.

140
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,640
They'll never find our bodies.

141
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:57,059
We get to start over,
which is a good thing.

142
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,561
Assuming we can even deliver gang friend.

143
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,772
And then they'll move us
anywhere in the country.

144
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,899
Do Alaska and Hawaii count?

145
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,901
BETH: Probably.
To do what?

146
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,820
Whatever we want.
What about Puerto Rico?

147
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:10,614
I mean, if it's under
their jurisdiction, I don't see why not.

148
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,782
They'll fully set us up.

It'll be like we never existed.

00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:26,714
Like we never put on those masks.

ANNIE: Ooh, one thing.

156
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,510
Not a big deal.
Real minor.

157
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:33,095
All the territories count, Annie.

158
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,805
Even Guam.
Okay.

159
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,475
The hitman.

160
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,938
I mean, wouldn't this whole
deal go away if your boy gets whacked?

161
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,195
One other thing.

he pulled his child out of school.

00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,875
I mean, this man
has completely disappeared.

166
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,419
Yeah. That's what we do before we, uh,

167
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,921
get to work, so to speak.

168
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,674
But we don't want him to get to work.

169
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,426
I can't just call off your hit.

170
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:13,761
BETH: Why not?

171
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,054
There's a code.

172
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,181
Like in Assassin's Creed?

173
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,558
(WHISPERS) I vouched
for you guys, all right?

174
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,393
We'll still pay him.

175
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,228
It just makes me look bad.

176
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,855
Well, what if we pay you, too?

177
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,774
Yeah.
Like a restocking fee.

178
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,192

Ew.

542
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:34,762
(TV PLAYING)
Okay, dinner.

543
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,432
Dad lets us eat here.

544
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,351
BETH: We eat at the table.

545
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,353
We don't have a table.

546
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,938
We've got a counter.

00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,451
Jane, put that down.
Come eat.

550
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,252
Don't you dare.

551
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,755

(CONTINUES INAUDIBLY)

553
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,583
How you wanna do this?

554
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,509
(CHUCKLES) Y'all don't mess around, huh?

555
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,762
Just business.

556
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,514
Mmm-hmm.

557
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:28,018
May I?

558
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:48,414
I didn't think she had it in her.

559
00:36:56,463 --> 00:36:58,465
Gotta be careful with a woman like her.

560
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:02,469
You never know what they're thinking.

561
00:37:03,178 --> 00:37:04,179
Don't.

562
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:07,641
Don't do that.

563
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,405
Later, Dave.

564
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,531
Dave?

565
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:23,741
(GUNSHOT)

566
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,080
When's Daddy coming home?

567
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,335
Soon.

568
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,260
And, funny enough, he actually invited me
this time, but um...

569
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:44,803
JOSH: Okay. That's good.

570
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,389
But I let him go by himself.

571
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,142
Maybe you'll go next time.

572
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,519
Yeah, maybe.

573
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,900
Um, I actually got you something.

574
00:37:58,525 --> 00:37:59,985
What?
Here.

575
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:03,572
It's just a little...
Little gift.

576
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:09,536
Uh...

577
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,289
Is that...
It's a Monarch.

578
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:14,750
I got him with my wiper.

579
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,585
Lovely.

580
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,670
It's for your collection.

581
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,340
Very thoughtful.

582
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,093
And, uh, kind of a goodbye.

583
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:27,971
Okay.

584
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:30,307
Like a toodle-oo.

585
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,850
See you next week.

586
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:37,523
It's more of a forever toodle-oo.

587
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,068
You're quitting?

588
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:44,404
I'm cured.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

589
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:46,949
Just like that?

590
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:51,203
Yeah, well, you're that good.

591
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,332

594

I Know where we can move.

595
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,202
We still dreaming?

596
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,456
Wyoming.

597
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:39,585
Like, the place
with cowboys and rodeos and stuff?

598
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,212
And a super low tax rate,
hardly any crime.

599
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:45,173
One of the few places that
can boast unspoiled nature.

600
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,342
Mmm-hmm.
And no black folks.

601
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:48,552
Not true.

602
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:50,220
Really?
Kanye.

603
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:51,889
He's up in Wyoming?

604
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,140
The ranch.

What's your problem?

609
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,612
I gotta get up in a few hours.

610
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,907
Can't humor me a little?

611
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:11,491
You know what?

612
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,661
I'd rather stay here.

613
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,540
For the rest of our lives?

614
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,669
At least I know what I'm up against.

RIO: Looks legit.

616
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,594
SO you approve?

617
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:35,891
Who made it?

618
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,770
Alexander Hamilton.

619
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,022
You dug up an old white guy?

620
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,150
No, but we both know how hard
it is to find a good artist,

621
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:46,610
so I'm not gonna tell you.

622
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:49,821
Fair enough.

623
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,782
And I obviously can't wash it anymore.

624
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,870
Spa business ain't what it used to be?

625
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,623
They seized everything.

626
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,459
All of it?

627
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,044
Yes, even yours.

628
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:06,588
Bummer.

629
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,299
I'll take a smaller cut.

630
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,718
Nah. We're cool.

631
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,180
Really?

632
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:19,059
Yeah. You earned it.

633
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,857
Oh, one thing, though.

must have been out of options, or...

Hmm.

00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,887
I must have been all they had.

Yeah, maybe.
