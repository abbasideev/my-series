00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,840
Get me my funny money back.

00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,551
RIO: Ask nicely.
BETH: The cops?

5
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:12,428
RIO: Not them.

00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:14,972
Nancy tried to grow the business too fast.

7
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,641
What's the damage?
We're totaled.

8
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:17,892
You're homeless?

00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,061
He's experiencing homelessness.

ANNIE: What happened with Angela?

11
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,272
She's not really roommate material.

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,357
Why did you leave?

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,610
No one's ever really needed me before.

14
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,488
I found this in my underwear a while ago.

15
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,573
I got this from my wife's cell.

00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,824
RUBY: We're back in the club.

17
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,368
Who's name is it in?
All of us.

18
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:36,869
You can't give that stuff to the DA.

19
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,079
Putting me in a tough spot.

20
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,705
If you can just drag
your feet a little bit...

21
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,624
It'd be a different story
if you were one of us.

22
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,584
Can we help you?
We're here about the dancing.

23
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,336
We're fully zoned and licensed.

24
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,797
There's enough there
to keep you from opening.

25
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,966
You want this problem to go away?
Yes, please!

26
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,467
Then run for city council.

27
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,552

28
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,263
So, what now?
We get him.

29
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,431
You think a strip club owner has a shot?

30
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,516
What changed your mind?

31
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,686
You.

32
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,690
Because crime isn't just
something that's downtown.

33
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:07,275
It's in our community.

34
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,860
And if we don't do
something about it right now,

35
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,323
the robberies, the drug dealing,
the gangs,

36
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,826
they're gonna show up in our backyard,

37
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:20,246
or our front steps, or even our kitchens.

38
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:24,292
And, personally, I want
to live in a world

39
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,294
where I don't have to lock my front door,

40
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:29,589
or watch my back every time
I go to the grocery store,

41
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,466
or worry that someone's
parked on my street

42
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:33,759
waiting for me to leave,

43
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,179
so they can just come in
and take whatever they want.

44
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,933
I want to go back to that Ashfield.

45
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,185
And I know you do, too.

46
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:46,147
And that's why I'm running
for city council,

47
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,859

49
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:56,824
How was it?

50
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,744
It was long.

51
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,787
Did you understand it?

52
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,998
Parts were funny.

53
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,168
You're really doing this, huh?

54
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,128
Was it that bad?

55
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,552
Uh, the principal wants to see us again.

56
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,637

You got your petty theft,

00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,210
drugs, carjacking, what have you.

61
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,921
Now, this is where you ladies come in.

62
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,715
Some of that money gets washed right here.

63
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,759
The rest turns into counterfeit.

64
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,057
Then it goes across the border
and comes back clean.

65
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:04,934
But now they got to launder it,

66
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:07,728
or else the IRS starts
asking all these questions.

Oh.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

72
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,282

74
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,371
He is not our boy.
Like, why does everyone...

75
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:28,416
And in return, they get...
Body glitter.

Now, this is where
it gets a little complicated.

Oh, jeez.

83
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,519
The shell companies are
hired by the city to build

whatever project Gang Fairy Godfather
can get approved.

85
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,649
Which is why he needs you in that seat.

86
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,944
But we don't know what
his next project is.

87
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,446
Which is why we need you in that seat.

88

To bring 'em all down.

Yeah.

How much of this do we have to understand

92
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,085
to get our deal back?

93
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,963
None of it.
Oh.

with that cutlet.

Not really.

Well, I'm calling it a vacation.

Mm, I'm calling it suspended

having drinks with a "friend."

00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,527
there's nothing in it for us.

103
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,155
How about not going away for all of this?

104
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,741
Now, would that be to a Canadian prison?

105
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,785
Does that matter?

106
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,119
I think I could handle it.

107
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,332
Can we keep our cut from all this?

108
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,545
Yeah.
