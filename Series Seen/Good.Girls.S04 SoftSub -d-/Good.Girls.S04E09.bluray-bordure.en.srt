Yeah.

186
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,687
What?
Well,

187
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,397
I don't want to jinx it.

188
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,523
Oh, come on.

189
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,651
I just feel like this time...

190
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,029
we got a real chance.

191
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,573
EMMA: Mom.

192
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:54,074
Mom, I gotta poop.

193
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,325
(CHUCKLES)

194
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,410
Il run her home.

195
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,995
Oh, wait.

196
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:59,413
Are you sure you didn't want to

197
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,623
hot bag it in the bushes?
Yes, I'm positive.

198
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,750
Come on, kid.

199
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,385
Not a great time.

200
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,636
I'll make it quick then.

201
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,638
Can we do this some place else?

202
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,974
Oh, you haven't told him our good news?

203
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,185
I don't think he'll take it that way.

204
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,478
(CHUCKLES)

205
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,149
I need you to run a little errand for me.

206
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,861
They are never little.

207
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,781
Get me my funny money back.

208
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,449
How am I supposed to do that?

209
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,910
Ask nicely.
The cops?

210
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,913
(SCOFFS) Not them.

211
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,545
They're your crew.

212
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089
They're leaving.

213
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,341
Never a good time, is it?

214
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,814
I was just thinking, before you leave,

215
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,898
we could, um,

216
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,942
finally get that green juice.

217
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,278
I can even bring it to
the hotel if that's easier.

218
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,199
I don't Know if you got
my text, but, um...

219
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,369
call me. Okay, bye.

220
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,416
How do you even know the money's there?

221
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,127
I don't.

222
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,171
So, wait, you're just gonna get her
hopped up on green juice?

223
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,464
Could always roofie her.

224
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,970
Just to loosen her up, get her talking.

225
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,806
You know what a little errand is?

226
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,599
Picking up the dry cleaning,

227
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,767
dropping off a dog

228
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,644
at the groomer, getting milk.

229
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,481
Breaking into a hotel room
to steal federal evidence

230
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,650
is a kamikaze mission.

231
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,862
It's suicide.
That is what kamikaze Is.

232
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,823
That's exactly why we have to
get out of this town.

233
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,074
STAN: Y'all ready?

234
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:02,327
Squad up, bitches.

235
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,581
It's just something we say.

236
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,207
STAN: Mm-hmm.

237
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,671
Oh. Go ahead.
Oh, no.
You take it.

238
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,840
It's your house.
It's my bags.

239
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,509
Oh, boy.

240
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,847
(BETH SIGHS)

241
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,308
So, last time...
I was thinking...

242
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,518
(SIGHS)

243
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,527
Last time we hit the third grade,
now we do fourth.

244
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,279
This way, we don't repeat parents.

245
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,614
Also, let's use a different house,

246
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,200
because we got new prospects.
Oh.

247
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,077
What about Irish twins?

248
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:45,787
What about 'em?

249
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,081
Same parent could have
a kid in third grade

250
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,208
and in fourth grade.

251
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,501
Not an issue.
Making sure.

252
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,046
So I figured that we'd...

253
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,257
break this down into shifts,

254
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,092
maybe over a few days.

255
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,804
And would that be
the most bang for our buck?

256
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,392
Um, I guess we could

257
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,269
double up in one day.

258
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,814
I mean the whole school thing.

259
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,364
(CHUCKLES) I mean, if it ain't broke...

260
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:22,115
Okay.

261
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:26,828
I mean, if you see a problem...

262
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,247
No, no, no.
This should work.

263
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:33,585
She sees a problem.

264
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,713
No, not necessarily.

265
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,049
Phew. Real big one.

266
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:40,384
Just a little snag.

267
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:47,015
Hey, I'm all ears.

268
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,851
It's kind of risky.

269
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,812
Here we go.
Why?

270
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:56,358
Well, who's on your mom chain right now?

271
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,111
Bunch of people.

272
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,321
And how many fourth grade moms
are on there?

273
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,698
Um...

274
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,408
not a lot.

275
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:05,492
What's your point?

276
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:08,245
Moms talk, a lot.
Mm-hmm.

277
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,957
And it only takes one
to smell a knock-off.

278
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,543
Or it's safer.

279
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,503
How's that?

280
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,171
If someone finds out,
then we can get ahead of it

281
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,589
because we're on that mom chain.

282
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,757
Or...

283
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,844
they start another mom chain,

284
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,929
so they can talk about you
behind your back.

285
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,433
How many mom chains are you on, babe?

286
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,560
Not a lot.

287
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,562
And then Harry gets kicked out of school.

288
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,730
Come on now.

289
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,898
And we're all in cuffs.
That's never gonna happen.

290
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,483
Why take the chance?

291
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:51,580
You know what?

292
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,582
I'm just gonna shut up.

No, you paid to get this party started.

309
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,053
You can't do this.
Oh, but we are.

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,517

All right, how much?

00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,150
Start at 2 grand.

00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,734

00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,207
No, I know, I Know.
I'm just saying, like,

366
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,750
ina slow month, it's an easy way

367
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,044
to put a little extra cash in your pocket.

368
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,548
Pyramid schemes aren't really my thing.

369
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,638
It's more of a...

370
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,809
you know, community of men
supporting each other.

371
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,320
You ever think
about coming back on the lot?

372
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,990
Uh...

373
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,702
Nah, it's not...

374
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:41,953
it's not my bag anymore.

375
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,039
Friend of mine over at, um,

376
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,582
Southfield Volvo

377
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:48,168
said they're losing
one of their best sales guys.

378
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,420
Southfield, huh?
Mm-hmm.

379
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:51,755
I can put in a word.

380
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:53,715
I'm my own boss now.

381
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,425
Just get lunch with the guy,

382
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:56,843
feel it out.
(BEEPING)

383
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,430
You know what?
Um, actually,

384
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,724
I can just do all this
for you. You don't...
you don't need...

385
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,517
(BEEPING)
That your phone?

386
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,569
(BEEPING)

387
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,405
Yeah, I think it's...

388
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,283
I think it's, uh...

389
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,745
Out of batteries.

390
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:27,999
I should really get going.

391
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:32,587
(BEEPING)

392
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,635
Also need a copy of the arrest file.

393
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,095
MAN: Should be there.

394
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,221
It's not.

395
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,056
Hang on.

396
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:47,352
Don't see it.

397
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,688
Well, maybe they threw it out
when they threw out my case.

398
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,774
No, no, here we go.

399
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:53,900
Hmm.

400
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:57,987
Sign the release.

401
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,249
That it?

402
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,210
Why'd they throw out your case?

403
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,213
Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't be going home.

404
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,135
Pays to have friends in high places, huh?

405
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:29,227
Hey, Shel.

406
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,438
I'm not sharing this.

407
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:33,690
I need something from evidence.

408
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,111
She was someone's daughter.

409
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,865
Rather give you half my sandwich.

410
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,326
You're the best.

411
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,958
CHEF: Order up.

412
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:54,878
This is a little embarrassing.

413
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,714
Hit me.
You got kids?

414
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:00,133
Mm-mmm. Married to the city.

415
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,217
An.

416
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,636
My daughter, she's nine.

417
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,263
She's a big MMA fan.

418
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,931
Mm. Who's her favorite?

419
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,600
(SCOFFS)
Anyone who kicks ass.

420
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:10,643
The whole girl power thing.

421
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,228
Right. Right, right, right.
Yeah.

422
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:14,147
So what can I do for you?

423
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:16,316
WAITRESS:
There you go.
Mm.

424
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,110
Heard you're the ticket guy.

425
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:21,988
How's that?

426
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:25,158
Word is you got the hook-up for
all the best fights.

427
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,160
(CHUCKLES) Says who?

428
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:28,244
(CHUCKLES)

429
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,873
Can't be humble on Instagram.

430
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,459
Office seats.
Hook a guy up?

431
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,795
Those are usually reserved for donors,

432
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,004
Make-A-Wish kids, you know.

433
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,590
What about murderers?

434
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,346
I don't know anything about this.

435
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:48,973
How'd they end up with a gang banger
tied to a homicide?

436
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,519
I guess, maybe they scalped them.

437
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,270
One of the cancer kids?

438
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,563
Mm.

439
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,234
Sorry, what was your precinct?

440
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,361
Fourteen.
Mm.

441
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,156
Let me see what I can do
for your daughter.

442
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,117
Appreciate that.
Yeah.

443
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,577
Have a good day, Officer.
You too.

444
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,959
And I've been using
the same shampoo bottle

445
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,460
for, like, a year.

446
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,505
Just add water and shake.

447
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,383
And I've never bought ketchup
or soy sauce,

448
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,718
I have a whole drawer
dedicated to freebies.

449
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,555
And I always order off the kid's menu.

450
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:32,141
No doubt about it.

451
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,810
You're poor.
Yes.

452
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,395
Maybe the poorest I've ever seen.

453
00:22:35,478 --> 00:22:37,438
Thank you.
But we can't grant you

454
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,731
financial aid.

455
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,317
Have you gotten to the part yet

456
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,570
where we lived off a deer
for an entire winter?

457
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:46,656
The problem is your drug charge.

458
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,241
(SIGHS)

459
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,954
I can explain.

460
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:55,415
That was because a man tried to rape me,

461
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:56,624
and when I wouldn't let him rape me...

462
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,168
It's just school policy.

463
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,257
The thing is,

464
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,135
Ben loves this school.
We love Ben.

465
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,095
Ben loves this school
so much that he's, like,

466
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:11,556
one of those kids
that you see on a brochure,

467
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,225
that you're sure has to be an actor
because they're so happy.

468
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:18,229
But actually, Ben is so happy at school.

469
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,232
What about Ben's father?

470
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:26,946
Isn't there any other way?

471
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,574
Do you have a boyfriend?
Domestic partner?

472
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:32,118
Okay, well, now you're just
rubbing it in.

473
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,162
(SIGHS)

474
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,834
Is there anyone you
get naked with regularly?

475
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,879
That counts?

476
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:44,923
If they share your address.

477
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,531
Ooh.

478
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,743
(SIGHS) Jesus.

479
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:15,828
I brought bagels.

480
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,667
Man, DWP was jackhammering all night.

481
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,336
You want everything or poppy?

482
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,466
I gave you a house key?

483
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,176
Oh, I used the spare.

484
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,222
(SIGHS)

485
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,936
It's been a while.

486
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:45,400
Yeah, I got...
Sorry, So busy...

487
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,360
Could have called.
I lost my phone.

488
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,028
Still liked my TikToks.

489
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:51,155
Hey, question.

490
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,532
You don't have any kind of like...

491
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:56,661
like a record
or anything like that, right?

492
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,414
Huh?
You know, like,

493
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,500
drug charges or felonies...

494
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,961
(SIGHS)

495
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,090
What do you want?

496
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,383
Nothing.

497
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,802
You only come over
when you need something.

498
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:15,471
Excuse me

499
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,683
for trying to have a nice breakfast moment

500
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,560
with my...

501
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:22,895
boyfriend.

502
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:24,689
Wow.

503
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,401
All right, seriously, why are you here?

504
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,614
Just... Here.

505
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:37,618
Fill these out, and for the address,
just use mine.

506
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,040
(MUTTERING)

507
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,378
Well, if I do this,

508
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,380
you gotta do something for me.

509
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,718
Yeah, I'm not really ready for
the tattoo thing.

510
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,637
Never come here again.

511
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:00,975
Okay.

512
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:07,732
And leave the bagels.

513
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:11,652
WOMAN: It's like my uniform, you know?

514
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,780
I don't even work out.
Neither do I.

515
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,573
But I still put them
on every morning like it's my job.

516
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:17,950
That's why I focus on my accessories.

517
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,870
Because I may not feel great in my jeans,
but my bags...

518
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:21,954
They always look hot.

519
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,706
I! wish I could afford it.

520
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,500
Convince your husband that you need one.

521
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,877
He just sent me on a girls trip
to Chicago.

522
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,088
Ooh, fun.
MAN: Let's go, go, go, come on.

523
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,506
Get your snack.
Move it.

524
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,508
Stop running.
We're not gonna be late, all right?

525
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,260
Hey, hon.
This is Beth.

526
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,930
Her oldest did Ladybug with Olivia.

527
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,100
I feel so bad I didn't remember that.

528
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,559
BETH: Please, it was forever ago.

529
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:45,394
She's selling these cute bags.

530
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,562
Kim just bought one.

531
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,898
How do you know Kim?

532
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:50,691
Friend of a friend.

533
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,318
BOY: Mom, where are the nuggets?

534
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:54,278
In the freezer, where they always are.

535
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,156
BOY: No, they're not.
Excuse me.

536
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:04,413
What is this?

537
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,625
Never use your real info
when booking strippers.

538
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,628
Do you want to get arrested?

539
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:14,715
I want you and your friends
to all buy your wives a bag.

540
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,676
Or maybe you're just dumb.

541
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,427
No, dumb would be thinking that

542
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,888
I didn't record everything
the other night.

543
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,517
Hey, babe, we're out of nuggets.

544
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,893
Oh, I wanted to show you one more thing

545
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,687
because I forgot to bring the snakeskin.

546
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,313
Oh, that might be a bit much for me.

547
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,649
Come on, you just
have to channel your inner stripper.

548
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:33,109
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

549
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:34,861
BETH: Here it is.

550
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:37,947
So this is from a trunk show

551
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,158
that we did the other night.
Let's just get it.

552
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,619
Babe, these are expensive.

553
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,580
Call it an early birthday present, huh?

554
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:47,498
Wow.

555
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,126
Someone won the husband lottery, huh?

556
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:51,544
I so did.

557
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:58,217
Uh, maybe the other guys' wives
would dig them, huh?

558
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,510
Are you kidding?
They would love them.

559
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,721
I would really appreciate the referrals.

560
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:07,977
What are all these emojis?

561
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,062
That's everybody paying everybody.

562
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,314
That's confusing.

563
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:12,857
Okay, click there.

564
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:17,153
So that's everyone paying you.

565
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:18,571
See? One emoji.

566
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:20,656
Is that a middle finger?

567
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,949
You did blackmail him.

568
00:28:22,783 --> 00:28:24,243
(BOTH LAUGH)

569
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:30,249
Happy hour?

570
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,835
Very happy.
She got the money.

571
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,212
Well, not all of it.

572
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,546
A few guys want to pay in cash

573
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,089
'cause they don't want it on record.

574
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,800
Cool.

575
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,598
(MOUTHING)
Ignore him.

576
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,143
Can somebody read my Bio report?

577
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,645
What's it on?

00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,438
Cellular organelles.

579
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:54,357
Yeah, that's all you.
Okay.

580
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,442
You know, I was the queen of

581
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,361
cellular organelles,

582
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,112
back in the day.

583
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,079
Is your account
@themHills?

584
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:10,998
Yep.

585
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:16,963
And...

586
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,216
that is your cut.

587
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,510
Must feel good proving me wrong.

588
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:26,430
Feels better to get the money.

589
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,015
Like that's why you did it.

590
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,102
What's your problem?

591
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,276
You.

592
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,903
Okay, I'm sorry that I...

593
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,405
You could have waited for the next party.

594
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,365
I saved our asses.
No, you went back over there

595
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:45,741
because your ego couldn't take the hit.

596
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,868
Okay, let's not talk about ego.

597
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,370
Got ignored for so long
in your own home...

598
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:51,289
Mr. My Bags.
Now all you want to do is matter.

599
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:53,624
Excuse me?

600
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,627
You use whoever you can
to get whatever you want.

601
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,589
I got you your money.

602
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,133
You got my wife shot.

603
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,847
And that's the least of it.

604
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,769
If you think that I would ever do anything
to hurt her...

605
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,187
I think that you don't think

606
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,897
about anyone but yourself, Beth.

608
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,408
Yeah, let me grab my jacket.

What are you doing here?

611
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,462
Do you want to have that green juice?

612
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,380
I'm kind of over it.

613
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,884
Good. 'Cause that's why I brought this.

614
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,427
I got work to do.

615
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,346
Is that your version of
"gotta pick up the kids"?

616
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,556
Only mine's real.

00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,727
I'm not a total bitch.

618

I only do shots.

Here you go.
All right.

620
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,282
Let me ask you something.
You got a glass?

621
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,868
Uh... your choice.

622
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:12,578
Mug or sippy cup?

623
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,372
Never mind.
Okay.

624
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,253
What do you know about cars?

625

I Know what I like.

626
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:23,631
No, like, how they work,

627
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:26,842
like, why is a Cadillac good for one guy,

628
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,512
but a BMW is great for someone else?

629
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,101
I was really good at that.

630
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,770
You're a natural.
At cars.

631
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,358
Think I see where this is going.

632
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:44,527
You guys have been so incredible to me...

633
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,737
When you were little,
what did you want to be?

634
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,489
Easy, astronaut.

635
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:50,282
Stuntman.

636
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:51,992
Okay, so?

637
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,994
You didn't know anything about cars.

638
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,538
I didn't know anything about
men's skincare.

639
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,498
I got a better chance
at being an astronaut...

640
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:58,666
But you have something down here

641
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,334
that you wouldn't have in outer space.

642
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,419
What's that?

00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:03,295
This guy.

644
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,841
It's just not for me.

645
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:11,846
And look, I really hope

646
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,348
that I can still bike
with you and the guys.

647
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,810

648

Thank you.

You just write me

Oh, okay. Um...

652
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,363
so I knew this was coming,

653
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,614
so I boxed it up.

654
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:35,828
These are just the samples.

655
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:36,996
That's all you gave me.

for the year.

657
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,465

Maybe I'll give it another shot.

Unless you don't have a phone,

666
00:33:08,944 --> 00:33:10,446
because I'm pretty sure
by the time you get home

667
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,115
and it's 11:00 p.m., you've been reading

668
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,202
all about everything
that's been happening all day.

669
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,620
It's kind of like, uh,

670
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:20,414
when parents send you a meme
after six months,

671
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,083
and you're like,
"Um, that's not funny anymore, guys."

Mm. And then she told the whole school

680
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,976
that I got genital warts from my dad.

681
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:43,437
I told her that in confidence.

682
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,359
Last part was a joke.

683
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:49,485
Oh.

684
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:52,112
Oh, come on, you would have done

685
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,864
the same thing to somebody like me.

686
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,408
I honestly probably wouldn't have
even known you.

726
00:36:14,421 --> 00:36:15,714
Kid kept dropping his hands.

727
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,091
That could get you into trouble.

728
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,384
Or draws 'em in.

730
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:25,224
What was that knockout like?

731
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,017
Boy got whooped.

732
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,644
Nothing like ringside seats, huh?

733
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:30,688
Yeah, I could hear his whole nose explode.

734
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,898
How's that?

735
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,403
Come on. Come on. Whoo!

736
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,779
(BOTH GRUNTING)

737
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:46,245

739
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,588
Yeah. Thing is,

740
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,008
you weren't at that fight, right?

741
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,765
Too busy putting a bullet
in that girl's face.

742
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,730
Sometimes I work weekends, bro.

744
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,531
So...

745
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,826
you were just gonna...

746
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,412
what, keep it to yourself?

747
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,956
It don't concern you, dude.

748
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,250
No, no.
It does.

750
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,006
I'll buy you some eggs, come on.

751
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,883
Did you do it for her?

752
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,552
Huh?

753
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,637
Don't worry about it.

754
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,014
Oh.

755
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,391
Gangster Rio had to whip it out.

756
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:52,436
I got it covered.

757
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,021
Show the soccer mom how big it is.

758
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,023
She knows.

759
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,818
(CHUCKLES) Right.

760
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,988
Aww, what's up?
Wore you out already?

761
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,201
No, cousin.

762
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,787
Round two.

763
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,622
All right, come on. Yo?

764
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:17,461
What's that for?

765
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,550
Doctor.

766
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:29,014
That was quick.
So there was this electrical line.

767
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,682
Uh-huh.
For the street lights.

768
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,267
Cool.
And it fell.

769
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:34,520
Can I have that back?

770
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,064
On my house.
On your car.

771
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:39,316
I was fine because of the whole
rubber tire thing,

772
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:42,110
but long story short,
it ignited the gas tank.

773
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,488

Hey.
Hey.

00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,958
You want the good news or the bad news?
Good.

778
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,544
You can stay at St. Anne's.

779
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:00,546
How?
Well...

780
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,422
Yo, you're out of Q-tips.

781
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:07,469
That's my toothbrush.

782
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,306
I'll get you back.

In case it wasn't clear,
that's the bad news.

786
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,494
So how'd you get it?

787
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,833
Just being myself.

788
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,338
Sometimes it's worth it.

789
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,467
What are you gonna buy?

790
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,262
Something special for you.

791

How'd you get that?

Mm-hmm.

799
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,644
Never did it for her.

800
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,864
Okay.

801
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,326
I did it for me.
