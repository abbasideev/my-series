00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,908
You already have one!

562
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:00,284
It's just such a steal.

563
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,453
Yeah.
From us.

Nope.

00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:17,964
I had to do what I had to do.

00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,048
Huh.

598
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,676

You never were a big-picture guy.

609
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,243
Because I don't see it your way, right?

No.

611
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:49,954
Never did.

in the back seat asking us

if we'd rather die
of a thousand bee stings
or be mauled by a bear.

Yeah, 'cause she thinks
there's a right answer.

633
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,770

'Cause eventually, you go numb.

The bear's way faster.

638
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,989
Not if it starts at your feet
and works his way up.

639
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,494
What if the bees decide
to sting you one at a time?

640
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,245
Like they're waiting in line at the DMV?

641

If she was here, she would settle it.

642
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,252
No, she'd tell us we were both wrong.

643
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,672
Just weird not having her around.

644
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:30,721
It'd be weird
not having you around, either.

to make that deal.

We're back in the club.

729
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,656
I knew you'd get it.

730
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:00,866
I gotta go print.

731
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:03,869
Make sure Harry
doesn't eat all the taco shells.

732
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:04,995
(CHUCKLES)

733
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,831
So, uh...
whose name is it in?

734
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:12,878
Ah, she's not going anywhere, is she?

735
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,421
Nah-uh.

736
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,674
Family first, huh?

737
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,926
Now you're getting it, Hill.

738
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:21,887
Okay.

739
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,055
Good to see you.

740
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,348
Bye.
Bye, babe.

741
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:29,687
(SIGHS)

742
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,403
(SCOFFS)

743
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,529
I Knew it.

744
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:43,617
No, thanks.

745
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,911
For back there.

746
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,581
Oh.

747
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,270
Running would have made more sense.

748
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:16,066
Well...

749
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,319
Couldn't have you
getting arrested in front
of your grandpa, could we?

750
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:20,988
He's not my grandpa.

751
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,240
Then who is he?

752
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,576
They call him the janitor.

753
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,453
Oh, no.

754
00:37:28,203 --> 00:37:29,246
Did clean up.

755
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,249
Clean up?

756
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:34,001
Anything that needed to be dissolved.

757
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,294
Okay.

758
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:36,462
Then flushed.

759
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,546
Got it.

760
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,882
He was like a grandpa.

761
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:41,925
That's sweet.

762
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:45,929
The kind of guy you want
to do things for.

763
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,141
Like that sister of yours.

764
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,601
It's not the same thing.

765
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,312
Mm.

766
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,774
How can one bitch
have such a hold on so many people?

767
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,859
She's not all that.

768
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,571
Then why are we both here?

769
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,483
Let's call the ladies.

770
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:41,665
He should have taken me.

771
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,294
He never will.

772
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,261
I need career advice.

773
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,601
(ALL LAUGHING)

774
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,938
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
What about... what about, uh... lip balm?

775
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,232
Oh, forget lip balm.
No, lip balm sells.

776
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:09,776
Dude, dude, you've got to have lip balms.
Yeah?

777
00:42:10,652 --> 00:42:11,653
What do you think, man?

778
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,827
I think I got something on her.
