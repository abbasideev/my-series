Then she'll change the alarm.

217
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,974
Why don't we just steal the whole thing?

Hey, Now you're talking.

219
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:29,396
Okay. And then what do we do with
a two-ton printing press?

220
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,316
I don't know. We put it in your garage.

221
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,528
So Mrs. Karpinski can
just drop in and borrow the leaf blower?

What's she gonna do?
Call a Mountie?

223
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,533
Or my kids walk in
and mom is printing cash.

be a problem.

You here with us.

363
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,980
Well, I have no place else to go.

364
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,774
Can't you...
bunk with that old man?

365
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,277
Oh, no. Murphy's super private.

(SIGHS WITH FRUSTRATION)

367
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,197
It's just...
It's too weird.

368
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:43,283
Just give it a chance.

369
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,826
It's too weird for my son.

370
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,203
Well, I'm his guardian.

371
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:49,372
On paper.

372

373
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,796
Yeah, all right. Fine.

374
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,341
I'll, uh...

375
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:02,927
Yeah, I'll go get my stuff.

376
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,888
Thank you.

377
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,766
And yeah, I'll let the school know.

378
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,184
Whoa...

379
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:10,894
let the school know what?

380
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,398
I'm no longer your domestic partner.

381
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,234
You can't do that.

382
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,652
Well, I can't lie.

383
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,154
I mean, you can.

384
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:22,781
But I'm not gonna.

385
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,783
It's for my kid.

386
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:26,284
Sorry.

387
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,454
It's just too weird.

388
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,675

own a paper store.

390
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:48,097
Name literally anything else.

391

392
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,725
Same diff.

393
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,394
Or like a jam store in Vermont.

394
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,396
I mean something that wouldn't be
in a Lifetime movie.

395
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
Okay, then I don't know.

396
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,405
(EXHALES)

397
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,657
Okay, let's go.

398
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,369
ANNIE: We kind of have
a weird thing going on
with the neighbors.

399
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:11,704
Yes, well, the quicker the better.

400
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,122
And quieter.

401
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:17,544
We'd do it during business
hours, but the new model
arrives in the morning.

402
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,547
And we've really
got to hit the ground running, right?

403
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,423
Yes. Mother's Day, graduation.

404
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,008
I mean, they're all
right around the corner.

405
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,218
Father's Day.

406
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,553
Can't leave out the dads.

407
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,846
Gonna stop you right there.

408
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,556
We have cash.

409
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:31,558
We're not doing this.

410
00:22:33,142 --> 00:22:34,143
A lot of cash.

411
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:35,603
It's not the money.

412
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,565
Okay, you know what?
I'm just going to be real with you.

413
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,943
We are straight-up stealing this thing.

414
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,280
You don't need to
know the why, but just know that our life

415
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,283
kind of depends on it.
And you can waste time with morality,

416
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,367
that's fine.

417
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,743
But just know that you are looking

418
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:55,081
at three mostly good
moms who really need your help.

419
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,836
We don't have a problem with any of that.

420
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:05,758
Thing just won't fit.
It's too big. It won't go
through the door.

421
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,181
But if you've got
anything smaller you want to steal,

422
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,434
we're cool with that.

423
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,025
RUBY: How did it get in here?

424
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,819
ANNIE: Maybe they built
the building around it.

425
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,700
This ancient machine
from Germany was just sitting here?

426
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,744
Maybe.

427
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:35,204
In a field.

428
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:37,373
Maybe.

429
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,627
Until Dorothy stumbles upon it

430
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,755
and decides, card shop.

431
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924
Maybe.

432
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:48,051
Someone must have
put it together piece by piece.

433
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,469
Well, can't we find that guy?

434
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,720
How?

435
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:52,597
Well, who services it?

436
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,516
Repair guy.
Okay, so we find that guy and...

437
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,893
Who knows Dorothy!

438
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,146
Then can we just
get somebody who's like, handy?

439
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:01,230
At this hour?

440
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:02,941
There are apps.

441
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,233
RUBY: What? TaskRabbit?

442
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,235
There are others.

443
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,738
What's it like inside there?

444
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:10,657

Earth's still round?

445
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:12,367
Is the sky even blue?

447
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:17,246
You think he could do it?

448
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,457
He took apart our dishwasher last week.

449
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,834
I guess this is kind of like
an appliance.

450
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,503
Would he?

451
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,883
So how do we convince him?

452
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,053
Not we.

453
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,140

00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,767
Come on.
What's going on?

455
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,060
Come on.
I need your help.

456
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,562
Now?
Yeah. It can't wait.
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,648

No.

Is it my mom?

No. I need your tool box.

Oh, it's the toilet again.

00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:50,613
No.

464
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:02,959
No.

465
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,712
Listen.

466
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,171
No.

467
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,008
This is the only way
we're gonna turn this around.

468
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,345
How does helping him help me?

469
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,682
Because if I keep him
in business, he won't notice
what I'm doing on the side.

470
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,310
What are you doing on the side now?

471

For my lawyer?

I don't care,
as long as they can't find us.

474
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,448
I'd rather have a lawyer.

475
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,826
You would need the entire
bar association to save you now.

476
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:44,167

what went into all of this.

for us to find our groove.

he's not gonna be in your head?

this is what gets us out.

how are we gonna put it together?

00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:14,705
and it gets 14 miles
to the gallon and there's a stove.

543
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,457
How can you afford that?

544
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,000
I can't.

545
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,503
But I also can't afford to have my son be
kicked out of his school.

546
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,799
Wow, you want me out that bad?

547
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,426
I never wanted you in.

549
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,518
Well, uh...

550
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,980
Yeah, if we're being honest...

551
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,942
Please. (SIGHS)

552
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,321
I kind of just assumed
he was a little dick.

553
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,824
My son?

554
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,702
You know, he...
he goes to some fancy ass school.

555
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,205
He has a bathroom.

556
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:01,210
But, uh, and now that
I've hung with him, he's like,

557
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:03,671
a regular dude.

558
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,132
Thanks, I think.

559
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,969
Yeah, that school could probably use
someone dope like him.

560
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,140
That's why I got to do whatever it takes.

561
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:20,563

00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,610
Yeah, that you can forget about the home
on wheels.

564
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,073
What are you going to want instead?

565
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:33,993
Oh, just keep him in lacrosse.

566
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,913
And don't let him become
some theater kid.

567
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,833
Where are you going to live?

568
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,418
With Murphy.

569
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,795
I thought he was too private.

570
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:47,798
I snagged him a refrigerator box
from Best Buy

571
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,216
so he owes me.

572
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:50,801
Gotcha.

573
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,678
Uh...

574
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,891
Can I put on Maddow while I pack?

575
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,518
Sure.

(MAN SPEAKING ON TV)
It's real, people...

577
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:04,607
The stain-fighting power of OxiClean.

WOMAN: It's how I did the towels.

579
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,526

00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:19,038
Pair it with a restorative
night cream. Great add-on.

586
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:22,208
Yeah, but do we use it
before or after the face wash?

587
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,377
I don't know, Cory,
you're gonna wash off $90 face cream

588
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,004
right after you put it on?

589
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:29,256
I robbed a greeting card store.

590
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,806
What's that, Dean?

591
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:40,893
Stole a printing press.

592
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,899
Is that how you got the bracelet?

593
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,652
That's...

594
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,322
because my wife was laundering

595
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:55,407
a gang's money through my business.

596
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:00,955
Yeah, but what'd you need the press for?

597
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,084
She uses it to make counterfeit.

598
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:14,885
What happened to her?

599
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:20,516
Not a damn thing.

600
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:24,228
And you're the one in the bracelet.

601
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,441
I owed her.

602
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,570
That's a big-time debt.

603
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,408

00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,013
Exactly.

611
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,557

You weren't home.

I got 'em.

do it wrong, you get a penalty.

00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,200
My guys can't clean the Queen here.

724
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,538
You said all we had to do was print it.

725
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,915
Yeah. And then drop it.

726
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,004
I assumed that you meant in our country.

727
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,966
Jesus. Not again.

728
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:52,884
Why can't it ever be Mexico?

729
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,264
When?

730
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,850
When I'm ready.

731
00:42:04,646 --> 00:42:06,314
Avoided it for so long.
Don't.

732
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:08,734
But I think we all
knew this day would come.

733
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:11,236
It's like you want it to happen.

734
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:13,155
I'm just saying.

735
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,282
You stay in the game long enough,

736
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,534
something's bound to wind up in your ass.
