Tomorrow?

I'll make cookies.

mini kKnanom chan.

What's that?

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,567
The traditional Thai dessert.

216
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,735
"Chan" means "layer."

217
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,237

366
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,139
Just plug and play.

367
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,809
Where's the little girl's room?
Got to tinkle.

368
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:42,602
Uh, just there on the left.

369
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,439
Great turnout, right?

370
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,524
It's crazy.

371
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,609
I'm trying to close an X5.

372
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,694
Nice.

373
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,573
Ooh. Heads up, that was fast.

374
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,952
Well, Terry, you seem
to know your way around a Spa.

375
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,204
So I would love to introduce you
to my husband

376
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,373
and have him walk you through
some of the technical features

377
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,457
and see what you think.

378
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,750
I think you're shut down.

379
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,961
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:10,797
I'm a building inspector
with Wayne County.

381
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,174
You folks got yourself
a load of violations.

382
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,141
Painted over your sprinkler heads.

383
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,226
Gonna have to dock you on that.

384
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:30,150
Got a residential power strip
juicing all your units.

385
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,735
Gotta dock ya.

386
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,989
Centerline of the toilet in your tinkler

387
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,199
is less than 15 inches from this wall.

388
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,619
That's a two-fer, plumbing and ADA.

389
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,329
So what do I gotta do, Dean?

390
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,747
Dock me?

391
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,831
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,795
So that's sprinklers, wiring,
construction, plumbing.

393
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,423
This could take months.

394
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,133
If you're lucky.

395
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,178
Can I get another one
of these for my niece?

396
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,764
Yeah, at the front.

397
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,266
All right, folks,

398
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,435
that's a wrap on Boland Bubbles.

399
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:08,104
Don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

400
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,530
PHOEBE: All right, ladies.
Now pick up those buns.

401
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,240
No slacking. Let's go.

402
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,909
It's like a friends and family discount.

403
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,911
I didn't know y'all were open.
Oh, we're not.

404
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:26,373
But, you know,
you guys are, like, tastemakers.

405
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,832
I'm telling you,

406
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,502
once you step foot
in a hot and steamy Boland,

407
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:33,129
we will not be able to keep it a secret.

408
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,341
We just put in a new deck.

409
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,885
Well, you know what goes with a new deck.

410
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,763
Lily just started private school.

411
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,473
We can't afford it.

412
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:44,766
I'm not even supposed to be selling them.

413
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,060
PHOEBE: Let's keep it going.
I'll work with you.

414
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,771
Less mouth, more ass.

415
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
(WHISPERS)
I have brochures.

416
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,441
PHOEBE: You got to breathe!

417
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,235
You want to stop peeing when you sneeze?

418
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,363
BETH: You can just pick 'em up
and pass 'em out at drop-off.

419
00:19:58,446 --> 00:19:59,698
PHOEBE: Tuck your butts.

420
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:02,784
I'll hook anybody up.

421
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,373
Selling hot tubs in my class?

422
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,042
Sorry.

423
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,630
Do I count as friend and family?

424
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,217
Uh... Yeah, sure.

425
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,385
How low can you go?

426
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,971
I mean pricing.

427
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:24,597
Oh.

428
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:26,141
Um...

429
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:30,145
Lower than my pelvic floor
after four kids.

430
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:32,939
You take Venmo?

431
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,691
I'll take anything.

432
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:46,786
Hey.

433
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,912
Hey.

434
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,205
Where's Ben?

435
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,458
Cleaning the house.

436
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,542
Alone?

437
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,960
Why?

438
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,628
We need to talk about him.

439
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,422
(SIGHS)

440
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:01,676
It's not cool, right?

441
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,802
He told you?

442
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:07,891
What do we do?
I don't know.

443
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:10,643
Nancy thinks we should
make him switch schools.

444
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,480
I mean, maybe she's right.

445
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
Over one party?

446
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:17,692
Huh?

447
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,195
Didn't the cops call you?

448
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,447
What are you talking about?

449
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,240
Ben threw a rager at our house.

450
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,575
Well, where the hell were you?

451
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:27,702
We were just at Nancy's parents' cabin.

452
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,204
What did you think we were talking about?

453
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:31,706
That he has no friends.

454
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,542
He had, like, 100 people at our house.

455
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:35,960
Who?

456
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,379
Sam, Eddie, Janice,
the whole lacrosse team.

457
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,839
I don't know, the usual suspects.

458
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,133
I don't know any of those suspects.

459
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,594
Okay, well, they all
had their shoes on in our house,

460
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:46,179
and Nancy is losing her mind.

461
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:54,896
He plays lacrosse?

462
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,481
Yeah. How do you not know that?

463
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:57,899
How did you know that?

464
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,567
'Cause I bought him the gear.

465
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,528
(SIGHS)

466
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,864
Sorry. Look, you've been really busy.

467
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:06,741
That's not why.

468
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,245
We just know all the parents
around the neighborhood and stuff.

469
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,581
And lacrosse.

470
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:15,124
Don't go there.

471
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,626
Already there.

472
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,714
He just knows
you wouldn't really be into it.

473
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,094
What? His whole new secret fancy life?

474
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,349
Well, he's got a game
next weekend if you want to come.

475
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
You could meet all the usual suspects.

476
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,984
Can I borrow something
from Nancy to wear?

477
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,278
No, your boobs are too big.

478
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,362
(CHUCKLES)

479
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:50,952
We would love for you
to take another look at our facility.

480
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:53,955
You couldn't have possibly
fixed everything that fast.

481
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, we came up
with some creative solutions.

482
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,335
Well, I've been doing this for 19 years.

483
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,296
And believe me, I've seen it all.

484
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,463
Have you seen this?

485
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,341
TERRY: Looks the same.

486
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,218
Are you trying to waste my time?

487
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:13,349
Um, we are trying to make it
worth your while.

488
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,315
DEAN: (CLEARS THROAT)
Yes, uh...

489
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,109
We Know how, uh, how tricky wiring can be.

490
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:27,322
So please just let us know
if there's anything you'd like us to do.

491
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:32,201
And, obviously, we can't knock down
the whole tinkler,

492
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:35,663
so we got a new toilet.

493
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:38,333
DEAN: We haven't installed it yet.

494
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,501
What do you, uh...
What do you think?

495
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,462
Did we pass?

496
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,758
(SIGHS)

497
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,189
Buy you a drink?

498
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:02,273
I own the place.

499
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,028
Why don't you buy me one then?

500
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,613
Why would I do that?

501
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,699
Boland Bubbles is in business.

502
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,203
That's what he's calling it?

503
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,288
Yeah, I think it's cute.

504
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,457
Yeah. Real panty-dropper.

505
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:24,253
Yeah, well, it's fully operational.

506
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,755
Your money is being cleaned,

507
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:28,132
laundered, folded and pressed as we speak.

508
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,302
Um, a tequila for the chief.

509
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:32,845
Top shelf.

510
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:35,390
And, um...

511
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:40,603
Do you have anything
without alcohol or caffeine?

512
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,110
Just bourbon, neat.

513
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:00,957
Could be more excited.

514
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:02,750
Ain't always about you, is it?

515
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:04,585
It's what you wanted.

516
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:07,630
You know what?
I got other stuff on my mind.

517
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,507
I need that gun.

518
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,722
I'm sorry, what?

519
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:18,933
We're up and running.

520
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:20,935
I'm making you bank.

521
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,564
Doesn't make sense
to hold it over me anymore.

522
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,443
You know what?

523
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,281
You're right.

524
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,162
I am?

525
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:40,913
Yeah.

526
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,540
I'm not gonna hold it over you anymore.

527
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:47,336
Thanks.

528
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,589
Cops might, though.

529
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,928
You see, the lawyer says,

530
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:58,139
I got to go in about
that friend of yours.

531
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:04,270
Apparently, they think
I had something to do with it,

532
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:05,438
which is just crazy.

533
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,151
(CHUCKLES)

534
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,779
And what are you gonna tell him?

535
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,033
I'm not sure I've got to say anything.

536
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,248
If you give it to them,
I'm not the only thing that goes away.

537
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,003
Mmm-hmm.

538
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:31,422
Priorities, huh?

539
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:43,184
I'll take another one.

540
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,529
There's a one-way to St. Petersburg.
Leaves at midnight.

541
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,406
Florida?
Russia.

542
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,034
Why Russia?
Because they'll give you asylum.

543
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,120
How do you even know
he's gonna turn over the gun?

544
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,372
How do I know he's not?
Exactly.

545
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:05,873
It's why we got to get your ass
on this plane

546
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,583
to Sheremetyevo Airport, now.

547
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,585
She's gonna live in Russia now?

548
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:12,588
Yeah. I mean, Snowden lived
in the terminal.

549
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,215
Her kids?

550
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,092
We'll sneak 'em out one by one.

551
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:20,263
So it's gonna be one big happy family
living in a terminal.

552
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,681
Snowden did.

553
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,100
Eating Sbarro's.
Snowden did.

554
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:26,018
'Cause they have Sbarro's in Russia?

555
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,645
Since 1997.

556
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:30,857
The point is,
you can't be extradited for murder.

557
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,692
You just need a lawyer.

558
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,529
I was the last person she was seen with.

559
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:37,780
Okay, a good one.

560
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,615
And I lied to the police.

561
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,659
A real good one.
And I stole her bird.

562
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:43,077
Technically, I stole her bird.

563
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,872
Okay, where's her power-walking boyfriend?
He'll back you up.

564
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,081
ANNIE: He's probably still in diapers

565
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,624
since the last time he saw gang friend.

566
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,084
You didn't pull the trigger.

567
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:52,795
I may as well have.

568
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,429
What are you looking for?

569
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:03,723
She's making me mental.

570
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,527
BETH: Dear Dean,
I spent the last two years
cooking and cleaning.

571
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,946
I've learned I'm excellent at both.

572
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:21,073
And you will be, too,

573
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,660
because I'm going to tell you
exactly what to do, and how to do it.

574
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,787
My friends will make the money.

575
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:30,082
You're gonna buy hot tubs with it.
A lot of them.

576
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,837
From as many wholesalers
as you can, just in case.

577
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,882
Spread it around.
This is where you shine, Dean.

578
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:40,718
Price doesn't matter.
It's all profit.

579
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,011
Now you're gonna Sell 'em.

580
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,309
And this is how you hide it.

581
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,813
Inflate the sales price
or the number of the units sold,

582
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,232
ideally both.

583
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,399
It's pretty simple.

584
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,487
I know you can do this.
You can still live the dream.

585
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,822
Nobody needs to know how you got there.

586
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,951
Love, Beth.

587
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,705
In my nite life I don't think twice

588
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,624
Everything is so nice

589
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,337
Loving in the luxury of the nite life

590
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,089
Everything is all right

591
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:23,135
Blinded by the headlights
Driving past midnight

592
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,804
Looks like a still life

593
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:28,057
Give me something cheap

594
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,350
Not enough sleep

595
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,102
Which one do ! keep?

596
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,229
You are my nite life

597
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,161
DEAN: Remember when those raccoons

598
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,122
tracked the mud all over the downspout?

599
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,293
I need to tell you something.

600
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,006
Look at this.
I have to repaint the entire door.

601
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,009
And it's all over,
everywhere that inspector woman touched.

602
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,260
I have to redo the bathroom,

603
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,594
the front area over there.

604
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,679
It's, like, what?

605
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:07,972
Did she change the oil on her car

606
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:09,056
before she came here?

607
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,184
And Eric, I mean, he's already
returned the stuff,

608
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,644
and we're never gonna match the color.

609
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,439
I mean, it's Swiss coffee
and pale avocado.

610
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:17,940
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

611
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:23,779
Hey.

612
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:27,366
What do you want to tell me?

613
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,995
Nothing.

614
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,503
Stopped by the school today.

615
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:41,714
RUBY: What for?

616
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:43,591
Tell little man's principal
that if Ms. Jackson

617
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:44,967
can't take an honest fart joke,

618
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,344
then maybe our son's not the problem.

619
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:49,638
How'd that go over?

620
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,557
He starts in Ms. V's class on Monday.

621
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,102
Bad people, not bad parents.

622
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:58,773
What happens when he does
the same thing in her class?

623
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:02,443
Well, she sees kids as kids.

624
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:04,862
What's this?

625
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,405
Science homework.

626
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,948
He didn't do it.
Oh, he did it.

627
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,285
Why did he draw a picture of a cactus?

628
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,453
It's not a cactus.

629
00:31:12,828 --> 00:31:14,246
Meerkat?
Nope.

630
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,248
Prairie dog?
Penis.

631
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,752
Math.

632
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,755
I'm guessing it's not a number.

633
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,840
And history.

634
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,177
I'm gonna get ahead of this one

635
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,261
and let you know right now,

636
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,554
it's not the Washington Monument.

637
00:31:32,973 --> 00:31:34,183
I was really hoping it was.

638
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,812
Me too.

639
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,148
Uh-uh-uh.

640
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,443
I'll call about the test tomorrow.

641
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,663
MAN ON TV:
...who work as well together as meerkats.

642
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:58,999
These squirrel-sized members...

643
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,627
ANNIE: Hey.
Hi.

644
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,587
How was Dad's?

645
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,589
Boring.

646
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,716
How was the dinner?
Plant-based.

647
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,802
Um, I got homework, so...

648
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:12,930
Hey, I thought maybe next weekend

649
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:14,974
we could, like, go to the movies?

650
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:17,101
You know, buy one ticket
and then sneak into five?

651
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:18,853
I think I might go to Dad's again.

652
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,312
You were just there.

653
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,440
I know, but I have a school thing.

654
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,151
Oh. Sick.
Can I come?

655
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,737
It's sort of not for parents.

656
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,952
Yeah, no, that's...
That's totally cool.

657
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:37,580
But I'm still totally down
for the movie thing.

658
00:32:38,747 --> 00:32:39,999
Hey, Ben.

659
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,837
Happy birthday.

660
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,422
Thanks.

661
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,312
(SLURPING)

662
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:06,901
Sure you don't want a fork?

663
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,736
Mmm-mmm.

664
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:11,280
Just thought it might be a little more

665
00:33:12,364 --> 00:33:13,824
efficient for your, uh,

666
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:16,535
situation.

667
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,579
What do you want?

668
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:25,252
Do you have kids?

669
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:29,757
I got a little girl in Cincinnati.

670
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,676
You get to see her at all?

671
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,180
I try to get there for her birthdays.

672
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,350
That sucks.

673
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,185
She's got a good mom.

674
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:43,812
It's better this way.

675
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,861
I need a favor.

676
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,365
You sound like your sister.

677
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,744
She's a really good mom too.

678
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,539
So?

679
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,797
So it really shouldn't be
her prints on that gun.

680
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:26,772
Dumpling?

681
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:22,911
When are you going in?

682
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,996
Soon.

683
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:30,502
I've been thinking a lot about it.

684
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:31,962
I'll bet you have.

685
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:37,384
It's hard to wrap your
brain around, actually,

686
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:42,097
that each of our fingerprints is totally
and completely unique.

687
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,267
Snowflakes too.

688
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:48,354
And tiger stripes.
Like, why?

689
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,232
Don't know, but it really
works out in my favor.

690
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,486
Does it?

691
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:02,993
Forgot one.

692
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:04,828
What's this?

693
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,747
You can keep it.

694
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:10,751
I've got the original somewhere safe.

695
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,808
Just crazy

696
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:29,603
that there's a way to get everyone,

697
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,773
even tigers.

698
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,366
Let me know what the cops say.

699
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,081
Is that booze?

700
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,752
This boy has worked a penis

701
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,045
into almost every one of these.

702
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,180
What did the specialist say?

703
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,350
You're probably gonna want some of this.

704
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,687
It's that bad?
It's pretty bad.

705
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:14,523
Like special-school bad?

706
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:16,734
Mmm-hmm.
The real expensive kind.

707
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,288
This says he should be in eighth grade.

708
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,748
Yep.

709
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,750
But he's in second grade.

710
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,252
Yeah.

711
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,298
No.

712
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,133
Boy's a damn genius.

713
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,431
What are we gonna do?

714
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,850
How are we gonna afford that school?

715
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,647
BETH: And I went ahead
and made some khao tom mud

716
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,776
banana leaf sticky rice thing,
It's delish.

717
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,530
Oh, but the dye still needs
to dry in the chut Thais,
so that'll take a minute.

718
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,242
Yes, I am feeling much better.

719
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,371
I just needed to take control
of the situation.

720
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,834
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

721
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,003
Wait, can... I'm sorry,
can I call you back?

722
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,134
You called.

723
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,934
May I?

724
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:37,272
Uh... yeah.
Let me just grab you a plate.

725
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,066
I lived off these on Koh Samui.

726
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:43,403
Where's your furniture?

727
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,989
It was stolen.

728
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,950
By whom?

729
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,785
Your target.

730
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,246
Remember?

731
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,332
Although, by this point,
he's gonna die of old age first.

732
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:56,875
I have other clients.

733
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,837
I am paying you a lot of money.

734
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,844
For you.

735
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,058
From Chile.
I don't support how they're made,

736
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,812
but their little hands are SO precise.

737
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,526
Move me up on your schedule.

738
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:24,486
Try them on.

739
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,868
You've done the legwork.

740
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,371
It's harder than I thought.

741
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,206
He is not hard to find.

742
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,332
He's not the problem.

743
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,293
Well, who is?
You.

744
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:45,132
Stunning. All of it.

745
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:47,175
What?

746
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,260
You're distracting.

747
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,720
How?

748
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,181
I can't stop thinking about you.

749
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,226
Mmm.

750
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,312
(SPEAKING THAI)

751
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,606
And if I'm honest...

752
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:04,818
That's why I've been dragging my feet.

753
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,366
Well, what am I supposed to do here?

754
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,534
Have dinner with me.

755
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,376
When did they get in?

756
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,003
This morning.
DL Dave, too?

757
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,296
The whole posse.

758
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:25,422
Is he pissed?

759
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:27,674
You charged a hot tub
to the United States Government.

760
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,552
How do I look?
Like you're gonna cry.

761
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,762
Well, I'm not.
Don't.

762
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:33,597
I won't.
You haven't cried in three days.

763
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,973
So?
You're due.

764
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:36,975
I promise, okay?

765
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,687
(CRYING) They bought the place in cash,

766
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,439
and they're selling 'em,
like, way below cost.

767
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:44,483
And the only way that works is if the plan
to go out of business.

768
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:46,401
So before you send me home, just, like,

769
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,404
please put forensic
accounting on it, because I swear to God,

770
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,698
if I am wrong about this, I will resign.

771
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,492
This will be the best gift
I've ever given you.

772
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:54,826
Just trust me.

773
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,578
What do you think, Dave?

774
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,832
No one is shipping you.

775
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,209
(SNIFFING) Thank you.

776
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,544
DAVE: Let's get the team on it.
Yes.

777
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,464
There's a pattern here.
Yes.

778
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:09,716
His car dealership got busted too.

779
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,510
Wait, sorry. What?

780
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,220
Put a tail on this guy.

781
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,181
Guy? Wait, wait.

782
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:17,683
Why? Why is it the guy?

783
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,769
And, fellas, let's tighten the net.

784
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:22,771
Last time he got off on a technicality.

785
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,818
MAN: Let's get out of here.

786
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:37,244
Just to see you there cryin' boy

787
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,832
Brings to mind

788
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:49,172
All the things I've told you one time

789
00:41:55,178 --> 00:42:01,476
I'll sit there and cry boy
The way that I did one time

790
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,691
And wish you could die boy

791
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:10,902
To get that woman off of your mind

792
00:42:12,946 --> 00:42:16,033
Go on and fall all to pieces, son

793
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:19,745
The way that she made me do

794
00:42:23,915 --> 00:42:26,251
I know what you're goin' through

795
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,170
And I feel...
