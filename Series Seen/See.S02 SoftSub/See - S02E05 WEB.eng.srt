1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,003
Thank you for coming to me.

2
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:12,840
Ladies, lords. Thank you
for your pledges of support.

3
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:14,951
Captain Gosset, how goes the count?

4
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:19,515
Our outposts at Hareburr and Currlye
have pledged 25 soldiers.

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,059
Lebnin has pledged an additional 30.

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:26,738
Lebnin considers it an honor,
not just a duty, Your Majesty.

7
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:31,218
I stand with you,
as my father stood with your father.

8
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:34,542
When we combine that
with our Pennsan troops...

9
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:42,062
Nothing from Altoona? Can that be so?

10
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:44,917
Lord Diego, is it?

11
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:49,154
Your Majesty, Altoona stands ready
with an additional 20 troops.

12
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:51,906
Ten less than Lebnin.

13
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:55,261
Your city is twice as populated.

14
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:57,680
We are approaching the planting season.

15
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:00,934
The town council felt that
the farmworkers must continue to plant,

16
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,585
or we will face a shortage.

17
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:08,023
Lord Diego, are you at all aware
of what transpired at Kanzua?

18
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,676
We all heard tales of your suffering.

19
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:15,949
Tell me, if I destroyed
your home in front of you,

20
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,206
drowned everyone you knew and loved,

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,395
murdered your wife and your children,

22
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,648
would you be worried about crops?

23
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:27,253
My apologies, Your Highness.

24
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:30,865
Perhaps we should
go to Altoona and find out.

25
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,559
The Trivantians
made contact. They wish to meet.

26
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,444
Lord Diego, I ask again.

27
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,378
How many troops do you pledge?

28
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,873
Thirty troops, my queen.

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,800
Very well.

30
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:52,906
Captain Gosset?

31
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,682
The count continues
with chambers in Monroe.

32
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,522
Do you ever imagine
the fire is speaking to you?

33
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:05,777
When I was alone after Father died
and you disappeared,

34
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,987
I swore it told me secrets.

35
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,963
Why didn't you tell me.

36
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:14,453
Trivantes requested a diplomatic summit?

37
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,855
Because it doesn't matter.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,191
Imagine Father's reaction.

39
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:22,396
The mighty Triangle frightened of me.

40
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,731
Begging me for peace.

41
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:27,299
- We have to consider it.
- Why?

42
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:32,115
We have righteousness on our side.
God leading the charge.

43
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:37,353
Yeah, well, even so, on the battlefield,
the men must believe.

44
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:39,463
- In God?
- In you.

45
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,583
They must believe that their queen did

46
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,888
everything in her power to protect them.

47
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,990
My men will do as they're commanded.

48
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,959
Sibeth.

49
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,932
A soldier must believe in his cause,
must believe in his queen,

50
00:02:56,956 --> 00:03:00,419
must love her to the point that
he would be willing to die for her.

51
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:09,279
Imagine if you could stop Trivantes
from encroaching on our land

52
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:12,473
without sacrificing a single soldier.

53
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,911
You already have their obedience,

54
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:19,355
but if you manage this,
you would have their love.

55
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,802
It's never been done.

56
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:28,081
Well, when was the last time
the Trivantians asked for a parley?

57
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:31,452
- Never.
- That's right.

58
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:36,540
Maybe having God on your side means...

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,587
you win the war without
having to fight the battle.

60
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:55,661
The Trivantians have no queen or king.

61
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,206
I cannot negotiate
with common politicians.

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,816
Of course not.

63
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,903
But I can go as your emissary.

64
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:07,657
As the princess and as your sister,
I can speak for you.

65
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:15,874
Very well.

66
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:24,633
Thank you, Sibeth.

67
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:31,441
Of course, any treaty
will require a formal apology

68
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:35,170
and reparations for
the attack on Kanzua.

69
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:39,858
What? You know that's not possible.

70
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:46,615
We're going to win a war without
fighting a battle, are we not?

71
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:49,827
I would say anything is possible.

72
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:20,758
So you thought
your wife was dead, but she wasn't,

73
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:22,802
and now you're about
to be together again.

74
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,947
You must be so excited.

75
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:26,806
I'm excited, and I've
never even met her.

76
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,559
Of course, it's complicated
now that she's a princess.

77
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,978
Strange, isn't it?

78
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:34,606
That she never once thought to mention
that she was a princess.

79
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,818
It's hard not to think of an omission
like that as a lie of sorts.

80
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:41,530
Ooh, if I were you, I'd be thinking
the entire relationship was a lie.

81
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:43,324
But you did raise two children together.

82
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,952
It would be hard
to lie through all of that.

83
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:49,497
I imagine if I were you,
I'd be very angry.

84
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,984
Also, confused and nervous.
But also so happy that she's alive.

85
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:56,880
Oh, I suppose I wouldn't
know how to feel.

86
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:59,606
What do I know?
I've never even been in love.

87
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,911
Maybe that's 'cause you
talk too much.

88
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,936
I, uh... I think it's dead.

89
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,903
I could, uh... I could
run drills with you.

90
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,448
See how you do with something alive.

91
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,121
I only fight soldiers.

92
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,125
And bales of hay, apparently.

93
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,061
Come on. It'll be fun. We...

94
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:55,049
You're right.

95
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:58,636
That was exhilarating. Thank you.

96
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,713
I'm not going to risk the wrath
of the princess

97
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:18,199
by putting a scratch on her boy.

98
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:22,511
Now, go away.

99
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:30,045
Toad!

100
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,303
I couldn't save my sister.

101
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:41,222
I couldn't help my dad.

102
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,021
I need to be able to defend my family.

103
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,816
I'm too used to having
other people do it for me.

104
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:55,614
I'm sure the princess can
appoint you a proper trainer.

105
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:59,551
You're right. I'll ask
her to appoint you.

106
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,588
And why me?

107
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,508
Because we get along so well.

108
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:17,638
I'm done training for the day.

109
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:35,365
- General, sir.
- Lieutenant, come.

110
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,964
- It's sharp.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,218
Virgin steel. Put through
a new forging process.

112
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,806
Wielded properly, it won't be stopped.

113
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,810
I'm rearming the entire battalion.

114
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,439
Here.

115
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,401
This one is yours.

116
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,213
I don't understand.

117
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,867
Didn't the Triangle offer the Payans
an overture for peace?

118
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,472
The queen doesn't
falsely accuse another nation

119
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,725
unless she is looking for a fight.

120
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:25,978
The peace talks will fail,
and we will make sure they do.

121
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:29,464
You have been very vocal
with the Triangle.

122
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:33,069
If something goes wrong,
they will lay the blame at your feet.

123
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:35,346
Which is why you will go in my place.

124
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:43,395
If there's a chance for peace with Paya,
shouldn't we try for it?

125
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,392
As it is, we're overcommitted

126
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,293
on the western front
fighting the Ganites.

127
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,318
Wren.

128
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:52,956
Wren.

129
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:58,578
The Payan queen has grown bold.
She's forgotten who we are.

130
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:06,003
It is in the best interest of the
republic that we remind her.

131
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,608
All right. This way. Stay close.

132
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,553
It's Tamacti Jun.

133
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:58,475
Wait here.

134
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:06,860
Go.

135
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,049
I told you to wait
while I gather intelligence.

136
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:13,426
Is she here or not?

137
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,488
Princess Maghra is here
and safe for now.

138
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,665
You're not telling us something.

139
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,819
She's with the queen.
That's all I know for certain.

140
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:25,772
And Kofun?

141
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,607
I've heard nothing.

142
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:29,294
His Witchfinder escort was traveling

143
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:31,070
without the benefit of compass maps.

144
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:33,281
Perhaps we arrived first.

145
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:34,449
Let's go find her.

146
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:36,117
Seek out the highest house.

147
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,077
The queen will have
fortified herself there.

148
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,186
You're not coming?

149
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:42,874
The queen thinks I'm dead, which
is how it will have to stay for now.

150
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:45,293
I need to make contact
with those Witchfinders loyal to me

151
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:47,629
and be assured of their
continued service.

152
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:50,531
We'll need their support
if we're gonna confront the queen.

153
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:55,078
- And how will we find you?
- I'll find you when it's time.

154
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:58,766
Tread lightly with the queen.

155
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,920
She's unlike anyone you've ever known,
and you're in her realm now.

156
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,106
I can handle myself.

157
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,050
Yes, but less well without your head.

158
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:13,806
I still don't trust him.

159
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:19,354
I do not either. But he has
made no false steps yet.

160
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,792
We cannot travel in such a big group.

161
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:25,002
Paris, you stay here with Charlotte.

162
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:26,492
We'll send for you once we find her.

163
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,696
I must stay close to keep Haniwa safe.

164
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:32,243
And who has kept Haniwa safe
for the last 17 years?

165
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:33,869
Here.

166
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,955
Keep that safe.

167
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,333
Carefully, Baba.

168
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:51,388
That must be it.

169
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,154
She'll be very happy that we're here.

170
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,451
- She's a princess now.
- She's still Mom.

171
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:17,249
What if she's not? What if
being here has changed her?

172
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:21,545
Then we'll rescue her.

173
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:37,312
Two guards. Six steps.

174
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,522
Guards, six steps.

175
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,215
Identify yourself.

176
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,635
I'm here for Princess Maghra.

177
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,846
The princess does not
receive visitors at the palace.

178
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,871
Move on.

179
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,824
- She'll receive me.
- I said, move on!

180
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:04,049
Haniwa!

181
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,112
- Maghra!
- Mama!

182
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:09,979
Stop!

183
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:14,012
Dad! Dad!

184
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:17,397
Stop!

185
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:19,982
Stand down.

186
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,741
Baba?

187
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,787
No. A bear.

188
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:35,725
I found you.

189
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:37,209
I knew you would.

190
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,905
- Mama.
- Haniwa.

191
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:49,759
Oh, my girl.

192
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:55,512
- I thought you were dead.
- It's all right.

193
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:56,872
You're safe now.

194
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,458
I found you. I found you.

195
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:00,734
Maghra.

196
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,321
You didn't tell me
we were having company.

197
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,534
Baba.

198
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,456
This is Lord Harlan.

199
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,253
- This is his house.
- Honey, please. Our house.

200
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:23,026
- What?
- Baba. Listen to me.

201
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,136
Baba? This is Baba Voss?

202
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,055
- I am.
- Huh.

203
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:32,060
I'm Harlan, Lord of Pennsa,

204
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:36,439
and this is awkward,
but I'm married to your wife.

205
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:39,251
Baba. Come upstairs.

206
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:42,820
- What is he talking about?
- Come upstairs, and I'll explain.

207
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:44,923
Come.

208
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:47,594
Yeah, let's all go upstairs.
Have a hot tea.

209
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:50,762
You... You're gonna stop speaking.

210
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,600
- Pretty unlikely.
- Not if I tear your throat out.

211
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:55,685
And make our wife a widow?

212
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,796
So, this is Baba Voss?

213
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,881
Who is that?

214
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:05,469
"Who's that?" Only your
queen, that's all.

215
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,474
Welcome, Baba Voss.

216
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,961
And did I hear my sister
call Haniwa's name?

217
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:18,484
Please.

218
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:21,152
I'm Haniwa.

219
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:37,963
My prayers have been answered.

220
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:42,551
My sister's family
returned to her unharmed.

221
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:46,764
My babies.

222
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,521
You must all join me for dinner.

223
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,565
We must toast your safe return.

224
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:02,030
You think she means right now?

225
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,494
The mighty Baba Voss.

226
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,125
Your legend precedes you,
and you did not disappoint.

227
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,626
You walked through my guards
like they were nothing but tall weeds.

228
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,757
They didn't seem very tall.

229
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:23,217
Some of the world's finest soldiers.

230
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:24,976
You send them to hunt children.

231
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,741
There's no wonder
they can't fight a man.

232
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,767
Baba.

233
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:31,437
It's fine, Maghra.

234
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,791
He needn't be polite on my account.

235
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,169
After all, we're all family here,
are we not?

236
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:38,778
- Hear, hear.
- Mmm.

237
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:45,135
Besides, as a former
Trivantian soldier and a Slaver,

238
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,139
it's only fair to expect
a certain lack of table manners.

239
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:49,474
Sibeth, please.

240
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:52,376
Wait... You're a Slaver?

241
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:56,338
Seriously? Wow.

242
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:59,174
I mean, not that I'm judging, but...

243
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,863
- No, I am judging. A lot.
- You be quiet.

244
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,806
Yes, Harlan.

245
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:08,702
Be very quiet. Like a little mouse.

246
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,371
I just find it so wonderfully ironic

247
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:15,292
that a Payan princess would marry
a Slaver out of all people.

248
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,395
Though I suppose
Jerlamarel didn't leave you

249
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,756
much of a choice now, did he, Maghra?

250
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,131
Abandoning you like that?

251
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,760
Oh. I apologize,
Lord Harlan...

252
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:26,304
...for discussing your wife's
ex-lovers in front of you.

253
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:30,082
No, it's fine. It's fine.
We all have our pasts, don't we?

254
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:34,212
For instance, this used to be
my house. Now it's yours.

255
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:37,249
And the great dance continues.

256
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:39,359
Mmm, you make an interesting point.

257
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:43,322
Since my birthright determined
my future from a young age,

258
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:46,660
I have no excitingly
scandalous past to speak of.

259
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:51,522
I suppose I envied Maghra, in a way.

260
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:53,983
The freedom,

261
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:57,546
selfish as it seemed,
to choose her own path

262
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,551
with no regard for others,
no sense of responsibility for anyone...

263
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,972
Respectfully, Your Majesty,
Maghra has devoted her life

264
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,934
to loving her husband,
raising her children,

265
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,311
and serving the Alkenny people.

266
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,963
Respectfully,
mountain woman...

267
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,707
it is because of my sister that

268
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:20,237
the Alkenny are traitors to the crown.

269
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,297
The Alkenny cannot be
traitors to the crown.

270
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,866
The Alkenny people are no more.

271
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,493
If a hidden tribe
disappears, how are we to even know?

272
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,543
Enough.

273
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,293
Our father
forbade the discussion

274
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:37,088
of politics at the table
for a very good reason.

275
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,530
Well said, my dear.

276
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:42,618
- Who'd like more wine?
- Mmm, I would.

277
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,620
It's funny.

278
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,042
When we were children,
I was the romantic.

279
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,463
Maghra always swore she'd never
marry, and yet, here we are.

280
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:57,437
I'm the spinster, and she has
two husbands at this table alone.

281
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:02,616
I meant no offense, Baba Voss.

282
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,750
I love my sister dearly,

283
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:07,836
even though she's lied to me,
betrayed me.

284
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,872
You are my
husband. I love only you.

285
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:11,148
I would still kill or die for her.

286
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,818
I imagine it's the same with you.

287
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:17,423
Oh, and you, of course,
Lord Harlan. Mmm.

288
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:20,325
It's an honor to be in
such fine company.

289
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,773
Do you recognize my voice, soldier?

290
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,916
I couldn't possibly because you're dead.

291
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:48,711
Only on the inside.

292
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,760
The queen said you took your own life.

293
00:22:57,553 --> 00:23:02,619
The queen has always had
a troubled relationship with the truth,

294
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:03,977
wouldn't you say?

295
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:08,065
Not out loud.

296
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:20,120
So... what happens now?

297
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:24,916
What indeed?

298
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,429
Kofun, Haniwa,

299
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:41,118
you must know your mother
never stopped searching for you.

300
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:44,937
From the moment you were separated,
you were all she thought of.

301
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:49,919
It's unfortunate she must go
on a journey now just as you've arrived.

302
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:51,963
- I wish it were different.
- Journey?

303
00:23:51,987 --> 00:23:53,047
What journey?

304
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:54,232
What is she talking about?

305
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,047
I didn't get a chance to tell you...

306
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:58,240
It's a mission
of the utmost importance.

307
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:01,514
Maghra will serve as my emissary

308
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:04,226
to receive a peace delegation
from Trivantes.

309
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,128
You're leaving now?

310
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:09,815
It's only for a few days.
I... I have to.

311
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,275
- I'm coming with you.
- Me too.

312
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,092
- No.
- No.

313
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,137
You're members of the royal family.

314
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,616
Too valuable a prize
for the Trivantians to pass up.

315
00:24:20,684 --> 00:24:22,478
They wouldn't even know we were there.

316
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:28,168
You're the future of this kingdom
and quite possibly the world.

317
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:30,378
We cannot risk any harm coming to you.

318
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,673
My sister is right. You will stay here.

319
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:35,092
I just got you back.
I will not lose you again.

320
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:38,512
- Mama.
- Haniwa. Your mother has spoken.

321
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:42,224
Maghra, the Trivantians will
not send a peace delegation.

322
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,934
They do not negotiate.

323
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:48,190
I wouldn't call it a negotiation.
They're going to grovel.

324
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:50,966
The Trivantians have never
groveled, and they never will.

325
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:54,095
They've never had
a truly worthy adversary.

326
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:57,056
- You?
- God.

327
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:01,913
Their soldiers will slit your god's
throat and drink its blood.

328
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:04,665
Yet it is the Trivantians
who have sued for peace.

329
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:06,292
It is a trick or a trap.

330
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:09,420
Baba, we have to try.
If there's even a chance...

331
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:10,671
There is not.

332
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:12,590
Then we'll defeat
them on the battlefield.

333
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:15,510
- There is even less chance of that.
- So what would you have us do?

334
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:17,485
The Trivantians are consumed with

335
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:19,305
the war with the Ganites to the west.

336
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,182
Do nothing to draw
their attention to the east.

337
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:23,309
- What if it's too late for that?
- Then surrender.

338
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,096
Spoken like a true Trivantian.

339
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,332
You must understand.

340
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:49,377
I needed him to keep us safe.

341
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,403
That little worm down there
doesn't think so.

342
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:53,613
That's just his manner.

343
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:58,702
Baba. You've always trusted me.

344
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:03,665
And you have lied to me
for all that time.

345
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,627
Well, you of all people know the
pain of a past best forgotten.

346
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:11,256
You were happy to be reminded, Princess.

347
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:15,319
The princess who ran away from Paya died

348
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:18,489
the day I pledged myself
to you as your wife.

349
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:20,056
Then let us leave this place.

350
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,786
Let us take our children
and return to the mountains.

351
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,456
We were happy there. We can be again.

352
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,500
- If only it were that simple.
- It is that simple.

353
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:31,775
You are my wife, they are our children,

354
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,310
and this is the past you wish to forget.

355
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,334
Well, these are my father's people.

356
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:43,806
He begged me on his deathbed
to protect them from my sister,

357
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,290
and I failed him.

358
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:51,213
I abandoned Paya, and so
many died at Sibeth's hands.

359
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:59,906
I'm the only one who can
truly challenge her for the throne

360
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,598
and save the kingdom.

361
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:06,186
So princess isn't good enough.

362
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:09,290
Now you wish to be queen?

363
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:12,251
Only until I've ensured a lasting peace,

364
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,712
and then I'll hand power over to Harlan.

365
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:18,198
Maghra, Harlan is making you his tool.

366
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:22,411
No. I have made him mine.

367
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:26,849
You are forgetting
what is most important to you.

368
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:30,311
You, me, Haniwa, Kofun,
we are what matter most.

369
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:32,105
I would die for my children.

370
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:35,358
I'm not asking you to die for them.
I'm asking you to live for them.

371
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:36,383
If I run off...

372
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:39,987
If I run off, if I turn my
sister against me again,

373
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:43,807
Haniwa and Kofun won't
be safe anywhere ever.

374
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:49,580
I have kept us safe for 18 years.
I can protect us out there.

375
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:52,190
- I cannot do that here.
- I know, but I can.

376
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:55,795
I can protect them and you.

377
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:58,673
Oh, good.
Good, you're both here.

378
00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:02,200
Now, let's talk about
sleeping arrangements.

379
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:05,763
Now, obviously,
in the usual circumstances,

380
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,932
I am open to group activities.

381
00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:10,068
- Harlan.
- Why do you think my bed is so big?

382
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:11,385
Stop it.

383
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:14,772
Forgive me.

384
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:19,509
Just trying to make the best
of a delicate situation.

385
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:25,165
You even tell him this is my
house? This is my house.

386
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:28,101
No one cares.

387
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,228
You're drunk.

388
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:32,439
Yes.

389
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:35,734
And with good reason, I think.

390
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:39,047
Look, Baba... Bab... Voss,

391
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:42,783
I don't care what you do in here
with my wife... Our wife.

392
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:44,844
Doesn't matter.

393
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:50,373
But it will be bad for all of us
if people were to find out.

394
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:54,979
Secret alliances only work
if they stay secret.

395
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:56,064
If he keeps talking,

396
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:57,982
- I'm going to feed him his own throat.
- Shh.

397
00:28:58,006 --> 00:28:59,942
Is he like this with everybody?

398
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:02,135
Leave us, please.

399
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:06,306
As you wish.

400
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:10,536
You know, in time, Baba Voss,

401
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,063
you will come to realize
I'm not your enemy,

402
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:16,650
but that makes me no less dangerous.

403
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:22,465
I may have lost my house,
but this is still my city.

404
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:25,534
And you would be well advised
to watch how you speak to me.

405
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,219
I need you. Now more than ever.

406
00:29:52,561 --> 00:29:53,562
Baba?

407
00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:59,192
What did they do to you?

408
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:02,654
I had to get her back.

409
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:17,553
I honestly don't know
what the queen's thinking.

410
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:20,189
Witches in the royal family?

411
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:22,399
Does she think the people
will stand for it?

412
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:23,774
There will be rioting at her gates...

413
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:26,463
Lower your voice,
or the queen will have your tongue.

414
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,539
Presage.

415
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:38,018
Is that you?

416
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:44,362
I am called Paris.

417
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,074
Paris.

418
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:51,203
I have an urgent message
for the princess.

419
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:04,091
You're the soldier
who brought Kofun to Pennsa.

420
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:06,176
Yes.

421
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:09,596
He told me the others
were less inclined.

422
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:13,850
We had our orders. I followed them.

423
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:17,872
And now, whose orders do you follow?

424
00:31:17,896 --> 00:31:20,342
For 20 years, I have sworn

425
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:22,731
my allegiance to the
Witchfinder general.

426
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:25,695
Not an easy habit to break.

427
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:31,576
I will make sure Mag...
The princess gets this.

428
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:36,748
That day, in the woods.

429
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:39,793
You touched me.

430
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:44,732
I wonder what it must feel like

431
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:47,926
to know things that will happen
before they occur.

432
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:55,851
Mainly it means I'm always concerned.

433
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:02,482
Never
thought of it like that.

434
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:05,694
Speaking of those concerns...

435
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:14,953
You protected Kofun before.
Do the same now.

436
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:20,125
Stay close to him and keep
him away from trouble.

437
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:26,757
I pulled him into this world.
He is past listening to me.

438
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:33,305
I will do as you ask.

439
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:37,285
Good. Good. Thank you.

440
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:38,310
But...

441
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,689
only because it is you doing the asking.

442
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,340
You are called Toad?

443
00:32:51,364 --> 00:32:52,717
Yes.

444
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:54,534
That is a stupid name.

445
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:58,121
A failure of imagination
on the part of my parents.

446
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,543
Wait here.

447
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,671
Princess Maghra.

448
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:53,802
I hear a dead man speaking.

449
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:00,267
Then listen closer.

450
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:04,938
Is it really you?

451
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:09,943
Tamacti.

452
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,865
I hear congratulations are in order.
There was a wedding?

453
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:20,555
Yes. While you were dead,
I've been trying to fix things.

454
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,097
By marrying a lord?

455
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:27,418
The Pennsan soldiers are loyal
to Harlan first and the queen second.

456
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,172
That's good.

457
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,166
We'll need all the forces we can get

458
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,736
if we're going to overcome your sister.

459
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,739
We're all in agreement.
Harlan is a valuable asset.

460
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:40,032
- When do we move?
- I'm working as fast as I can.

461
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:41,950
Explaining why I'm not dead
when I killed myself

462
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:43,911
in the service of the queen
is proving complicated.

463
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:45,997
- How much time?
- More than we have.

464
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:48,347
From what I hear,
your sister is days away

465
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:50,391
from marching Paya into war.

466
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,253
Perhaps not.

467
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:55,715
I convinced her to let me arrange
a diplomatic summit with Trivantes.

468
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,550
Why would the Trivantians discuss peace

469
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:59,469
when they never declared war
in the first place?

470
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:00,678
It's a delay.

471
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:03,222
To allow the soldiers to march
from the western front.

472
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:05,116
You said yourself the Trivantians

473
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,641
are heavily occupied
on the western front.

474
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:10,210
Well, they can't possibly
want war in the east.

475
00:35:11,214 --> 00:35:13,165
There may very well be
a chance for peace

476
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:15,860
even if they do have ulterior motives.

477
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:18,445
As long as your sister is on the throne,

478
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:20,054
there will be no peace.

479
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:25,658
However, killing the queen,

480
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:28,352
or even deposing her,
is no simple matter.

481
00:35:29,317 --> 00:35:30,903
There are many laws in the strands

482
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,753
all designed to protect the monarch.

483
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:36,172
- And you know all these laws?
- No. Not all.

484
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:37,239
I do.

485
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:39,862
So you gather your Witchfinders,

486
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,677
and you let me worry about the laws.

487
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:42,953
Do you have a plan?

488
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:45,414
More than one.

489
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,812
So different
from how we grew up.

490
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:54,607
You should see Trivantes.
It makes Pennsa look tiny.

491
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,550
It's an incredible place.

492
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:01,930
Except for the slaves and
how they kidnapped you.

493
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,100
- Not all Trivantians are bad.
- Ow.

494
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:14,192
I met someone there. Someone like us.

495
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,114
- Really?
- Yes.

496
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:24,327
And no relation to Jerlamarel.
Both of her parents are blind.

497
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:28,331
So it's not just Jerlamarel's line.

498
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,710
Sight's really coming back.

499
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:33,980
You don't sound too happy about it.

500
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:35,881
Look at what it's done to the world.

501
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:37,900
Look what it's done to us.

502
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:40,010
It wasn't vision that
destroyed the world.

503
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,763
It was people.

504
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,433
They can do that with or without sight.

505
00:36:47,058 --> 00:36:49,328
Look at the queen waging
war on Trivantes.

506
00:36:49,352 --> 00:36:53,249
She's protecting her people.
Isn't that what queens do?

507
00:36:53,273 --> 00:36:56,044
Why are you defending someone
who hunted us our whole lives?

508
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:57,903
She didn't know we were family.

509
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:01,591
If Mom had spoken up, maybe
we wouldn't have had to hide.

510
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:02,949
Mom was protecting us.

511
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:06,328
Maybe.

512
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,998
Maybe she was protecting herself.

513
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:13,251
I would trust our mother
over the queen any day.

514
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:15,496
What about Jerlamarel?

515
00:37:16,296 --> 00:37:20,128
You trusted him. And Boots,
you vouched for him too.

516
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:24,846
Do you really want to taunt me
while I have a blade to your scalp?

517
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:27,682
Sorry.

518
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:33,814
I am too.

519
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:37,818
For everything.

520
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,660
All right.
Are you sure about this?

521
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:48,703
Do it.

522
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,847
- Paris?
- Yeah. Here. Come.

523
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,391
Sit.

524
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:13,812
Sit with me. Hmm.

525
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:19,317
So, a shift in the world.

526
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:21,570
Yes.

527
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:28,660
I'm sorry.

528
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:34,499
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about all of this.

529
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:37,836
About who I really was.

530
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:43,800
Maghra, I know who you really are.

531
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:52,184
As for this, I am glad
you did not tell me.

532
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:55,645
I would not have kept
your secret from Baba.

533
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:58,148
He's so angry.

534
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,318
And how would you have him be?

535
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:06,073
Finding his wife married to another?

536
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,742
I've explained that.

537
00:39:10,452 --> 00:39:15,433
Did you explain to him why you concealed

538
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:17,918
that you were a daughter of Kane?

539
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:21,922
He doesn't wanna listen to me.

540
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:27,928
I can't run away from this.
I have to stay.

541
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:30,806
For Haniwa and Kofun.

542
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:35,060
You stay for Haniwa and Kofun?

543
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,895
Who else?

544
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:42,692
The crown is your birthright.

545
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:47,864
It is no small thing to wear it.

546
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:57,958
You know...

547
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:04,131
it was you who started
this whole journey.

548
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:10,554
You who taught Haniwa and Kofun to read.

549
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:16,059
Told them the tales
of the great Jerlamarel.

550
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:19,980
Their father.

551
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,736
I would never have left the mountains.

552
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:33,744
It was only a matter of time.

553
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:38,081
The mountains could never contain you.

554
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:46,882
I've missed you.

555
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,499
Kofun.

556
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,542
What are you doing out here?

557
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:26,230
Listening to the world.

558
00:41:26,254 --> 00:41:28,632
What do you hear?

559
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:32,677
Everything. Come.

560
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:38,934
Close those eyes of yours.

561
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,270
Let the sound fill your mind.

562
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:50,153
Now, what do you hear?

563
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:54,908
Nothing really.

564
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:57,160
Nothing is never nothing.

565
00:41:57,786 --> 00:41:59,788
Even the absence of sound is telling.

566
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,772
Dad.

567
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:10,841
Shh, I know. I heard him come.

568
00:42:11,842 --> 00:42:13,218
Just relax.

569
00:42:14,928 --> 00:42:17,280
He's breathing slow.
He's not on the hunt.

570
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,521
There. He's gone to rejoin the others.

571
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:32,988
Are you angry at Mom?

572
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:41,913
What your mother does, she is
doing for you and your sister.

573
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,585
And what about for you?

574
00:42:53,575 --> 00:42:56,361
I was sure you'd throw Harlan
off the roof when you arrived.

575
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,806
I considered it.

576
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:06,188
You can't let Harlan win.

577
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:10,567
Harlan doesn't matter.

578
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,653
This whole place doesn't matter.

579
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:16,281
We are together again.

580
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,411
I just have to figure out
how to get out of this place.

581
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:23,914
Back to where we belong.

582
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:29,294
I can't think of any place
where we all belong anymore.

583
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:47,479
Wait, I hear it.

584
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:50,482
Tell me.

585
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:03,555
Yeah?

586
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:05,235
Lord Harlan, your brother's horse

587
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:06,765
was found running in the orchards.

588
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:08,541
Saddled and riderless.

589
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:11,670
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

590
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:14,250
Kerrigan has a habit of grabbing

591
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:16,294
the nearest horse when he's in a rush.

592
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:19,545
Look, um, put her in my stables.

593
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:20,969
He'll pick her up when he's home.

594
00:44:21,346 --> 00:44:26,393
Sir, this satchel hung on the saddle
with a message for you.

595
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:52,753
Oh, no.

596
00:44:55,213 --> 00:44:56,214
No.

597
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:34,915
What happened?

598
00:45:45,814 --> 00:45:48,041
What is it? What happened?

599
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:51,395
Kerri.

600
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:54,147
Kerrigan.

601
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:57,092
I'm so sorry.

602
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:15,877
Kofun?

603
00:46:17,295 --> 00:46:19,339
Ah. How are you settling in?

604
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:21,800
Very well, thank you.

605
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:31,101
Would you like some?

606
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:35,272
Sure.

607
00:46:53,206 --> 00:46:56,877
Your mother. This house.

608
00:46:58,128 --> 00:46:59,921
It must be a lot to take in.

609
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:04,050
It is.

610
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:21,943
Something troubling you?

611
00:47:22,986 --> 00:47:26,281
I forgot for a
moment you were sighted.

612
00:47:29,034 --> 00:47:32,454
I imagine you're able to see my pain?

613
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:34,956
Yes.

614
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,460
What a gift that must be.

615
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,301
It also means I have no choice
but to trust you.

616
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:49,346
Because it's a secret.

617
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,431
Kofun.

618
00:47:53,225 --> 00:47:54,643
It must stay between us.

619
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,771
Of course. It will.

620
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:11,243
I lost the baby.

621
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,043
He was taken from me.

622
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,755
I'm so sorry.

623
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:34,367
When the people find out...

624
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:38,140
In our village, it happened all
the time. People will understand.

625
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,481
This is not your village.

626
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,752
And I'm not an Alkenny mother.

627
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:47,797
I stood before the entire city
and announced my child.

628
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:50,265
A sighted child who now will not come.

629
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:56,163
They'll think I'm... I'm
no longer chosen.

630
00:48:57,497 --> 00:48:59,332
That I'm no longer God's queen.

631
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:01,593
So tell them the truth.

632
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:08,067
They will understand. They will
feel for you, just like I do.

633
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:09,610
I... I'm sorry.

634
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:10,719
Thank you.

635
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:14,890
Thank you, Kofun.

636
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:21,055
I'll confess. I came here

637
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:23,734
because I needed to open
my heart to someone.

638
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:29,321
I felt strongly that I could trust you.

639
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:32,240
I felt that from the moment we met.

640
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:35,410
Do you feel you can trust me?

641
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:42,042
I don't know.

642
00:49:45,337 --> 00:49:48,149
Because my Witchfinders
killed your people?

643
00:49:48,173 --> 00:49:49,174
Yes.

644
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:56,157
I hope I can help you understand

645
00:49:56,181 --> 00:50:00,811
that if I'd known it was
Maghra and her children,

646
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:02,687
I...

647
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:06,417
- I don't want you to hate me, Kofun.
- I don't know you.

648
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:09,194
But I want you to!
I want you to know me.

649
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:12,489
Being queen is very lonely.

650
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:19,788
I've been alone for so long,
I feared I lost the ability to connect.

651
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:23,583
But I already feel connected to you.

652
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:28,255
There's something about you
that soothes me.

653
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:30,799
That fills me with hope.

654
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:34,219
Hope for what?

655
00:50:35,011 --> 00:50:36,513
The future of Paya.

656
00:50:37,347 --> 00:50:39,075
I'll not live forever.

657
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:44,438
This holy kingdom may someday
rest on your shoulders.

658
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:48,024
It is too much weight for
any mortal woman or man.

659
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:53,715
I have only borne it because
through all my years on the throne,

660
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:58,660
there's always been somebody
at my side, inside of me...

661
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:03,498
guiding my every move.

662
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:07,127
- Are you talking about God?
- Yes, Kofun.

663
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:09,629
Without whom, we are dust.

664
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:14,402
I will show you

665
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:16,988
- how to seek God's counsel...
- Sibeth.

666
00:51:17,012 --> 00:51:19,198
...so that you will know her voice
when you need it,

667
00:51:19,222 --> 00:51:21,074
and she will know yours.

668
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:27,809
Listen. To hear her,
you must first feel her.

669
00:51:34,738 --> 00:51:37,967
Let her flame warm you,
as the God Flame warms the earth.

670
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:41,620
Oh, yes. Feel her.

671
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,683
Ah. Yes.

672
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:49,604
Feel me, Kofun.

673
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:53,775
Lose yourself in me,
and you will find God.

674
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:57,445
Yes. Feel me.

675
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:00,383
Feel me.
