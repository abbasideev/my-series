1
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,813
Commander General,
you are called to answer

2
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:12,774
for the escape
of the prisoner, Tamacti Jun.

3
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,134
Tamacti Jun was not my prisoner.

4
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:16,294
But Baba Voss was.

5
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:19,198
Baba Voss was an enemy of the Republic.

6
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:21,282
Who should have been put on trial

7
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:24,535
and executed expeditiously,
as the law requires.

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,498
Had you done that, he never
would have had the opportunity

9
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:30,208
to escape with Tamacti Jun.

10
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:32,542
The Witchfinder
was a potential source

11
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:36,614
of great intelligence for us
on the Payan queen's larger strategy

12
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,157
and military assets.

13
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:41,118
Do you have any idea
how they managed to escape?

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,038
Such a devastating breach
in our security is unheard of.

15
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:48,792
They must have had help.
Someone on the inside.

16
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,980
Then we must
ferret out the traitor, or traitors,

17
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,315
and make an example of them.

18
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:58,176
If there are traitors, I will find them.

19
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,658
General Voss, you have
served this council

20
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:06,786
with great honor and valor
for many years,

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,989
but your obsession with the
rumors of the return of sight,

22
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:14,711
your personal vendetta with your
brother, they must be put aside.

23
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:16,921
The Ganites grow
ever more bold in the west.

24
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:18,506
You are our greatest tactician.

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,451
We need you focused on the
true threats to this republic.

26
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,162
Do you understand?

27
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:34,629
Yes. I understand, sir.

28
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:44,282
I want you to question every
guard who came in contact

29
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,783
with Baba Voss or Tamacti Jun.

30
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:48,119
I already did, sir. They didn't
have anything useful to offer.

31
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:52,564
Well, then question them again.
Someone will break.

32
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,066
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:35,125
Who's there?

34
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,396
- It's okay.
- Oloman?

35
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,048
It's okay.

36
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,561
Another bad dream?

37
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:56,563
You don't understand.

38
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,608
The dreams are beautiful.

39
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:05,614
I can see the world, my children.

40
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:09,868
It's when I wake up
that the nightmare starts.

41
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:15,040
We're still here, Father.

42
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,541
We'd never leave you.

43
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,466
Have you found a way to fix this?

44
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,969
I know it can be done
with the right equipment.

45
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:31,190
We simply don't have the machines,

46
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:33,019
the technology to do the things you ask.

47
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:47,364
Have you forgotten everything
that I taught you?

48
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,037
It's been my life's work
to build this place.

49
00:04:56,206 --> 00:05:00,043
Through setbacks and overwhelming
odds, I persevered.

50
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,172
Now you...

51
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,052
You must rise to the challenge.

52
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:14,349
Take what seems impossible
and make it possible.

53
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:20,248
You must dedicate your every
waking moment to restoring my sight

54
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,691
so that I can fulfill my destiny.

55
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,861
Now, it won't happen overnight,

56
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,824
and I was wrong to make
you feel like it should.

57
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:36,204
We must both settle in and persevere.

58
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,041
No matter how long it takes.

59
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:43,712
Yes, Father.

60
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:45,797
All right.

61
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,052
Now, your morning report?

62
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:52,255
Now?

63
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,406
Our work here continues, does it not?

64
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:57,785
Of course it does, it's just...

65
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:02,273
I may be injured,
but I am not compromised.

66
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:06,151
And you shouldn't treat me as such,
or the children might follow suit.

67
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:08,320
And the Trivantians...

68
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:14,677
The Trivantians...

69
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,370
they must not know of my injury.

70
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,432
It is their fear of my abilities
that keeps them in check.

71
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:20,540
Do you understand?

72
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:24,503
Yes, Father.

73
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:28,006
Good.

74
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:33,678
Then... your morning report.

75
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:42,330
Well, Nonni has moved on
to quadratic equations.

76
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:44,940
She's very smart.

77
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:48,294
I started her on the text
that you suggested.

78
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:50,529
She took to it like a moth to a flame.

79
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,249
They left before the agreed-upon time.

80
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:17,824
Something must have happened.

81
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:19,701
We don't have time to search for them.

82
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:23,270
Our priority must be
to find Princess Maghra.

83
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:30,101
Princess Maghra?
What is he talking about?

84
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:37,367
If he is to be believed,
your mother is sister to the queen.

85
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:43,933
- Queen Kane? That is ridiculous.
- I know it is hard to believe.

86
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,603
What's hard to believe
is that you didn't

87
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:48,002
tear him to pieces the
moment you met him.

88
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:49,838
I did consider it.

89
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:54,485
- This could be a trap, Papa.
- Yes.

90
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:57,095
And yet you allow him to lead us. Why?

91
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:01,433
For the same reasons I came
to find you in Trivantes.

92
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,269
She's my wife, Haniwa.

93
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,981
It's the only woman I will ever love.

94
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:09,167
And if there's the smallest
chance that she's alive...

95
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,400
I understand.

96
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:18,450
But if he is lying, then I
want to kill him with you.

97
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,078
I give you my word.

98
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:27,060
And if he is not lying, then
my mother is a Payan princess.

99
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:28,251
How could that be?

100
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,421
I do not have answers.

101
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,008
I trust your mother will
explain once we find her.

102
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,301
Come.

103
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:52,567
Three horses, two dogs.

104
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,904
- Trivantians?
- Witchfinders.

105
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:57,673
If they hurt my son...

106
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:59,884
Witchfinders serve the pleasure
of the queen.

107
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,679
If Maghra is with the queen,
then their orders will be

108
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:04,913
to find and retrieve her children.

109
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,659
- But the queen would have them burned.
- No.

110
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,645
I learned that the queen
issued a new decree.

111
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:13,380
The sighted are no longer
to be considered witches.

112
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,401
So where do we go?

113
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:20,137
East. There's a Witchfinder camp nearby.

114
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:22,389
They'll know where the queen is settled.

115
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,535
Pennsa.

116
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,727
What?

117
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:28,937
They took Kofun to Pennsa.

118
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:32,174
- Did he leave you a sign?
- Yes.

119
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,526
Pennsa.

120
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:39,614
Highly fortified, prosperous,
strategically located.

121
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,452
I would guess the queen
has consecrated a new capital.

122
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:06,075
What is this vital matter
that couldn't wait, Lord Harlan?

123
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,952
I don't mean to be alarmist,

124
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:11,956
but when Your Majesty's
personal safety's at stake,

125
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,158
I'd rather be guilty of overreacting
than complacency.

126
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,278
Must everything with you
include a speech?

127
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:21,615
I'll keep it brief. I promise.

128
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:25,118
I want you to hear this firsthand.

129
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,790
I only ask that you
stay very, very still.

130
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,377
If he knows you're here,
I fear he won't speak freely.

131
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,089
I'll be silent as a spider.

132
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:52,813
Lord Harlan, this is Zechan,
the man who requested the audience.

133
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,815
Thank you, Kerrigan.

134
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,412
Is someone else in the room?

135
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:12,582
A trusted servant loyal to me.

136
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,335
Where are you from, Zechan?

137
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,963
Kanzua, sir.

138
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:21,466
And you were a palace sentry at Kanzua?

139
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,719
Yes, sir. For over 20 years.

140
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:27,931
So you were there when
the Trivantians attacked?

141
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:32,894
I was there when Kanzua fell.

142
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:38,817
But the thing of it is,
there was no attack.

143
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:43,305
Then how did
the dam come to be destroyed?

144
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,050
I can't say for sure, sir.

145
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:49,286
All I know is, there
were no Trivantians.

146
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,581
I don't understand.

147
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,668
It was a regular day.

148
00:11:57,878 --> 00:11:59,296
Birds and wind.

149
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:03,234
Not once did I hear the sound
of Trivantian stingers.

150
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:04,634
No war cries.

151
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:12,225
So if it wasn't the Trivantians,
who was responsible?

152
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,334
You have to understand, sir.

153
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:24,422
My father was a guard at Kanzua,
as was his father before him.

154
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:26,716
We have served the monarchy
for generations.

155
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,200
I understand. I understand.

156
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:36,416
It's all right.

157
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,044
Say what you came to say, soldier.

158
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,696
I knew those buildings inside and out,

159
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,321
every passageway, who had access.

160
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:49,966
And I believe that the only person

161
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,645
who could have released the waters...

162
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,104
was the queen herself.

163
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:01,918
Lord Harlan, you do have
a flair for the dramatic.

164
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,963
This kind of talk, you know...

165
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,712
left unchecked, it can
spread like a plague.

166
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:13,346
And if the people doubt
your account of Kanzua,

167
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:16,558
they will doubt the sighted
child you spoke of,

168
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,894
and your mandate from God.

169
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,022
All of it.

170
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:28,445
You will make sure that won't happen.

171
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,616
It's the least I can do
if it threatens my queen.

172
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:36,244
And just think how much
more vigilant I'd be

173
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:39,289
if it threatened the sister
of my own wife.

174
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,716
Urgent message
for you, my queen.

175
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:47,626
Come.

176
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:17,644
Rest assured, Harlan,
you'll have your bride.

177
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:43,955
Sibeth, please. I have no
fight left in me right now.

178
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,356
Relax, Sister. I come bearing good news.

179
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,359
Kofun has been found.

180
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,631
My soldiers are making their way
back here with him as we speak.

181
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:56,759
What? When will they arrive?

182
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:59,036
What about Haniwa and Baba Voss?

183
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,329
No sign
of them, I'm afraid.

184
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:03,891
That doesn't make sense.

185
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:06,293
He would have kept them
together at all costs.

186
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:09,796
Unless he no longer could.

187
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:14,402
And now that Kofun will be joining us,

188
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:16,954
we are faced with the
issue of his safety.

189
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:18,489
Safety?

190
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,344
As you witnessed, it will take some time

191
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:22,718
before the people embrace the new way.

192
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:26,588
You had no such concerns about Boots.

193
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:29,858
Boots is nobody.

194
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,527
Just the father of your child.

195
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:39,618
What?

196
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:42,662
I can hear your heartbeat
growing faster, Sibeth.

197
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:49,002
But only your heart.

198
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:51,296
The baby.

199
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:54,674
You lost the baby.

200
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:01,264
Sibeth. I'm so sorry.

201
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:41,471
Your child returns while mine
has decided not to come at all.

202
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,560
Which does put us
in a somewhat difficult position.

203
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:51,857
If word gets out that
I'm not with child,

204
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:54,777
the protection of sighted children
will be called into question

205
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:56,738
even more than it already is.

206
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,930
Kofun's safety will not be ensured.

207
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,009
I don't understand this conversation.

208
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:05,263
- Are you threatening my son?
- On the contrary.

209
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:07,873
I'll do everything in my power
to protect my nephew.

210
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:13,086
But if the people rise
against me, against us,

211
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:16,089
there'll be no one left to protect him.

212
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:18,633
This is about Harlan.

213
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:22,453
An alliance with Lord
Harlan guarantees us

214
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,198
control over a united military

215
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:27,518
that will serve as the ultimate
deterrent to any talk of revolution.

216
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:31,171
Why are you so insistent on this?
What aren't you telling me?

217
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,488
Apparently, there are
survivors of Kanzua.

218
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:44,761
- If word spreads...
- Word will spread.

219
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:46,851
The only question is how well positioned

220
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,891
we will be to quell any unrest

221
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:51,125
to assert our authority when it does.

222
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:54,856
A man in Harlan's position,

223
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,066
he could pour the water or fan flames,

224
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,817
depending on where his interests lie.

225
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:03,595
And right now, what he wants is you.

226
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:09,459
Sister. I know what I'm asking of you.

227
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,270
- I wouldn't ask it, but...
- Shh. Just... Just...

228
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:35,794
Fine.

229
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:40,483
Fine.

230
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:46,698
I'll agree to this charade
as long as Harlan understands

231
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:49,266
it's simply an arrangement
of convenience.

232
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,229
As all marriages are.

233
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:24,801
I still can't imagine
my mother as a princess.

234
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:28,656
Maghra Kane was born to rule.

235
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,515
Her father's daughter in every way.

236
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:34,120
Yet you hunted her like an animal.

237
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:35,204
No.

238
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:39,441
My charge was to find the witch,
Jerlamarel, and then his children.

239
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,752
Maghra was believed to be dead.

240
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:48,158
- We should camp here.
- We just started walking.

241
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:51,953
It's a difficult passage up
through the foothills.

242
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,498
Your father will need rest.

243
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:56,750
Do not speak for me, Witchfinder.

244
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,452
Okay, then I'll speak for myself.

245
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:03,316
Like you, I've lost blood.
Like you, I haven't eaten in days.

246
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,401
And although I haven't been
whipped on the rack like you...

247
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:06,635
Shh! Tamacti.

248
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,345
What do you see, my love?

249
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,224
Cages of the God bone.

250
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,170
- Shit.
- What?

251
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:19,298
It's a Slaver's den.

252
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:23,461
- You know this place from before?
- No, I do not.

253
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:25,338
Tamacti, we must move quickly. Come.

254
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:27,697
Papa, it's okay. There's no one coming.

255
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:30,559
They're already here.

256
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,332
Stand where you are.

257
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,960
Greetings, friend.

258
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,547
If we are trespassing, I apologize.

259
00:21:44,214 --> 00:21:47,175
We have no intentions other than
to get to the eastern foothills.

260
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,970
What's your business in the foothills?

261
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:52,556
The Yuree cattle markets.

262
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,269
You may go.

263
00:21:57,769 --> 00:21:59,396
Thank you.

264
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:05,403
Not you, girl.

265
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:07,154
Papa!

266
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:24,963
Papa!

267
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:33,638
You'll be taught obedience, girl.

268
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,646
Who's there? Speak!

269
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,190
Catch your breath,
Baba. You are safe.

270
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:50,274
Paris!

271
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,299
Haniwa!

272
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:57,323
- Paris. Who fights with us?
- Baba.

273
00:23:57,347 --> 00:23:59,992
I will explain more
when we are somewhere safe.

274
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:02,620
- Where's Kofun?
- Kofun has gone on to Pennsa.

275
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:04,312
And I have important news.

276
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,207
Maghra is alive.

277
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,649
- You've heard?
- Yes.

278
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,461
You should've went with Kofun.

279
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:13,506
Well, then where would you
be now, you big lump?

280
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,966
- We'll go now.
- No.

281
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,533
You're not fit to travel.

282
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:19,178
I hear deep pain in your voice.

283
00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:22,098
You must rest and heal
before we can make this journey.

284
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:23,223
Baba Voss.

285
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,509
Paris, wait.

286
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:28,378
- Tamacti Jun.
- Paris.

287
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:31,423
The Witchfinder general.

288
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:33,276
What a find.

289
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,820
After we kill him, I'll keep
his ears as a trophy.

290
00:24:35,844 --> 00:24:37,763
No. We need his help.

291
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:40,742
We never would have made it
out of Trivantes without him.

292
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,594
- He's no longer one of them.
- Even if that were true...

293
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:48,207
He can track the queen's soldiers.
He's helping me find Maghra.

294
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:50,626
We are not bringing
a Witchfinder home with us.

295
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,796
We're not going anywhere with
you. We're going to Pennsa.

296
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,341
Haniwa, your father needs rest.

297
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:58,425
Even now, his breath fails him.

298
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:01,787
Papa.

299
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:05,332
Where is this home?

300
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,043
It does not matter. We are
going straight to Pennsa.

301
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:11,004
Baba, we have made camp nearby.

302
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,400
Rest for the night. Then we
go on to Pennsa from there.

303
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:17,562
You cannot really mean that
we will travel with the Witchfinder.

304
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:20,163
Where we go, he goes. Yes?

305
00:25:20,764 --> 00:25:21,807
So be it.

306
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:24,601
Vienna, Quito, return home.

307
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,914
Inform them that we
are going on to Pennsa.

308
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:29,706
Charlotte, to the camp.

309
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:40,760
Some 200 years ago,

310
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:45,747
a small number of Payan children
were born with vision.

311
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,646
Their mothers fled to the mountains

312
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,070
to hide them from the Witchfinders.

313
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:57,718
But eventually they were
found and burned.

314
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:03,706
Those grieving mothers
formed the Compass.

315
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:07,060
It's a secret society of guardians

316
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:11,197
whose membership is passed on
from mother to daughter.

317
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,277
We've remained a secret for generations,

318
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:18,815
standing by, ready to
take on the sacred duty

319
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,491
of protecting the sighted
when vision returns.

320
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:24,077
And how many sighted
children have you met?

321
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:28,307
Counting you? One.

322
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:31,227
And that is one more than
my mother or her mother met.

323
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:33,920
I never imagined it would happen
in my lifetime, but it has.

324
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:37,340
Paris, what do you have to do with them?

325
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:44,222
That is a long story. And a sad one.

326
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:47,726
You were one of them.

327
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:53,523
Yes, I was.

328
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:00,280
A lifetime ago.

329
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:04,343
No one ever blamed you, Paris.

330
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:07,746
Nevertheless, it was my responsibility.

331
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:12,352
The curse of every Presage
I've ever met.

332
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:13,637
You all think you're responsible

333
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:15,911
for knowing everything
before it happens.

334
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:19,257
Is it true that Queen Kane decreed

335
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:20,926
the sighted are no longer witches?

336
00:27:21,551 --> 00:27:22,820
That's the talk.

337
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:26,199
This queen's proclamation
is ill-conceived.

338
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:29,393
Bigotry cannot be changed by decree.

339
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,529
If anything, she's made you
even more of a target.

340
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:39,277
Which may be as she intended.

341
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:49,849
I guess he needed to sleep.

342
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,434
So do I.

343
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,064
Which is why I put enough valerian root

344
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,919
in his ale to knock out a horse.

345
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:56,523
'Cause if he's not snoring,

346
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:59,037
I'm up all night with
my ropes in my hand.

347
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:02,050
More grub anybody?

348
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,615
Come on, Toad. You took
the same oath we did.

349
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:10,118
To seek out and destroy
the witches no matter the cost.

350
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,370
We serve the queen, Dax.
We follow her orders.

351
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:13,955
Not when the orders are heresy.

352
00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:16,666
God Flame first, Queen second.

353
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,942
Dax is right. This feels wrong.

354
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:22,028
- We're breaking the law.
- We've been tasked with his safety.

355
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:24,632
He's the queen's nephew.

356
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:27,009
What do you think she'll do
to the man who harms him? Hmm?

357
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:28,845
We cannot ride into Pennsa with a witch,

358
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:30,888
we'll be shunned or burned
as heretics right beside him.

359
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:31,906
Don't be an idiot.

360
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,558
We should be gutting him,
not escorting him.

361
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:35,518
You don't wanna kill him?
Fine, don't kill him.

362
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,537
Let's just leave him here
and say he ran away.

363
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:38,604
Let the forest have him.

364
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:41,274
Come on, Toad.
You know he's right.

365
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:42,299
No.

366
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,692
What he is is one word away from

367
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,746
an insubordination charge
and a demotion.

368
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:49,431
And he'll take you right down with him.

369
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,101
Shut your mouths and
do your fucking jobs.

370
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:55,479
And if you're lucky,

371
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:59,107
I'll forget this conversation happened
by the time we reach Pennsa.

372
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:49,384
You should announce yourself.

373
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:50,927
Apologies, Princess.

374
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:53,286
I keep forgetting
it's not my house anymore.

375
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:58,083
Uh-huh. Whistle sword, weapon of kings.

376
00:29:58,583 --> 00:29:59,876
And their daughters.

377
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:02,087
You sent for me?

378
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:03,797
Yes, I did.

379
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:09,862
- This marriage proposal of yours...
- I made no such proposal.

380
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:11,722
Well, my sister did it for you.

381
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:14,409
That is unfortunate.

382
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:16,994
Let me assure you, I had something
more romantic in mind.

383
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,896
- I have a husband.
- We all have our flaws.

384
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:24,043
I tend to snore if I sleep on
my back. But piece of advice...

385
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:26,087
- Harlan. Harlan.
- ...a swift kick will usually shut me up,

386
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,487
- so I'm told.
- Harlan!

387
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:30,766
What is it you're really after?

388
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,630
I come from a rich tradition of men

389
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:49,634
who fought for crumbs
at the feet of the monarchy.

390
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:58,060
Now, I worked tirelessly for many years

391
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,521
to get something better for myself.

392
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:06,443
It took some doing, believe me.

393
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:09,571
And now, in walks the queen,

394
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:14,052
and she screws it all up
with this war of hers.

395
00:31:14,076 --> 00:31:16,495
And I find myself with two choices.

396
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:22,000
One: I stoke the fires of rebellion
and burn down the whole palace,

397
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:27,089
Or two: I join you and move into it.

398
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:35,030
After much consideration, Princess,
I've reached a conclusion.

399
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:38,016
Number two is a lot less work.

400
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,020
You're wooing the wrong sister.

401
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:44,023
I'm wooing the better sister.

402
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:45,767
Sibeth is the one with the power.

403
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:47,651
For now.

404
00:31:58,578 --> 00:32:01,265
- We will announce an engagement.
- Excellent.

405
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,449
But there will be no wedding.

406
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,811
Not to put too fine a point on it...

407
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,188
The engagement will ease
my sister's concerns

408
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:09,381
about Kanzua for the time being.

409
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:12,318
You will use your influence
with the council

410
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:14,511
to help me stop her from going to war.

411
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:17,848
And once my husband
and my daughter are found,

412
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:21,727
you will make sure that they
are protected at all costs.

413
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:26,506
And in exchange?

414
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:32,588
I will convince Sibeth to make her
capital in a more suitable city,

415
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:34,823
and you will have yours back.

416
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:38,577
Maghra.

417
00:32:40,454 --> 00:32:42,414
I believe I underestimated you.

418
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,876
Well, I hope I've done the same.

419
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:48,170
Time will tell, Princess.

420
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:24,539
- Chet-chet.
- Oh. Chet-chet. Ah.

421
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:30,999
- Hot tea.
- Ah. Mmm.

422
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:43,850
So, you were a Compass warrior?

423
00:33:45,268 --> 00:33:49,064
Guardian. Lost the
appetite for it long ago.

424
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,361
Why did you leave?

425
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:06,998
When I was with the Compass,
Haniwa, it was a thrilling time.

426
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:12,021
Two hundred years without
reports of a sighted child,

427
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:16,049
and then suddenly there appeared a boy.

428
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:19,636
I was assigned to protect him.

429
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:22,657
He was gifted beyond his sight.

430
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:27,436
I mean, his young mind
just cried out for knowledge...

431
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:30,480
like yours did.

432
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,819
I broke the rules.

433
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:41,509
I allowed him access
to the artifacts we stored.

434
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:42,534
Books...

435
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:47,288
and the knotted codes
that would teach him to read.

436
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,936
Soon, I couldn't find enough books

437
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,250
to satisfy his hunger for knowledge.

438
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,507
I woke up one day and he was gone,

439
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:01,928
along with the books
and the knotted codes.

440
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:07,934
I failed the Compass.

441
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:13,231
I failed in the thing
that I was sworn to do.

442
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:17,110
So I did the only thing I could. I left.

443
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:26,703
Do you know what became of him? The boy?

444
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:34,044
He became your father.

445
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:46,932
Jerlamarel.

446
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:48,975
Yes.

447
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:55,982
Years later, as your mother
carried you, Jerlamarel found me.

448
00:35:56,483 --> 00:35:57,943
He knew I was Alkenny.

449
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,573
He knew I would protect
and guide his children.

450
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,451
And make sure we knew how to read.

451
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:12,124
I'm hoping that was the right choice.

452
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:20,257
Of course it was.

453
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:25,595
Sight is as much a part of me

454
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:30,058
- as your hands are a part of you.
- Ooh.

455
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:34,771
It would be wrong for me not to read.

456
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:43,530
Dear one...

457
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,325
humankind has a long history...

458
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:53,790
a long history of despising and
fearing those who are different.

459
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,460
Nobody chooses how they're born.

460
00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:02,090
And yet the unsighted
persecute the sighted.

461
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:12,309
If one day the sighted outnumber
the unsighted again,

462
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:15,103
the roles will reverse.

463
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:21,902
It is one of the many ways in which
we all are very much the same.

464
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,037
What are you doing?

465
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:57,479
My job, witch.

466
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,773
- Toad!
- Shut up.

467
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:02,312
Hold him still!

468
00:38:07,556 --> 00:38:09,074
Come on, witch!

469
00:38:13,704 --> 00:38:14,746
Toad!

470
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:30,738
Dax! Frye! What the fuck are you doing?

471
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:32,013
Fall in!

472
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:36,434
Toad!

473
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,149
Frye! Stop, Frye.

474
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:44,544
Toad! Toad!

475
00:38:44,568 --> 00:38:46,706
Toad! Toad! Toad!

476
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,883
Toad! Toad!

477
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:52,909
Toad! Toad!

478
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:59,833
Toad. Toad.

479
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,086
- Dax. Dax!
- Toad.

480
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:06,256
Frye?

481
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:09,171
Frye?

482
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,596
- Frye!
- Stay down, Dax.

483
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,881
What'd you do?

484
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:17,184
Stay the fuck down.

485
00:39:18,518 --> 00:39:19,518
You killed him.

486
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,320
And I'll kill you too if you
don't stand down right now.

487
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:27,170
What's wrong with you? You're
a Witchfinder protecting a witch!

488
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:29,589
I'm not gonna tell you again, Dax!

489
00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:31,740
Stand the fuck down! Now!

490
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:38,080
I'm leaving.

491
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:40,892
I want no part of this.

492
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,959
If you wanna desert,
take your horse and go.

493
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:45,456
But if you attempt to interfere
with this mission,

494
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,231
I will kill you where you stand.

495
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:17,978
- Toad.
- Shut up.

496
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:28,004
Can you ride a horse?

497
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:31,717
Not really.

498
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:35,846
Well, I hope you're a quick learner.

499
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:39,933
'Cause you're not riding with me.

500
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,878
Why didn't you kill Edo
when you had the chance?

501
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:16,344
Killing a brother would be
like killing a part of yourself.

502
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:21,516
Like killing your own father?

503
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:35,363
My father ordered me to kill Edo.

504
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:38,950
And I made a choice.

505
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,087
If you were protecting Edo, then
why does he hate you so much?

506
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:58,428
Family can be complicated.

507
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:06,811
Well...

508
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:12,126
I was just kidnapped by my uncle

509
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,362
and found out that my mom is a princess.

510
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:21,571
I think I know something
about complicated families.

511
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:35,298
My mother died giving birth to Edo.

512
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:39,720
And my father never
forgave him for that.

513
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:44,474
I was just a young boy, almost
too young to remember her.

514
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:49,287
And too young to question
my father's point of view.

515
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:03,201
You asked for me, sir?

516
00:43:06,455 --> 00:43:08,415
The girl, Haniwa, is an archer.

517
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:11,543
Is she?

518
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,379
She put three arrows in me.

519
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:20,010
My brother has raised
two of Jerlamarel's children.

520
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,763
That is a dangerous combination.

521
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:29,686
A group of Slavers was killed
at a den in Munhall today.

522
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:32,647
You think it was them?

523
00:43:35,984 --> 00:43:39,396
Baba's hurt. He's tired.
He won't be moving very fast.

524
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:43,175
Send word to every
outpost in the area...

525
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:48,889
that I want Baba and the girl
brought back to me alive.

526
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:52,416
Yes, sir.

527
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:54,503
Lieutenant?

528
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:09,267
Any word on who helped them escape?

529
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,563
No, sir. Nothing yet.

530
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:21,004
That's odd, Wren. That's very odd.

531
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:27,035
But I think I might have
an idea about that.

532
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:30,622
Keep me informed.

533
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:32,457
Yes, sir.

534
00:44:52,127 --> 00:44:54,187
- Toad.
- What?

535
00:44:58,817 --> 00:45:00,527
Thank you for saving my life.

536
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:06,324
Your gratitude is misplaced.

537
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:10,704
You're Princess Maghra's son,
and I'm duty bound to protect you.

538
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:13,498
I had no choice.

539
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,213
You had a choice.

540
00:45:48,308 --> 00:45:49,576
Give me the map.

541
00:46:06,134 --> 00:46:09,846
It'll take 13 days to get to
Pennsa if the weather holds.

542
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:12,492
We can get there in half that time.

543
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:14,267
What? How?

544
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:17,312
This way.

545
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:23,610
There's a cliff.

546
00:46:24,236 --> 00:46:26,589
Yes, according to the map.

547
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:29,425
But there is no cliff.
We can go straight through.

548
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:30,550
And how do you know that?

549
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,869
They make the maps.

550
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,306
That's how we've kept our outpost

551
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,250
hidden all these centuries
from bastards like you.

552
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:40,627
Haniwa?

553
00:46:41,128 --> 00:46:44,589
I am charged with your
protection at any cost.

554
00:46:45,257 --> 00:46:48,635
You will always stay behind me.

555
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,722
Always behind me.

556
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:55,877
Your father always behind you.

557
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:58,478
I don't need a guardian.
I can take care of myself.

558
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:02,625
You were almost made
a breeding machine in Trivantes.

559
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:04,001
And I got out.

560
00:47:04,025 --> 00:47:06,087
And nearly lost your head
at a Slaver's camp.

561
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:08,231
At this rate, I expect you'll
be dead within the week.

562
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:10,073
Oh, Haniwa.

563
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:16,496
Just don't get in my way.

564
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,416
You're the sighted one.
Don't get in mine.

565
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,916
Ah. Always behind me.
Your father always behind you.

566
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:28,675
Paris.

567
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,141
Jasmine.

568
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:43,398
Burnt sage.

569
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:55,994
Rain across the meadows.

570
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:01,119
Thank you, Your Majesty.

571
00:48:05,714 --> 00:48:09,045
I had heard that the Pennsan Scent Chefs

572
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,429
were among the best in the land.

573
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:15,389
And now I know it to be true.

574
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:19,763
I hope you all enjoyed the performance.

575
00:48:21,395 --> 00:48:25,690
I've learned that even
in our darkest hours,

576
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:30,213
we must find time
to appreciate the beauty and joy

577
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:32,507
with which the God Flame blesses us.

578
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:36,451
Even now, with the struggle
that lies ahead,

579
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:38,704
there is beauty to be found.

580
00:48:39,871 --> 00:48:42,708
There is love.

581
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:46,312
And so it is with great joy

582
00:48:46,336 --> 00:48:49,506
that I share with you,
the esteemed members of my court,

583
00:48:50,006 --> 00:48:55,721
that my sister, Princess Maghra Kane,
has been betrothed

584
00:48:56,221 --> 00:49:01,346
to none other than your very
own Lord Harlan of Pennsa.

585
00:49:02,644 --> 00:49:05,039
I thought we were
going to announce this.

586
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:06,582
Yeah, I thought so too.

587
00:49:06,606 --> 00:49:09,234
And we will all
bear witness to their marriage

588
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:12,983
on the fourth God Flame
rising from today.

589
00:49:16,074 --> 00:49:18,113
- Were you part of this?
- No.

590
00:49:19,244 --> 00:49:20,871
I'm not sure I believe you.

591
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:25,292
Well, Princess, at some point,
you're gonna have to trust me.

592
00:49:26,293 --> 00:49:28,165
You better give me a reason to.

593
00:49:37,262 --> 00:49:38,472
Father.

594
00:49:41,558 --> 00:49:42,642
What is it?

595
00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:44,543
The general is here.

596
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:46,813
What?

597
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:49,816
Edo Voss is here?

598
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,253
He just arrived with some soldiers.

599
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:59,342
He must not know that I am compromised.

600
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,752
General Voss.
This is quite a surprise.

601
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:10,796
Really?

602
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:16,510
I half thought you'd be expecting me.

603
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,471
And why's that?

604
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:29,356
Someone walked into my prison
and walked out with Baba Voss.

605
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:32,776
You captured Baba Voss?

606
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:35,846
We had him.

607
00:50:37,823 --> 00:50:39,074
Until we didn't.

608
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:43,078
It's no small thing
to outmaneuver the guards

609
00:50:43,578 --> 00:50:46,373
and navigate passages
of a Trivantian prison

610
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:51,712
unless one has the gift of sight.

611
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:55,236
And you are accusing me?

612
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,111
Why in the world would I free Baba Voss?

613
00:50:58,135 --> 00:50:59,302
Where's the son?

614
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:01,930
The son?

615
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,664
The son you refused to send

616
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:06,494
with my men when they were here.

617
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:08,621
- I'd like him now.
- Listen to me.

618
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:11,416
The trap you set brought
Baba Voss to my door.

619
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,860
He killed my guards
and took my son by force.

620
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,155
Baba Voss was here and
he left you alive?

621
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:22,125
Even after you gave away his daughter?

622
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,450
He had no choice. He was outnumbered.

623
00:51:29,332 --> 00:51:31,853
What is this? What is this?

624
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:38,008
And why does the boy answer
when I am speaking to the father?

625
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:42,721
And why aren't you moving around
like you usually do when we meet,

626
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:45,548
to lord your gift over me?

627
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:48,911
It's almost as if...

628
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:51,415
Listen, General,
if you came all this way, just...

629
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:54,542
Let him go! Let him go.

630
00:51:54,566 --> 00:51:56,902
- General.
- Quiet.

631
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:13,710
He took your sight.

632
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:17,089
A temporary injury.

633
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,175
One that will soon be healed.

634
00:52:24,388 --> 00:52:25,389
No.

635
00:52:28,266 --> 00:52:29,551
It will not.

636
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:34,332
No!

637
00:52:34,356 --> 00:52:36,483
No! No!

638
00:52:36,983 --> 00:52:39,986
No! No!

639
00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:45,200
I will kill you. I swear
to God, I will kill you.

640
00:52:46,576 --> 00:52:48,328
Put aside your grief, Oloman.

641
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:52,374
It falls on you now to protect
the rest of your family.

642
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:56,253
To do that, you'll need a clear head.

643
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,464
This house belongs to me now.

644
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:04,094
You, the books, the
knowledge, all of it.

645
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:06,430
Tormada!

646
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,984
This is Tormada.
He's one of our greatest scientists.

647
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:22,738
You work for him now.
