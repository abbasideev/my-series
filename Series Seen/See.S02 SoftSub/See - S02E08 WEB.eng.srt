1
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,940
Fire!

2
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,543
Close the gate.

3
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,370
Haniwa!

4
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:50,473
I'm here.

5
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:54,073
I'm here.

6
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,113
If you leave my side again,
I'll kill you myself.

7
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:01,799
That's fair.

8
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:03,367
Trivantians!

9
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:05,489
Advance!

10
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,010
Gather your wits and your breath.

11
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:57,930
We'll make our stand here.

12
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:01,267
There's too many of them.
We don't have enough soldiers.

13
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,752
- We'll hold them.
- For how long?

14
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:06,129
Baba.

15
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:11,110
Long enough to send word
to your mother to evacuate the city.

16
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:14,531
Kofun, Haniwa, ride to Pennsa
as fast as you can.

17
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:15,681
What?

18
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,619
There's nothing more
that you can do here, my son.

19
00:03:18,643 --> 00:03:20,212
Dad, we can fight.

20
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,247
I'm your only archer.

21
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:22,989
If you stay here, you will die.

22
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,198
Then we die.

23
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,349
Then we die.

24
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,349
The two of you are stubborn fools!

25
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:30,767
Commander Ferik.

26
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,917
Witchfinder General.

27
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:35,419
Send your swiftest rider to Queen Maghra

28
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:36,853
with this immediately.

29
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,796
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:49,270
They retreated into the fortress
and closed the gate.

31
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:53,290
Let's get those gates down, now!

32
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:54,500
Lift!

33
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:55,525
Forward!

34
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,992
Halt!

35
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,466
Soldiers, take your positions!

36
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,220
Move.

37
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,078
- Dad.
- Shh.

38
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,410
Do you hear that?

39
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,920
- They're breaking through the gate.
- Not that.

40
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:00,844
That.

41
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,888
What is that?

42
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:06,136
The Hidden Tribes.

43
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:27,622
Bow!

44
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:31,601
Kofun. You're alive.

45
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:37,359
- Paris!
- Baba.

46
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,568
Baba.

47
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:40,886
Lion. Ah.

48
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:45,158
- We stand with Baba.
- You brought the Valier.

49
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:46,827
We've brought you more than that.

50
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:50,123
The Valier stand with Baba Voss!

51
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:53,667
- The Salvin stand with Baba Voss.
- We fight!

52
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,703
The Yeliss stand with Baba Voss.

53
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:58,047
The Reyenne stand with Baba Voss.

54
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,632
How many fighters?

55
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:00,967
More than 100.

56
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:03,661
A hundred mountain warriors are worth
twice as many Witchfinders.

57
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:05,355
They'll have to be.

58
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,891
Kofun, take Paris to safety.

59
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm uphill.

60
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:12,879
Chet-chet.

61
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:14,672
Toad.

62
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:19,762
Kofun.

63
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:23,557
Seems like they'll let anyone
into the wars these days.

64
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:24,749
Any advice?

65
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,478
The Trivantians are
all leather and steel.

66
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,812
If it rings, stab it.

67
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:32,816
I can see, remember?

68
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,486
That's what I'm afraid of.

69
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:53,797
Who's there?

70
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,262
Maghra.

71
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,931
Surprised you have
time to check in on me,

72
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,266
what with the war you're waging.

73
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,246
The war you started.

74
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,689
Mmm, yes.

75
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:14,235
I understand your own children
have joined the cause.

76
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:18,090
All that time you spent nattering away
at me about keeping them safe...

77
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:19,257
Oh, be quiet.

78
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,325
I'm not here to have a conversation.

79
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,830
I just need you to answer one question.

80
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,959
This baby you carry...

81
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:33,505
whose is it?

82
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,382
Oh, come on, Maghra.

83
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,093
I know you must have suspected as much.

84
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,806
Sweet Kofun.

85
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:46,561
Not my first choice, I'll grant you,
but he performed admirably.

86
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:51,858
You're lying.

87
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:56,190
I should have let Tamacti kill you.

88
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:16,842
My son won't just be your nephew.

89
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,888
He'll be your grandson as well.

90
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:22,390
He will be neither,

91
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,434
because he will never be your son.

92
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:31,208
I will take him from you
the moment he is born,

93
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:33,193
and he will never know you.

94
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:35,612
Not even your name.

95
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,618
I may be your prisoner now, sister,

96
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,623
but you watch what you say to me.

97
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,685
It's not the first time
I've been in chains.

98
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:51,420
They tend not to hold me very long.

99
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,758
I will have you buried in these chains.

100
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,473
Take care of my crown, Maghra.

101
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,558
I'll be wanting it back.

102
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,538
How are you feeling?

103
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:25,748
I've felt better.

104
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:30,671
I'm told you will heal just fine.

105
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,548
Yeah, well, either way, you're welcome.

106
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,902
I'm sorry?

107
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,221
Uh, for saving your life?

108
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:45,662
Ah. I believe it was I who saved you.

109
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,707
No, no, it wasn't.
It's not how I remember it.

110
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:50,441
It's certainly not how I'll tell it.

111
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,879
Those were Lowland Assassins.

112
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:56,132
Very few people meet them
and live to talk about it.

113
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:58,824
It was brave of you to attempt a rescue.

114
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,388
You'll get no disagreement from me.

115
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:06,017
My Queen, Lord Harlan.
The army reached Greenhill Gap,

116
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,417
as did the Trivantians.

117
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:10,046
Our next runner should
have news of the battle.

118
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,131
Thank you.

119
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,591
It begins.

120
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:29,648
We have spent our lives

121
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:34,071
cowering in the shadow
of the Trivantian empire...

122
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,575
wondering when the day would come

123
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,091
when they would march their army

124
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,285
into our land to make it their own...

125
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,587
making slaves of our wives,

126
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:52,964
husbands, sons and daughters.

127
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:56,551
And now,

128
00:10:58,012 --> 00:10:59,389
and now that day has come.

129
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,768
On the
other side of that wall

130
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,397
is the army that we have
all feared for so long.

131
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,022
And their victory

132
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,525
will mean the end
of everything that we hold dear.

133
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,241
But when they come through that wall,

134
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:21,370
they will not find the frightened army
they are expecting.

135
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,950
We are Payan soldiers,

136
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:31,148
mountain warriors, Witchfinders.

137
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:33,633
Former enemies banded together

138
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:35,886
for one purpose and one purpose only:

139
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:39,509
To protect what is ours at all costs!

140
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:48,481
I know this enemy.

141
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:51,818
I was this enemy.

142
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,490
They fight to enslave.
They fight for greed.

143
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,577
We fight for love.

144
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:04,457
They fight for conquest.

145
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,477
We fight for our families.

146
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,087
We fight for our freedom!

147
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:15,634
I am a father

148
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:20,682
fighting side by side with my children.

149
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,060
I am a husband

150
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,124
fighting to protect my queen.

151
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:30,483
I am your friend
fighting for your freedom

152
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,108
until the day that I die.

153
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:35,031
I am Baba Voss,

154
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:40,037
and I say let us not wait
until they knock down our gate!

155
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:43,539
I say we open it right now

156
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:46,417
and welcome them to hell.

157
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,681
Baba.

158
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,699
They're opening the doors.

159
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,251
Scouts.

160
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,254
Crossbows, advance.

161
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:11,721
Forward march!

162
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,570
Aim high! Three quarters!

163
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,592
Forward march.

164
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,296
Aim left, one quarter.

165
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:33,755
Forward march!

166
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:37,265
Aim center high!

167
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,930
Forward march!

168
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,250
Aim center high.

169
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:47,437
Fire!

170
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,042
Full attack! Take the fucking fort!

171
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:51,234
On your left!

172
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:57,720
Please.

173
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,556
Is it still lit?

174
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,058
Yes.

175
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:21,166
Shit.

176
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,063
No!

177
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,272
- "No"?
- Fuck!

178
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,096
You're a mountain man.
Can't you light a fire?

179
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,777
Yes, I'm a man. I can light a fire.

180
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,094
Go hold them off.

181
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:53,427
Baba!

182
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:54,577
Almost!

183
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:56,997
Hot.

184
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,158
Good, because there's a war
happening out here!

185
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,333
Now!

186
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,635
Crossbows! To me!

187
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,030
One quarter left!

188
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:32,597
Fire!

189
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:38,097
Three one quarter right!

190
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:40,767
Fire!

191
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,294
Two left!

192
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:46,404
Fire!

193
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:49,776
- Three one quarter right!
- Fire!

194
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:55,830
Aim high three quarters.
Aim left one quarter.

195
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:00,252
- Toad, follow that voice!
- Two left!

196
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:02,335
One quarter left!

197
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:08,842
Two left!

198
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:12,136
One quarter right!

199
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:15,438
One quarter left!

200
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,399
Kofun. Kofun!

201
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,020
Saving your ass is starting to feel
like my only job.

202
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:50,545
Don't stop now.

203
00:22:58,636 --> 00:22:59,837
Shit.

204
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:07,646
- Kofun!
- Toad.

205
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,672
Get off me.

206
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,257
What are you doing?
There's a battle going on.

207
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,112
I'm not leaving you like this.

208
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:23,577
It's not you who's leaving.

209
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,043
Tell Paris...

210
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:34,840
Tell her what?

211
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:39,761
She'll know.

212
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:46,929
Now, do me a favor.

213
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:49,938
Go kill someone.

214
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:27,017
Tamacti Jun!

215
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,545
Baba Voss!

216
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,627
Just checking to see if you're dead.

217
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:38,670
Not yet.

218
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:45,077
There are more of them.

219
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:48,789
Many more.

220
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:21,445
No!

221
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:18,805
Bow Lion!

222
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:20,764
Bow Lion!

223
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:24,853
Now!

224
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:49,582
Now, where... where are they?

225
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:52,616
Where are they?

226
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,310
Come on! What?

227
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:23,495
What's happening?

228
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,509
What was that? What?

229
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:41,104
Oh, no.

230
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,390
Fall back!

231
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:46,651
Fall back!

232
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:35,951
Fall back! Fall back!

233
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:42,123
Fall back!

234
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,247
Wren?

235
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:53,510
Wren!

236
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:58,949
Wren!

237
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:30,982
Kofun!

238
00:31:31,817 --> 00:31:33,313
Haniwa!

239
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,923
Kofun! Haniwa!

240
00:31:36,947 --> 00:31:38,716
- Papa! Papa.
- Baby.

241
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,134
We did it.

242
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:41,201
We won.

243
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:45,890
- You're not hurt.
- No, um, I'm okay.

244
00:31:45,914 --> 00:31:48,834
And so is Kofun. I-I-I saw him earlier.

245
00:31:58,802 --> 00:31:59,928
You stay here.

246
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:03,348
- What is it?
- Do as I say.

247
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,309
You find Paris and make sure she's okay.

248
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:08,413
Okay.

249
00:32:08,437 --> 00:32:09,896
I love you.

250
00:32:27,873 --> 00:32:29,291
You can see.

251
00:32:31,877 --> 00:32:33,896
We have the same father.

252
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,940
Jerlamarel is your father?

253
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:36,965
Yes.

254
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:40,236
But you're fighting for the wrong side.

255
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,303
No.

256
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:51,188
People like us,
we're always on the same side.

257
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:56,026
This is Charlotte.

258
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,863
I'm going to take you somewhere safe.

259
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:02,057
I don't want to go with her.

260
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:07,199
Well, I don't want to take you.
But you won't hear me complaining.

261
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:41,655
You okay to get up? Yeah? Okay.

262
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,108
Edo.

263
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,895
You always did hear better
than the Ayuras.

264
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,282
You still have Ranger's whistle.

265
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:27,284
He gave it to me

266
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:31,455
right before they locked him up
for helping you escape.

267
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:33,749
Everyone close to you

268
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:36,292
always ends up suffering.

269
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:42,339
Now it's your turn.

270
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:47,512
Leave this place, Edo.

271
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,767
Please. It is over.

272
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:55,227
No, it's not over,

273
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,673
not while you're still breathing.

274
00:35:22,214 --> 00:35:23,775
I don't want to kill you.

275
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:24,925
Don't worry.

276
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:26,760
You're not going to.

277
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,297
Goodbye, brother.

278
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,864
Our father couldn't make me kill you,

279
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,617
and neither can you.

280
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:17,532
No!

281
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:18,557
No!

282
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,330
Edo.

283
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,121
What did you do?

284
00:38:56,386 --> 00:38:59,968
There was no going home for me
after this defeat.

285
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:03,393
You could have come with me.

286
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:11,694
Even you could not have kept me
from a Payan rope.

287
00:39:14,112 --> 00:39:15,859
It didn't have to be this way.

288
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:24,915
We were raised as warriors.

289
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,504
It's always been our fate
to die like this, Baba,

290
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,591
bleeding into the earth.

291
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:39,388
Tell me...

292
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:45,185
did our father really
instruct you to kill me?

293
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:52,359
Yes, he did.

294
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,238
What a prick.

295
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:14,381
Edo.

296
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:19,636
Edo.

297
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:34,510
Is there anything I can say

298
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:36,319
to convince you to come back with me?

299
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,365
You wouldn't have to hide
who you are anymore.

300
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,501
You know I can't do that.

301
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:53,962
Why not?

302
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,674
My family,

303
00:40:59,384 --> 00:41:00,677
my home,

304
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:04,306
I couldn't leave them any more
than you could leave yours.

305
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:19,154
I can't be at war with you.

306
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:23,325
I don't want that either.

307
00:41:38,256 --> 00:41:40,008
You're still wearing the necklace.

308
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:45,180
Well, it does say "forever".

309
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:50,227
Well, then...

310
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:53,980
don't ever take it off.

311
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:54,608
What are you doing?

312
00:42:58,044 --> 00:42:59,147
Let's talk later.

313
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:02,758
You just freed a Trivantian officer
because she can see.

314
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:05,153
Is that how it works?

315
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:07,747
- If you have vision, you're forgiven?
- Of course not.

316
00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:11,308
I heard what you said
to the kid, Haniwa.

317
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:14,203
"People like us are always
on the same side".

318
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:16,973
After everything,
you still think you're special?

319
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:17,998
We are special.

320
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:20,726
She's just killed dozens of our people!

321
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,002
She is my people!

322
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:28,450
She is my people.

323
00:43:31,037 --> 00:43:33,539
So what am I?

324
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:39,419
What am I?

325
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,769
Here he is.

326
00:44:18,793 --> 00:44:19,961
Toad's horse?

327
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,003
Yeah.

328
00:44:27,568 --> 00:44:29,045
Where is Haniwa?

329
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:31,525
- Haniwa.
- I'm here.

330
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,724
It's time. Let's go home.

331
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:38,014
- I don't even know where that is anymore.
- Yes, you do.

332
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:40,814
It's where she is.

333
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:00,709
Haniwa?

334
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:09,576
Mama.

335
00:45:10,385 --> 00:45:11,446
Haniwa!

336
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,471
Mom.

337
00:45:13,221 --> 00:45:15,390
- Kofun?
- Mama.

338
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,197
Thank you...

339
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:59,119
for bringing our babies home safely.

340
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:03,791
I think it was they who brought me home.

341
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:09,463
You were right.

342
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:14,551
It is time for us to stop
treating them like children.

343
00:47:16,845 --> 00:47:18,055
They fought bravely.

344
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,267
They don't need me anymore.

345
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,146
I think they need you
more than you know.

346
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:29,525
We all do.

347
00:47:39,576 --> 00:47:41,703
I'm just so happy to have you back.

348
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:47,584
I don't belong here.

349
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:54,258
You belong with me.

350
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:11,273
For generations, the Witchfinders

351
00:48:11,297 --> 00:48:13,628
have been the backbone of this monarchy.

352
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:17,073
Holy warriors in service of the crown.

353
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:21,701
And for that, I offer you all
my enduring gratitude

354
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:24,871
and the gratitude of this nation.

355
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,249
But the world has changed,

356
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:31,628
and in this new world
there are no longer any witches,

357
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:35,400
so no need for Witchfinders.

358
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:38,010
But, more than ever,

359
00:48:38,803 --> 00:48:42,056
there remains the need
for brave warriors.

360
00:48:43,907 --> 00:48:44,986
Tamacti Jun.

361
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,901
Witchfinder General,

362
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:58,922
your charter is changed,
but your rank remains.

363
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:03,978
From this day forward, you are
High General of the Payan army.

364
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:08,123
And you, brave and loyal soldiers,

365
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:11,877
are all officers of the Royal Guard.

366
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:26,142
There are those of you

367
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,561
who will not agree,

368
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,980
as a matter of principle,
with this change.

369
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:36,068
I will not compel you
to a service you did not choose.

370
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,404
For any of you who feel this way,

371
00:49:40,614 --> 00:49:45,118
I absolve you of the blood oath
you swore upon conscription.

372
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,537
You are free to leave

373
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:53,086
with one year's honorarium
in grateful recognition

374
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:55,228
of your holy service.

375
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:04,963
- This will not stand.
- Ferik.

376
00:50:05,347 --> 00:50:08,308
You should know better.

377
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:44,720
Baba Voss.

378
00:50:46,388 --> 00:50:49,575
Your heavy gait gives you away, Baba.

379
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,661
Harlan.

380
00:50:51,685 --> 00:50:55,814
I wanted to express my gratitude
to you for protecting my city.

381
00:50:57,023 --> 00:50:58,793
Your city?

382
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:02,989
Well... Yeah, I built it, bled for it.
So I'd say it's mine.

383
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:05,992
Whatever gives you peace.

384
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:08,034
Baba, wait.

385
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:12,098
You would be a great asset
to the Payan army.

386
00:51:12,122 --> 00:51:13,474
I'm not a soldier.

387
00:51:13,498 --> 00:51:15,751
Well, you might surprise yourself.

388
00:51:16,835 --> 00:51:18,462
This war isn't over, Baba.

389
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:25,803
It is for me.

390
00:51:38,106 --> 00:51:39,941
How many
Witchfinders did we lose?

391
00:51:41,026 --> 00:51:44,071
Twenty-two... today.

392
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:47,700
So, not that many.

393
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:51,867
As Witchfinder General,

394
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:54,915
Ferik had some measure of influence.

395
00:51:57,626 --> 00:51:59,669
He'll recruit more.

396
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:02,089
Will they be a problem?

397
00:52:02,672 --> 00:52:03,924
Undoubtedly.

398
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:06,676
But not immediately.

399
00:52:08,804 --> 00:52:10,306
You sound tired.

400
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,590
You try
serving your sister for 20 years.

401
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:23,026
Well, I hope I can make
the next 20 years a little easier.

402
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:30,200
I think my days of service
have finally come to an end.

403
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:36,058
Tamacti, Paya needs you.

404
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:38,543
- They have you.
- I need you.

405
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:43,588
I'll consider it.

406
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:50,053
Thank you.

407
00:52:52,347 --> 00:52:54,808
Your command of the
council is inspiring.

408
00:52:59,063 --> 00:53:04,694
You are your father's
daughter in every way.

409
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:12,409
You will truly be a great queen.

410
00:53:15,412 --> 00:53:19,583
And Paya will have
the leader it deserves.

411
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:07,172
Oloman.

412
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:11,135
You have a demonstration for me.

413
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:14,430
- Yes.
- Hmm.

414
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:18,225
Let's hope for your sake this one goes
better than your last attempt.

415
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,478
It will.

416
00:54:22,979 --> 00:54:24,272
Get on with it.

417
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:55,220
You're testing my patience.

418
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:57,140
Wait for it.

419
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:14,229
The guard said you were
crying out in your sleep.

420
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,774
A presage as a midwife.

421
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,278
For many years now.

422
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:23,531
Describe what you are feeling.

423
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:28,511
The pain of motherhood.

424
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:31,496
It is early yet for that.

425
00:59:37,586 --> 00:59:38,962
Let me examine you.

426
00:59:56,021 --> 00:59:59,917
How odd...
you being so concerned for me.

427
00:59:59,941 --> 01:00:02,486
My concern lies with the child.

428
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:10,804
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

429
01:00:10,828 --> 01:00:12,747
Your womb is intact.

430
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,125
This baby will come on its birth day.

431
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:23,131
Maghra says this child
will never know me.

432
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,029
You're a midwife, Paris.
Surely you agree,

433
01:00:27,053 --> 01:00:29,514
a child should never be taken
from its true mother.

434
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:35,412
It is not my place to question
the intentions of the queen.

435
01:00:35,436 --> 01:00:36,853
No, of course not.

436
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:42,251
You can't really expect Kofun
to raise a child.

437
01:00:42,275 --> 01:00:43,878
He's practically one himself.

438
01:00:43,902 --> 01:00:45,946
He is very much a man.

439
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:49,366
And he's much stronger than you know.

440
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:05,590
Will you help him?

441
01:01:07,467 --> 01:01:10,554
Of course I will help Kofun.

442
01:01:15,435 --> 01:01:17,014
No, you won't.

443
01:01:19,564 --> 01:01:21,686
And hear this, mountain woman.

444
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:27,612
I will kill this child
before I let it be taken.

445
01:01:29,406 --> 01:01:31,153
And I'll kill anyone who tries.

446
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:38,374
Everything is gonna be all right.

447
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,844
Rock-a-bye.
