1
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:16,294
- Paris.
- Help! We've been betrayed!

2
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,254
- Paris.
- Intruders! Wake up!

3
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:19,756
Paris!

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,217
Haniwa. Haniwa.

5
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:26,137
Your mother, Baba. They must not leave.

6
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,038
They've already left. What's wrong?

7
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,440
I dreamt betrayal.

8
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,838
Blood. Blood and betrayal, Haniwa.

9
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:43,090
Okay. You stay.

10
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,494
Can't you just send someone else?

11
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:52,538
Who should I send? Do you want
me to trust a Witchfinder?

12
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:54,165
Can you even ride a horse?

13
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,833
Kofun does it. How hard can it be?

14
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:58,486
- That's it. I'm coming with you.
- You'll just slow me down.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,429
- Just grab me a horse!
- Charlotte!

16
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:02,581
There's no time.

17
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:09,371
- Swear to me you'll be safe.
- I'll do my best.

18
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:12,207
I promise.

19
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:57,478
Keep to yourself.

20
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,231
Pay attention to all that is said.

21
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,527
I don't see how an agreement
will be reached, but...

22
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,550
if you feel our delegates weakening,

23
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:09,404
you will make them see reason.

24
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:11,784
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,039
You're troubled.

26
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,128
I understand the queen wants war,

27
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:25,899
but an attempt at peace
costs us nothing.

28
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:29,427
Every day we wait to strike
is another day she grows her forces.

29
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:32,614
I've buried enough soldiers this year.

30
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:34,932
You represent me
at the conference.

31
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,994
The other delegates will be wary of you,

32
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,643
but they will also listen to you.

33
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,814
No one will listen to a lieutenant.

34
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:49,196
That is why I am making you a captain.

35
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:00,475
The Payans have killed our people.

36
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:02,436
And instead of avenging their deaths,

37
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,463
the Triangle would prefer
that we appease the enemy.

38
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:08,132
Wren.

39
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:12,779
Sometimes in order to
best serve the republic,

40
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:14,472
you must work around its government.

41
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:18,476
The talks must fail. Do you understand?

42
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,227
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,940
The delegation is leaving. Here.

44
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,485
In case you get hungry.

45
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:30,630
Are you okay?

46
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,843
Kerrigan was always gonna get
himself killed one way or another.

47
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:42,100
I'm pleased he did it in the service
of the princess, my wife...

48
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:45,323
not crossing the border with a bag

49
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,397
of thornflowers stuck up his ass.

50
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:54,029
I need another drink.

51
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:58,426
We can drink later when we
toast the Trivantian delegation.

52
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,203
You can toast those bastards.
I'm drinking to my brother.

53
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,912
- Harlan. We...
- Sorry.

54
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:05,774
You have nothing to be sorry for.

55
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,105
But there's a lot at stake here,

56
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,770
and if you're unable to participate...

57
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:12,964
- I know what's at stake. It's my city.
- ...you have to let me know.

58
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:17,394
I'm fine.

59
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:22,015
If we fail, Sibeth will have her war,

60
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,124
and the Trivantians will destroy us.

61
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:27,223
I just got my family back.

62
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,197
I will not let any harm
come to them now.

63
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,900
Nor will I.

64
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:40,325
Actually, you're the only
family I've got now.

65
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,621
That's pretty sad, huh?

66
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,595
That's 12 heads you've lost today.

67
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,056
- I blocked you twice that time.
- Oh.

68
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,436
We'll tie a knot by your grave

69
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,335
to remember that stunning achievement.

70
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:35,523
How do you do it?

71
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:38,192
It's like you know where
I'm gonna be before I do.

72
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,427
Movement is a language. Hmm?

73
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,304
Dance, combat, fucking.

74
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,224
It's all just bodies
talking to each other.

75
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,294
Now, I'm trying to teach you to listen,

76
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,980
but you just keep swatting at my sword.

77
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,443
Cover your eyes.

78
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,756
Don't think I'm ready for this.

79
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,157
Oh, believe me, you're not.

80
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,909
But sight clearly isn't helping you.

81
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,655
So either it's hurting you,
or you're simply hopeless.

82
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,058
I just wanna find out which it is.

83
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,125
Let's go.

84
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:25,388
Okay.

85
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,374
Dropped my sword...

86
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:37,499
Stop!

87
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,524
What...

88
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:52,856
Good news.

89
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,225
You may not be hopeless.

90
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,605
- But we're done training for today.
- No, I wanna go again.

91
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,839
Well, then you better find
someone else to fight.

92
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:25,406
That is the Payan banner.

93
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,031
Commander Watts

94
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,057
of the Trivantian Empire.

95
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,604
Captain Gosset of the Payan kingdom.

96
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,459
As has been the custom
between our two nations,

97
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:45,694
soldiers shall maintain their
company outside the camp.

98
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,215
All others who enter will be unarmed.

99
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,240
Agreed.

100
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:54,036
Our soldiers will check your delegates,
and yours will check ours.

101
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,080
Agreed.

102
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,549
Then let's begin.

103
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,476
Clear.

104
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,305
- Clear.
- Next.

105
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,397
Clear.

106
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,236
Clear.

107
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,295
Clear.

108
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,138
Clear.

109
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,096
Clear.

110
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:03,497
Clear.

111
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,581
You're fine.

112
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:07,353
- Arms up. Arms higher, huh?
- Arms up.

113
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:12,984
- What is this?
- Move on.

114
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,912
Chet-chet.

115
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,937
Haniwa?
What are you doing here?

116
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:30,899
- I have a message from Paris.
- Shh. Come down here.

117
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:33,819
- When did you learn to ride?
- I didn't.

118
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:36,655
- It hurts a lot actually.
- What does Paris say?

119
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,992
She says you will be betrayed.
We should go now.

120
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:42,578
If we leave the talks,
we are assured of war.

121
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:43,954
She dreamt it, Mama.

122
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,289
She seemed very sure.

123
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,082
Paris's premonitions might come true,

124
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:50,002
but if we walk away,
thousands of people will die.

125
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,152
That is a certainty.

126
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:54,072
Papa.

127
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,385
Your mother will handle our business.

128
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:01,454
We will stay close in case
this betrayal does come to pass.

129
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,082
Thank you.

130
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:09,295
She has been wrong before.

131
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,255
Paris or Mom?

132
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:13,216
Both.

133
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:15,986
It's good you came.

134
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,655
Find a perch. Keep watch.

135
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,680
Okay.

136
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,709
My guards told me
you'd taken to riding.

137
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,837
I was so pleased to hear it.

138
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:53,297
With your sight...

139
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:57,760
you must be able to ride so quickly.

140
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:00,763
How exhilarating.

141
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:02,890
I wonder,

142
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,143
would you take me on a ride?

143
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:21,159
It would mean so much to me.

144
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,410
You okay?

145
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,128
Great.

146
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:09,535
I haven't felt freedom like that
in such a long time.

147
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,587
Really? You're the queen.

148
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,881
Don't mistake power for freedom.

149
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,196
My position binds me to my people,

150
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,223
but it also keeps me
forever at a distance.

151
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:31,103
That sounds lonely.

152
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:35,148
Everyone does
as I command, but...

153
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,985
no one laughs with me...

154
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:42,640
wishes to know how I feel.

155
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,408
Am I happy? Sad?

156
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,911
I'm... I'm the queen.

157
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:51,684
It's been a very long time since someone

158
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,043
treated me with
simple, honest affection.

159
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,139
Thank you.

160
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:15,564
Should we go again?

161
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:35,643
For years there was bloody
conflict between our nations.

162
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:38,479
But for a long while,
the peace has held.

163
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:41,423
And now we hear your queen
has assembled a war council.

164
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:43,884
Know this now,

165
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:48,680
it will be a sorry day for all Payans
if we answer this call to arms.

166
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:52,744
But we have no particular
desire to go to war.

167
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:55,163
Perhaps once you explain
your queen's behavior,

168
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:57,665
we can reach a less bloody solution.

169
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:01,068
The queen has responded
to Trivantian aggression.

170
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,130
Your soldiers have been
encroaching on our land,

171
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:07,366
occupying border towns and
taking our people as slaves.

172
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,885
If your accusations were true,

173
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:12,263
we could talk about settling them.

174
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:13,853
But Trivantian law prohibits

175
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:16,917
any slaving company from
crossing the eastern border.

176
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:20,045
And we have occupied no Payan towns

177
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:24,150
except in retaliation
to military incursions

178
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:26,027
and smuggling across our borders.

179
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:27,612
It's hard to talk about borders

180
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,531
when your government has repeatedly

181
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,200
re-knotted the surveyors' maps,

182
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:34,661
claiming Payan territory as your own.

183
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:38,081
To be clear, is that
a formal accusation?

184
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:39,481
It's a fact.

185
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:41,233
I know that voice.

186
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,045
That's Wren.

187
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:45,946
The woman who saved us in Trivantes.

188
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:51,201
Sounds like you're happy to see her.

189
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:54,663
I am.

190
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:03,004
It's always the hard way with you.

191
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:11,948
If this was a
simple border dispute,

192
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,602
perhaps you'd just review the maps

193
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,752
and agree on our respective territories.

194
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,561
Yes, but...

195
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:22,667
any peace must come
with an official apology

196
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,192
for the attack on Kanzua.

197
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:27,338
An apology?
You can't be serious.

198
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:30,049
We will not apologize
for something we did not do.

199
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:33,136
You destroyed the dam
and tried to murder our queen.

200
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,554
We did no such thing!

201
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:37,056
Come on. We're talking a simple apology.

202
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,475
We are the strongest military
power on the continent.

203
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:43,228
If we wanted your queen dead,
she'd be dead.

204
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,731
It's that strength that makes you
the only nation

205
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,983
capable of pulling off
an attack on Kanzua.

206
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,652
Your queen is despised
by many of her own.

207
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:53,864
I would not be surprised
if this so-called attack

208
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,907
came from within her own camp.

209
00:18:55,931 --> 00:19:00,162
Regardless, we will not take the blame
for something we did not do,

210
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:01,912
just as we will stand by any actions

211
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:04,081
we did take in defense of our nation.

212
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,318
For instance, Lord Harlan,

213
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,047
we made no secret
of beheading your brother

214
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,740
after he was caught spying in our city.

215
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:15,469
As a matter of fact,

216
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,870
we sent his head back
to you as a courtesy.

217
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:21,874
We tried to make it quick,
but he refused to cooperate.

218
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:27,254
- Captain Gosset!
- I'll kill you!

219
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:28,839
Come on!

220
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:32,694
All right. That's enough.

221
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:33,945
Have you lost your mind?

222
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:35,947
- Fuck you!
- I want him arrested at once!

223
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,117
This is a peace summit on neutral
grounds. There will be no arrests!

224
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:41,078
- Shove a poker up your ass!
- I apologize.

225
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:42,579
Don't apologize to them.

226
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:44,956
This conference was a waste
of time. We're done here.

227
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,024
Are you leaving? Oh, no.

228
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,419
Bye-bye. Good night.

229
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,363
Sweet dreams, assholes.

230
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:23,102
- Paris.
- Most people chop firewood outside.

231
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:26,647
I'm doing sword drills.

232
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:31,293
And... you just do the same
motion over and over

233
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:32,797
until it becomes thoughtless.

234
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,091
In battle, there's no time to think.

235
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:40,012
Mmm. Did Toad teach you that?

236
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:41,954
No, it's a fundamental rule of combat.

237
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:49,086
Remember...

238
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:54,408
there are weapons more powerful
than swords. Hmm?

239
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:58,363
Compassion, love...

240
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,181
Love didn't save our people.

241
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:07,021
I sense you're different, Kofun.

242
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:11,067
So much anger.

243
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,652
Of course I'm angry.

244
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:16,447
I've been lied to my entire life.

245
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,031
You've spent
time with the queen.

246
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,796
Be careful. Be very careful, my dear.

247
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:33,923
This queen...

248
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,631
serves only one interest.

249
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:41,806
Her own.

250
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:45,017
Or maybe she's just careful
about who she trusts.

251
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:53,734
Well, at least she doesn't pretend
to be someone she's not.

252
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,479
I'm busy, Paris.

253
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:10,583
You both need to calm down.

254
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:12,585
No harm was done.

255
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:14,212
No harm?

256
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,149
You almost started the war right there.

257
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:19,694
I may have had a bad moment, granted...

258
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:22,571
Your bad moment has ended
any chance of a negotiated peace.

259
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:25,640
Well, if that's true, why haven't
the Trivantians ridden off yet?

260
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:32,063
Maghra, you're new to this.

261
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:34,543
And, Boo-Boo,

262
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,198
you don't strike me as the kind of guy

263
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,003
to negotiate his way out of a fight.

264
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:40,549
So you'll both have to trust me
when I tell you

265
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:42,467
we've gained invaluable knowledge.

266
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:43,552
And what is that?

267
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:46,764
The Trivantians might actually
be serious about peace.

268
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,641
They will never return to the table.

269
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:50,852
Yeah, well, they will.

270
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,711
But the table doesn't matter.

271
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,592
What matters is the deal you make
before you get to the table.

272
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,345
What are you talking about?

273
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,909
What have you done without my authority?

274
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,870
I acted in your name

275
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:10,165
and with your best interests
at heart, Princess.

276
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,751
We have a meeting tonight
with Ambassador Scopus.

277
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,918
It's a private meeting,

278
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:18,782
away from the bluster and the
threats and Torrance's spying.

279
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:22,327
We negotiate the peace tonight,

280
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:27,500
and then we pretend to do it again
at the table in the morning.

281
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,688
You will not go to this meeting.

282
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:32,963
Excuse me?

283
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:36,110
You mean my meeting
that I set up for me?

284
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:37,445
Yeah, I think I will.

285
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:40,281
No. You have another one
of your bad moments,

286
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:42,575
you and Maghra will be dead right there.

287
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,660
I will go with her.

288
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:44,911
Oh, yeah.

289
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:48,791
A Trivantian traitor wanted for murder.
What could possibly go wrong?

290
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:51,401
Just... Just stop it, both of you.

291
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:59,219
Lord Harlan, that is the last time

292
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:01,309
you will negotiate anything on my behalf

293
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,674
without my express permission.

294
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:03,824
Is that understood?

295
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,585
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

296
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,715
Now.

297
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:14,426
This is how we move forward.

298
00:24:15,928 --> 00:24:18,991
Harlan, you will attend the meeting
with me, but so will Baba Voss.

299
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,867
And if you speak one word out of line,

300
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,936
he will render you speechless
with a method of his choice.

301
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:31,528
Now, where is this meeting
you've arranged?

302
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,602
You forgot to mention
you were Payan royalty.

303
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:45,067
I would have... if I had known.

304
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:47,320
You didn't know?

305
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:50,360
It's a long story.

306
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:54,369
Well, you'll have to tell me sometime.

307
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:05,005
Every day since I escaped,
I've dreamed of seeing you again.

308
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:08,381
I know this is difficult.

309
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:12,825
Our nations are about to go to war.

310
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:14,851
Not if this conference is successful.

311
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:18,814
It won't be.

312
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:20,524
You can't know that.

313
00:26:22,735 --> 00:26:23,736
Can you?

314
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:28,653
And if our people go to war...

315
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,015
...you will fight for yours,
and I will fight for mine.

316
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,166
We just can't let that happen, Wren.

317
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:40,504
I know my mother doesn't want war.

318
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:45,426
I'm not sure there can be peace...

319
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:48,513
between our people.

320
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:57,647
And I don't wanna fight you.

321
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:00,193
Wren.

322
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,625
I will never fight you.

323
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,694
Scopus?

324
00:27:41,113 --> 00:27:42,114
You here?

325
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:45,946
Where else would I be?

326
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:52,626
Harlan. And who is with you?

327
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,645
As promised, brought the princess.

328
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:56,855
- Princess.
- Ambassador.

329
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,693
Please let me offer
my most sincere apologies

330
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:02,153
for Lord Harlan's inexcusable outburst.

331
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:03,858
You did make a fool of yourself, Harlan,

332
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,990
acting out like a temperamental child.

333
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,992
Imagine if you'd actually harmed Watts.

334
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:10,395
Come on. It's not a summit
till someone gets hit.

335
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,709
So... we gonna do this?

336
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:15,859
Where do we begin?

337
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:18,462
We know you didn't attack Kanzua.

338
00:28:18,486 --> 00:28:20,257
Princess, I appreciate your candor.

339
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,509
A refreshing change from earlier today,

340
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:25,412
but I didn't need to crawl down here
to hear what I already know.

341
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,396
Then I'll tell you something
you don't know.

342
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,835
Within a very short time,
my sister will no longer be queen.

343
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,255
I'm listening.

344
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,735
The queen has not been
herself since the fall of Kanzua.

345
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,990
She has suffered greatly, and her
judgment has become questionable.

346
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,533
And your judgment is more sound?

347
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,702
There'll be no victor in a war
between our countries.

348
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,787
I'm quite confident there would be.

349
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,457
You're asking my government to apologize

350
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:51,916
for an attack we did not commit.

351
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,294
When I am queen,
I will disavow the apology

352
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,712
and make the truth known.

353
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,589
Why would I agree to this?

354
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,841
For the same reason
you're here at all.

355
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:03,512
We all know the Triangle
does not want a second war.

356
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:04,889
You turn your back on the Ganites,

357
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:07,016
and they'll be through your walls
in a matter of weeks.

358
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,684
The Ganites are cockroaches

359
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:11,229
and crushed under our boots
on a daily basis.

360
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:13,798
And all those boots are
mobilized in the west.

361
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:18,028
It would be a grave error
to underestimate our capabilities.

362
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,303
Yeah, I know.

363
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,850
But you know our queen
is capable of such errors.

364
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,187
So, do we have a deal?

365
00:29:29,523 --> 00:29:32,711
So, Harlan, you've married
yourself a future queen.

366
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:35,321
A bold gamble, even for you.

367
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,493
Well, we're all slaves to
the vagaries of true love.

368
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,518
Thank you
for dining with me.

369
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,300
Gets so quiet when everyone's away.

370
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:06,605
Thank you for the ride this morning.

371
00:30:08,065 --> 00:30:09,108
It was nothing.

372
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:10,776
It was not nothing.

373
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:14,298
I'd like to return the favor.

374
00:30:14,322 --> 00:30:16,199
- Harmony?
- Your Highness?

375
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,868
Do you have it?

376
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,620
Yes, a portion for each of you.

377
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,778
Your service is a blessing.

378
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:34,887
Thank you, my Queen.

379
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:40,809
Have you
had thornflower before?

380
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:43,021
The journeyer?

381
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:44,874
It's forbidden.

382
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:47,901
I won't tell if you don't.

383
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,031
I've never taken journeyers before.

384
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,911
I'm honored to take your
first journey with you.

385
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:00,749
What are its effects?

386
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:04,480
I cannot explain it to you any more than

387
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:06,794
you can explain sight to me.

388
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,278
I'll give you the same amount I take.

389
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,597
Surely a man your size can handle that.

390
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,608
Now me.

391
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:50,345
And now we wait.

392
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:24,967
I don't feel anything.

393
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,411
To feel, you
have to touch.

394
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:34,603
Touch?

395
00:32:47,825 --> 00:32:49,762
Yeah, I feel, uh...

396
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:51,430
I... I feel...

397
00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:53,206
Not like that, Kofun.

398
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:22,154
Do you feel that?

399
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,449
Yes.

400
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:44,930
Oh, I feel that.

401
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:02,307
- Sibeth.
- Mmm?

402
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:04,935
Sibeth.

403
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,708
Should I stop?

404
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:16,672
No.

405
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,768
So, what do you think?

406
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:45,672
Scopus will make
the deal. Trust me.

407
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:48,176
- I don't trust you or him.
- Hey, Baba.

408
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,251
Ask your husband
how it is he has the ear

409
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,424
of a high-ranking Trivantian ambassador.

410
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,049
He does make a good point, Harlan.
It is suspicious.

411
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:56,366
I'm no spy.

412
00:35:57,076 --> 00:35:58,202
So, what then?

413
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:03,499
The queen's tax.
It's fucking high and stupid.

414
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,314
So, in order to keep the city fortified

415
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,565
and keep my citizens
fed in leaner times,

416
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:10,700
I occasionally have to make the odd deal

417
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:12,294
beyond the reach of Kanzua.

418
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:14,762
It's thornflower. Coal.

419
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:16,597
So, you broke the law?

420
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,560
Cute. Yeah, I broke the
law for my people.

421
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,957
Mmm. No doubt taking a good
percentage for your efforts.

422
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:27,693
A fair one. The risk was all mine.

423
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:32,364
Look, we all have our
questionable pasts, don't we?

424
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:34,676
And you should be grateful for mine,

425
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,537
because otherwise we'd all be
skipping off to war right now.

426
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:43,436
So, Baba Voss, unless you got
any more pretty little threats for me,

427
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,753
I'm gonna go to sleep.

428
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:48,591
We have a peace to pretend
to negotiate in the morning.

429
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:52,386
It's been a long day.
We should all go to bed.

430
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:55,807
We can argue more tomorrow.

431
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:58,227
Uh, excuse me.

432
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:01,396
Get out of my way.

433
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,023
No.

434
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:06,211
How we sleep in private is one thing,

435
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:08,672
but Scopus just made a deal

436
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:11,741
with queen-to-be Maghra
and her king-to-be Harlan.

437
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:14,577
Can't let anything confuse that, can we?

438
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:25,756
If you touch her...

439
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:32,222
One of these days,
I'm gonna make you finish that sentence.

440
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:34,724
I'll sleep out here with you.

441
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,646
What?

442
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:47,280
He's a jackass, but he's right.

443
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:52,077
I don't want to be the reason
for your failure.

444
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:57,332
It's too cold for you out here anyways.

445
00:37:58,626 --> 00:37:59,627
Go in.

446
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,047
You sure?

447
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:07,260
Yes.

448
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,457
We all know Trivantes
did not attack Kanzua.

449
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:17,838
But we also know your queen is
deranged enough to go to war anyway.

450
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:21,027
So, we will deal with her the way

451
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:23,036
you deal with a child having a tantrum.

452
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,763
In the interests of peace,

453
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:28,474
we will grant her the
apology she craves.

454
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:31,246
Thank you, Ambassador.

455
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,706
And in exchange for this lie,

456
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,234
you will accept the borders
as they are knotted on our maps.

457
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:38,735
Agreed?

458
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:41,085
We accept your proposal and thank you

459
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:42,659
on behalf of the Payan people.

460
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:44,059
Excellent.

461
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:46,971
Our clerks will have the day
to redraw the maps,

462
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:49,122
and we'll review them tomorrow
before we depart.

463
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,793
Uh, one more thing before we adjourn.

464
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:56,564
This, uh, business of your
queen embracing sight,

465
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,492
that must end.

466
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:04,198
If the sighted are allowed
to grow and prosper there,

467
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:08,092
no amount of border concessions
will save you from destruction.

468
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:35,925
Hello, Paris.

469
00:40:39,512 --> 00:40:40,513
Hello.

470
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,485
I don't recall inviting you to join me.

471
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:54,987
I didn't want you to dine alone.

472
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:58,342
Maybe I like dining alone.

473
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:00,284
No one likes dining alone.

474
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,976
When I asked you to stay close to Kofun,

475
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,540
I did not mean turn him into a soldier.

476
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:13,067
Believe me, there's no risk of that.

477
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:16,386
I'm serious. He is under your care.

478
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:20,024
It is your responsibility to...
to guide him.

479
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:22,494
I'm teaching a boy
how to protect himself,

480
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:23,995
- nothing more.
- Toad.

481
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:26,456
My whole life, I was
taught to kill witches.

482
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,524
Now you tell me I must protect them.

483
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:32,922
So, why should I trust you?

484
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:34,865
You must trust yourself.

485
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:41,055
You, and you alone, are responsible
for every choice you make, man.

486
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:42,331
What if I choose wrong?

487
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:44,768
You won't.

488
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:45,877
How do you know?

489
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,591
Because...

490
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:57,539
I can tell you are a good man...

491
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,812
with a very stupid name.

492
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,653
Good man.

493
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:27,798
Good morning.

494
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:30,550
Hi.

495
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:54,160
Are you regretting last night?

496
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:01,209
I... I've just never done that before.

497
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,426
What is new is always frightening...

498
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,138
but also exciting.

499
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,814
I wouldn't wanna do anything
that makes you uncomfortable.

500
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:26,863
These days that seems to be everything.

501
00:43:31,534 --> 00:43:32,785
You've had a hard time.

502
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:37,457
You don't know who to trust.

503
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,650
Let's make a pact, right now.

504
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:46,384
I will never lie to you.

505
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:50,513
You will never lie to me.

506
00:43:51,723 --> 00:43:55,728
Even when the things we tell each
other might be painful to hear.

507
00:43:58,355 --> 00:43:59,356
Agreed?

508
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:02,860
Agreed.

509
00:44:10,702 --> 00:44:11,995
This peace...

510
00:44:13,747 --> 00:44:16,083
it's built on so many lies.

511
00:44:19,712 --> 00:44:21,047
And it won't stand.

512
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,177
Maybe there's a greater truth
beyond all the lies.

513
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:30,974
And what truth is that?

514
00:44:33,268 --> 00:44:34,729
That no one wants war.

515
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,986
I wish I was as hopeful as you are.

516
00:44:43,613 --> 00:44:44,615
Well...

517
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:49,495
if you stay close,
maybe it will rub off.

518
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,054
Intruders! Wake up!

519
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,640
What's happening?

520
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:29,429
Commander Watts?

521
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:32,473
Who's there?

522
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:42,646
Who's...

523
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:58,436
Help! Help! Guards!

524
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,832
We've been betrayed!

525
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,191
Scopus.

526
00:50:20,694 --> 00:50:21,755
I'm sorry.

527
00:50:21,779 --> 00:50:24,198
- No.
- Wren.

528
00:50:28,285 --> 00:50:30,580
Papa, stay back!

529
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:35,561
You. You did this.

530
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:38,189
Wren. No.

531
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:39,815
This was your plan all along.

532
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,568
No, it wasn't us.

533
00:50:41,592 --> 00:50:44,079
You knew I was the only one
who could stop this.

534
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:46,514
- Wren.
- You kept me up there.

535
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,203
You used me.

536
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:52,688
No. No.

537
00:50:56,508 --> 00:50:57,509
Wren, wait!

538
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,515
This assassin has Payan markings.

539
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:30,270
Sibeth.

540
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:36,694
Shit.

541
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,299
She was never gonna allow a treaty.

542
00:51:40,323 --> 00:51:41,720
This whole summit was just a way

543
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:44,074
for her to wage a war we couldn't stop.

544
00:51:48,123 --> 00:51:49,666
I almost admire her,

545
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:53,564
if it weren't for the fact
she's gonna get us all killed.

546
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:54,708
We need to move.

547
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:58,134
The Trivantians will be here
before the God Flame rises.

548
00:52:22,161 --> 00:52:23,162
Kofun?

549
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:27,333
Kofun?

550
00:52:30,845 --> 00:52:32,046
Sibeth.

551
00:52:36,093 --> 00:52:37,553
I'm so sorry to wake you.

552
00:52:38,178 --> 00:52:39,614
No, what's wrong?

553
00:52:39,638 --> 00:52:41,807
Something's happening.
I'm not safe here.

554
00:52:42,934 --> 00:52:45,538
What... What's... What is it?
What's happening?

555
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:49,222
Well, nothing yet, but
something will. I'm sure of it.

556
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:53,566
You are the only one I trust.

557
00:53:01,036 --> 00:53:02,539
Y-You can stay with me.

558
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:05,876
Thank you.

559
00:54:32,604 --> 00:54:33,939
How was your trip?

560
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:54,955
You don't seem surprised.

561
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:59,960
That Queen Kane
wanted war? No. I'm not surprised.

562
00:55:01,128 --> 00:55:02,629
I tried to warn the Triangle.

563
00:55:05,383 --> 00:55:07,135
Those soldiers didn't have to die.

564
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:10,513
There's something else
you should know.

565
00:55:13,316 --> 00:55:14,610
The attack...

566
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:17,813
I believe it was led by Baba Voss.

567
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:21,817
So Baba and his children
fight for the queen now.

568
00:55:23,777 --> 00:55:27,240
It was I who drew him here
and let him escape.

569
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,804
If this gets out, the Triangle
will call for my head.

570
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,413
They will not hear it from me.

571
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:41,172
You're the only survivor.
The Triangle will have questions.

572
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,969
The first of those questions will be:

573
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:52,226
How is it that the lone survivor
of the attack was my own captain?

574
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:56,105
You think I'm a traitor?

575
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:59,609
No. Of course not.

576
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:02,862
I've known you since you were a child.

577
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:08,494
Still, the ground does continue
to shift under our feet.

578
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:12,248
So I need to know the answer
to this question, Captain.

579
00:56:16,044 --> 00:56:18,964
How is it that you alone survived?

580
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:23,013
- I would have thought you would be glad...
- Answer me.

581
00:57:10,816 --> 00:57:12,306
Because I can see.
