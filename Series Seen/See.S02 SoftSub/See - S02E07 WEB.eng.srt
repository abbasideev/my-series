1
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:11,831
Talk of peace is in the past now.

2
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:17,423
After the delegation's failure
at the peace summit,

3
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:20,408
we're left with only one path forward.

4
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:22,635
War.

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,919
Remember this moment.

6
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,964
Your names will be burned
into Payan history

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,342
as the women and men
who stood with their queen

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,264
to lead Paya into a new and blessed age.

9
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:40,124
She's lying. Someone needs to stop her.

10
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:42,519
Not now.

11
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,564
Lord Harlan, have all the
representatives signed?

12
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:49,843
Yes.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,472
The knots of all the representatives
have been added.

14
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,536
Then, my ladies and lords,

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,080
we're now at war.

16
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:02,391
Have your captains report
to my Witchfinder general

17
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:03,600
for assignments immediately.

18
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:06,652
There is still another matter
to be brought before this council.

19
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:11,250
Princess Maghra, there is always
something with you, isn't there?

20
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:12,260
What is it now?

21
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,744
It's about the Witchfinders.

22
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,205
What about them?

23
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:19,067
They will not fight for you.

24
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:23,720
My Witchfinders will do as I say,

25
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:25,975
as they have done my entire reign.

26
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,818
They're my army.

27
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:29,048
No.

28
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:40,982
They are my army.

29
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:43,777
Tamacti Jun?

30
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:46,923
I'm glad you haven't forgotten me.

31
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:50,301
You're alive!
Thank the God Flame.

32
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:53,222
You have no idea what I went through.

33
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,922
If you're gonna trade in lies,

34
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:57,807
make sure the truth
is buried with the dead.

35
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:02,459
- Lies?
- It was you who destroyed Kanzua.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,926
He is lying!

37
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,302
Arrest this man.

38
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:12,118
I said arrest this man!

39
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:15,103
They don't serve you anymore.

40
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:18,641
- Tak!
- Tak! Tak!

41
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,818
Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak!

42
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:24,798
Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak! Tak!

43
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:29,410
It was you who murdered
your own people...

44
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:33,330
who killed their families.

45
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,752
My family.

46
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:48,806
It was you who tried to murder me.

47
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:54,079
These are serious allegations, General.

48
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,732
They're not allegations. They're truths.

49
00:02:58,275 --> 00:02:59,943
Like you, Captain Gosset,

50
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,489
I have been loyal to the crown
my entire life.

51
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:05,574
But this queen...

52
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:08,119
this woman...

53
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,974
this thing

54
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:13,517
is an abomination.

55
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,186
He keeps on lying!

56
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,671
Maghra, tell them he's lying.

57
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:19,965
He speaks the truth.

58
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,427
You've betrayed your people
for the last time.

59
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,640
This council has a decision to make.

60
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:31,244
War is now inevitable.

61
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,566
But will we be led by
this lying murderer...

62
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:42,907
or will we fight for the true queen...

63
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,827
Maghra?

64
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:51,542
Oh, so it's a coup?

65
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:53,502
I understand.

66
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,523
At our nation's gravest hour,

67
00:03:56,547 --> 00:04:01,153
my sister resorts to trickery
and lies to steal the throne.

68
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:04,248
But she forgets that my army

69
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:07,182
is much larger than a few Witchfinders.

70
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:11,313
Captain Gosset, arrest these traitors.

71
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:13,524
Yeah...

72
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,026
No.

73
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:21,800
The army of Pennsa stands
with Queen Maghra.

74
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:24,762
She's not your fucking queen!

75
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,955
Let's agree to disagree, shall we?

76
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:31,561
I can confirm the allegations
made by Tamacti Jun are true.

77
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:34,248
I have witnesses from Kanzua
who will tell you

78
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:37,295
the destruction of the city
was her doing.

79
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:40,737
And queen or no,

80
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,992
treason and murder
are punishable by death.

81
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:48,020
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
I'm entitled to a trial.

82
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:53,133
You yourself just declared the war
you so desperately wanted.

83
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,307
And by knotting the war declaration,

84
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:04,287
you transferred authority
from the courts...

85
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,578
to the generals.

86
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:12,713
You thought this through.

87
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:15,674
I've had some time.

88
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,056
Thank you for your service.

89
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:24,434
Wait!

90
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:26,979
She is with child.

91
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:35,279
Sibeth lost her child shortly
after we arrived in Pennsa.

92
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:37,281
This is a new one.

93
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:39,701
Still forming.

94
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,063
I feel him strongly.

95
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,135
This child must not be killed
for the sins of the mother.

96
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:52,024
Her death can wait. Toad.

97
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:54,568
That's twice now you failed
to kill me, Tamacti Jun.

98
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:57,071
- Get her out of here.
- The prophecy remains!

99
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,616
And the God Flame is still with me.

100
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,910
The child has arrived just in time
to save his mother.

101
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:06,414
People, be true to the crown!

102
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:09,626
Do not rest until your queen
is back on the throne.

103
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,171
And the rest of you traitors,
you will be flayed alive.

104
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,322
Put her in her chambers under guard.

105
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:17,593
Keeping her
in the palace is unwise.

106
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:20,449
It is the most fortified
building in all of Pennsa.

107
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,125
Quiet.

108
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:28,332
Do you hear that?

109
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,862
Woodvale has fallen.

110
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:47,317
We took Woodvale
with zero Trivantian casualties.

111
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,007
Thanks to your vision, we arrived

112
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,797
days before they were expecting us.

113
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:54,634
Still managed to get
the signal out though.

114
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,645
Pennsa knows we're on our way.

115
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:58,050
That won't make them any more ready

116
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,754
for the full might of this battalion.

117
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:03,334
And once the council
hears of our fast victory...

118
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:06,788
they will finally ratify my strategy.

119
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,342
You mean using sighted soldiers?

120
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:20,228
General, please, the council
cannot know about me.

121
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:23,815
I won't identify you until it's safe.

122
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:28,028
Wren, you're like a daughter to me.

123
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,323
I will protect you. You have my word.

124
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:04,109
The Trivantians have reached
Woodvale faster than expected.

125
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:08,447
At this rate, they'll be in Pennsa
in five or six days.

126
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:11,241
How could their army
be moving this fast?

127
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:13,660
They have sighted soldiers
guiding their armies.

128
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:16,831
The Trivantians wouldn't
condone sight in any form.

129
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,241
The commander general has been

130
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,376
secretly recruiting and training them.

131
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,087
If the Trivantians reach Pennsa,
we're finished.

132
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:28,185
Agreed. Greenhill Gap.
Is the fortress still active?

133
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,387
Of course. Fully fortified, 20 men.

134
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,806
We'll make our stand there.

135
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,309
No. Greenhill Gap's a stone's throw
from Pennsa. It's too close.

136
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,938
It's the only place
that we can command the high ground.

137
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:39,163
Gives us a chance.

138
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,817
Any word on their numbers?

139
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,985
They're heavily committed in the west.

140
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:48,040
Our spies estimate 250 men.
A small force by Trivantian standards.

141
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,474
Bigger than ours.

142
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:53,121
I want every available soldier
and munition in Paya

143
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:55,730
at Greenhill Gap in two days' time.

144
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:58,001
Captain Gosset, ready your soldiers.

145
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:00,354
We march tomorrow
with the rise of the God Flame.

146
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,381
No. Think, Maghra.

147
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,081
If they truly have sighted soldiers,

148
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,706
we're at even more of a disadvantage.

149
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,507
You will have sighted soldiers too.

150
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:09,688
- No.
- We're going.

151
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,166
You are not soldiers.

152
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,562
No, we're the children of the queen.
This is our fight too.

153
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,690
Your father is right. You and
your sister have no training.

154
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:21,509
You cannot be expected to fight
just because you can see.

155
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:25,614
- I don't wanna intrude on family matters...
- Then do not.

156
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:28,104
But as you yourself
have said many times,

157
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,224
we face a far superior army.

158
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:35,250
We need every advantage
we can get in this battle.

159
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:37,776
Sight offers no
advantage on the killing field.

160
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,088
As I have learned with my own children,

161
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:42,091
more often than not,
their vision betrays them.

162
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:46,971
And these sighted soldiers will give
Edo's army a false confidence.

163
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,639
We need not do the same with ours.

164
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:51,007
Edo has developed systems
for using them.

165
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,144
I've witnessed it myself.

166
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,288
Papa, you are a great warrior...

167
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,402
but the truth is there are things
we can do that you can't.

168
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,853
That is the same thing
that Jerlamarel said

169
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:04,384
just before I took his eyes.

170
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:07,577
You can't protect
us from this fight.

171
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,953
It is not a fight.

172
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:11,915
This is a slaughter, and my children
will not be a part of it!

173
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,686
- Yes, I will.
- I will.

174
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:16,444
Maghra.

175
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:22,259
- We are not sending our children to war.
- I can't stop them.

176
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,930
You said you became queen to protect
them. And this is what you do?

177
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:27,557
Do you think it's any easier
for me to let them go?

178
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:30,393
Believe me, I would like nothing more
than just to lock them up.

179
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:33,053
Then do that. We will
force them to stay.

180
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:36,442
Haniwa and Kofun are
not children anymore.

181
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:40,215
They're adults with opinions
and ideas of their own.

182
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:47,454
It was not so long ago

183
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:51,959
that our entire world
was just the four of us.

184
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,026
We never needed any of this.

185
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:56,529
When we were all separated,

186
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:59,783
you must have thought you would
never get your family back.

187
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:01,702
And now you have.

188
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,140
Let us take our children.

189
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:07,935
Let us be a family again.
This is not our fight.

190
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,187
Please just... just stop saying that.

191
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,231
This is a war that was
started by your sister!

192
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:14,900
No. We've all made choices
that brought us here today.

193
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:18,344
Now war is upon us, and
we must greet it head-on.

194
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,163
You speak of war as if
you've been in one.

195
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:29,333
You have no idea what you
are sending our children into.

196
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:32,272
- I am not sending them in...
- Their deaths will be on your hands!

197
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:57,204
I did everything I could
to avoid this war.

198
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:02,393
But now I have no choice but to win it.

199
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:27,629
You can't.

200
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,888
Where are you going?

201
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:44,730
I'm going to war. Along with
the rest of your family.

202
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,910
Do you wanna count it?

203
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,288
You've never been short before.

204
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:01,583
And you've never failed to deliver.

205
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:06,397
Once I take payment,
the contract is sealed.

206
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,673
Say you hear.

207
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:10,843
Must we go through this every time?

208
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,029
Say you hear.

209
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,531
I hear.

210
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:18,411
The contract cannot be
nullified. Say you hear.

211
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:20,562
I hear.

212
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,185
Now get it done.

213
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,869
Instead of lurking around,
why don't you join me?

214
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:43,128
The man who just left, who was he?

215
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:47,799
Pray you never have to find out.

216
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,220
Baba?

217
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,207
I know you're there.

218
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,693
You've been inside of me, Kofun.

219
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:40,238
I recognize your scent in my sleep.

220
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,094
Why do you seem happy?

221
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,555
Why wouldn't I be?

222
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,536
My faith has been restored.

223
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,729
The prophecy remains intact.

224
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,983
Do you understand? You're a sacred
instrument of the God Flame.

225
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:04,366
The baby...

226
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:06,576
...is it mine?

227
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,125
You know...

228
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,650
- The way every father knows.
- No. You used me.

229
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:23,679
I don't recall
you complaining.

230
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,533
- No.
- Mmm.

231
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,183
Stop!

232
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,786
What are you doing?

233
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:49,206
What is this?

234
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:55,714
Stop it right now.

235
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,300
If you want to.

236
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,178
You can put an end to your nightmare.

237
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:57,072
Promised you I'd never
lie to you, Kofun.

238
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:59,534
So I'm gonna tell you the truth.

239
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,664
You still see yourself as a child...

240
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:08,167
which makes you a weak man.

241
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,256
The time has come for you to be strong.

242
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,261
This child is your son, and you'll
have to claim him as such.

243
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,284
Regardless of whatever immature
shame you might feel in doing so,

244
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:25,103
not just because he's your son,
but because he's mine.

245
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:31,753
This child is vital to
the future of Paya.

246
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:34,589
- What are you talking about?
- I tried to explain it to Jerlamarel,

247
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:38,051
but he thought his vision meant
he didn't need anyone else.

248
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,828
He could just run off,
start his own world.

249
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:45,333
This world still belongs
to the unsighted.

250
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,858
Only I, a queen ordained by God,
can lift it out of darkness

251
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:54,294
toward a new future governed by light.

252
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,569
You're not queen anymore.

253
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:57,990
Of course I am.

254
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:00,474
It'll all be sorted. It's God's will.

255
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,853
Was it God's will for you
to murder the people of Kanzua?

256
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:07,041
Destroying Kanzua brought me here.

257
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,026
To you. To our baby.

258
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:14,193
They are going to kill you
the moment it's born.

259
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:17,535
Your baby will be an orphan.

260
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:22,790
No. He's the son of a prince.

261
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,624
I'm nobody's father.

262
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,295
If you abandon him, you're
no different than Jerlamarel.

263
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,720
Tell them the truth, Kofun.

264
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,992
He's your blood.

265
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:40,602
If you die in battle,
the truth will die with you.

266
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:42,938
Tell them!

267
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:46,441
Be a fucking man!

268
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,027
Your Majesty.

269
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:54,241
I heard a rumor that the queen
herself was girding for battle.

270
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,178
And you think you should stop me?

271
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,347
Oh, I'm not thinking of you at all.

272
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:02,457
I'm thinking of the soldiers
who will die trying to protect you.

273
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:04,894
Well, no one need protect me.

274
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,594
There's little purpose
in the queen coming

275
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:08,397
if she doesn't make it
known she's coming.

276
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:11,692
And once she makes it known,
her army will be more focused

277
00:21:11,716 --> 00:21:13,444
on her safety than victory.

278
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:15,053
She will be a liability.

279
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:18,199
Do you understand
what you're asking of me?

280
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:19,683
I'm not asking.

281
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:22,828
I'm not my sister.

282
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:25,681
I will not send my people,
my family, into battle

283
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:28,417
while I sit at home, drinking tea.

284
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:31,444
That's the reaction of
a mother, not a queen.

285
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:35,490
Sentimental, not practical.

286
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:40,596
My job is to win this battle.

287
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,474
And I will not have
my battle plan compromised.

288
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:44,916
Not even by you.

289
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,043
Sentimental?

290
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,881
So what do you propose I do?

291
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:53,633
You will do...

292
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,803
what every great leader must do.

293
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:01,558
Bless and inspire your army.

294
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:05,562
And be there to pick up the
pieces when we return.

295
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,607
You're serious.

296
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:11,693
Have you ever known me to be otherwise?

297
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:16,216
I understand you'll be joining us.

298
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:32,707
It doesn't sound like ordinary
God bone. May I?

299
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:39,865
Heavy.

300
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,033
Unwieldy.

301
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,579
For a small hand, yes.

302
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,335
A surreal set of alliances.

303
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,883
You are fighting with your former
enemy against your former home.

304
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:01,487
I fight for my family, not the crown.

305
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:05,056
Your wife is the crown.
So is there any difference?

306
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,519
I understand.

307
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,525
I once was a husband.

308
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:17,611
And a father.

309
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,991
Kanzua.

310
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:26,411
Yes. Kanzua.

311
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:33,960
Sorry for your loss.

312
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:39,090
You spent years fighting
in the service of your family.

313
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:44,054
And I lost my family
in the service of the fight.

314
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:49,726
I do hope yours fares better than mine.

315
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:57,667
My own brother stands
between us and victory.

316
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:02,072
No matter the outcome, I will lose.

317
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:06,618
If there's a better definition of war...

318
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:09,871
I have yet to hear it.

319
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:12,249
You know we can't win.

320
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,628
They are better trained.
They are better armed.

321
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,299
At least there's fewer of us.

322
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,059
You and I are soldiers.

323
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:34,729
We fight even when we know
we're gonna lose.

324
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:39,252
That's what makes us different
than the others.

325
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:40,485
I'm not a soldier.

326
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:43,572
I come to win.

327
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:10,533
- Your Majesty.
- Captain.

328
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:12,285
The heralds are ready to announce you.

329
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,555
Thank you.

330
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,648
How do I send people
off to a war I didn't start?

331
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:22,879
- Are you asking my advice?
- Yes.

332
00:26:22,903 --> 00:26:24,380
Excellent.

333
00:26:24,404 --> 00:26:26,531
I have none to give,
but thank you for asking.

334
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:31,786
Listen to me.

335
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:35,332
This is the role you were born for.

336
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,502
I don't doubt for an instant
you'll find the words.

337
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,632
- Harlan.
- The queen is ready.

338
00:26:44,507 --> 00:26:45,717
Yes, sir.

339
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:01,015
Her Majesty the queen.

340
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:12,410
Charlotte.

341
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,432
You didn't think I'd let you
sneak off again, did you?

342
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:18,976
I thought the Compass stayed out
of war and politics.

343
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,002
We do.

344
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:22,480
My only charge, though,
is to bring you back alive.

345
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:24,055
And if that means killing
a whole mess of.

346
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,560
Trivantian soldiers, so be it.

347
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:27,324
- Hey, Kofun.
- Haniwa.

348
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,380
Citizens of Paya.

349
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:15,473
My sister has put our nation
in great jeopardy.

350
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,312
It was because of
her manipulation and lies

351
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:25,317
that we now face the Trivantian
army at our doorstep.

352
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:28,837
I won't deny this.

353
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:31,339
You've been lied to enough.

354
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:35,452
From this queen, you
will only hear the truth.

355
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,790
And the truth is...

356
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,503
we face an enemy more
powerful than we are.

357
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,131
They have more men.

358
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:51,384
They are better armed
and better trained.

359
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:54,554
So if you are afraid...

360
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:57,807
know that you are not alone.

361
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:04,105
Unlike my sister, I am
a mother and wife.

362
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:07,609
And I am terrified.

363
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,826
For many years, I made my home

364
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,716
in the mountains with the Alkenny,

365
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,304
where we cherished nothing
above family and community,

366
00:29:18,328 --> 00:29:20,830
and where every life was precious.

367
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,418
And I address you now,
not as your queen,

368
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:29,381
but as a mother and a wife.

369
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:33,736
And I address you, not as warriors,

370
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,115
but husbands and wives,
and sons and daughters.

371
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:39,933
We are all scared.

372
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,936
And we all have so much to lose.

373
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:46,356
So at this moment...

374
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,809
I offer you this comfort.

375
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,049
In all the generations
that Paya has struggled

376
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:57,033
to survive Trivantian aggression...

377
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:00,662
we have never been conquered.

378
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,326
Trivantian boots have never walked

379
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,705
on this soil, and they never will!

380
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:14,819
No amount of God bone or fire
will ever be enough

381
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:17,071
to separate us from this land,

382
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:21,386
the land of our families,
the land of our ancestors!

383
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:31,794
I believe in a future
far better than our past.

384
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:36,098
One where we and our families
will thrive and prosper

385
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:40,052
in a land safe from hate and bigotry,

386
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:42,805
and safe from invading armies.

387
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:46,458
And it is that future
we fight for today.

388
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:50,170
So, my fellow Payans...

389
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:55,467
brave sons and daughters of Paya...

390
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:58,470
be swift.

391
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,181
Be strong.

392
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,868
And let the enemy know

393
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:07,371
that their blood may fall on our land,

394
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:11,709
but it will remain, now and forever,

395
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:14,522
Payan land!

396
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,008
- Tak!
- Tak!

397
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:43,908
Paris.

398
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:47,135
Here, Baba Voss, at your side.

399
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:51,106
You will face Edo again.

400
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,835
I cannot kill my own brother.

401
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,278
Then he will kill you.

402
00:31:57,237 --> 00:31:58,798
Maybe.

403
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:00,740
And you think then you'll be absolved?

404
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:03,326
Use your mind, lump.

405
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:07,831
Think of your children. Who
will protect them from him?

406
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:11,585
- You will.
- Oh, don't be daft, Baba.

407
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:15,398
I've never thanked you.

408
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:16,423
For what?

409
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:19,777
Everything.

410
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:21,219
All of it.

411
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:25,765
You bring your children back
to me safely, and it's settled.

412
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:29,060
Yes.

413
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,598
But I need you to do something for me.

414
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:47,120
Mama.

415
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:50,056
My children.

416
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,379
I wish I could convince you
to stay here with me.

417
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:58,965
What kind of princess and prince

418
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:00,939
would we be if we hid from the war?

419
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,571
I chose this. You didn't.

420
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:04,804
We choose it now.

421
00:33:14,648 --> 00:33:17,627
Take care of each other. Hmm?

422
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:19,003
- We will.
- We will.

423
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,195
We promise.

424
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:22,239
Go on.

425
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:27,827
Maghra.

426
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:33,083
Baba.

427
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:35,852
Come back to me.

428
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:38,129
With our family.

429
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:45,011
Yes.

430
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:33,035
Toad!

431
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,269
Here, Paris.

432
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:40,024
I heard they had you on home defense.

433
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:44,337
A soldier of my rank
and skill building barricades.

434
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:45,882
I should be on the front lines.

435
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:48,176
If I had known
you'd take it so hard,

436
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,827
I would've thought twice before
asking the queen to arrange it.

437
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:54,557
What are you talking about?

438
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:58,084
I have to take a trip. I thought
you might want to come with me.

439
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:00,938
Where are we going?

440
00:35:00,962 --> 00:35:02,940
I'll explain on the way.

441
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:04,174
Prepare a horse for me.

442
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:06,635
A good horse. Your horse!

443
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:08,695
We leave at once.

444
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:34,621
It's an airplane.

445
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:36,915
Yeah.

446
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,698
Must have been so terrifying,

447
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,547
falling out of the sky in a metal tube.

448
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,682
Almost like they had no business

449
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,441
being up there in the first place.

450
00:36:04,276 --> 00:36:07,088
This saddle is not soft.

451
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:09,322
Did you ever hear of oiling a saddle?

452
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:13,080
Sometimes a simple "thank you"

453
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,534
is all you have to say.

454
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,081
You're in a mood.

455
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:21,250
I'm used to marching toward the fight,

456
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:22,374
not away from it.

457
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:27,608
This war is gonna be so much
bigger than one battle.

458
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:29,134
Not if we lose this one.

459
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:32,137
This war is not about
Trivantes and Paya.

460
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:36,617
The world is about to change, Toad.

461
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,226
Sight is returning.

462
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:40,979
That's what this war is about,

463
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:44,649
even if those who wage it are unaware.

464
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:46,669
What I'm aware of is that

465
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:50,405
our new queen is asking us
not only to forget our beliefs,

466
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:52,967
but to go to war against them.

467
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:55,452
Maghra is much more than a Kane.

468
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:58,919
She is Haniwa and Kofun's mother.

469
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:01,208
They hold the keys to our future.

470
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,127
Have you dreamed that future?

471
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:08,173
I dream multiple futures. Oh, oh.

472
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:12,761
And on what do they depend?

473
00:37:13,803 --> 00:37:15,949
They depend on small things like

474
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:18,473
you and me making this journey safely.

475
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,688
None of this makes any sense.

476
00:37:25,273 --> 00:37:26,524
Then why did you come?

477
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:31,112
Because you asked me to.

478
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:36,368
We camp here for the night.

479
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:39,597
God Flame is still strong.
We should press further.

480
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:41,540
No. I have my reasons.

481
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:44,000
This is the spot.

482
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:07,507
You should sleep here with me.

483
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,490
What did you say?

484
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:26,042
We'll be warmer if we sleep together.

485
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:37,637
Point well taken, soldier.

486
00:38:44,477 --> 00:38:47,225
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

487
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:52,559
If I thought that were true,

488
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,523
I wouldn't bother coming over here.

489
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:09,961
Someone's out there.

490
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:29,372
What's troubling you, Kofun?

491
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:35,612
Besides going into battle with the most
powerful army on the continent?

492
00:39:36,154 --> 00:39:37,656
Yes, aside from that.

493
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,886
Nothing. I'm fine.

494
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,961
Come on.

495
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:45,955
You've barely said a word since I
got back from the peace summit.

496
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,126
It's been kind of a busy time.

497
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:52,796
Our mother is the queen.

498
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,875
You're a prince. I'm a princess...

499
00:39:58,385 --> 00:40:00,804
We're going to war,
and you have nothing to say?

500
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:06,309
What are you reading?

501
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:12,148
It's a book of poems.
I found it in Trivantes.

502
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:14,985
There were books in Trivantes?

503
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:17,937
There were lots of
surprises in Trivantes.

504
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:23,135
Will you read something to me?

505
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,369
Read it yourself.

506
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,746
Please?

507
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:36,155
"Turning and turning
in the widening gyre

508
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:40,026
the falcon cannot hear the falconer;

509
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:46,558
Things fall apart; The
center cannot hold;

510
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:51,354
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

511
00:40:53,273 --> 00:40:56,104
the blood-dimmed tide is loosed...

512
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:59,380
...and everywhere

513
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:02,157
the ceremony of innocence is drowned;

514
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:08,514
The best lack all conviction,
while the worst

515
00:41:08,538 --> 00:41:11,166
are full of passionate intensity.

516
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:17,339
Surely some revelation is at hand;

517
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:21,301
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

518
00:41:22,135 --> 00:41:23,470
The Second Coming!

519
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:27,742
Hardly are those words out

520
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:30,317
when a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi.

521
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:31,941
Troubles my sight:

522
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:36,334
Somewhere in the sands of the desert

523
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:39,653
a shape with lion body
and the head of a man,

524
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:44,091
a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,

525
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:47,762
is moving its slow thighs,
while all about it

526
00:41:47,786 --> 00:41:50,413
reel shadows
of the indignant desert birds.

527
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:55,686
The darkness drops again; But now I know

528
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,940
that twenty centuries of stony sleep

529
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:02,884
were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle,

530
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,658
and what rough beast,

531
00:42:08,682 --> 00:42:10,600
its hour come round at last,

532
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:14,896
slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"

533
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,793
- Maghra, run!
- Harlan!

534
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:05,006
Harlan!

535
00:44:12,305 --> 00:44:13,927
Trivantian fuckers!

536
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:01,539
Harlan?

537
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:03,607
Maghra. Oh.

538
00:45:04,816 --> 00:45:07,128
I'm so pleased I stayed to protect you.

539
00:45:07,152 --> 00:45:08,754
Where are you hurt?

540
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:10,631
Pretty much everywhere.

541
00:45:10,655 --> 00:45:12,675
- Are there more of them?
- I don't think so.

542
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,317
Guards!

543
00:45:15,202 --> 00:45:16,823
No, stay with me.

544
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:21,269
I thought you'd never ask.

545
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:45,398
We made it here before the
Trivantians. Make base!

546
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,012
We're now at 160 fighters.

547
00:45:58,036 --> 00:46:00,789
We picked up another ten recruits
from towns along the way.

548
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:05,252
If the Trivantians are
indeed 250 strong...

549
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:09,357
This fort was designed to eliminate
any advantage of numbers.

550
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:12,735
The narrow trenches will
squeeze the Trivantians

551
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,344
and equalize the battlefield.

552
00:46:15,595 --> 00:46:17,347
Have you fought here before?

553
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:19,891
Never.

554
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:39,202
They're here.

555
00:46:40,203 --> 00:46:41,371
Papa.

556
00:47:24,497 --> 00:47:25,916
There's too many of them.

557
00:47:26,858 --> 00:47:28,068
Ayura.

558
00:47:35,342 --> 00:47:37,844
I count close to 350, sir.

559
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,559
Gosset's spies were wrong.

560
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:08,458
They're here.

561
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,586
Earlier than we anticipated.

562
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:15,006
It won't matter. Who do you see?

563
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,811
About a hundred soldiers
in front of the gate.

564
00:48:18,835 --> 00:48:20,488
There'll be more inside the fort.

565
00:48:20,512 --> 00:48:21,513
Captain...

566
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:24,592
I did not ask what you see.

567
00:48:24,616 --> 00:48:27,869
I asked, "Who do you see?"

568
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:35,068
I see Baba Voss.

569
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:37,028
Good.

570
00:48:38,387 --> 00:48:40,132
We fight them in the trenches.

571
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:41,634
That's where we'll have the advantage.

572
00:48:41,658 --> 00:48:44,160
Drummers!

573
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:46,138
Will it be enough?

574
00:48:46,162 --> 00:48:47,265
No.

575
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:50,417
But at least we'll kill many more
of them before we're overrun.

576
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:55,523
- No.
- What are you doing?

577
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:56,816
Charlotte.

578
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,108
Someone has to stop this.

579
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:01,904
- What are you talking about?
- I have a friend on the other side.

580
00:49:01,928 --> 00:49:04,448
If I can get to them and tell them
the queen has been deposed...

581
00:49:04,472 --> 00:49:07,470
- Haniwa, they will kill you.
- You have to trust me.

582
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:13,732
Papa.

583
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:21,632
Let her go.

584
00:49:21,656 --> 00:49:22,699
What?

585
00:49:23,992 --> 00:49:25,619
We're out of choices, my boy.

586
00:49:27,078 --> 00:49:28,163
Let her try.

587
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,856
You shouldn't be here.

588
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,380
None of us should be here.

589
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:05,051
What you did at the peace conference...

590
00:50:05,075 --> 00:50:06,993
It was Queen Kane
who attacked your people.

591
00:50:07,577 --> 00:50:09,878
She would do anything for her holy war.

592
00:50:09,902 --> 00:50:11,992
You need to know that it wasn't us.

593
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:16,044
Wren, I would die before I hurt you.
You have to believe that.

594
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:23,009
I do believe you.

595
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:27,774
The queen is no longer in power.

596
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:30,100
My mother took the throne
as soon as we got back.

597
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:32,119
Maghra's the queen?

598
00:50:32,143 --> 00:50:34,664
Yes. And she does not want this war.

599
00:50:34,688 --> 00:50:36,398
You could talk to Edo.

600
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:40,002
No, he won't listen to me.

601
00:50:40,026 --> 00:50:41,695
You have to try.

602
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,008
Hundreds of Trivantians and
Payans will die for a lie

603
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:48,994
if we don't stop this right now.

604
00:50:51,413 --> 00:50:54,267
It's too late. You have to go back.

605
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,375
What?

606
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:00,417
- Wren.
- Archers!

607
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:03,508
Run.

608
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:05,677
Arrows up!

609
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:08,341
Fire!
