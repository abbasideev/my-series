1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,668
Do you feel much pain?

2
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,297
Just some aching.

3
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:36,388
It's time.

4
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:35,201
Nothing.

5
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:39,431
- Nothing!
- Father. Father.

6
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:41,809
- I can't see.
- It's o... It's okay. Stay calm.

7
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,396
- Oloman, it didn't work.
- Father, please.

8
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,941
We'll try it again.

9
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:48,691
The procedure, do it
again. Try it again.

10
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:51,111
I'm sorry. There's nothing
more to be done.

11
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:53,679
You're wrong! There must be.

12
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,490
- Oloman.
- Father.

13
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:58,410
You have to keep reading.
All of the medical books, everything.

14
00:01:58,434 --> 00:01:59,704
The answers will be there.

15
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,081
Father, I have read all the books.

16
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:03,701
And what they tell me
is that your corneas

17
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,485
have been damaged beyond repair.

18
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,152
You're not looking hard enough!

19
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:11,823
I will not be blind.

20
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:14,577
Do you hear me?

21
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:17,621
I will not be blind!

22
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,712
What?

23
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,136
What?

24
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:49,033
Don't get any ideas.

25
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:14,035
Lieutenant Commander Wren.

26
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,352
Yes, Lieutenant.

27
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:17,539
Open the gate!

28
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:18,731
Yes, sir!

29
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,617
And so...

30
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:14,707
the great Trivantian, Toliver,
wounded but not dead...

31
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:22,127
pulled himself to his tired feet
and mounted his horse.

32
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,031
Although thunder and rain...

33
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,991
...dampened his senses,

34
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,216
he guided his tired men

35
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,849
through the tall grass
of the Bloody Plains...

36
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,899
...to the Ganite stronghold.

37
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:43,247
Under his command,
20 Trivantian soldiers...

38
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:46,074
...held the Ganite hordes at bay...

39
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,344
...all through the night

40
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:50,685
and into the next morning

41
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:53,759
until the battalions
arrived to turn the tide.

42
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,311
Where are you taking me?

43
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,063
You'll see.

44
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:59,192
I've never been so high up before.

45
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:00,217
Yeah?

46
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,429
When I was younger,
I used to climb all these towers.

47
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,602
They were the only places
I felt safe being sighted.

48
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,648
Guess I loved going where I
knew no one else could come.

49
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,983
And that's how I found this place.

50
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:20,530
I've taken care of it ever since.

51
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,000
People used to celebrate their sight.

52
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:37,716
We make art to be heard
or felt or smelled.

53
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:42,178
Everything in their world
was meant to be seen.

54
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,018
- People too.
- What?

55
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,356
We were meant to be seen too.

56
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:27,226
This one was my favorite.

57
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:34,400
I used to make up stories
about the girl in the pictures.

58
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,407
I named her Gwendolyn.

59
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:45,662
Her name is Alice.

60
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,125
You can read.

61
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:04,441
The book is called Alice in Wonderland.

62
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,087
"Alice was beginning to get very tired

63
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,236
of sitting by her sister on the bank

64
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:17,697
and of having nothing to do...

65
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:21,635
"Once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading,

66
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,347
but it had no pictures
or conversations in it".

67
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:26,516
No!

68
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,459
"'And what is the
use of a book', thought Alice,

69
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:33,208
'without pictures or conversations?'"

70
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:35,924
Stop.

71
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:47,654
Big brother, you are holding up well.

72
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:02,619
Your marks are nothing compared
to the scars you left on my back.

73
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,628
What have you done with Haniwa?

74
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:12,797
Haniwa?

75
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:18,219
You fear for your daughter.

76
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,687
Fear is worse than the pain, isn't it?

77
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,194
It was like that for me as a boy.

78
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:38,074
The pain you inflicted on me was...

79
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,247
wasn't nearly as great as the fear
of knowing it was coming,

80
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,552
that you were coming.

81
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,531
And I promise you,

82
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:56,227
Haniwa will know that same fear
every night, as I did.

83
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,360
Edo, please just let her go.

84
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,339
You were my brother.

85
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,926
I'm still your brother.
I'm s... I'm sorry.

86
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,095
I should've protected you.
But I was forced...

87
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:16,790
You don't know what sorry is. Not yet.

88
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,210
But you will.

89
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:21,962
'Cause I will keep you here...

90
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:26,218
and whip you every night
for every night you whipped me.

91
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,345
And years from now,

92
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:31,348
when I finally decide to kill you,

93
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,769
you will weep with gratitude.

94
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,956
Keep him conscious.

95
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,084
- Edo.
- I want him to feel every lash.

96
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:43,945
No. Edo, just... just let her go.

97
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:47,782
Edo. Edo!

98
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:50,368
Edo!

99
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:54,956
Edo, no! Let her go!

100
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:58,919
Edo!

101
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:20,650
Tak.

102
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:25,256
We'll stop just long enough to piss
and fill our canteens.

103
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,282
Yes, sir.

104
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,222
I wanna wash up.

105
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,999
I don't want you near my men.

106
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,293
They're hungry and tired,

107
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,398
and they're not fond of witches
under the best of circumstances.

108
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,424
Come on.

109
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,057
How many witches
have you talked to before?

110
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,185
None before you.

111
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,000
If I'm the first, how do you know
we're something to be feared?

112
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:00,535
People like you destroyed the old world

113
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,710
with your machines and your poisons.

114
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,065
Your kind were responsible
for the deaths of millions.

115
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,366
And you for the death of thousands.

116
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,995
You wiped the Alkenny...

117
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,268
my tribe, off the face of the earth.

118
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:17,013
They knew the price
for harboring witches.

119
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,271
It was the law of the kingdom.

120
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:21,295
You killed children. Babies.

121
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:23,485
I wasn't there.

122
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,511
And what would you have
done if you were?

123
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:30,409
I'm the witch.

124
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,102
Who's murdered more people? You or me?

125
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,302
My queen,

126
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:51,722
I present to you the greatest minds
of Pennsa, your council of state.

127
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,375
My council of what?

128
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:58,356
Your council of state, my queen.

129
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,959
Uh, to advise you,
to execute your commands.

130
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:05,354
We are here to assemble
not a council of state,

131
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:07,277
but a council of war.

132
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:12,745
Majesty, protocol requires that
a council of war be assembled

133
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,123
following an official
declaration of war.

134
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:18,335
He is going to school me in protocol.

135
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,987
War was declared on us.

136
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,385
Captain Gosset, I worry that
you don't grasp the stakes here.

137
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:28,662
Rest assured, I do, Majesty.

138
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:33,426
And everything I say here
is with all due respect

139
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,127
and in accordance with your wishes.

140
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:38,314
If we are to withstand
the might of the Trivantian army,

141
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:41,626
we must shore up our defenses
across the kingdom.

142
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,511
- Captain Gosset...
- Defenses?

143
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:49,535
We have been charged by God
to defeat the Trivantians.

144
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,196
We must prepare to attack, not defend.

145
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,805
- Sibeth...
- Who?

146
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:59,003
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

147
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:04,658
Princess Maghra, if you have
something to say, then say it.

148
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:09,681
Paya has been weakened
by the loss of Kanzua

149
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:12,601
and the chaos in the wake
of your presumed death.

150
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,086
We just consecrated a new capital.

151
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:19,681
Perhaps we should spend some time
tending to our kingdom,

152
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,767
organizing and fortifying our armies

153
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,947
while, of course, remaining vigilant
to the threat from Trivantes.

154
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:33,664
Everyone... out.

155
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,898
Out!

156
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,358
Sibeth...

157
00:17:58,382 --> 00:18:02,462
Did you hear
what just happened?

158
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:05,807
What?

159
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,288
A room full of people quietly
questioning my authority,

160
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:15,067
wondering if, in fact, they're
even bound by it anymore.

161
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,463
A captain who argues with me.

162
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,010
Politicians entertaining
treasonous thoughts,

163
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:28,807
all of which end with our heads
removed from our bodies

164
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,668
and our royal bloodline
wiped out for all time.

165
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,839
And in that room full of betrayal,

166
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:39,384
my own sister contradicts me.

167
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,254
War is suicide.

168
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:48,978
How many people are you willing
to sacrifice for your lie?

169
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,774
Those who die will die gloriously...

170
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,403
for Paya...

171
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,568
for the new world that
will be built by our children.

172
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:05,505
Who will also die
along with the rest of us

173
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,141
when the Trivantians
burn Paya to the ground.

174
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,709
You cannot believe
we can actually defeat them.

175
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,504
What was I spared for if not for this?

176
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:18,527
God put a sighted child in my belly,

177
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:21,238
a child who'll be named for our father,

178
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:24,298
in order to make this kingdom the vessel

179
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:27,119
through which sight
returns to the world.

180
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:28,429
It is my destiny.

181
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:32,491
God help us. You actually
believe what you're saying.

182
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,338
We will conquer Trivantes,

183
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:38,581
absorb their armies

184
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:42,651
and become the one true
kingdom on this land.

185
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:44,578
Sibeth.

186
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,460
Sibeth.

187
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,090
There must be another way.

188
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:03,048
You yourself stood by...

189
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:06,656
when Tamacti Jun drew his blade,

190
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,206
with your blessing, to kill me.

191
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,107
And God did not let it happen.

192
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:14,086
You'd do well to remember
that moment, sister.

193
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,217
And remember as well that
it was I who saved you that day

194
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:21,034
and not the other way around.

195
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:09,336
Haniwa.

196
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,582
If it was my bed, I wouldn't be able

197
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:27,356
to think of a reason to get out of it.

198
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:31,359
Well, I'll show you one.

199
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:43,380
Precious stones.

200
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:51,180
This one's like a piece of the sky.

201
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:55,635
What does that say?

202
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:03,727
"Forever".

203
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,731
That's beautiful.

204
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,402
Except it wasn't.

205
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:13,237
Beautiful?

206
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:15,614
Forever.

207
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,195
Well, maybe the feeling was.

208
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,601
I'm... I'm sorry.

209
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,329
No.

210
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:45,396
No.

211
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:58,713
The Payan queen has announced

212
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,987
that she is pregnant
with a sighted child.

213
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:03,975
Queen Kane
also claims it was our army

214
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,175
that attacked the capital
city of Kanzua.

215
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:08,260
So the queen lied to her people.

216
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:11,365
Why then should we believe
that she is being any more truthful

217
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,416
about this supposed sighted baby?

218
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,601
How could she know such a thing?

219
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:19,306
She could know,
if the father was sighted.

220
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,650
Let me stop you right there,
Commander General.

221
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:23,860
Because I can already tell
where this is going.

222
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:28,073
There have been multiple reports
of at least one sighted Payan man.

223
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:30,000
You are speaking of Jerlamarel.

224
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:33,145
Jerlamarel is not a man.
He is a myth and nothing more.

225
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:35,648
We do not know that for sure.

226
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,213
General Voss,

227
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:39,957
our western border is
being attacked ceaselessly

228
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:41,462
by the Ganites,

229
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,215
and you would have us open up
another front to the east

230
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,925
based on rumor and hearsay.

231
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,368
Sight will return.

232
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,098
And the first nation
to harness its powers

233
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:52,891
will be the nation
that dominates the world.

234
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:56,335
Council has grown tired
of these theoretical arguments.

235
00:23:57,462 --> 00:24:01,150
Any nation that gives a foothold
in their society to the sighted

236
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,610
is sowing the seeds
of their own destruction.

237
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:07,449
And in the unlikely event
that any sighted people emerge,

238
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:11,269
they will be executed
as threats to our republic.

239
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:14,271
Other nations may not feel the same.

240
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:18,126
We have
not lost a war in 200 years.

241
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,029
And there is no reason
to think we will begin now.

242
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:27,344
Your fascination with sight was
interesting as a strategic exercise,

243
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:29,722
but now it risks becoming a distraction.

244
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:32,317
We must turn our attention to the west,

245
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:36,563
where the Ganites are amassing
in greater and greater numbers.

246
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:38,732
The People agree with the Military.

247
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:40,377
The Bank agrees with the People.

248
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:45,513
Council has ruled.

249
00:24:46,405 --> 00:24:49,116
Thank you for your service,
Commander General.

250
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:05,008
Good morning.

251
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:08,595
I fell asleep.

252
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:14,101
I didn't have the heart to wake you.

253
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:17,521
What are you thinking about?

254
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:23,403
I'm wondering...

255
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:27,407
what would happen if I let you go.

256
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:36,916
You could come with me.

257
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:44,008
I have a life here, a family, a career.

258
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,061
Why would you stay some place

259
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,515
where you'd be executed
just for being who you are?

260
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,353
You say that as if being sighted
is the only thing that I am.

261
00:25:56,813 --> 00:25:58,523
I'm a soldier of Trivantes.

262
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:03,296
I'm the daughter and granddaughter
and great-granddaughter

263
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,049
of people who built Trivantes,

264
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:07,992
who fought and died for it.

265
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,204
None of that would save you
if your secret got out.

266
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,749
We could travel east.

267
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,210
You could meet my brother.

268
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:22,465
Maybe we could find
other people like us.

269
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:24,885
We could help change the world.

270
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:31,350
You think we're special.

271
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,811
But we're not.

272
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:39,067
We're just... different.

273
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:43,238
I think we're special
because we're different.

274
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:49,160
If sight's meant to come back,
it'll come back.

275
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:54,083
It's not our job to change the world.

276
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:57,712
It's our job to...

277
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:03,259
use our sight to make things better
right where we are.

278
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:08,014
And how do we do that?

279
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:12,936
Well...

280
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:17,941
you could start by reading to me.

281
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,827
I would love to.

282
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,522
"'I could tell you my adventures

283
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:42,217
beginning from this morning',
said Alice, a little timidly.

284
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:46,555
'But it's no use going
back to yesterday,

285
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:49,174
because I was a different person then.'"

286
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:08,620
So this is the great
warrior... Baba Voss.

287
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,710
You're no fucking warrior now, are you?

288
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:22,968
Get back!

289
00:28:25,097 --> 00:28:27,116
Get down!

290
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,943
- Stay down!
- You broke my fucking nose!

291
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,689
Sir.

292
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,950
Baba Voss.

293
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,353
Four days on the rack.

294
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:52,249
I should thank you.

295
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:04,211
Sorry. I can't offer you
anything stronger than water.

296
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:09,636
But... here.

297
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:26,191
I know your voice, Witchfinder.

298
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,070
I hear it in my nightmares.

299
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,958
Tamacti Jun.

300
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:39,629
You killed my wife.

301
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,775
I don't blame you for wanting me dead.

302
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,653
I've committed many offenses
to you and your people,

303
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,613
but killing your wife
is not one of them.

304
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:50,450
I'm gonna make it through
these bars at some point.

305
00:29:50,474 --> 00:29:53,419
And when I do, I'm gonna hurt you.

306
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:56,906
Listen to me. I was the one
left for dead, not Maghra.

307
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,459
Don't you say her name!
Don't you say her name.

308
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:02,545
I could never harm her.
She is my princess.

309
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,464
Princess? What are you talking about?

310
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:06,107
You make no sense, Witchfinder.

311
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:09,552
Your wife was born to His Highness,
the king Wolf Kane.

312
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:11,336
And I was sworn to protect her

313
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,448
as the rightful heir
of the Payan throne.

314
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:15,558
You lie. You're a liar.

315
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:21,648
Ask yourself what reason might I have
to lie to you at this point.

316
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:26,877
So, my wife, whose children you hunted
since the day they were born,

317
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:29,697
you're saying she's a princess?

318
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:31,807
That's what I'm saying.

319
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:34,953
And I'm also telling you

320
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:40,315
that when she and the queen left me,
she was very much alive.

321
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,427
- Come on.
- Side to side, Father.

322
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:58,041
With a tap at the end of each swing.

323
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,936
Uh, constant contact, if you can.

324
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:05,566
Hold the stick out farther.

325
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,695
You're doing well. Good.
It'll get easier, Father.

326
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,578
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

327
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,370
Let go!

328
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:20,856
I will find my way without any help
from anybody! Do you understand?

329
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,262
What are we gonna do?

330
00:31:34,286 --> 00:31:36,371
He'll get used to it.
Just give him some time.

331
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:38,201
God Flame.

332
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:44,041
You have shielded me from
enemies known and unknown.

333
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,841
Counsel your loyal servant.

334
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,045
Strengthen my resolve,
that I will not be shaken.

335
00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:58,433
I will serve your will...

336
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:00,763
...as you will preserve
me at your pleasure.

337
00:32:00,787 --> 00:32:02,306
Your Majesty?

338
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,169
Fuck.

339
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,046
Apologies, my queen.

340
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,615
Lord Harlan begs a moment of your time.

341
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,575
Grant it to him, then leave.

342
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,809
Yes, my queen.

343
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:21,625
Oh, yeah.

344
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:25,587
I love the smell of a
lavender milk bath.

345
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,858
Lord Harlan,

346
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,569
you have a dangerous tendency
toward the informal.

347
00:32:31,593 --> 00:32:34,489
Some might mistake it for disrespect.

348
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:35,764
On the contrary.

349
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:39,994
I relish our history together,

350
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:42,312
my childhood in your father's court.

351
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,197
I think it binds us with a loyalty

352
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:49,461
far deeper than simply
queen and subject.

353
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:51,113
Don't you think?

354
00:32:52,656 --> 00:32:54,741
Which brings me
to the purpose of my visit.

355
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,581
I am bursting with anticipation.

356
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:08,772
Bold move, launching a war so soon
after consecrating a new capital.

357
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:13,082
If you don't have the stomach for it...

358
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:14,737
I don't have the stomach for losing.

359
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:18,473
Hmm. Well, fortunately for you,
you're on the winning side.

360
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:22,019
Marry me.

361
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:31,129
Uh-huh. Not exactly
the response I hoped for.

362
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:33,548
When your hubris surprises even me,

363
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:36,217
it might be time
to rethink your worldview.

364
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:40,638
You need me. My army, my people.

365
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:42,456
You mean my army and my people.

366
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:47,937
You're declaring war on the
greatest military force in the world.

367
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:49,897
To even hope to succeed,

368
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:53,008
you need the undying fealty
of every man and woman here.

369
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:57,446
You have Pennsa, and
you will have all of Paya.

370
00:33:58,722 --> 00:34:00,724
And here I thought I already did.

371
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,019
Yeah.

372
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:09,274
Your subjects might die to protect
their rightful sovereign, but...

373
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,712
I'll bet they're a little less generous
with their skins

374
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:15,447
when it comes to protecting
a child they think is a witch.

375
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:21,620
And if I marry you?

376
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,666
I've been the rule of law here
for a generation.

377
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:29,342
As stepfather to the sighted child,

378
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:31,966
I can change the minds
that need changing.

379
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:38,011
I can't think of a better way
to solidify your position.

380
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:42,599
And yours.

381
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:45,851
Of course, and mine.

382
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:49,855
Why else would I do it?

383
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:56,337
You can have my sister.

384
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:00,301
Be stepfather to her
sighted royal children.

385
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,743
She's got two of 'em.

386
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,086
Isn't Maghra married already?

387
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:15,108
Baba Voss is dead.

388
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:17,360
And in any case, Alkenny
rutting in their tents

389
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,736
doesn't qualify as marriage
under Payan law.

390
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:26,018
I don't think Maghra
would feel the same.

391
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,316
Lord Harlan, are you
underestimating your own charm?

392
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:39,448
You'll talk to her?

393
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:42,117
Yes.

394
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:48,223
Now come here and kneel
before your queen.

395
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:52,289
Open the gate!

396
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:59,296
Two quarters up!

397
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,056
Right one.

398
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:08,620
Come on. We can't stay here.

399
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,032
Wait. Wait.

400
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:15,233
Straight.

401
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,341
Left, two step.

402
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:22,759
That boy can see.

403
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:24,427
I said, left!

404
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:26,095
You said you were the only one.

405
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,947
It's Edo's secret program.
The boy's a son of Jerlamarel's.

406
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:31,033
He trained him as part of an
arrangement he has with the general.

407
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:33,227
Jerlamarel?

408
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:35,396
So, what, he just...

409
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,381
just gave that boy away?

410
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:40,300
Wren, he's a child!

411
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:51,111
He gave me away too. Do you understand?

412
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:53,271
He sent me to die.

413
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:57,350
- You're not going to die.
- We both know Edo will never let me go.

414
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:03,174
Haniwa.

415
00:37:03,198 --> 00:37:04,592
Haniwa.

416
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:08,654
I will do everything I can
to keep you safe. I promise.

417
00:37:09,663 --> 00:37:11,164
I need you to trust me.

418
00:37:23,176 --> 00:37:24,177
I do.

419
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:34,730
Go.

420
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:41,879
General, sir.

421
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:45,866
Lieutenant. Get the prisoner
and bring her down to the street.

422
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:47,951
Why? What's happening?

423
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:53,457
Bring the girl downstairs. Now.

424
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:40,796
Papa?

425
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,736
Papa!

426
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,238
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

427
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:51,513
I wanted to give you the opportunity

428
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,537
to hear your daughter's
cries one last time...

429
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:57,265
before I sent her off
to be useful to the republic.

430
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:03,527
People of Trivantes,

431
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:07,715
I give you the great coward, Baba Voss.

432
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:09,324
Murderer!

433
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:16,056
Twenty-five winters have passed
since he murdered Teo Voss,

434
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:17,874
my father,

435
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,918
and fled the city.

436
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:25,900
But Trivantian justice never
forgets and never relents,

437
00:39:25,924 --> 00:39:28,418
not in a thousand winters.

438
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:31,197
On with him!

439
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:32,305
Once around the city.

440
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:34,867
No, no, no. Papa.

441
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:39,646
- No! No, no, no.
- Murderer!

442
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:43,437
Coward!

443
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:49,716
- Haniwa!
- No! No, no, no.

444
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,617
No, please. No, please. Please.

445
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:58,081
General, why not leave her
with me a while longer?

446
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:00,351
She's a valuable source of intelligence.

447
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:04,147
No. I've imposed upon you enough, Wren.

448
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:09,176
Besides, she has something greater
to offer than intelligence.

449
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:12,780
Take the prisoner to my house. Now.

450
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:13,865
Sir!

451
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:14,890
Take her!

452
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:19,746
Move! Come on. Now!

453
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:20,854
Please...

454
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:29,446
Her Highness, Queen Kane.

455
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:34,076
Her Majesty, Princess Maghra.

456
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,626
A walk among the people?
This doesn't feel like you.

457
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,073
The citizens of Pennsa have experienced

458
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:46,773
too much distance from the crown.

459
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:50,318
We must do what we can
to capture hearts and minds.

460
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:54,280
Oh. So that's what we're doing.
We're capturing hearts and minds.

461
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:58,450
Yes. But if you wanted
to be truly useful,

462
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:02,455
there are larger, more
strategic moves to be made.

463
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:05,708
- Strategic moves?
- I told Harlan you would marry him.

464
00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:07,150
What?

465
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:11,631
- What? You're kidding.
- I'm not.

466
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:13,341
Her Highness, Queen Kane...

467
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:15,426
Well, then you're more
insane than I thought.

468
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,513
You're overreacting.
It's a business arrangement.

469
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:20,038
You know what this is?

470
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:25,853
Some kind of poorly formed God bone.

471
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:29,965
This is a marriage cuff, made
for me by my husband, Baba Voss.

472
00:41:30,674 --> 00:41:33,069
Alkenny unions aren't
recognized by Payan law.

473
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:37,806
So you won't be betraying Baba Voss,
if he's even alive.

474
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:41,727
You coldhearted bitch.

475
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,604
You can call me what you want,

476
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:50,235
but I promised I would make Paya
safe for your children, and I did.

477
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:55,032
But I think you fail to realize
just how close to the edge we are.

478
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:58,160
Harlan's clearly suspicious
about Kanzua.

479
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,015
We've taken his city from him.
If we don't make it worth his while,

480
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:04,661
we'll find ourselves
on the wrong end of an uprising.

481
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:11,691
Like you said, we need Harlan
and the army he controls,

482
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:12,775
until we don't.

483
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,010
- Then you marry him.
- And make him king?

484
00:42:18,263 --> 00:42:20,283
We'll discuss this again
once you've calmed down.

485
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:21,367
No, we won't.

486
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:24,853
Heretic! The queen is a heretic.

487
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,916
Witch lover! It's an abomination.

488
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,251
Burn the witch!

489
00:42:30,275 --> 00:42:34,047
Burn her! And her whole family!

490
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:35,340
- Find them.
- Right away.

491
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:38,426
- Burn the queen! Burn her!
- Burn her!

492
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,095
Witch!

493
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,390
Like I said, we are closer to
the edge than you realize.

494
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:45,999
Burn her!

495
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:04,559
No.

496
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:13,294
Raising three.

497
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:15,821
- You're bluffing.
- Ready to put down and find out?

498
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:47,594
Baba Voss?

499
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,731
Baba Voss?

500
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:54,043
Who are you?

501
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,170
Someone who will be killed
if I'm caught helping you.

502
00:43:56,194 --> 00:43:59,132
So, please, no more questions
until we're out of here.

503
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:01,825
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you to Haniwa.

504
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:05,724
- You know where she is?
- Yes, but we have to hurry.

505
00:44:05,748 --> 00:44:06,794
I took care of the guards,

506
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:08,933
but we have to be gone
before the next rotation.

507
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:10,250
Baba Voss.

508
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,296
If you're planning
to fight your way out,

509
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,721
you could use all the hands you can get.

510
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:15,081
I'm here only for you.

511
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:17,358
You wanna get to Maghra, as do I.

512
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:20,028
It's only a matter of time
until her sister turns on her,

513
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:21,446
if she hasn't already.

514
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,364
You expect me to trust you, Witchfinder?

515
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:25,749
I know how the queen thinks.

516
00:44:26,475 --> 00:44:28,411
You wouldn't even begin
to know how to look for her.

517
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,510
And even if you did, she'd be surrounded

518
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:33,750
by Witchfinders. My Witchfinders.

519
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,651
I am not releasing Tamacti Jun.

520
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:38,837
He comes.

521
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:42,175
I'm already committing treason
by releasing you.

522
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:45,118
I won't compound that by
freeing the Witchfinder general.

523
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:47,722
They can only hang you once.

524
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:49,606
We go now, or we die here.

525
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,251
You go.

526
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:03,553
This way.

527
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:14,106
This changes nothing!

528
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,251
The second you are not useful to me,

529
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:20,296
I'm going to rip out your entrails
and feed them to you.

530
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,005
As you should.

531
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,419
Take the guards' weapons.

532
00:45:39,923 --> 00:45:43,318
You walk too fast. Your staff
barely touches the ground.

533
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:46,531
You're sighted, aren't you?

534
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:49,324
Believe it or not, I used to
be pretty good at hiding it.

535
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,730
Let's go.

536
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:15,954
Haniwa.

537
00:46:23,342 --> 00:46:27,387
Don't worry. It's not going
to be your uncle Edo.

538
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:37,898
If you fight...
it will just take longer.

539
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:59,628
- Truss!
- Noss.

540
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,797
Noss!

541
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:37,934
Yes. Keep this for Haniwa.

542
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,269
Edo will have
her some place upstairs.

543
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:42,045
We will separate to find her.

544
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:45,149
Tamacti will hold off anyone
down here that wishes to join us.

545
00:47:45,173 --> 00:47:47,110
You'll need more than one man for that.

546
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,677
Not when it's that man.

547
00:47:49,261 --> 00:47:50,262
Stairs.

548
00:47:53,557 --> 00:47:56,051
Oh, don't be scared.

549
00:47:57,894 --> 00:47:59,474
I could be gentle.

550
00:48:05,902 --> 00:48:09,507
No. No!

551
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:10,574
No!

552
00:48:15,037 --> 00:48:17,003
You continue straight.

553
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,707
I will check the far side and meet you.

554
00:49:29,194 --> 00:49:31,446
It's okay, it's okay.

555
00:49:34,157 --> 00:49:36,743
I'm so sorry.

556
00:49:42,374 --> 00:49:44,788
- I knew you would come.
- I'm so sorry.

557
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:52,175
I'm not alone.

558
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:58,256
Baba Voss told me to
give you this. Let's go.

559
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:26,561
When you left,
I was still the smaller one,

560
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:28,462
still the weaker one.

561
00:50:29,046 --> 00:50:32,399
And you'll find that's
no longer the case.

562
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:52,022
To be honest, I was hoping
you'd have a bit more fight in you.

563
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,312
How fitting...

564
00:51:28,397 --> 00:51:31,641
that I would kill you
with our father's sword.

565
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:36,713
Edo. I'm sorry.

566
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:43,386
But please, let my death
be the end of it.

567
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:49,543
Let Haniwa leave this place. Please.

568
00:51:57,926 --> 00:52:00,679
Know this before you die, brother.

569
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:09,596
Haniwa will spend the rest of
her life in my dungeons,

570
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:12,774
a broodmare...

571
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:18,965
mothering sighted children for my army

572
00:52:18,989 --> 00:52:22,951
until her womb is no longer able.

573
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,956
And when she can produce no more...

574
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:32,219
I will slit her throat

575
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:36,798
and toss her body into
the same manure pit

576
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:41,604
into which I will throw yours.

577
00:52:41,628 --> 00:52:42,629
Leave him.

578
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:47,934
Leave him!

579
00:52:55,651 --> 00:52:57,235
- Haniwa.
- Papa.

580
00:52:59,404 --> 00:53:01,198
Are you okay?

581
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,472
We have to go. Come.

582
00:53:07,496 --> 00:53:08,867
Take me to him.

583
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:24,513
If you ever come near my children again,

584
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:29,351
I will burn this entire fucking
city to the ground...

585
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,622
and leave you alive just long enough

586
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:36,459
so you can smell your flesh
melting off of your face.

587
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:39,778
There he is.

588
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:45,609
There's the Baba Voss I know!

589
00:53:46,134 --> 00:53:47,135
We have to go.

590
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,872
Tamacti Jun.

591
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:16,476
Haniwa! No, no, no.

592
00:54:17,649 --> 00:54:20,777
Haniwa. No. He fights with us.

593
00:54:21,486 --> 00:54:22,821
He killed Mom.

594
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:27,284
Listen to me. Your mother is not dead.

595
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:29,762
What?

596
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:31,097
What are you talking about?

597
00:54:31,121 --> 00:54:32,640
I'll explain later.

598
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:34,458
Listen, right now we need to go.

599
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,376
Is she safe?

600
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,671
We don't know. That's why
we need to trust him.

601
00:54:42,758 --> 00:54:49,449
Haniwa, please. See me. We have to go.

602
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:50,766
Please.

603
00:54:53,018 --> 00:54:54,995
Left. To the eastern gate.

604
00:55:42,192 --> 00:55:43,252
Come with us.

605
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:44,545
I can't.

606
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:46,113
Please.

607
00:55:53,537 --> 00:55:54,658
Forever.

608
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,309
Haniwa!

609
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,334
Go.

610
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:17,444
Haniwa.

611
00:56:33,243 --> 00:56:34,244
Cora!

612
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,916
Cora?

613
00:56:45,964 --> 00:56:47,941
She said I lost the baby.

614
00:56:50,134 --> 00:56:52,512
He was in the blood on my sheets.

615
00:56:53,347 --> 00:56:54,431
You killed her.

616
00:56:59,144 --> 00:57:00,663
She said,

617
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:06,002
"Sometimes what forms cannot
grow to completion. It's too weak".

618
00:57:06,026 --> 00:57:08,278
Queen.

619
00:57:23,418 --> 00:57:24,961
What did you put in me?

620
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:28,215
I did what you asked.

621
00:57:29,925 --> 00:57:33,720
I did not ask for this.

622
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:37,742
You didn't have to kill her.

623
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:39,977
Of course I did.

624
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,021
No one can know.

625
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,484
I announced my child, a sighted child.

626
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:50,362
They'll think me mad.

627
00:57:52,155 --> 00:57:55,009
I will lie with you again.

628
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:58,286
I will make you a stronger baby.

629
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:25,689
You poor boy.

630
00:58:30,068 --> 00:58:36,867
You poor, stupid boy.
