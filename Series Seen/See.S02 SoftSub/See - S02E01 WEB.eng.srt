1
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,959
Is someone there?

2
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:21,387
You there. Identify yourself.

3
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:31,189
I said identify yourself now.

4
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:34,484
I'm nobody.

5
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:41,449
Give me your knots.

6
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:48,915
You don't need my knots.

7
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:52,418
And why is that?

8
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:29,616
I thought I killed him.

9
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,310
Your sword went straight through.

10
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,897
He would have died from
his wounds, but much later.

11
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:40,610
Come here, boy. Come here.

12
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:44,339
You can't see a kill.

13
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,783
You must feel it. Put
your hands on mine.

14
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:52,658
- Now close your eyes.
- Close them.

15
00:03:54,832 --> 00:04:00,439
You push in and up. Up.

16
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:02,900
Do you feel that?

17
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:03,984
Yes.

18
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:07,696
You know, the ripping and
the... the tearing.

19
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,428
You cut up like that,
I promise you he'll stay dead.

20
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,281
Straighten your leg.

21
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,371
Are we gonna have another problem?

22
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:57,324
Lieutenant Wren. I just came by
to check up on the prisoner.

23
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:59,284
- Anything to report?
- She's fine.

24
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:02,246
General, you said it would be a few
days. It's been almost a month.

25
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,497
It won't be much longer.

26
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,749
I don't understand
why you have to keep her here.

27
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:08,294
You know I can't make her
an official prisoner.

28
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:10,339
If the Triangle
hears you've smuggled

29
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,089
a sighted prisoner into the city,

30
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:15,092
- we'll both be as good as dead.
- You'll be fine.

31
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:17,262
You're following orders, so follow them.

32
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,786
Let me worry about the council.

33
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,849
You're the only one
I can trust with this, Wren.

34
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:23,892
You trust me enough to do your bidding,

35
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,335
but not to tell me who she is
and why she's here.

36
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:30,757
I would also like to know
who you are and why I'm here.

37
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,868
I am... Commander General Edo Voss.

38
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,917
And you will speak... when spoken to.

39
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:17,245
As you were, Lieutenant.

40
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,039
You managed not to
ruin this one's armor.

41
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,981
Feels like you could squeeze into it.

42
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,359
I just need the chest plate.

43
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,278
Here, hold my sword.

44
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,092
Do you think it'll fit?

45
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:40,682
It doesn't have to fit.

46
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:42,347
It just has to carry his smell.

47
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,581
Son, give me a sword.

48
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,728
Okay.

49
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:52,064
You and Paris camp 50 heartbeats
into the trees.

50
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:54,358
- Against the mountain wall...
- What are you talking about?

51
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,734
I'm coming with you.

52
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,859
No. No, no, no, you are not.

53
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,863
It's gonna be hard enough
getting one of you out.

54
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,682
Then how are you gonna find her?
You'll need my eyes.

55
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,559
Your eyes?

56
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,312
Dad, what are you doing?

57
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:10,732
Baba!

58
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:15,319
- Hit me back.
- What?

59
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,369
I said hit me.

60
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,584
They will hear every move
you make just as I do.

61
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:33,221
A lifetime of sight has
left you loud and clumsy.

62
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,543
That's enough.

63
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:39,236
Kofun. Kofun.

64
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,306
My son. Listen to me.

65
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:46,225
Your mother and I...

66
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:51,539
we raised you to be beautiful,
not a warrior.

67
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:55,021
I don't want you to have to fight
the way that I had to.

68
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,948
I never imagined a life for you
away from the Alkenny.

69
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:03,659
And I failed to prepare you.

70
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:11,167
I will likely not return.

71
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:15,147
You need to learn how to fight with
your eyes closed like a blind man,

72
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:16,464
as I would've taught you.

73
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,801
Remember, your eyes betray you.

74
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:23,072
Dad...

75
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:25,515
Someone has to survive. Okay?

76
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,535
Paris.

77
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,621
- Yes.
- Come here.

78
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,540
Listen to me. You wait seven days.

79
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:37,777
If I do not return, then I am dead,
and so is Haniwa.

80
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,280
You get away from here
as far as possible.

81
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,741
Paris, say it.

82
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,619
Seven days, we go.

83
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:52,017
If I do not return, you'll be all he has.

84
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,042
Yes.

85
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,349
I swore I'd never return here.

86
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,395
Come back with Haniwa
and swear it again.

87
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:16,983
I'm sorry, boy.

88
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,278
I love you, my son.

89
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,035
Are you well?

90
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:10,828
Of course I'm well.

91
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,015
You were out there for some time.

92
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,727
Ah. Too many days on the trail
eating poorly-cooked game.

93
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,461
I don't have your Alkenny stomach.

94
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:23,484
How far to Pennsa?

95
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,403
Just a short distance beyond
the lake, Your Highness.

96
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:27,428
Well, then...

97
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,931
Onward.

98
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:32,517
- Tak!
- Tak.

99
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:51,637
Twenty-sixth
border battalion, sir.

100
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:53,830
When they didn't check in,
we came looking.

101
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:57,041
They most likely came across
a band of smugglers.

102
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:03,506
No. This wasn't smugglers.

103
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,675
Sir?

104
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:09,429
Take them in.

105
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,140
- Full honors.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:18,980
Welcome home, Baba.

107
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:53,806
Knots.

108
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:57,477
Proceed.

109
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:06,861
Knots.

110
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,686
Captain Koji?

111
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,106
Twenty-six battalion?

112
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:21,442
Twenty-six isn't due
back until tomorrow.

113
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:25,171
I was ordered in early
for a casualty report.

114
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:29,884
That's unusual, isn't it?

115
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:33,513
Not when there are casualties.

116
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:02,208
You can head to the Eastern Gate.

117
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,001
Sir.

118
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,941
You need to eat.

119
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:10,550
What do you care if I eat?

120
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:12,760
I don't.

121
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,864
I'm just trying to make you comfortable.

122
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:18,141
I have been chained
to this bed for weeks.

123
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,161
Believe me, Edo could
do much worse to you.

124
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,348
Then why hasn't he?

125
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:27,209
Why is he doing this to me?

126
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,901
I already told you I don't know.

127
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:32,822
I don't even know why you're here.

128
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,542
The general said his name is Edo Voss.

129
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:47,253
So?

130
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:51,382
My father is Baba Voss.

131
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,801
Edo's brother?

132
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:55,762
You've heard of him?

133
00:15:57,263 --> 00:16:00,908
Only the stories. I...
I was still a kid when he fled.

134
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,330
But Edo's been searching for him
for over 25 winters

135
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,332
to avenge his father's death.

136
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:10,401
- You're saying Baba killed his own father?
- Yes.

137
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:12,278
I don't believe that.

138
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,531
Well, what you believe
doesn't actually matter.

139
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:18,785
Edo is using
me to lure Baba here.

140
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:23,831
Most men choose to avoid
my father at any cost.

141
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,627
Well, the general
is not like most men.

142
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,776
And he's been waiting a very long time

143
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,710
to get his hands on Baba Voss.

144
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,231
You don't know my father.

145
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:51,734
When he comes for me,
you won't know it until we're gone.

146
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,006
Your father might be able to
make it into the city...

147
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,115
Next.

148
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:59,242
...but he'll never get out alive.

149
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,471
Identification knots.

150
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:03,931
This is Edo's city.

151
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,767
Let's go. Hurry it up.
Identification knots.

152
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,501
And he'll be waiting for him.

153
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:37,089
So Edo is the general,
and you work for Edo.

154
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:38,489
What does that make you?

155
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:41,890
That makes me someone who feels like

156
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,214
she's answered enough of your questions.

157
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,666
Okay. Just one more.

158
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:56,758
Does he know you can see?

159
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,641
Come get a taste.

160
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:33,002
Sexual satisfaction for all tastes.

161
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:35,880
Whatever you feel you want to...

162
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:41,464
- Pleasure guaranteed.
- Look at these beauties here!

163
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:50,223
Thank you.

164
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:06,953
Come on, you lazy bastards!

165
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:11,165
Mind the fires. I don't
want that slag settling.

166
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:18,631
Smithy. This one's no good.

167
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,569
Must have cracked while it was cooling.

168
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:23,987
'Cause it was moved while cooling.

169
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:26,222
Melt it down. Take more
care, for fuck sake.

170
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:38,234
Military steel. Black's hilt. Authentic.

171
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:42,488
You've got the chest plate
to match. That's a rare haul.

172
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,925
What is it worth to you?

173
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:48,077
It's against the law to buy
or sell military weapons.

174
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:52,165
- Guess I'll have to take it back.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

175
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,126
Uh, ten coppers.

176
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:58,772
The hilt alone is worth that. Twenty.

177
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,607
For 20 coppers,

178
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:03,718
you'd have to bring the soldier
that you fucking stole it from.

179
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:07,305
You should have told me that
before I killed him.

180
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,634
I know that voice. But it can't be.

181
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,271
It belongs to a man that's dead.

182
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,833
And if he isn't dead,

183
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:20,002
then I could get 100 coppers
for turning him in.

184
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:23,529
Yes... but first, you'd
have to make it out alive.

185
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,782
And I know you can't outrun me.

186
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,326
Fuck you.

187
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,578
Baba Voss.

188
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:33,698
You gotta be crazy coming back here.

189
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:36,626
I'm happy to hear your voice.

190
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,587
But I suspect I'll be
regretting it soon enough.

191
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:42,691
Yes, you will.

192
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:44,717
Come, it's a little cooler in the back.

193
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:49,597
How did you know?

194
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,142
I've spent my whole life hiding it.

195
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:56,270
Just like you. I know
what it looks like.

196
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,109
Clearly, Jerlamarel is not your father.

197
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:05,863
No.

198
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:09,826
My parents are here in Trivantes.

199
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,078
And your mother or father?

200
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,622
They're normal.

201
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,041
So are my brothers.

202
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:21,814
Jerlamarel was born to blind parents,

203
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:24,966
but I've never heard
of anyone else like that.

204
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:30,012
Are there others like you here?

205
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:34,892
None... that I know of.

206
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:38,896
Well, that must be very lonely.

207
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:44,586
And being a soldier,

208
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,864
aren't you worried they'll figure it out
and burn you as a witch?

209
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:53,453
Trivantes isn't like Paya.
No one here believes in witches.

210
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:58,416
But they would still execute me.

211
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:02,211
If they don't believe
in witches, then why?

212
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:06,382
Our government isn't superstitious,
but they're practical.

213
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:10,094
There are laws in the strands
going back centuries.

214
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:15,308
Vision destroyed the world once.

215
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,896
And they will not allow it
to happen again.

216
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:25,300
So if I told the general your secret,

217
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:27,779
it wouldn't go well for you, would it?

218
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,147
It would be the word
of a desperate prisoner

219
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:46,815
against a loyal lieutenant.

220
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,633
Who do you think he would believe?

221
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:53,347
And be glad that's the case...

222
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,407
...because otherwise,
I'd have already killed you

223
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:57,767
and told the general
you died trying to escape.

224
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,561
You wouldn't kill me.

225
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,148
You don't know me.

226
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:10,171
I already know you better
than anyone ever has.

227
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,803
Her Royal
Highness Queen Kane.

228
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,700
Even in all this noise,
I can still hear you pouting.

229
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:59,972
You gave me your word we would
keep searching for my family.

230
00:23:59,996 --> 00:24:01,205
And we shall.

231
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:04,226
We've been searching for over 30 days.

232
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,270
We can't wander
the countryside indefinitely.

233
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:07,954
We have a kingdom to reclaim.

234
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,608
Once we have, we'll own fresh soldiers

235
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:14,260
and a base from which
to continue the search.

236
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:17,046
Fruitless though it may be.

237
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:57,237
We should leave.

238
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,114
Calm yourself, Boots.

239
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:01,325
You grew up alone and in filth,

240
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,411
and now you're a consort
to the Payan Queen.

241
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:07,748
- Do you not grasp the miracle in that?
- I am a witch here.

242
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,543
You serve a sacred and specific purpose.

243
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:13,492
She will keep you safe.
Now stop whining.

244
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:23,913
Beautiful room.

245
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:29,544
My queen.

246
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:31,754
My queen.

247
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,424
We're all so relieved you survived.

248
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,844
When we heard of the destruction
of Kanzua, we feared the worst.

249
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:41,514
Lord Harlan, thank you
for this wonderful reception.

250
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,537
Your presence is an honor
in any circumstance,

251
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:49,415
let alone a triumphant
return from the dead.

252
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,899
Hello, Lord Harlan.

253
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,694
Hello. Who's this?

254
00:25:58,906 --> 00:25:59,967
Maghra?

255
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,243
Did you not recognize my voice?

256
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:04,430
It can't be.

257
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:06,247
It is me, Harlan.

258
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:08,703
Princess.

259
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:16,483
Both sisters return to us!

260
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:18,629
Truly a miraculous day!

261
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:23,031
It's been so long. I'm surprised
you even remember me.

262
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:25,391
- 'Course I remember you.
- Good.

263
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,478
'Cause as I recall, you're
a big admirer of mine.

264
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,331
My queen.

265
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:34,293
The knots we received
in advance of your party

266
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:35,502
indicated your intention

267
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:37,963
to consecrate Pennsa
as the new Payan capital.

268
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,739
I assume you have no objection?

269
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,950
On the contrary, I am humbled.

270
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,703
I've known you too long to believe that.

271
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,460
We all mourned the loss
of Kanzua, my queen.

272
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:56,047
Truly an inconceivable tragedy.

273
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:58,549
Yes.

274
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:03,096
One we'll have plenty of time to discuss
in a more private setting.

275
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:05,181
Of course.

276
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:09,769
I can only imagine
how terrible your journey's been.

277
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:12,814
The genocide of your people.

278
00:27:13,648 --> 00:27:16,526
You cast out into the badlands
beyond the lower walls.

279
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:20,613
So I've taken the liberty
of securing you a beautiful residence.

280
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:22,841
It's well-fortified, perfectly located.

281
00:27:22,865 --> 00:27:25,465
- You'll be comfortable...
- Which is the highest house in Pennsa?

282
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,580
Well, that would be
this house. My house.

283
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:31,624
Would it?

284
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:37,463
Which I would be honored
to repurpose as your palace.

285
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:40,633
I'll have you brought upstairs at once.

286
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:44,846
I will not forget your
kindness, Lord Harlan.

287
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:49,809
Princess Maghra.

288
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,567
Well... this is something
of a clusterfuck, isn't it?

289
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:02,947
So, you're just gonna let her
ride in like this and take your city?

290
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,074
She's the queen.

291
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:08,262
You have more soldiers
than she has Witchfinders.

292
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,038
Yes, but hers are more adept
at killing than mine.

293
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:14,977
Besides, handled properly,

294
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:18,504
there are advantages
to having the queen this close.

295
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:22,943
Yesterday, the queen was dead.
That was close enough for me.

296
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,220
Kerrigan, you're my brother,
and I love you,

297
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:28,848
but you have no imagination.

298
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:36,457
So all this time,

299
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,649
you've been hiding in
the Payan mountains.

300
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:43,088
- Hard to imagine you as a Payan.
- I'm not.

301
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,031
I lived among the hidden tribes.

302
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,303
So you're not a Trivantian.

303
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,846
You're not a Payan.

304
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,015
Well, at least you're not
a fucking Ganite, right?

305
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,082
Yakis...

306
00:28:56,793 --> 00:29:00,481
Right to the fucking point.
Same old Baba.

307
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,631
Okay, what is it?

308
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:05,760
- Edo.
- Shit.

309
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:09,782
He took my daughter.

310
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:11,658
I need to find out
where he's hiding her.

311
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:13,494
You've been away a long time, Baba.

312
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,579
Edo's come up in the world.

313
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:18,940
- I know he's the general.
- He's the commander general.

314
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,460
- He's commander general?
- That's right.

315
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:23,253
You'll never get anywhere near him.

316
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:26,464
Not that you'd want to.
He'll skin you alive for what you did.

317
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,117
She's my little girl.

318
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:31,369
Do you understand that?

319
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:34,640
Look, I've been out for a long time,

320
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,515
but if he took her to draw you in,

321
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,475
she won't be in a regular prison.

322
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:40,918
My guess is that he'll have her
at base three.

323
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:43,649
Tell me about base three.

324
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:46,402
It's a sealed compound.
Secret army doings.

325
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:49,053
Edo has his own commando regiment there.

326
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:11,468
And how do I get in there?

327
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:13,995
No one gets in, not even the government.

328
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:20,251
Fucking Baba.

329
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:24,523
You think it was wise
to take Lord Harlan's house?

330
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:26,942
I am the queen. The queen
should live in the highest house.

331
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:28,902
Even a queen needs her allies.

332
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:31,447
Our situation here is tenuous at best.

333
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:34,658
Until the destruction of Kanzua
has been satisfactorily explained,

334
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:35,743
we are vulnerable.

335
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,186
- You worry too much.
- You don't worry enough.

336
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:40,956
Your people have already
turned on you once.

337
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,001
Lord Harlan controls the army,
and we will need his protection,

338
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:46,527
- especially when we announce the new law...
- Enough.

339
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:49,674
Harlan was a lowly courtier

340
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:52,073
who managed to become
the Lord of Pennsa.

341
00:30:52,575 --> 00:30:55,912
I don't know how he did it.
Most likely not by being an idiot.

342
00:30:56,454 --> 00:31:00,249
Show a man like Harlan any
weakness, and he will own you.

343
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:02,460
Remember that.

344
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:53,010
You need to take greater care
in your dealings with Lord Harlan.

345
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,056
We need him and the
leadership on our side.

346
00:31:58,558 --> 00:31:59,976
I am their queen.

347
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,455
What other side can they be on?

348
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:06,075
I'm just saying a beloved monarch

349
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:08,359
can achieve much more
than a despised one.

350
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,862
You're talking about your children.

351
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,841
I made you a promise, Maghra.
You think I won't keep it?

352
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,427
- I'm suggesting you curry favor...
- A queen doesn't curry favor.

353
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,595
...with the leadership while
Kanzua remains unexplained.

354
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:21,390
I don't have to explain
anything to anyone.

355
00:32:21,414 --> 00:32:24,101
Your Majesty, Lord Harlan
and Captain Gosset.

356
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,460
I'll receive them.

357
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:27,970
Leave us.

358
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,674
What will you say about Kanzua?

359
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:34,945
I'll decide what needs to be said
and that's what I'll say.

360
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:37,573
Whatever lie you tell
becomes my lie as well.

361
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:39,766
If the queen says it, it's not a lie.

362
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,935
Lord Harlan. Who have you brought?

363
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:45,104
My queen. Princess.

364
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:49,901
Allow me to present Captain Gosset,
Pennsa's chief military officer.

365
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,507
It is an honor, my queen.

366
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:59,136
The attack at Kanzua was an
unprecedented abomination.

367
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,220
Yes.

368
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,705
We've been on full military
alert since we heard.

369
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:07,186
I expect a full readiness report
on your fortifications here tomorrow.

370
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,729
And you shall have it.

371
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,483
As the only witness, if you
could tell us who our enemy is,

372
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:15,218
- it would surely help us prepare.
- I can.

373
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:17,696
And I will, in due time.

374
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,906
Call up your council.

375
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,991
I'll meet with them
at the earliest opportunity.

376
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:22,141
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,037
I have a separate issue that
is of the utmost importance.

378
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:26,372
- Maghra.
- Princess?

379
00:33:26,396 --> 00:33:30,167
You hunted them for 17 years.
You can search a little longer.

380
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:31,192
Fair enough.

381
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:35,172
My family and I were separated.

382
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:36,977
I will need every soldier you can spare

383
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:38,411
to continue the search for them.

384
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,136
We shall leave no stone unturned.

385
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,161
Thank you.

386
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:45,456
I will accompany you to give
the soldiers the mandate.

387
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:56,300
Ah! The things we do for family.

388
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,885
Yeah...

389
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:01,764
I trust...

390
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,061
you and your sister find the
accommodation to your liking?

391
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:09,564
Yes.

392
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:16,237
And now, I take it we're going
to have a real conversation.

393
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:22,553
It stands to reason, following
the attack on Kanzua,

394
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:24,513
we would want to shore up our defenses.

395
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:28,583
And yet you've just agreed to send
valuable soldiers out of the city.

396
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:35,298
Unless perhaps you have reason
not to fear a second attack.

397
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:38,509
We are well fortified here.

398
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:42,305
Pennsa has the largest regiment
in Paya, does it not?

399
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,932
- It's one of the reasons I chose it.
- Oh.

400
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:49,144
I thought it's 'cause you knew
you had a friend in me.

401
00:34:51,146 --> 00:34:52,899
Am I in need of your friendship?

402
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:57,653
Well, there are whispers, my queen.

403
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:00,507
Whispers.

404
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,510
Yeah, it's no secret that
the nobility of Kanzua

405
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,286
were mobilizing against you.

406
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:07,848
Be very careful, Harlan.

407
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,415
I always am, my queen.

408
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,645
My devotion to you is unassailable,

409
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:15,898
but Pennsa's a big city.

410
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:18,549
Lot of factions,
lot of people of influence.

411
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:21,135
They have their suspicions.

412
00:35:24,305 --> 00:35:25,366
I can only assume

413
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,535
you're working your way towards
something resembling a point.

414
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,478
It's the same one I made before.

415
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,730
You've got a friend in me.

416
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,086
I can be a very good one.

417
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,613
I'll keep that in mind. Now if
there's nothing else, leave me.

418
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,826
I'm still learning my way
around my new palace.

419
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,079
My queen.

420
00:35:58,965 --> 00:35:59,966
Boots.

421
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:02,760
Yes, Queen?

422
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,097
You can see. Do I look well?

423
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,471
You look beautiful.

424
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,398
Do I look like I want you around?

425
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,028
Leave me!

426
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,635
Kerrigan.

427
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,979
And how was the queen?

428
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:59,376
Every bit as cunning and
dangerous as I remember.

429
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,653
Hmm. Sounds like my kind of woman.

430
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:04,965
And the sister?

431
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,675
Haven't
figured her out yet,

432
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:09,368
but there's an intriguing disharmony
between the two.

433
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,080
Something's off.

434
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,707
- What is it?
- I don't know.

435
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,834
Could be worth discovering.

436
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,633
Either way, I'll no doubt require
the leverage we discussed.

437
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:25,885
You know where he is?

438
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:30,574
He is being delivered as we speak.

439
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:31,599
Good.

440
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,994
In the meantime,

441
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,859
it seems the High Lord of Pennsa

442
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:38,374
has been expelled from his own bedroom.

443
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:39,399
Yep.

444
00:37:40,483 --> 00:37:42,860
Not coincidentally,
so has his younger brother.

445
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,988
I had a feeling you'd say that.

446
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:03,172
God Flame. Protect our Haniwa.

447
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,759
Baba Voss, her father.

448
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:11,013
Deliver them whole to us.

449
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,601
Deliver them in peace to us.

450
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:17,770
Give...

451
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:20,022
Hello?

452
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:25,445
Hello?

453
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,656
You're not out here all alone, are you?

454
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:32,010
I could ask the same thing of you.

455
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:34,036
But you are not alone, are you?

456
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:36,242
No, I'm not...

457
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,269
Witchfinders. We have to go now.

458
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:55,308
Shit.

459
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:57,828
Don't move.

460
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,205
- Haniwa.
- It's time for me to go.

461
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:02,833
- You'll never make it out of the city.
- Then it'll be a short trip.

462
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:05,188
Now, we're gonna walk over
to that leg shackle...

463
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,649
Fuck.

464
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,480
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- Then let me go.

465
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:26,793
I don't want to do that either.

466
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:42,688
Fuck!

467
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,136
That's enough.

468
00:40:15,471 --> 00:40:18,367
What are Witchfinders doing
this far from the capital?

469
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:20,119
We're searching for
two Alkenny siblings,

470
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:22,830
- Haniwa and Kofun.
- We are not them.

471
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,231
Well, our dogs smell otherwise.

472
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:31,797
- This is Kofun.
- No, I'm not.

473
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:33,282
- Leave him be.
- Ah.

474
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,452
The years in your voice
tell me that you are not Haniwa.

475
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,413
- So, where is she?
- She is not with us.

476
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,873
Well, one's better than none.

477
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,142
- By order of Princess Maghra...
- Maghra?

478
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,310
...you are to return with us
to Pennsa immediately.

479
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:48,439
What are you talking about?
She's not... Princess? She's dead.

480
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:51,233
I assure you she is both alive
and the sister of Queen Kane.

481
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:52,633
You're lying.

482
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:01,517
He speaks truth.

483
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,353
- What?
- She's alive.

484
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,648
Maghra is alive.

485
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:10,753
- What?
- We need to move. Now.

486
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:11,837
You're sure?

487
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:14,673
I felt her life force on him
very strongly.

488
00:41:14,697 --> 00:41:17,259
Thank you for confirming
that which was never in doubt.

489
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:18,552
- Now let's go.
- Wait, no!

490
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,621
Wait, wait, we can't... we can't leave.
We're waiting for someone.

491
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,224
Is it Haniwa?

492
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,519
Yes, and my father.
They'll be here soon.

493
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:30,647
- We go now.
- No, we can't leave without them.

494
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:33,525
We can't stay. It's too dangerous.

495
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:35,611
Now, you can come willingly,

496
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:38,012
or you can come bound
to the back of my horse.

497
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:39,514
Make your choice.

498
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,660
- Paris...
- Maghra is alive.

499
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:45,579
Kofun, go to your mother.

500
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,456
I will wait here for Baba and Haniwa.

501
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,291
I'm not leaving you here alone.

502
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:52,110
I will not be alone.

503
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,296
Go to her.

504
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,405
Go now.

505
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:24,576
Lord Harlan. You may come in.

506
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,394
You knew me from my knock.

507
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:29,188
Or from your gait coming up the stairs.

508
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:32,525
Yes, I forgot. You're an Ayura.

509
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:36,988
And please, within these walls,
no boring formalities.

510
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:39,490
Call me Harlan.

511
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,494
Well, I assume you want
to call me Maghra.

512
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,265
It's what I called you
when we were children.

513
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:49,959
- Well, we're not children anymore.
- 'Course we are.

514
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:55,715
Just sadder, angrier ones as we age.

515
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:03,306
I come bearing a gift
for the child within.

516
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,863
A sound wand.

517
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:25,311
I haven't had one of these in years.

518
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:33,002
I recall you always enjoyed
playing with those.

519
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:35,088
Yeah.

520
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:39,300
They were the only thing that
would quiet the noise in my head.

521
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:46,075
Thank you, Harlan.

522
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:49,036
It was the least I could do, Maghra.

523
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,229
After my sister took
your home, you mean?

524
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:55,501
Everything I do is in service
of the queen.

525
00:43:55,525 --> 00:43:56,919
As I recall it,

526
00:43:56,943 --> 00:44:00,196
everything you ever did was
always in service of yourself.

527
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,320
Well, it seems we both
have long memories.

528
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:08,955
Tell me...

529
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:12,375
were you in Kanzua when it was attacked?

530
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:15,628
- No.
- No?

531
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:21,008
So... no witnesses then?

532
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:26,824
First you drop our titles, and
now you're flirting with treason?

533
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:28,951
Oh, you'd know about that.

534
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:30,911
You're the one who rose up
against your sister

535
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,830
and tried to take the
throne for yourself.

536
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:35,565
But then no one heard
from me for 18 years,

537
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:37,859
so there may be a lesson in that.

538
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:40,319
Indeed.

539
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:44,216
Where were you, by the way?

540
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,119
You know, that is a very long story
for this very short visit.

541
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:50,037
Fair enough.

542
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:53,541
We'll find time for it
one of these days.

543
00:44:57,754 --> 00:44:59,213
If you don't mind me saying,

544
00:45:00,882 --> 00:45:02,842
you would have made an excellent queen.

545
00:45:10,058 --> 00:45:13,227
Dear and
holy citizens of Pennsa,

546
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,064
may God Flame warm your hearts.

547
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:23,237
I stand humbly before you today
as a soul reborn through hardship.

548
00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:26,616
Through sorrow. Through death.

549
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:30,661
Grateful, now more than ever,
for your faith,

550
00:45:31,788 --> 00:45:32,872
your love...

551
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:35,309
Maghra?

552
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,002
- ...and the purpose you have bestowed me.
- I'm here.

553
00:45:39,128 --> 00:45:40,421
What's going on?

554
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:42,900
- We...
- Consecration's scheduled in three days.

555
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:44,401
- We agreed.
- ...are...

556
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:46,195
- I've been making arrangements.
- ...chosen.

557
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:48,572
She woke up this morning
and decided something else.

558
00:45:48,596 --> 00:45:49,597
She does that.

559
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:55,162
Our beloved capital city of Kanzua,
where my father ruled,

560
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,897
and his father, and his
grandfather before him,

561
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:02,105
is no more.

562
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:12,178
I bore witness to the cries of
my people as they drowned.

563
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:20,586
Children crying out for their mothers.
Men for their wives.

564
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,257
I was prepared to die with them,

565
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:28,261
but God had another plan for me.

566
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:33,659
I felt her flame burning inside of me,

567
00:46:33,683 --> 00:46:37,186
warming me as she carried me
away from certain death

568
00:46:37,854 --> 00:46:40,231
to reunite me with my sister.

569
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:47,464
Princess Maghra,
lost to us for all these years.

570
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,240
And it is the same god...

571
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,577
The only true god...

572
00:46:54,537 --> 00:46:56,515
who brought us here today

573
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:59,143
to consecrate the city of Pennsa

574
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:02,248
as the new capital of the Payan kingdom.

575
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:10,386
My dear Payans,

576
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:15,725
know now that what you have
probably feared is true.

577
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:21,893
It was the Trivantian army
who murdered our people...

578
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:24,959
...and destroyed Kanzua.

579
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,504
Fuck.

580
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:29,530
And now
I will tell you why.

581
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,992
Their spies informed them...

582
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:37,121
that I carry within me a child.

583
00:47:39,499 --> 00:47:41,667
A child who will change everything.

584
00:47:43,836 --> 00:47:48,849
As he or she will be born
with God's gift of vision.

585
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,395
I know it is hard to accept
something so contrary

586
00:48:00,895 --> 00:48:03,022
to the doctrines of our forefathers.

587
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,293
But I have heard the voice of God...

588
00:48:09,112 --> 00:48:13,092
and God joined her spirit to mine
and brought me back to life

589
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:15,552
so that I might unite all Payans

590
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:18,137
to defeat our enemy in the west,

591
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,372
once and for all.

592
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:30,925
Our victory has been foretold,
and it will be swift.

593
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:38,492
As we are chosen to safeguard
these blessed children as they come,

594
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:43,288
and they will come,
to usher in a new world.

595
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:47,418
A world in which those with
sight and those without

596
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:51,612
live together in harmony under my rule.

597
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:55,491
For we are Payan!

598
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,691
Have you ever been down
to the coal hub before?

599
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:11,716
No.

600
00:49:12,675 --> 00:49:14,236
They don't like visitors.

601
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,030
Stay close to the walls.
Keep away from the pits.

602
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,908
- Snell will be waiting for you.
- Snell.

603
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:23,061
Here, give him this.
He'll show you the right tunnel.

604
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,956
Now you move through as fast as you can.

605
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,433
If you breathe in that heat,
you'll burn to death from the inside.

606
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:35,656
Thanks, Yakis.

607
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:38,534
- You're probably going to die.
- Nah.

608
00:50:55,236 --> 00:50:58,030
Hello, friend. You have
something for me?

609
00:51:04,036 --> 00:51:05,121
Let's go.

610
00:51:28,352 --> 00:51:31,749
This tunnel will put you
right under base three, all right?

611
00:51:31,773 --> 00:51:34,668
But a man won't last more than
30 heartbeats in that heat.

612
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,028
So move fast, or you'll be cooked alive.

613
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:40,907
Good luck.

614
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:18,736
Sibeth.

615
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:22,299
- What have you done?
- What we discussed.

616
00:52:22,323 --> 00:52:25,677
We never discussed a baby. With Boots?

617
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:28,121
Don't judge. He was brought
to me for a reason.

618
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:30,974
You can't even know
your baby will be sighted.

619
00:52:30,998 --> 00:52:32,351
Not until it's born.

620
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:33,668
You can't know. I can.

621
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:35,979
Honestly, Maghra,
I thought you'd be happy.

622
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:38,232
If not for me, for you.

623
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:39,983
Your children are no longer witches.

624
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:41,278
Well, that won't matter

625
00:52:41,302 --> 00:52:43,278
when we're all slaughtered
by the Trivantians.

626
00:52:43,302 --> 00:52:45,555
You're being hysterical.

627
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,450
You agreed we would rule together.

628
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:50,518
I said I would rule with you by my side,

629
00:52:51,102 --> 00:52:53,414
- and here you are.
- Oh, it doesn't matter where I stand

630
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:55,541
if you just continue to act
without consulting me.

631
00:52:55,565 --> 00:52:58,210
And if I would have sought your counsel,
what would you have said?

632
00:52:58,234 --> 00:53:01,463
I'd have said that waging war
with Trivantes is madness.

633
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,674
And that announcing
a sighted baby upon arrival

634
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:06,492
makes you and me
vulnerable to a revolution.

635
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:08,846
I'd have said that with one speech,

636
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,098
you've found two different
ways to get us killed.

637
00:53:11,122 --> 00:53:13,183
And I would have given the
same speech all the same.

638
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,292
- Sibeth.
- Maghra.

639
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:18,129
There can only ever be
one queen, and she is me.

640
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:21,608
This is where a wise woman
would listen and learn,

641
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:24,236
instead of assuming
she knows how to run a kingdom

642
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,972
so that someday she might actually
have some counsel worth offering.

643
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:35,229
I am taking care of you... sister.

644
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:39,275
As I always did.

645
00:54:43,923 --> 00:54:46,092
Hello, friend.

646
00:54:47,635 --> 00:54:50,489
Sorry, it looks like I sent
you up the wrong tunnel.

647
00:54:50,513 --> 00:54:52,382
Smithy, are you sure this is Baba Voss?

648
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:54,076
I heard him and Yakis talking.

649
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,452
Well then,

650
00:54:55,476 --> 00:54:58,497
we're just gonna wait right here
for the general's men

651
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,189
and collect our reward.

652
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:04,944
Something funny?

653
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:08,298
Dead men thinking
they're getting paid.

654
00:55:08,322 --> 00:55:10,820
What the hell are you talking about?

655
00:55:37,894 --> 00:55:38,895
Smithy.

656
00:55:40,688 --> 00:55:41,915
Smithy.

657
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,442
You could get out now
before the soldiers get here.

658
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,356
It's too late.

659
00:55:51,824 --> 00:55:53,177
No one move.

660
00:55:53,201 --> 00:55:55,620
Baba Voss, you are to surrender at on...

661
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,881
Halt.

662
00:56:18,017 --> 00:56:19,018
Fan out!

663
00:56:20,395 --> 00:56:21,771
Surround him!

664
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:03,980
He's here!

665
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,774
One left turn!

666
00:57:09,485 --> 00:57:11,237
To the left. Move out.

667
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:20,455
He's moving towards the square!

668
00:57:35,928 --> 00:57:37,990
- Quiet, boy.
- Okay.

669
00:57:38,014 --> 00:57:40,641
Cover the streets and alleys!

670
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:45,538
He's in the alley going
towards the river.

671
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,854
I can hear you.

672
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:48,918
And I can smell you.
So you might as well come out.

673
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:01,389
Now who wants tea?

674
00:59:36,215 --> 00:59:37,341
Greetings, brother.

675
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:40,052
Edo.

676
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:44,450
The mighty Baba Voss.

677
00:59:44,474 --> 00:59:49,145
Slaughterer of Ganites by the dozens.
Murderer of his own father.

678
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:51,606
Chained like a common slave.

679
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:55,693
All because he could not
bring himself to kill a boy.

680
00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:00,174
It's almost disappointing.

681
01:00:00,198 --> 01:00:01,365
Please, brother.

682
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:03,659
My daughter...

683
01:00:04,994 --> 01:00:05,995
Your daughter?

684
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:10,750
Your daughter? You mean... You mean
Jerlamarel's daughter, don't you?

685
01:00:12,418 --> 01:00:16,106
Please. Just... Just let her go.

686
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,900
- "Please"?
- She has nothing to do...

687
01:00:17,924 --> 01:00:19,693
- "Please". I just...
- ...with the both of us.

688
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,303
So strange hearing compassion
in your voice.

689
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:30,603
I remember a time when I prayed
for just a hint of compassion from you.

690
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:42,424
I'm... I'm sorry. I spent
my whole life regretting

691
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:45,076
- what I've done to you. I...
- Shut up!

692
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:53,876
Don't worry.

693
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,713
We'll have plenty of time to catch up.

694
01:01:01,467 --> 01:01:02,468
Begin.

695
01:01:04,345 --> 01:01:05,346
Edo.

696
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:08,099
Edo.

697
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,935
Just let her go.

698
01:01:21,362 --> 01:01:23,740
Edo!
