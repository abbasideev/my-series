1
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:12,012
The morning God Flame has finally risen
to give us a bit of warmth, Princess.

2
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,063
Good morning, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,608
It is a beautiful day, Maghra.

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,985
The entire city will rejoice with you.

5
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:31,907
It is a shame Father couldn't be here
with us to celebrate your wedding day.

6
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,916
Lilac, lavender and honey.

7
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,294
You'll make the most appealing bride.

8
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:46,839
Leave that.

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,384
Princess, you must be completely
unadorned for the marriage ceremony.

10
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,512
- No. I will not remove this cuff.
- It's the law of the land.

11
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,973
Handmaiden, what is your name?

12
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,809
Harmony, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,603
Harmony? That is a beautiful name.

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,438
Give me your hand, Harmony.

15
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,947
Harmony,

16
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,118
are you in the habit of telling princesses
what they may and may not do?

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,580
Perhaps you would tell your queen as well?

18
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,206
No, Your Majesty, never.

19
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,958
Then hush and leave her.

20
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,509
The princess is fully slathered.
You may go, Harmony.

21
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,635
Yes, Your Majesty.

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,691
The Pennsan people,
and that means all of them,

23
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,821
even insignificant servants,
must believe this is a true union.

24
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,240
Don't worry. I will play my part.

25
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,034
You're not in this alone.

26
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,746
Yes, I am.
You are not the one being unfaithful.

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,461
This marriage will serve us all.

28
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,964
When your children are found
and brought here to you,

29
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,592
it'll be this arrangement
that'll keep them safe.

30
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,226
Some people would be insulted
by their sister tuning them out.

31
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,728
Sibeth, you can never be silenced.

32
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,355
God knows I've tried.

33
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:35,948
Here.

34
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:42,871
Remember when you were little,
and I'd wash your hair?

35
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,645
Don't stop.

36
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,067
Please.

37
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,936
Can you please just... just stay back?

38
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,647
I promise you, no one is going
to kill me on this path.

39
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,732
Yeah, well, not with me here, they're not.

40
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,027
Haniwa. Haniwa, wait for me.

41
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,744
Listen, there's no harm in having
a dedicated warrior by your side.

42
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,038
I know I'm grateful
for you and your arrows.

43
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,293
I can hear you thinking.

44
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,216
Yesterday, I was mourning my mother.

45
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,178
Today, she is a living princess,

46
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,515
and I am thinking back
on every moment of my childhood,

47
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,102
wondering what was true and what still is.

48
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,190
We will know soon, my love.

49
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,609
Not soon enough.

50
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,576
You know, I'm not a threat to you.

51
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,706
You mistake my contempt for fear.

52
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,464
Tell me, Witchfinder General,
how many lives have you taken?

53
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,968
Enough to damn my soul many times over.

54
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,182
And yet, you will kill the queen
whom you have served.

55
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,019
There is not enough damnation for you.

56
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,190
No. I suspect not.

57
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,284
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

58
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,122
- We should've stayed another night.
- Nah, it's nothing.

59
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,252
If your head fell off, you would
pick it up and carry it to Pennsa.

60
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,338
No, I would make you carry it.

61
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:03,966
Ouch.

62
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,053
These brave soldiers died

63
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,724
trying to stop the murderer, Baba Voss,
from escaping Trivantes.

64
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,353
They died heroes,
and they will be avenged.

65
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,482
A valiant soldier
of the republic remembered forever.

66
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,404
A sacred son of Trivantes,
now one with us.

67
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,331
Rendayo. My son.

68
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,006
Madame Orrie.

69
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,135
Rendayo was a patriot and a hero.

70
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:53,473
I immensely admired him
as if he were my own son.

71
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:00,230
Those responsible for his death
will suffer. You have my word.

72
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,182
You have news for me?

73
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:39,061
Yes, General Voss.
A Witchfinder looking for asylum.

74
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,312
A Witchfinder.

75
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,231
If true, this will be the first time

76
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,358
one of Tamacti Jun's soldiers
has broken ranks.

77
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:47,945
What is he trading?

78
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,864
He insists he will speak only to you.

79
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,618
And he will likely regret that.

80
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,119
Bring him to me.

81
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,288
Come on.

82
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:12,386
I am Commander General Edo Voss,
and I understand you wish to speak to me.

83
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,470
Yes, sir.

84
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,390
You are the first
of the queen's Witchfinders that I've met

85
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,310
that wasn't already impaled
on the end of my sword.

86
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,855
I have information you will want, sir.

87
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:29,570
And why would I trust a soldier
who betrays his own kingdom?

88
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,781
My kingdom is no longer
the kingdom I swore to defend.

89
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,408
And how's that?

90
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,827
I am sworn to protect the Payan kingdom

91
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,996
from the evils of witchcraft
and therefore...

92
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,374
I am familiar with Witchfinders, boy.

93
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,502
Including those who might have sight
or seek to facilitate its return.

94
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,256
And now,
your queen decrees that the sighted

95
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,175
are, in fact, not witches.

96
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,803
Yes, sir.

97
00:09:54,887 --> 00:10:00,142
In fact, she also claims to be
carrying a sighted child in her own womb.

98
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,269
Yes, sir.

99
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:08,650
Boy, did you really desert your own army
and face certain death

100
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:13,280
to come here and tell me something
my spies reported days ago?

101
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,036
- Hobble him and sell him to the Slavers.
- No, no.

102
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,454
- Come on.
- Sir.

103
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,916
- Commander Voss, there are others.
- Stop!

104
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,136
Others?

105
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,974
Hers won't be the first sighted child
within the Payan royal family.

106
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,519
There are two, already grown.

107
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,608
And these children already grown…

108
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,739
Is one of them a girl called Haniwa?

109
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,283
Yes.

110
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,402
So, this is Pennsa?

111
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,155
Yes.

112
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,875
Is it always this quiet?

113
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,046
No. Never.

114
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,634
Something's wrong.

115
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,146
There's soldiers ahead.

116
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,484
Stay here and say nothing.

117
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,447
- Should we be worried?
- Not we, you.

118
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,807
- This is gonna be tricky.
- Why? Isn't my mother here?

119
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,310
- She's here.
- So, what's the problem?

120
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,604
The thing of it is,

121
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,232
she's apparently getting married today.

122
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,333
Baba, my love…

123
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,294
Forgive me.

124
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,339
Mom?

125
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,592
Mom!

126
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,427
Kofun?

127
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,681
Mom. Mom! Mom!

128
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,729
You're alive.

129
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,064
My baby.

130
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:40,404
I've searched for you
every day since we were separated.

131
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,865
I never stopped.

132
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,703
Mom, they said
that you're getting married today.

133
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,246
That can't be true, can it?

134
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,874
I will explain everything.

135
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,211
Where's your father? And Haniwa?

136
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,715
He went into Trivantes to get her back.

137
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,799
Trivantes?

138
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,968
Princess Maghra, it's time.

139
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,597
Wait. Why... Why Trivantes?

140
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,266
- What happened with Jerlamarel?
- How can you be getting married today?

141
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,351
Lord Harlan is waiting,
and the queen is growing impatient.

142
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,187
- I'm coming.
- Who is Lord Harlan?

143
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,731
I will explain everything later.
I have to go, Kofun.

144
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,359
- I just need you to trust me.
- Mama? Mama, you can't do this.

145
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,945
I... I can't stop this.

146
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,572
Your father would understand.

147
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,992
No, I don't think he would understand why
his dead wife is marrying someone else.

148
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,410
- Kofun...
- Stop saying my name

149
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,995
and do something to fix this!

150
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,373
I don't know what is happening,
Mama, but you can't go through with it.

151
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:34,625
Be quiet!

152
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,463
I am still the mother you knew,
and you are still my son.

153
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,216
But things have changed.

154
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,803
Now, I'm doing this for you
and for all of us.

155
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,141
So you stay here.
You stay here in my room,

156
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,268
and you speak to no one,

157
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,106
and then we will talk
when all of this is over. I promise.

158
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:03,278
- I promise.
- Don't do this.

159
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,657
- Don't do this.
- I have to.

160
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,295
I have so many questions.

161
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:30,889
All right, that's enough.

162
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,392
- I just need a moment.
- Paris?

163
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:39,815
Woman.

164
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,193
I feel the fever through your clothing.

165
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,864
- It's not gonna kill me.
- You need a healer.

166
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,782
We'll find one in Pennsa.

167
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,493
Baba.
You'll be dead by the time we get there.

168
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,123
We are in the Lakelands now,
not far from the Valier.

169
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,542
They will offer us shelter and a healer.

170
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,419
Papa?

171
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,506
Please.

172
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,801
Okay, my love.

173
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,680
I cannot accompany you
to Valier territory.

174
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,099
Well, that is where we are going.

175
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,144
Understand, the hidden tribes
were not hidden to me.

176
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,689
The Valier suffered greatly at my hands.

177
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:33,702
You stay quiet and camp nearby.
We'll find you on the way out.

178
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,208
Or not.

179
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,884
Our God, beyond your flame above…

180
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,597
let your will be done on this special day

181
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,058
in this holiest of unions.

182
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,522
Give guidance, clear paths,

183
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:49,903
condemn those who trespass against us
to writhe within your fire and smoke.

184
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:57,327
For Thine is the darkness,
the power and the glory.

185
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,873
Forever and ever.

186
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:28,025
Princess Maghra and Lord Harlan…

187
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,824
You enter this union
adorned in scented splendor.

188
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,805
You've pledged
your commitment to each other

189
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:02,017
with the joining of bodies and souls
before God.

190
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:10,692
So, by the divine ordination
bestowed upon me, you may seal your union.

191
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,871
Thank you, you too.

192
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,378
Princess Maghra.

193
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,843
- Any wife of Harlan's is a sister of mine.
- Maghra, you remember my brother.

194
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:04,932
- Thank you.
- Kerrigan. I changed your diapers.

195
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:08,352
Well. Lucky for all of us,
I have people for that now.

196
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,774
Thank you.

197
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,735
Thank you so much.

198
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,029
I'm sorry. Sorry.

199
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,033
All right. Go, go. Get off. Go.

200
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,216
- Are we close?
- Yes.

201
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,510
Because I don't think
the big one can make it much further,

202
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,220
and I don't think
we'll be able to carry him.

203
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,641
Who's there?

204
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,518
Make yourself known.

205
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,813
Who enters Valier territory
without announcing themselves?

206
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:57,651
Brother! We bring no threat. I am Paris.

207
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,695
We are the last of the Alkenny.

208
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,073
No. I am last of the Alkenny.

209
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,785
- Chet-chet.
- Chet-chet-chet.

210
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,620
Bow!

211
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,205
Lion.

212
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,374
Bow Lion.

213
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,712
Oh, Paris.

214
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,407
Kofun?

215
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:47,993
Is it you?

216
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,538
It's okay. You're safe.

217
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,707
I'm your Aunt Sibeth.

218
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:00,422
I was overjoyed
when I heard you were finally here.

219
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:03,217
We've been waiting
such a long time for you.

220
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,769
Will you embrace me?

221
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,418
You're taller than your parents.

222
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,925
Would you like something?
Anything to drink? I'll send for it.

223
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,553
No. Thank you.

224
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,307
How tragic we're only meeting now
for the first time.

225
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,311
You hunted us my whole life.

226
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,776
If only Maghra
had announced herself long ago,

227
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,029
I would've protected her, protected you.

228
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,323
She knew that.

229
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:12,578
We were hunting Jerlamarel
and his children.

230
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,329
I didn't know they were Maghra's.

231
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,792
I'd been led to believe
Jerlamarel had killed my sister.

232
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,169
I believed him to be the devil.

233
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:23,422
You know that's not true.
Why'd my mother stay hidden?

234
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,466
Whatever mistakes she made,

235
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:31,013
I'm sure she made them
to keep you and your sister safe,

236
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,307
which is what I'm trying to do right now.

237
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,851
Well, even with your decree,

238
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,437
people in Paya still believe
a witch is to be burned.

239
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,647
I've been known to change a few minds.

240
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,525
It might take a bit of time,

241
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,947
but the Payans will learn, as I have,

242
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:54,119
to embrace those with sight as blessed.

243
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,210
How difficult for you,

244
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:06,423
journeying to this place,
arriving on your mother's wedding day.

245
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,675
The world must seem upside down.

246
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,387
But know this,

247
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,351
no one shall stand against you,
not while you're in my kingdom.

248
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,145
Do you believe me?

249
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,275
I don't know.

250
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:27,861
I want to.

251
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:30,948
Fair enough.

252
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:35,577
Many good things start with… desire.

253
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:47,172
I've arranged a room for you.
We'll talk again soon?

254
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,943
Queen Kane's war council
is mobilizing her armies.

255
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:11,738
And we've learned from the Payan defector

256
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,949
that not only has
Princess Maghra returned,

257
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,452
but she comes with two grown children,
Haniwa and Kofun.

258
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:19,955
Both sighted.

259
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,125
The Payan fanatics
will burn them at the stake.

260
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,878
They will do as their queen commands.

261
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,922
With two sighted children
in the royal family now of age,

262
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,300
they are an even greater threat.

263
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,552
We don't know their intentions.

264
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,720
We know they took the trouble

265
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,222
to break their Witchfinder General
out of captivity.

266
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,475
That is intention enough.
We must strike now.

267
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,438
It would be suicide
for the Payans to attack us.

268
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:48,984
The queen may be crazy,
but she's not a fool.

269
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,029
Still, these are troubling developments.

270
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,406
I can muster our forces in a matter of d...

271
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,782
No, steady, Edo.

272
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,204
The Ganites
are still raining shit on us out west.

273
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,290
And you yourself stood here
and heard the council's attitude

274
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,917
about an eastern campaign.

275
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,337
- You will never sell it.
- No. You will do that.

276
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,631
You overestimate my influence.

277
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,008
I am but one third of the Triangle.

278
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:15,886
But still,

279
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:21,058
I will convince the council to request
a diplomatic summit with the Payans.

280
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,645
- Trivantians do not sue for peace!
- We do what we need to do.

281
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,273
And you will do as ordered.
Do you understand?

282
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,694
Yes, sir.

283
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:36,740
If for nothing else, it will give us time
to bring a battalion or two east,

284
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,201
if it comes to that.

285
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,161
Understood.

286
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:48,043
I will let you know
what the council decides.

287
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:07,646
Breathe slow and deep, Baba,
and drink this.

288
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,651
It will give you strength.

289
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,286
When did you become a healer?

290
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:27,416
I'm not yet, but I've been learning
from the healers here.

291
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,547
Those roots should absorb the infections
so that the fever can pass.

292
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,510
You've lost so much, all because of us.

293
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:41,889
Still, you take us in.

294
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,895
We are one tribe, remember?

295
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,817
Yeah, I remember.

296
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,406
Kofun?

297
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,201
No. Not Kofun.

298
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,996
What are you doing in here?

299
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,125
Maghra, it's our wedding night.
Where else am I gonna be?

300
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:58,215
This is not a marriage.
This is an alliance.

301
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,885
Right, but... but it can be both.

302
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,268
Put on your pants, Harlan.
I need your help.

303
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,312
- Now.
- Fine.

304
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,256
They made me sneak you
some pheasant and ale.

305
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:42,718
Don't worry. I didn't poison it,
if that's what you're thinking.

306
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:46,263
I had no such thought.

307
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,807
And I had no such poison.

308
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,564
Our Alkenny brothers and sisters,

309
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,400
last time you came to us,
we turned you away.

310
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,654
You healed our Bow Lion.
It is more than we could've hoped for.

311
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:06,408
It is you who bring us
a message of hope upon your return.

312
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,328
We feared that you would
lead Witchfinders to us,

313
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:13,749
because when they had come prior, they
said the sighted hid amongst the Alkenny.

314
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:19,338
They slaughtered men, women, children.

315
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,382
Their blades didn't discriminate,

316
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:26,720
all because the Witchfinders believed
we had knowledge of witches.

317
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,766
Those of us who lived
were spared only to spread the fear.

318
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:37,272
But we will rebuild.
We're already making babies.

319
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:42,986
We will make ourselves whole to honor
the memory of the many that were lost.

320
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,115
Stop!

321
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:54,164
And now word comes that the queen
will no longer send her Witchfinders,

322
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:56,375
as she no longer searches for witches.

323
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,712
The queen may yet change her mind,

324
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:06,885
but tonight, we celebrate your escape
from Trivantes and savor our freedom…

325
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,595
[signaling] Tamacti Jun is here.

326
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,932
…however short-lived,
from the queen and her Witchfinders.

327
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,727
These are uncertain times,

328
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,813
but we face them with hope

329
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:20,983
for a future more peaceful than our past.

330
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,114
Have you lost your mind?

331
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:32,160
The Valier deserve retribution.
I owe 'em that much.

332
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:33,829
No, you owe me, Witchfinder.

333
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:37,541
You think I don't wanna rip your throat
out every time I hear your voice?

334
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:41,128
You slaughtered my people too.

335
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,464
But you do not get to die.

336
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,177
Your punishment is you will live
with what you have done.

337
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:55,893
Death must be earned too, Witchfinder,
every bit as much as life.

338
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,335
That's his favorite spot.

339
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:26,715
And… his favorite chair.

340
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,760
Kerrigan. Come on.

341
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,178
Wake the fuck up. Come on.

342
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,140
Princess.

343
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,936
I can still smell the blossoms on you.

344
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:43,565
You two should be home,
rolling around in sticky sheets.

345
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:44,816
I need your help.

346
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,404
- Brother, not up to the task?
- We need you to cross the border.

347
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,408
What's the cargo?

348
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,494
Her daughter, Haniwa.

349
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,956
She's being held by the Trivantian army.

350
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:01,708
Yeah.

351
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,627
Yeah, fuck off.

352
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:05,295
Please.

353
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:09,341
Princess, generally in my trade,

354
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:12,427
the object is to avoid the military,
not go searching for them.

355
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:13,762
Kerrigan.

356
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:24,898
If she really is in a military brig,
I won't be able to get her out.

357
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:29,194
Come on. Prison guards can be bought,
same as anybody else.

358
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:30,571
Maybe.

359
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:33,197
But it would take a lot of copper.

360
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,574
For you or for them?

361
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:38,661
- I am offended, Princess.
- No, he's not.

362
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:44,168
No, I suppose I'm not.
Still, it would take some doing.

363
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:48,088
When you find her, how will you
get her safely out of Trivantes?

364
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,091
Getting out of the city's the easy part.

365
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:55,888
I have been smuggling Ganite thornflower
from Trivantes to Pennsa for years.

366
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:04,813
I know every hole and tunnel
into and out of that place.

367
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,399
So you'll do it?

368
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:16,366
Consider it… a wedding gift.

369
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,997
I'll leave when the God Flame warms.

370
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:23,999
You'll leave now.

371
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,002
Come on. Up you get.

372
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,375
No. Now is not the time.

373
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,505
Paris? How could you bring him here?

374
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,049
How could you even
share the air that he breathes?

375
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,802
We need him. He has a new purpose.

376
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:20,097
No. He dies by my hand tonight.

377
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:23,559
He killed my mother.

378
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:26,812
Yes. Time will come he pays for that.

379
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,314
I can't believe this is you.

380
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,150
You're a traitor.

381
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:35,279
He is our only hope of getting to Maghra.

382
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:37,781
The Witchfinders massacred the Valier.

383
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:41,076
They will have
something to say about this.

384
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,038
Please. You cannot tell them. You cannot.

385
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:50,335
- I trusted you. I trusted you.
- Bow Lion. Bow Lion.

386
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,921
You know me.

387
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,675
You know my heart.

388
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:00,179
Girl.

389
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:06,143
Be gone before God Flame rises.

390
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,190
I won't keep your secret
any longer than that.

391
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,176
Kofun?

392
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,101
Thank God Flame.

393
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,481
- I told you to stay in my room.
- I know.

394
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,441
I'm here.

395
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,738
I'm sorry.

396
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:06,161
I know this must all feel very strange
and upsetting to you,

397
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:08,789
and I promise you
I will explain everything,

398
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:12,167
but you cannot disobey me like that again.

399
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,627
It is not safe here.

400
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,713
- My sister is someone who...
- Sibeth.

401
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:20,384
Don't worry. We've met.

402
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,096
She came to see me after your wedding.

403
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,017
Kofun.

404
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:34,106
- You cannot trust her.
- Why not?

405
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,693
She's not the one
who lied to me my entire life.

406
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:42,281
It is not that simple.

407
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,534
You betrayed your husband tonight.

408
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,788
You betrayed all of us
and not for the first time.

409
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:55,043
You could've identified yourself
to the Witchfinders when we were babies.

410
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,796
You could've saved the Alkenny.

411
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,590
We wouldn't have had to
spend our entire lives running.

412
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:03,802
My sister would never have accepted
any sighted children that weren't her own.

413
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,723
She would've killed all of us.

414
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,309
I was trying to protect you
the best way I knew how.

415
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,561
- By lying to us.
- Of course by lying to you.

416
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,354
The truth would've gotten you
burned at the stake.

417
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:15,439
No.

418
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,778
You resented us.
You resented our sight. You always have.

419
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:25,824
That's why you were so angry
when you realized we'd learned to read.

420
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,160
Wasn't it?

421
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:33,957
You wouldn't speak to us.
We'd become unrecognizable you said.

422
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,169
Do you recognize yourself, Mama?

423
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:40,631
Because I don't.

424
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:46,512
You and Haniwa belong to a world
that I couldn't begin to understand.

425
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:51,600
I was terrified that one day
it would take you away from me.

426
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,231
Looks like it did.

427
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,780
What are you doing about Haniwa and Dad?

428
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,327
Lord Harlan has already
sent someone to find them.

429
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,462
Right, I'm sure your new husband
is very determined to find your old one.

430
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:58,542
You asked me
if I remember how many I had killed.

431
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:05,716
That's like me asking you
how many breaths you took today.

432
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,402
When the queen left me bleeding to death…

433
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,865
I fell into a state.

434
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:35,954
Not dead… but no longer among the living.

435
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,710
And it was there…

436
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:44,796
Suddenly…

437
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:48,926
I had vision.

438
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,681
Do you know what I saw?

439
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,606
I saw faces.

440
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:08,403
I saw the faces…

441
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:14,743
Of every man, woman and child
that I had murdered and tortured.

442
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,290
I heard their screams.

443
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,753
I could feel their pain.

444
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,011
But in all of those faces…

445
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:41,311
I could not find that of my wife
nor of my children.

446
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:52,447
I was not there when Queen Kane
drowned them in their beds.

447
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:00,873
Instead…

448
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:08,380
I was butchering all those faces.

449
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:16,054
For years and years,
you have fought for darkness.

450
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,186
Now you must fight for light.

451
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,193
You should not have stopped the girl.

452
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:40,871
All right. No more stopping.
We walk until we reach Pennsa.

453
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,831
Do not fear.

454
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:48,462
You will have
plenty of opportunities to die.

455
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:51,465
We all will.

456
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:58,388
I always thought that
the fact that I could see and you couldn't

457
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,016
was something that separated us.

458
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:04,895
Thought there was
so much space between us.

459
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:09,608
But every time
I feel like I'm beyond help,

460
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:16,031
in the House of Enlightenment,
in Trivantes, somehow you always find me.

461
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:24,206
You're my baby girl.
Kofun is my boy, Maghra my wife.

462
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:29,628
As long as I'm alive,
nothing will separate us. Yes.

463
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:35,342
I know I don't make it easy.

464
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,471
No, you don't.

465
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:43,058
From this place, it's two days to Pennsa.

466
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:48,230
What do you think it will be like, Pennsa?

467
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,066
Crowded.

468
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,028
What do you think she'll be like?

469
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:58,824
- She'll be like Maghra.
- Right.

470
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,661
Do we even know who that is?
