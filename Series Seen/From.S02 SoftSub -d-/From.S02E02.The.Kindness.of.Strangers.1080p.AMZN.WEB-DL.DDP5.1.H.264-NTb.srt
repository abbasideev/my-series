<i>Previously on</i> From...

2
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,100
We have to turn around.
We can't be here! Stop the bus!

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,449
Everyone please
return to your seats!

4
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,191
Bad things are gonna happen if...

5
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,193
Stop the goddamn bus!

6
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:21,325
- Donna!
- What?

7
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:25,503
There is a bus parked
outside the diner!

8
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,202
There's a woman
trapped in the basement

9
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,552
of that house over there.
We could use some help.

10
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,033
Places don't just
come apart like this!

11
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:34,164
Jim! Come!

12
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:35,470
Wait, we're almost there.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,601
Elgin?

14
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,343
I need some help over here!

15
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,613
Dad!

16
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,137
Julie!

17
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,182
In order to get us
all three out safely,

18
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,576
you have to do it slowly

19
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,360
and you gotta do it right.

20
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,145
Dad, the sun is
about to go down.

21
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,190
That's why you're
gonna leave us here.

22
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:01,626
Everyone on, right now.

23
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,019
- We're leaving.
- Hold on!

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,194
- Start the...
- No! No, no!

25
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,761
Donna!

26
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,285
Fatima, get back here!

27
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,765
We can't just leave them!

28
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,506
- Fatima!
- Fatima!

29
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:14,248
Inside the diner, now!

30
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:17,077
- I love you too, Dad.
- We have to get inside!

31
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,209
Let's go. Inside. Inside!

32
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,169
They're here. We have to go.

33
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,040
- Where are we?
- We're underneath the town.

34
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,781
This is where the monsters live.

35
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,262
This is where they sleep.

36
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:30,220
There's a tunnel!
Please, go all the way up.

37
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,352
Go, go, go, go.

38
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,137
Victor!

39
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,747
Part of me really wants
to go to Iceland

40
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:37,271
with the most amazing guy I met

41
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,142
in the most
fucked-up place imaginable.

42
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,404
What does the other part want?

43
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,276
To go back and find out if

44
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,365
the woman I fell in love with
waited for me.

45
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,415
Anybody up there?

46
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:55,245
I can help you if you help me.

47
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:06,474
You made it.

48
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:07,562
What the...

49
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,219
We don't have much time.

50
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,525
I need you to kill me.

51
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,756
The fuck?

52
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:29,236
Where are we?

53
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,848
We had a deal.

54
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:35,242
You said you would kill me.

55
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,288
Jesus.

56
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,640
Who did this to you?

57
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,861
Are you from the town?

58
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,472
What, the town...?

59
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:49,473
- Yeah.
- Oh. The to...

60
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:50,866
- Oh.
- The to...

61
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,478
I-I always thought the town
was the worst part,

62
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,785
and then I went
through the tree.

63
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,137
Did you go through the tree?

64
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,183
Yeah.

65
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:05,750
The tree, yeah.

66
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,929
You go in one place,
come out another.

67
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,714
Sometimes you get stuck.

68
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,586
Sometimes you get trapped.

69
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,632
Now, that's when they get you.

70
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:20,635
Who?

71
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,334
You... You have a kind face.

72
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,641
What's your name?

73
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,514
I'm Boyd.

74
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,212
I'm Martin.

75
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,391
How long you been here, Martin?

76
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:39,871
Oh, it's... it's been
a long... Ah!

77
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,395
Oh, I'm sorry.

78
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,310
I used to try to count the days,

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,400
but I couldn't bear
to count the years.

80
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,272
It's been so long since
I've seen kindness.

81
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,839
That's why you have to go,

82
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,014
before they come back.

83
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,581
I'm not leaving without you.

84
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,845
Boyd.

85
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,803
Wait, you... you're a Marine?

86
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:00,849
Semper fi.

87
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:06,550
Leave no man behind.
You help me, I help you.

88
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:07,986
That's the way it goes, got it?

89
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:09,945
Boyd, if you want to help me,

90
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,816
then just kill me.

91
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,951
Please.

92
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,909
Everybody calm down!

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,260
Calm the fuck down!

94
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,053
Please, you haven't done
anything yet you can't undo.

95
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:33,664
This is just
a big misunderstanding.

96
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,624
People are upset,
but if you'll let us go...

97
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,408
You wanna go?

98
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,845
You have no idea
what's waiting out there.

99
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,587
Where's Kristi?

100
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,459
She's in the back
with the girl from the bus.

101
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,895
- The nurse.
- Sit down.

102
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,464
You too, sit!

103
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:53,510
Okay.

104
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,861
I know this is scary...

105
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:01,301
but we are not the enemy.

106
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:05,000
The enemy's out there.

107
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,567
Well, that's an odd
thing to say...

108
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:09,352
Please, just let me explain.

109
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:11,659
Okay.

110
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,051
Okay, let's start

111
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,576
with the tree
you saw in the road.

112
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,406
How did you know about the tree?

113
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,409
Everyone sees the tree.

It's too far. Over there!

140
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,020
We can hide in there
till morning.

141
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:37,718
Yeah.

142
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:38,849
Okay.

143
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,723
Go in.

144
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,683
We have to be quiet.

145
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,685
There's no talisman in here.

146
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:55,170
Whose stuff is this?

147
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,607
This is mine.

148
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,914
Why is it here?

149
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,611
I come here sometimes.

150
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,445
I have some food for us.

151
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,499
Mari.

152
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:21,849
How could you?

153
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:27,071
We were supposed to have lunch.

154
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,946
I was on my way to meet you.
We were supposed to have lunch.

155
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,210
I know.

156
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,777
Have you been here
this whole time?

157
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:41,651
It's been six months.
You never called, you never...

158
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,135
You know, your parents and I...

159
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,575
...we went to the police.

160
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,148
Mari, you don't understand...

161
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:02,019
Bullshit.

162
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,937
This whole time you've been
less than two hours away,

163
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,113
with these people,

164
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,246
with shotguns,

165
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,987
that fucking woman.

166
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:17,121
It's like you've joined
some fucking cult.

167
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,689
I gotta get out of here.

168
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,125
You can't leave the diner.

169
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,649
Get out of my way.

170
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,259
You need to listen to me, okay?

171
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:28,002
You don't get to tell me
what I can and cannot do.

172
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,577
Look.

173
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,145
I know you're hurt.

174
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,712
Mm-hm.

175
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,846
And that this is
beyond fucked up.

176
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:51,025
But I-I just need you
to listen to me, okay?

177
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,596
This place.

178
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,603
It isn't what you think.

179
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,041
How you doing over there, Jim?

180
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,610
I think I busted a rib.

181
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,176
It's getting hard to breathe.

182
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,787
Just take it slow.

183
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,746
We'll be okay.

184
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,706
Have you ever done this before?

185
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,622
Spent the night hiding?

186
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,625
Would it make you feel
better if I said yes?

187
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,198
What the fuck. Fuck!

188
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,245
I can't move!

189
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,246
Help!

190
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:39,769
It's Rick, right?

191
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:42,380
Brick! My name's Brick.

192
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,121
Okay, you gotta calm down, buddy.

193
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:46,689
Hey, you need to get me
out of here, okay? Please.

194
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,170
- Brick. Brick.
- My chest hurts.

195
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,388
- Brick?
- Yeah?

196
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,129
You gotta stay quiet, man.

197
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,959
I'm coming over to you,
buddy, okay?

198
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,744
I ca... I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

199
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,267
Yes, you can.

200
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,704
You're talkin', right?
That means you can breathe.

201
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,880
Just nice and slow.

202
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,102
Okay? Tom?

203
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,886
Almost there.

204
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,889
Stop!

205
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,114
Come on, man,
you gotta stop moving.

206
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,120
Hey, look at me.

207
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,992
You see me?

208
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,821
Yeah. Yeah, I can see you.

209
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,171
Just, um, look I'm, uh,

210
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:37,261
not really good in
tight spaces, all right?

211
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:38,741
It's all right.

212
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:41,309
Just, you gotta be quiet.

213
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,268
I'm right here.
We're both right here, okay?

214
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,054
We're gonna get outta this.

215
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:50,797
We just gotta stay calm
and not make things worse.

216
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:54,975
Most of all, we gotta be quiet.

217
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:58,152
As quiet as we can.

218
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,719
Why?

219
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,945
Come on, man.

220
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,730
There's gotta be something.

221
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,213
Even if you get me free,
then what?

222
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,215
I don't think
I can make it to town.

223
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:20,478
Then I'll carry you. Huh?

224
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,307
Once we get back to town,
look, we got... we got people.

225
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:24,787
A doctor. She can help you.

226
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:26,180
Hey, look.

227
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,921
You see this?

228
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,880
I found these in the forest.

229
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,926
They protect us. Keep us safe.

230
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,015
They won't be able
to hurt you there.

231
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,800
You think... you think
those things that come out

232
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,933
of the forest at night did this?

233
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,762
They're just
the tip of the spear.

234
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,547
Hey, how 'bout we change
the subject, huh?

235
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:47,070
Hey, Martin, where you from?

236
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,246
A small town. Millbrook.

237
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,421
Where?

238
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:51,858
Millbrook, huh?

239
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,816
You're wa... wasting time.

240
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,082
Oh, God.

241
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,128
- They're coming.
- What the...

242
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,307
You don't have time, Boyd.

243
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:11,007
There's darkness in the forest.

244
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:14,054
Nightmares you can't
even begin to imagine.

245
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,883
Things we were never
meant to see. Things that...

246
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:21,365
You have to get out
before the music stops.

247
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,278
Don't.

248
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,150
The more attention
you draw to the house,

249
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,892
the more likely those things
are to go looking around.

250
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,372
I can't just
sit here doing nothing.

251
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,287
That is exactly
what you're gonna do.

252
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,987
You... Come on, sit down.

253
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,174
Julie, your dad's best
chance right now is to stay

254
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,133
exactly where he is
until the morning.

255
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:37,572
People used to do it
all the time here.

256
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,139
They hid.

257
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,620
That's how Sheriff Boyd
and his family

258
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,144
survived the first night.

259
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,191
I know.

260
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:52,021
Hey, look, all we can do
right now is wait.

261
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,027
Do you want some tea?

262
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,909
What, uh...
What's your favorite book?

263
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,085
What?

264
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,130
You do read, right?

265
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,045
What's your favorite book?

266
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,700
You're just trying
to distract me.

267
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,529
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

268
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,532
But you still gotta
answer the question.

269
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:39,547
Just when I thought life
was all out of surprises.

270
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,525
Hello?

271
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:02,962
Anybody here?

272
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,965
This is a weird gas station.

273
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,011
Yeah.

274
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,015
This whole fuckin'
place is weird.

275
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,539
It's like we drove
into a goddamn acid trip.

276
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,326
There are worse places
to be stuck, I suppose.

277
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,950
Can anybody hear me?

278
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,300
God dammit,
where did they all go?

279
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,606
We need to go back inside.

280
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,086
- What? No.
- Come on.

281
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,478
No. We have to find them.
We can't just leave

282
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,827
- those people out here.
- Look, we tried. We tried.

283
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,351
There's nothing more we can do.
Okay? Come on.

284
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,049
Hey! If you were on the bus,

285
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,659
if you can hear me,
you have to run.

286
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,705
You have to run
and be as quiet as you can.

287
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:53,273
There are things out here,
things that if they find you,

288
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,318
they'll... if somebody
calls for you...

289
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:56,711
- Okay, inside!
- ...do not answer!

290
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,060
Inside, now! Inside, now!

291
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,062
If somebody calls for you
do not answer!

292
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,122
You're spoiling all the fun.

293
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,473
Fuck!

294
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,171
No, Fatima! No, stop!

295
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:25,479
Hey!

296
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,567
Fatima!

297
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,266
Oh, no.

298
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,313
Hey! Hey! Hey!

299
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:34,792
You need to run!
You need to hide!

300
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:37,056
Fatima, hey, hey, baby.

301
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:38,622
Baby, come away from
the window, okay?

302
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:39,797
Hey! You should run!

303
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,538
You need run! You need to hide!

304
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,236
You have to get inside!

305
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,542
Hey! They're not listening!

306
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:47,196
- Hey!
- Hey, hey.

307
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,154
- What?
- I know.

308
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,372
We have to do something!

309
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,373
Baby, there is nothing
that we can do!

310
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,245
I'm going to the back door.

311
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,550
- No.
- Ellis!

312
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,596
Ellis, we can
literally sneak out.

313
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:58,251
We have to bring them inside!
We can bring them inside!

314
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,730
I know, I know!
Baby, listen to me...

315
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:00,775
Baby, you need to stop!
Baby, look, listen!

316
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,260
Hey.

317
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,697
Hey. It's okay.

318
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,655
I'm here, you know?

319
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,527
Hey.

320
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,357
Baby.

321
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:18,706
Baby.

322
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,755
Fuck you.

323
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,279
Fuck you!

324
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:30,370
Stop fucking smiling!

325
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,416
Stop smiling!

326
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,638
You'll feel better
if you come outside.

327
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,128
Fatima.

328
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,616
I can't. I can't
fucking do this anymore.

329
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:00,791
I can't...

330
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,445
I know.

331
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,274
I can't... I can't fucking
do this anymore.

332
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,841
I know. I know.

333
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:09,713
I can't.

334
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,851
Is that... is that them?

335
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:17,808
Is that the...

336
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,723
Yeah.

337
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,943
Jesus. Jesus!

338
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,641
Jesus fuck, please, please!

339
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,295
Please, God,
I just wanna go home.

340
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,471
I just wanna go home, please!

341
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,734
- God!
- Hey, man, you gotta shut up.

342
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:32,127
I just wanna go home! Please!

343
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,390
Hey, look at me.

344
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,306
We're good.

345
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,182
What's wrong?
What the... what's wrong?

346
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,748
Fucking bleeding!

347
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:47,273
What the fuck?

348
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,405
You gotta be quiet.

349
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,799
I can't! I'm fucking bleeding
from my fuckin' mouth!

350
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,366
You're gonna be okay.

351
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,368
We just gotta hang on.

352
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:58,632
God, I just wanna
fucking get outta here!

353
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,772
My God,
this is really happening.

354
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,690
Fuck this. Let us out.

355
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,257
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
- Let us out.

356
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,476
- Relax.
- Let us the fuck out.

357
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:19,522
Hey! Hey, are you insane?
Are you insane?

358
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,481
- Did you hear that?
- There's more people out there.

359
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,483
You've got those people
trapped under the house!

360
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,224
You can't just fuckin'
leave them! You have guns!

361
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,269
It won't matter.

362
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,749
Won't make a fuckin' difference.

363
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,838
Are you people fucking crazy?
I'm not gonna sit here...

364
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,494
- Kenny!
- Hey, whoa, wait!

365
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,843
Move!

366
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,410
The fuck over there now!

367
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,802
- Back the fuck up!
- Hey, hey.

368
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,717
Now!

369
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,328
Hurry the fuck up!

370
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,201
All right, we're gonna
try this the fuck again.

371
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,551
You stupid motherfucker.

372
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,814
You have no idea
what you're doing.

373
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,599
Yeah, we'll see.

374
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,905
Now, me and my friend here are
gonna go take a walk outside.

375
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,429
- Hey.
- No, shut the fuck up.

376
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,604
Open the fucking door.

377
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:59,258
We do that,

378
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,695
you put everyone
in this room at risk.

379
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:03,827
You want that?

380
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,745
How'd the tree
get in the road? Huh?

381
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,312
How many of you
did it take to lug

382
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:11,357
that fuckin' thing
out there, huh?

383
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,359
Are you fucking kidding me?

384
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,447
You actually think that we...

385
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,231
I honestly think
you're full of shit.

386
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,537
And how 'bout the rest of you?

387
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,755
Huh?

388
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,584
Just gonna sit there?

389
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:24,761
This bitch blew out our ride
home with a fucking shotgun!

390
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,720
You all seem
disturbingly okay with that.

391
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,725
Everyone's scared. Okay?

392
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,771
- They should be.
- I tend to be a little

393
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,339
suspicious of people who tell
me how to fucking be scared.

394
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,733
You just heard
those people outside, man!

395
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,604
Yeah, that's right, I "heard."

396
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,346
Super convenient we can't
actually see anything.

397
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:47,262
So, how 'bout we go take a look?

398
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,829
Okay.

399
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:49,917
Let's move.

400
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:52,789
Let's just talk, okay?

401
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,791
- No, we're done talking.
- No, please, just relax...

402
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,489
Shut the fuck up!

403
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,797
Now, you are gonna
put down those guns

404
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,190
and open the fuckin' door

405
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,757
or I'm gonna put his
fucking brains on the wall.

406
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,455
How 'bout that?

407
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:13,810
Then you're gonna
have to shoot him.

408
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,599
And I'm gonna have
to shoot you...

409
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,993
...right in the fuckin' head,

410
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:26,475
'cause you sure as shit
ain't opening those doors.

411
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:36,703
Almost there.

412
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,932
You ever wonder
if Abby was right?

413
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:49,933
Wh...

414
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,373
Hey, what did you say?

415
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,985
What if it's all just a dream?

416
00:22:58,115 --> 00:23:00,727
How the fuck do you...

417
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,166
Martin! Wha-wha-what's...
What's goin'...

418
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,863
What's...
What's goin' on, Martin?

419
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:09,083
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.

420
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:10,867
Martin. Okay, come here.
Come here...

421
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:13,696
All right. All right.

422
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,959
Okay. Hey, Martin, come on.

423
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:28,015
We're out of time!

424
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,106
Come here, Martin...

425
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,150
Let go, Martin!

426
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:37,851
My blood is your blood now.

427
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,030
Martin?

428
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,163
The fuck?

429
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:38,564
Okay... okay...

430
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:46,963
What the...

431
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,578
Hey, hey. Hey.

432
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,502
What...

433
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,577
I'm, um...

434
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,100
I'm making some tea.

435
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,981
Uh, hi.

436
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,940
Oh, hi.

437
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:54,074
Uh, what are you doin'?

438
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,033
My mom always says
that food cures all ills,

439
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,165
so, I don't know.

440
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:00,863
Tea.

441
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,213
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I don't know.

442
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:05,346
It's not like a cheese platter
is gonna fix anything, right?

443
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,869
Well, I'd be pretty impressed

444
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,132
if you whipped out a cheese
platter all of a sudden.

445
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:18,141
You, um...

446
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,014
You doing all right?

447
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:23,059
That's...

448
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,540
That's a pretty hard question
to answer right now.

449
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,020
Yeah.

450
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:31,851
Yeah.

451
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,158
Uh, what about you? Is that...

452
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,031
Is that really...

453
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:41,164
Yeah.

454
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,863
Yeah.

455
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,607
Wow.

456
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,048
Yeah.

457
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,183
You should probably
get back out there.

458
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:03,056
She's gonna need you,

459
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:07,582
and it's a long time
until sunrise, so.

460
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:08,888
Yeah.

461
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,722
- I got it.
- Yeah.

462
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,995
Maybe they
weren't screams, maybe...

463
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,126
We're in the middle
of the woods.

464
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,911
Maybe it was a coyote
or something.

465
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,608
No, it's not an animal, Kelly.

466
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,827
You don't know that.

467
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:36,132
I grew up on a fucking farm.

468
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,917
I know what
an animal sounds like.

469
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,309
Well, maybe it's
a prank or something!

470
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,094
- I don't know, Brian.
- Okay.

471
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:43,966
Look, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have snapped.

472
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:49,189
Hey, it's an adventure, right?

473
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,365
Right? Look, maybe...
Maybe this is just gonna be

474
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:54,107
like one of those, I don't know,

475
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,109
crazy stories that
we just tell at parties,

476
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,241
and it'll be fun and it'll...

477
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,767
Hello?

478
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,116
Is anyone in there?

479
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:06,336
Please, help us.
We were on a bus.

480
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,122
We took a detour through town,
but we stopped and...

481
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,908
- Hello?
- What the hell?

482
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,301
- Don't go. Don't go, baby.
- I don't wanna die here.

483
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,651
- We need help, please.
- We've gotta help them out!

484
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,174
Wait...

485
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,785
I'll be fine.

486
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:21,961
Please help us.

487
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,137
Please.

488
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,979
Oh, thank God,
we heard the screaming.

489
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,155
You picked a bad spot.

490
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:25,562
Gus! God dammit, slow down!

491
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,132
Oh God. Fuck.

492
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,443
Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. This...

493
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,194
The boy. The...

494
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,153
The one who told you
to wait in the tunnels.

495
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,416
He's my friend.

496
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,028
For a long time he went away,

497
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,030
but now he's back.

498
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:52,519
How long have you been here?

499
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,260
Oh, it's been a while.

500
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:00,527
How did you get here?

501
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,965
I don't like to talk about that.

502
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,015
Oh, wow!

503
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,408
I found them.

504
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,108
Look.

505
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,371
Yeah.

506
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,201
Chocolate chip.

507
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,993
If you don't want them,
you don't have to have...

508
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,430
No, no, I... I like chocolate.

509
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:42,090
Thank you.

510
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,053
I used to have more snacks...

511
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,404
but there haven't been
many new people

512
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:54,363
come through here
in the last few months.

513
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:58,585
Is that where you
get all this stuff?

514
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,110
Some of it.

515
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,373
I mean,
some of it was here already.

516
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,985
Some of it belonged to my...

517
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,165
To who?

518
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,258
Who did you come here with?

519
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:23,566
My mother.

520
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,395
She was nice.

521
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:35,187
Mm, I think...
I think I have some pretzels,

522
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,449
'cause these are stale.

523
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:56,556
- What the...
- Boyd?

524
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,688
- What are you doing out here?
- Get in! Hurry!

525
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:01,343
- They'll see you!
- Okay. It's okay.

526
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:02,301
Don't worry.

527
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,302
Look.

528
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,173
- Oh, my God!
- We're okay.

529
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,175
- We're okay.
- Help!

530
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:10,135
Help me!

531
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:11,701
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Stop!

532
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,573
Please!

533
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:16,141
I said stop! Stop!

534
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:20,536
- Hey!
- They're killing people!

535
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:21,755
- We need to close the door!
- They're coming, they're coming!

536
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:23,148
- You need to run!
- Please!

537
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:24,453
- Fuck! Come on!
- Please!

538
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:26,586
- You need to get inside.
- Get in here! Come on.

539
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:28,718
- Come on, come on!
- Run, run, run!

540
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:29,676
- Come on!
- You need to get inside.

541
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:31,199
Come, on, run, run, run!

542
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,722
- Let's go! Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Run, run, run!

543
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:33,723
We need to close the door!

544
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,116
Hurry up!

545
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:36,291
Come on, come on. Hurry up!

546
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,076
- Move, move, move!
- Move, move, move!

547
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:39,468
- Move!
- Close the door!

548
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,298
Here.

549
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,126
Okay.

550
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,042
I'm sorry, I should've
stayed at the diner.

551
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:49,261
I was scared.

552
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,612
- Who are you?
- What?

553
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,658
I asked you a goddamn question!

554
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:57,095
Elgin.

555
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,184
My name's Elgin.

556
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,402
I was on the bus!

557
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:01,664
On the what?

558
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:04,145
What... What is he talking about?

559
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,451
What... What bus?

560
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:17,158
It really hurts.

561
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:20,683
You're doing great, man.
Just... just hang in there.

562
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:24,818
Just try to breathe, okay?

563
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:26,602
We're gonna get out
of here before you know it.

564
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,259
Hey, Brick.

565
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,392
You like pancakes?

566
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,308
Yeah.

567
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:38,179
When the sun comes up,
you're gonna have the best

568
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,399
goddamn pancakes you ever had.

569
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:43,706
Come on now.

570
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:46,231
You think this skinny
little fucker eats pancakes?

571
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:50,496
Ow, fuck, that hurts.

572
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:53,716
You know,
pancakes sound pretty...

573
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,330
Ah, shit.

574
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,766
Shit.

575
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:03,291
Brick, Brick,
you gotta shut the fuck up, man.

576
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,511
I know it hurts but keep quiet.

577
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,817
Breathe it out.

578
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,732
Nice and easy.

579
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:12,300
Tom.

580
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,606
You gotta cover his mouth, man.

581
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,742
I can't get to him!

582
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,376
Tom, what's happening?

583
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,553
Talk to me, man. What is it?

584
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:50,817
I think he's fucking dead.

585
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:03,743
No, no, no! No! Get off! Jim!

586
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:07,790
Get off me!

587
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,452
Julie, Julie, no! Julie, no!

588
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,497
No, we have to go out there!

589
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:19,802
- No!
- Please! We have to help!

590
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:20,803
We can't. Julie, no!

591
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:23,415
Julie! Julie!

592
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,895
But they found him!
We have to help him, please!

593
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:27,245
It's okay.

594
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,248
I can't...

595
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,293
I can't...

596
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,425
It's okay.

597
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:38,560
It's okay.

598
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:42,825
I can't... I can't...

599
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:45,306
It'll be all right.

600
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,830
It'll be all right.

601
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:54,402
Please.

602
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,439
I don't trust him.

603
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,923
Look, we're still alive.

604
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:42,581
For now.

605
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,543
Tabitha.

606
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,720
How you holding up?

607
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,594
I'm fine.

608
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,948
You know,

609
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,429
I've probably passed
this truck about a dozen times,

610
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,606
and I didn't reali...
Did you do all this?

611
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,609
I thought you were on a journey.

612
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:14,961
I was.

613
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:18,791
Did you find what
you were looking for?

614
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,796
What are you drawing?

615
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:30,977
Things I've seen.

616
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,416
It's good to draw them
when you see them...

617
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:40,508
so even if you forget,
the pictures remember.

618
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,080
I thought they were dreams,

619
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,690
all those things...

620
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,477
but the pictures remembered.

621
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,982

We're gonna get you out.

656
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,659
Son of a bitch. Oh!

657
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,009
He's alive!
Everybody, get out here!

658
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,185
- Everybody help out, come on!
- Let's dig him out!

659
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:17,578
Grab anything you can!

660
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:18,884
Come on, let's go.

661
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:20,712
- Hurry!
- We'll get you outta there.

662
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:23,018
Careful! Careful, easy! Easy!

663
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:25,717
Move this out of
the way! This is blocking...

664
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:27,719
Come on, get over here!

665
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:29,851
Lend a hand!
We're gonna get you outta there!

666
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:50,611
Oh...

667
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:35,047
Okay.

668
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:36,875
Yeah.

669
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:37,919
Hey, kid.

670
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,573
How many people did you say?

671
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:40,313
I don't know.

672
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:43,882
Maybe 20, 25.

673
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:47,799
The lady with the shotgun,

674
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,278
she was trying to get people
to stay in the diner,

675
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:50,453
but once the house collapsed...

676
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:52,107
No, no, no. What do you mean?

677
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:53,892
What do you mean it collapsed?
Which house collapsed?

678
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:56,242
The, uh,
the one next to the diner.

679
00:43:56,372 --> 00:43:58,200
Oh my God!

680
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:00,638
Oh my God, wh-which... town...
Which way to town!?

681
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:04,163
Tabitha, it's that way!
Tabitha, you...

682
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:30,102
Close it. Let's go.

683
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,845
Victor, close it!

684
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:34,715
Come on.

685
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:42,984
Tabitha?
