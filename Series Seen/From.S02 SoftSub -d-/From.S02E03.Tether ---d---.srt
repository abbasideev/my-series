<i>Previously on</i> From...

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,490
We have to get inside!
We'll be safe in there.

3
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:13,970
I'll be right behind you.

4
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:17,756
Fuck!

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,410
Why were you
screaming like that?

6
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,282
I had a really bad dream.

7
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,066
Your mom needs you, okay?

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,415
Go and get help.

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,640
Dad!

10
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:33,076
Julie!

11
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,340
- No!
- Stop!

12
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:39,039
- Get inside!
- We can't just leave them!

13
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:40,910
This bitch blew out our ride
home with a fucking shotgun!

14
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:43,260
You have no idea
what you're doing.

15
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:45,219
This whole time
you've been less than

16
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:48,526
two hours away
with these people.

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,833
It isn't what you think.

18
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:53,140
Stop fucking smiling!

19
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,577
You'll feel better
if you come outside.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,318
I can't fucking
do this anymore.

21
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,971
I know.

22
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:02,018
You shouldn't be doing this.
Victor wouldn't like it.

23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,108
Every time I see something
really weird, I see this.

24
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:06,240
This symbol.

25
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:08,024
It's not safe here.

26
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,547
This is where they sleep.

27
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,512
Come on, Victor.
Go, Victor, go!

28
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,297
Maybe this is just gonna be like
one of those crazy stories

29
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,560
that we just tell at parties,
and it'll be fun and--

30
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:24,910
Is anyone in there?

31
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,913
Please help us.
We were on a bus.

32
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:31,178
You ever wonder
if Abby was right?

33
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,527
What if it's all just a dream?

34
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,532
Ah!

35
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,751
My blood is your blood now.

36
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,020
What do you mean it collapsed?
Which house collapsed?

37
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:49,239
The one next to the diner.

38
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,980
- Oh my God!
- Tabitha!

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,285
So, she pushed you
into a tree, and then you...

40
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:38,201
I-- Then I was
someplace else.

41
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,378
So you, like--

42
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,641
So, you're saying you,
like, teleported?

43
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:47,210
No, I... Maybe.
I don't know.

44
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,386
When you say it like that,
it sounds frickin' crazy.

45
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,129
Dad, where is Sara?

46
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,349
I don't know.

47
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,133
She said she was gonna
be right behind me.

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,265
So, do you think she's alive?

49
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,092
I don't know.

50
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:02,747
Okay, look, I need you to really
just take me through this, okay?

51
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,142
Look, you went through
a tree and then what?

52
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,753
Then I was back here.

53
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,365
How?

54
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,105
I got lucky.
I found my way. I-I--

55
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,933
No, look, look,
if you don't wanna tell me,

56
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:16,892
just say that you
don't wanna tell me.

57
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,763
- Hey.
- No, no. Dad. Dad.

58
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,852
You said that
you were gonna find answers.

59
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,506
You said you were
gonna go out there

60
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,291
and find answers
or find a way home!

61
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:25,770
That's what you said!

62
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,598
And now we're exactly
where we fucking started!

63
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

64
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,036
Hey, what's going on here?

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,735
Ellis, hey.
Talk to me.

66
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,302
What--
What happened?

67
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:39,523
What's happening, son?

68
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:49,664
Fatima. She, um...

69
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:53,798
Look, last night
it got bad.

70
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:54,930
Dad, it got really bad.

71
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,675
Yeah, I, I feel like
the people that make it here,

72
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:01,806
it's because they...

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,682
There's a part of themselves
that they hold on to.

74
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,379
Right.

75
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:13,035
And... I just think, you know...

76
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:17,300
Look, last night
I feel like I saw

77
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:21,435
that piece of her...
start to slip away.

78
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,002
I got it. Okay.

79
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,092
Hey, hey.
Look at me.

80
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,356
Look at me.

81
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,274
Then it has
to be you, okay?

82
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:38,147
You have to be that piece of her
that this place can't take away.

83
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,671
That's how
we get through this. Okay?

84
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,369
Even if we lose our way,

85
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:45,546
we hold on to each other
and we keep trying.

86
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,157
'Til we get home.

87
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,029
'Til we get home.

88
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:52,030
That's right.

89
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,730
This place
will not win.

90
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:56,731
You understand me?

91
00:04:58,689 --> 00:04:59,864
Good.

92
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,563
Come here. Come.

93
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,569
Alright.

94
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,008
- Okay.
- Um...

95
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,228
I'm gonna go give
Kenny a hand

96
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,752
checking on
the animal traps and--

97
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,928
Let somebody else do that.

98
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,277
Go see Fatima.

99
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,279
Well, I--

100
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,542
You know, I figured while
I was out there I could, uh,

101
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,588
pick her some of those
wildflowers she likes.

102
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:30,025
- Good. Good. Good man.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:32,070
Hey, you know what?
You should, uh,

104
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,811
think about getting
her a new ring.

105
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,205
That little wire doo-dad, I--

106
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:38,816
Hey, you're better
than that.

107
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,427
Right?

108
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,213
I'm glad you're back, Dad.

109
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,694
Yeah.

- You're okay.
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.

136
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,055
I'm just gonna
clip it here, okay?

137
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,013
Good.

138
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,496
Alright.
Just try to keep it dry, okay?

139
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,236
Yeah.

140
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,282
We can take them out in
probably a week or two, alright?

141
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,370
So, we're done here, then?

142
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,893
Ah, you have...

143
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,896
...three cracked ribs
and probably a bruised lung.

144
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,246
I wouldn't exactly
call that fine, okay?

145
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,683
You okay, Dad?

146
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,815
Yeah, buddy.

147
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,426
Just catching my breath,
that's all.

148
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,950
How you doing?

149
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:38,605
I... heard you had
a pretty rough night too.

150
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:41,433
She was on a quest with Victor.

151
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:42,434
I'm okay.

152
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,486
Um, look, bottom line is,
you got really lucky.

153
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,444
So just don't do anything
to make it worse, okay?

154
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,489
Alright.

155
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,708
I'll check back on you in a bit.

156
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,100
- Alright.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,066
Kids, can you give me
and your mom a second?

158
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,241
Yeah. Of course.

159
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:15,163
Donna said we could
stay at the Colony House,

160
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,165
but there's no way in hell
I'm taking the kids--

161
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,122
Tabby.

162
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:24,215
Hey. Hey. Hey.

163
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,436
I thought you were dead.

164
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,742
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,308
- I thought--
- I know. I'm so sorry.

166
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,266
I'm so sorry.

167
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,441
I can't lose you.

168
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:34,443
No, no, no.

169
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,234
Jim...

170
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,237
the wires aren't
connected to anything.

171
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,804
What?

172
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,719
Yeah, they were just
dangling from the ceiling.

173
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,680
How'd there be any electricity

174
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,116
if the wires
aren't connected?

175
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,858
Tabitha, we have
so much to talk about.

176
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,384
How are the kids holding up?

177
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:06,910
I don't know.

178
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,829
I think I'm gonna
take them to the diner

179
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:16,354
to see if I can get some food.
I don't know when they've eaten.

180
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,312
I love you.

181
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,530
I love you too.

182
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,061
You are not
listening to me.

183
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,498
No, I'm listening,
and I'm telling you to fuck off.

184
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,065
You think after
what happened last night

185
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,370
I'm just gonna trust you people?

186
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:33,937
That is not gonna
do any good against

187
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,460
those things
that come out at night!

188
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,724
All you're gonna do is
make everyone here nervous.

189
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,813
No, but it's okay for you to
start shooting out fuckin' tires

190
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:42,163
though, right? Because that made
people real fuckin' calm!

191
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:43,599
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You are a f--

192
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,602
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey, hey, Donna.

193
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,909
What's-- What's goin' on here?
What's goin' on, Donna?

194
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:49,997
Who the fuck are you?

195
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,174
Boyd Stevens.

196
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,219
I'm the sheriff.

197
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,960
I thought the Asian guy
was the sheriff.

198
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:00,529
We're just having a little
disagreement about firearms.

199
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,226
Residents don't carry guns.

200
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,314
That's the rule.

201
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,707
And whose rule
is that?

202
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:05,708
Mine.

203
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:09,669
Well, uh, rules change.

204
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:11,758
No, no, no.

205
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,455
Got it, hold, hold up.

206
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,892
Look. I understand.

207
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:19,374
I understand this is
all pretty scary, right?

208
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,593
But I've had
a strange fuckin' week,

209
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,508
so I'm a little less
patient than normal.

210
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,381
You don't like the rules. Great.

211
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,731
You take your rifle,
you go live out in the woods,

212
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,341
and make whatever
rules you like.

213
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,342
See how long you last.

214
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:33,475
Now, now.

215
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:36,130
You want a roof over your head
at night when those things

216
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:40,395
come out to hunt, then you put
the fucking rifle down

217
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:41,701
and you listen to the lady.

218
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,362
That's a good choice.

219
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,624
Mm.

220
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:53,625
Mm-hm.

221
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,065
Listen.

222
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:04,114
We're all... gonna have

223
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,291
the time to talk, okay?
Answer all your questions.

224
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,772
- Just know...
- Asshole.

225
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,427
...that we are all
in this thing together,

226
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,953
and the only way to get
through this is together.

227
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,783
Take 'em to the house.

228
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:24,047
Go. Go.

229
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,452
Do you want more?

230
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:39,280
- No, that's good.
- Okay, come on.

231
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,987
Okey-dokey. Here.

232
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,862
Honey, you need
to eat something.

233
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,212
I'm not hungry.

234
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,823
Have this, Jules.

235
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:01,824
Really good.

236
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,089
Can we go see Victor?

237
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,571
Mom?

238
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:10,877
Yeah?

239
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,269
Can we go see Victor?

240
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,749
No, honey, not now.

241
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,273
He's been through
a rough few days.

242
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,407
I hope
he's not mad at me.

243
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,844
Why would he
be mad at you?

244
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,586
Me and Jade
were in his room.

245
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,284
He said he was looking for
clues about how to get home.

246
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,026
I told him Victor
wouldn't like it.

247
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,077
Are we gonna be able
to get our stuff back?

248
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,993
Norman's down there.

249
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,821
I don't know, honey.

250
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:43,866
Eat your food, okay?

251
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,348
Where are you going?

252
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,176
I'll be right back.

253
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,832
Can I-- Can I talk
to you for a second?

254
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,312
Yeah.

255
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,237
You like tea?

256
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,412
Oh, no, no.

257
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,240
Thank you. I'm okay.

258
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,198
Um...

259
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,986
I know you oversee
a lot of the supplies in town,

260
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,208
and I was wondering if maybe
I could go through the storage?

261
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,211
Everything we had
was in that house.

262
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,693
We don't have any supplies
or clothing or--

263
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,309
You come stay our house.

264
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,485
Okay?

265
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:40,140
Mothers help together.

266
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,275
Thank you.

267
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,973
Thank you so much.

268
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,453
Ya hear about Kristi's fiancée?

269
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:50,759
I did.

270
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,589
Not sure that's
ever happened before.

271
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:57,722
So, uh, you know,
what are supplies looking like?

272
00:14:58,767 --> 00:14:59,899
Not good.

273
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,076
Storm wiped out half our crop.

274
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,252
We're gonna have to get
real serious about rations

275
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,383
with all of the new people.

276
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,172
Driver said
there were 25 aboard.

277
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,087
What with the folks in the diner

278
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,697
and the bodies
we found this morning,

279
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,786
we're accounting
for about 22.

280
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:26,838
Busload of terrified people,
and I fire a fuckin' shotgun.

281
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,321
You were gonna lose
people no matter what,

282
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,281
so let's... focus on
the ones you saved.

283
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,374
You gonna tell me
what happened out there?

284
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,335
Hey, I got another one.

285
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:58,392
Okay.

286
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,135
Oh, fuck.

287
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,266
Fuck.

288
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,790
Shit.

289
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,923
Can we salvage
that one?

290
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,144
No, there's, um...
I can't find the...

291
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,800
Can you stop with the flowers,
please, and just help?

292
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,550
Listen, man, I, uh...
I get that you're probably

293
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,726
all bent out of shape
about the whole Kristi thing.

294
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,036
Never mind.

295
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,038
It's fine. Uh...

296
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:40,651
Look, there's a-- there's a--
there's a rod that helps

297
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,262
prop up the traps.

298
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:43,611
I just-- I don't...

299
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:44,742
Okay, um--

300
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,222
I must've put the--

301
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,355
<i>♪ Wake up, little Susie,
wake up♪</i>

302
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,620
<i>♪ Wake up, little Susie,
wake up♪</i>

303
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:53,751
What the hell is that?

304
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,930
<i>♪ Wake up,
little Susie and weep♪</i>

305
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,411
<i>♪ The movie's over,

306
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,587

307
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,373
- <i>♪ Wake up, little Susie ♪</i>

308
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,028
<i>♪ Wake up, little Susie ♪</i>

309
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,466
<i>♪ Well, what are we

310
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,772
<i>♪ What are we gonna... ♪</i>

311
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,430
Okay, um, we have to bring
her back into town to bury her.

312
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:23,216
How--
Why would they do that and--

313
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,001
Just put the goddamn
flowers down and help me.

314
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:30,875
Right, she's, um,
look, she's--

315
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,355
she's pinned to the tree,
so I...

316
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,190
Get Kristi.

317
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,671
Now.

318
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:44,976
Yeah.

319
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,977
Go!

320
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:49,372
Help me.

321
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,681
Please help me.

322
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,422
Yeah, it's okay.

323
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,379
It's okay.

324
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,054
No, no.

325
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,099
No, no, no, no, no--

326
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,317
I'm glad you're okay.

327
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,710
What?

328
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:24,190
I said I'm glad you're okay.

329
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,105
We lost so many people,
I was worried that--

330
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,324
- Who was in my room?
- Sorry?

331
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,457
Someone was in my room,
and they took something.

332
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,720
Oh, um, I think I saw Jade
and the Matthews boy

333
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:35,288
up here last night. But--

334
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:36,376
Excuse me.

335
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,802
What? What?!

336
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,589
What?!

337
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,852
Oh, you're back.
Holy shit.

338
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:19,070
This is great. This is great.

339
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,071
That's mine.

340
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,684
- Ah.
- Give it back to me.

341
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,294
- Yeah. Uh--
- Give it back to me.

342
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,122
- I'm sorry, alright.
- Give it back to me.

343
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,211
I was just thinking I could
just play it for a little bit--

344
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,170
- Give it back to me!
- Okay! Alright.

345
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,606
Calm down, man. Here.

346
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,393
That's my room!

347
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,223
You don't go in my room!

348
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,181
Okay.

349
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:44,835
Wait! Oh, hold on.

350
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,057
Hey! Slow down! I'm sorry.

351
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,928
Okay? I shouldn't have gone
in your room.

352
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,234
I thought you were fucking dead.

353
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,932
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

354
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,327
There's this symbol
that I keep seeing.

355
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,373
I mean, I keep seeing things
that aren't actually there,

356
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,070
but every time I do,
there's this symbol,

357
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,159
and there's this book
that Kenny's mom gave me.

358
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,683
Some guy kept drawing the same
symbol and there's a picture.

359
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,424
Would you please
just fucking stop!

360
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,650
Look at this. Look at this.

361
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,956
There's gotta be a reason
I'm seeing this everywhere.

362
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,393
This guy.

363
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:25,441
He must've been
seeing it too. Right?

364
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,965
And look, right there.

365
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,619
Right in the back.

366
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,665
That's you, right?

367
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:36,060
Maybe in some fucked-up way,

368
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,846
this could be the key to
getting the hell out of here.

369
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,893
I mean, Jesus, all this time.

370
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:45,896
Don't you wanna go home?

371
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,729
You shouldn't have touched this.

372
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,428
It's not yours.
Stay away from me!

373
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,388
Well, fuck you too!

374
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:04,175
Wait, uh-- Fuck.

375
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:18,668
Yeah, the paint got
a little faded.

376
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,718
First few weeks I was here,
I carried it everywhere I went.

377
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,807
I held it when I slept.

378
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,027
Sweaty palms, I guess.

379
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,384
I, um... I like the blonde.

380
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:40,864
It's a cute look.

381
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:52,572
I, uh... I know
all this is a lot.

382
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:58,142
But we can get
through this together.

383
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,883
Hey, sorry--I--

384
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:03,060
No, it's okay.
It's fine. I just...

385
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,105
Maybe, um...

386
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:09,719
Maybe I should stay with
the others from the bus.

387
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,550
People died last night,

388
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,510
and that's the rock I painted
for you sitting there

389
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,947
like it was on
your nightstand at home,

390
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,473
and... you're just
acting like everything's...

391
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,128
I just need...

392
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:30,871
I just need some time.

393
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:32,394
Kristi!

394
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:35,266
Are you in here?
It's an emergency!

395
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,920
Uh, coming.

396
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:39,140
Kristi! Yeah, great.

397
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,750
- What?
- We need your help.

398
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:41,882
- Okay.
- Now.

399
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:43,318
- What's going on?
- I gotta go.

400
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,059
I promise we'll talk
as soon as I'm back, okay?

401
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,234
- No--
- Just-- I love you.

402
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,105
Don't do anything
until I leave.

403
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,803
- Kristi--
- I gotta go.

404
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:50,891
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,114
It doesn't hurt.

406
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,770
That's weird, right?

407
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:01,902
Why doesn't it hurt?

408
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:06,907
Are you still there?

409
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:09,475
Yeah.

410
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,738
Yeah. I'm still here.

411
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,654
What's your name?

412
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,831
I'm Ellis.

413
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,008
Cool name.

414
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:23,663
I'm Kelly.

415
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:24,838
Hi. Hi, Kelly.

416
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,669
Um...

417
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:31,061
where are we?

418
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,325
We're, uh...

419
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,632
We're in the woods.

420
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:37,938
Just outside town.

421
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:40,419
The woods.

422
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:42,682
How?

423
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,122
Oh, God.

424
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,299
We were in the bar.

425
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:01,135
These people came in. They...

426
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,534
Brian was screaming.

427
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,840
It's okay. It's okay.

428
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,538
No. No.

429
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:15,105
No, you don't understand.
They--

430
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,455
They dragged us out. They...

431
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,720
made me watch.

432
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,205
They said they wanted to...
play with me.

433
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:30,904
What-- What the f--

434
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:32,427
Hey, hey.

435
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,777
'Kay, uh, the doctor's here.

436
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:38,346
She's gonna take
care of you, okay?

437
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:39,478
Hi.

438
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,959
I'm Kristi.

439
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,744
I'm just gonna take
a look at you, okay?

440
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:45,832
Okay.

441
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:49,183
Is it bad?

442
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,315
It's bad.

443
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,752
- Oh, God.
- Hey.

444
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:53,796
It's bad.

445
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,059
Hey.
Take my hand.

446
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,192
Squeeze it as hard
as you like.

447
00:24:58,235 --> 00:24:59,759
And I'm gonna
take a look, okay?

448
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:02,718
Squeeze. Squeeze.

449
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:03,676
Good.

450
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,878
Oh, am I
interrupting something?

451
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,011
I was looking
for the doctor.

452
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,579
I think her name
is Kristi.

453
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,406
Uh...

454
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,844
She had to run out.

455
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:28,021
Can I, uh...
Can I help you with something?

456
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:32,765
You're the fella that
got stuck under the house.

457
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:35,028
Yeah.

458
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:38,248
That boy from the bus
that got stuck with you?

459
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:41,338
He sat across
the aisle from me.

460
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:47,344
I'll let you get back to...

461
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,479
Where were you headed?

462
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,135
You were on a bus.

463
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:58,486
Where were you going?

464
00:26:58,529 --> 00:26:59,443
Oh.

465
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,926
The racetrack.

466
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,189
I was gonna bet on the ponies.

467
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:09,279
I've been visiting racetracks
all across the country.

468
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,238
Was it a charter bus?

469
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,936
Uh, I don't know.
It was a bus.

470
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,939
It had wheels and a door
and tickets you had to buy.

471
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:18,288
What's in the bag?

472
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,203
Oh.

473
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:22,945
You ask a lot of questions.

474
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:25,861
I just have one more.

475
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:31,084
Uh, we need
a little help in here!

476
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,175
Hey.

477
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:36,567
Hey, you're supposed
to be in bed.

478
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,570
Who the hell are you?

479
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:42,312
My name's Marielle.
I'm a nurse.

480
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:43,705
Let's get you
off the floor, okay?

481
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:44,837
- Yeah.
- Come on.

482
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,536
Okay, there we go.

483
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,539
Little sore.

484
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:52,975
'Kay, I'm gonna see
if I can find you

485
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,977
an aspirin or something.
Excuse me.

486
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,066
- I'll stay with him.
- Thank you.

487
00:27:58,546 --> 00:27:59,852
You okay?

488
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,854
Oh.

489
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,858
Can you imagine?

490
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,860
Showing up in a place like this

491
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,297
to find out that
your fiancée is here?

492
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,473
What did you say?

493
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:16,259
Well, Kristi and Marielle.

494
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,826
They're engaged.

495
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,266
You're my what?

496
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,920
Your proxy.

497
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,227
It's uh, something we normally
do on the first night,

498
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,490
but things happened a little
differently this time.

499
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:33,494
So, if you have any questions
or if there's anything I can do

500
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,061
to make things a little--

501
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:37,759
How long have you been here?

502
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:40,936
Uh, just had
my one-year anniversary.

503
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,459
It was, um--

504
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,290
You good?

505
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:51,338
Is there water nearby?

506
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:54,341
Like a...
a lake or a pond?

507
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:59,215
Uh, yeah, I mean,
we have this place called

508
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,478
the Brundles not far from here.

509
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:02,915
Can I see it?

510
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,525
Here it is.

511
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,050
Closest thing to
normal fun we have here.

512
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,750
Why do they
call it the Brundles?

513
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,580
Uh, it was just called
that when I got here.

514
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,366
How did you know about--

515
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:20,410
I saw it.

516
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,328
Were you the one on
the bus that had the dream?

517
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,944
Yeah, those happen sometimes.

518
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:35,077
People have all sorts of
strange reactions to this place.

519
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:40,953
Dreams, nightmares,
weird premonitions.

520
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,825
But we don't know why
or what it means.

521
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,437
Why it happens to some people
and not to others.

522
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,963
This one girl, Nadia,
she used to say that it was

523
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,835
like this place was
calling out to us,

524
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,837
but only some of us were
listening closely enough

525
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:56,838
to hear it.

526
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,536
But has anyone--

527
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,929
Yes.

528
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:04,541
People have obsessed
over these things.

529
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:07,327
They've compared
and picked it apart.

530
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,069
It didn't tell us anything
we didn't already know.

531
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,287
Which is what?

532
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,465
That we're stuck.

533
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,555
And nobody can tell us why.

534
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:26,737
So?

535
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,565
Well, I mean,
even if we were in a hospital,

536
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,830
this would be at least
a 15-hour operation.

537
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,529
But she's talking.

538
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:37,879
I mean, she's literally
sitting there and talking.

539
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,315
Yeah, I know.

540
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,579
But, uh, how long
can she be here?

541
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:47,323
Uh, I mean, it could be hours.
It could be days.

542
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,412
I-- She's not
suffering right now,

543
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,371
but I don't know how
long that's gonna last.

544
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,807
Those things,
they'll be back tonight.

545
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,591
Okay, so then we have
to get her out of here.

546
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,028
Look, I don't
think you understand.

547
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,857
I mean, it's a miracle
she's even still alive.

548
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:01,772
So then, what do we do?

549
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,260
How do we, um...

550
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:14,611
How do we do it?

551
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,613
Do you have something
in your bag that might--

552
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,441
No, nothing that
would be strong enough.

553
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:24,926
We have to pull out the rod.

554
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:29,670
Okay. Will it, uh...

555
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,672
Will it be peaceful?

556
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:32,934
I don't know.

557
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,285
Look, there's...

558
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:40,420
there is one more option.

559
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:43,597
No. No.

560
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,688
I'm not having her last moments
be with a gun to her head, okay?

561
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,385
Kristi?

562
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,432
Hey.

563
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:55,870
I'm right here.

564
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:59,482
I'm not okay, am I?

565
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:02,746
No.

566
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:06,794
No, you're not.

567
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,408
Am I gonna die?

568
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,417
Yeah.

569
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,996
These are for Dad.

570
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,173
Mom, this has a huge hole
in it.

571
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:41,785
So? If it fits, it goes.

572
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,744
Oh, just like this one. Perfect.

573
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:50,533
So how come Ethan gets
to spend the afternoon

574
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:52,013
looking through
toys with Mrs. Liu

575
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,580
and I get stuck doing this?

576
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,712
Oh, honey, I'm sorry,
do you want to play with toys?

577
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,193
Come on, Julie.

578
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,890
This is what being
an adult looks like.

579
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:02,545
Hm.

580
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,374
Oh.

581
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,769
Look at this.

582
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:10,205
Try this on.

583
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,557
This is so creepy.

584
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:17,430
All this stuff has
belonged to people who've...

585
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:18,735
What?

586
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,433
It's no different
than a thrift store.

587
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,001
It's a little different.

588
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,046
It fits you. Perfect.

589
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,222
So are we living with
Kenny and his mom now?

590
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:29,181
And Jade?

591
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,878
Well, just for now.

592
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,923
You know, once your dad's
back on his feet,

593
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,012
then we can start look--

594
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,234
Mom?

595
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,496
Mom, what's wrong?

596
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:43,673
What's wrong?

597
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:44,805
Nothing.

598
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:47,068
Mom, what happened
just now?

599
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,591
- What's going on?
- Wait.

600
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,029
I don't know.
Nothing. Let's go home.

601
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,726
- What?
- Let's go home.

602
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:53,944
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

603
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,691
Hey, babe.

604
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:09,308
I'm back a little
sooner than expected.

605
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:13,094
That big swing we talked about?

606
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:17,968
It didn't go quite
the way I'd planned.

607
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,103
But I got some news. Uh...

608
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,063
Somebody's getting married.

609
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:30,459
Maybe you already knew that.

610
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:33,723
Or maybe...

611
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,387
Maybe none of this is real.

612
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,914
Maybe you and Ellis are
sittin' by a hospital bed

613
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:55,528
waiting for me
to open my eyes up.

614
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:58,313
Just open your eyes up! Op--

615
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:00,446
I mean, how could a--

616
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:03,405
How could a man that's
chained to a wall in a place

617
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,668
that's not there
know your name?

618
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,018
How can that be real?

619
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,194
That-- How can--

620
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,943
Mom, what happened back there?

621
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:22,511
Nothing. I'm fine.

622
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:23,512
Mom.

623
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,688
What?! I'm fine.

624
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,908
You know, why don't you
take these upstairs, please.

625
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,431
Mom, talk to me!

626
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,306
Do you know what I spent
the whole night

627
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,743
thinking about in that diner?

628
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:39,485
How I was gonna have to
take care of Ethan by myself,

629
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:41,704
'cause I thought you were dead.

630
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:43,837
And I sat there waiting
for those things to find Dad

631
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,752
and rip him apart.

632
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,146
So don't tell me you're fine,
and don't tell me it's nothing.

633
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:53,673
Yes, I saw something.

634
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:57,677
Something that wasn't there.

635
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:02,290
It's not the first
time that's happened.

636
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,424
What do you mean?

637
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:14,476
After Thomas died,

638
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,871
for months I could
still hear him crying.

639
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:24,530
Sometimes I would
even go into a room,

640
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,792
and I would see him there.

641
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:31,058
Just for a second.
It always felt so peaceful.

642
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,629
Like he was letting me
know he was okay.

643
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:40,328
So that's what
happened just now?

644
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,157
You saw Thomas?

645
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,029
No. No, no.

646
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:49,772
No, this... this was different.

647
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,473
I saw two children

648
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,084
standing in the middle
of the road staring at me.

649
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,479
But this...

650
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:01,436
What?

651
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,355
It didn't feel peaceful.

652
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,230
Is Ellis still there?

653
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,584
Hi.

654
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,283
Yeah, I'm still here.

655
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,635
And, um,
who's the other boy?

656
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,290
Oh, that's, uh...
that's Kenny.

657
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:31,423
He's our deputy.

658
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:32,467
Hi, Kenny.

659
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,382
Hi.

660
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:38,430
You're all so nice.

661
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,956
Um, can you get
my phone, please?

662
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:45,567
I have to call my mom.
I have to tell her--

663
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:48,440
Um, yeah, the, uh,
the phones here,

664
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:50,137
they... they don't really work.

665
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:54,097
But, uh, we can...
we can write you a note.

666
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:57,710
I've got some paper
in-in my bag.

667
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,581
You, uh... you just
tell us what you wanna say,

668
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,148
and we'll write it
down for you, okay?

669
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:03,846
You'll make sure she gets it?

670
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:05,848
Yeah.

671
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:08,982
I guess that'd be okay.

672
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:12,115
Whenever you're ready.

673
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:18,774
Um, tell her, um...

674
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,473
Tell her that I love her.

675
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,175
And I'm sorry
I didn't give her a hug.

676
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,875
Um, she wanted one,
but I was mad when I left so...

677
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,618
It was so stupid.

678
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,969
We had this fight
about Brian, um...

679
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,147
And I...

680
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:47,194
I didn't give her a hug,
so tell her that I'm sorry.

681
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,587
And, um...

682
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:53,679
What is that?

683
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:54,636
Hey.

684
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,073
Kelly, what's wrong?

685
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:58,901
Do you hear that? It's--

686
00:38:58,945 --> 00:38:59,946
Kelly! Hey!

687
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:05,517
Hey, what's happening, Kristi?

688
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,693
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

689
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:09,782
The longer we wait,
the more she'll suffer, okay?

690
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:10,870
Okay. Alright. I'll do it.

691
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,088
It's my job.

692
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:13,176
Hello! Hello?

693
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,441
Hey, hey! I heard screams.

694
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:17,398
She's--

695
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,924
She's from the bus.

696
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,622
They left her like that.

697
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:28,409
Kristi. Kenny. Come.

698
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:29,367
Come.

699
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:31,891
You all go back
to town now, okay?

700
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,109
What?

701
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:34,546
You don't need to
be here for this.

702
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:37,418
- All due respect, Sheriff--
- Kristi, I'm not asking.

703
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:38,941
I'm not leaving, okay?

704
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:47,559
Alright, alright, alright.
What's her name?

705
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:48,995
- What's her name?
- It's Kelly.

706
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,562
Hey, Kelly?

707
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:51,824
I can't!

708
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,087
I'm so-- No!

709
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,262
Okay.

710
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:56,306
You squeeze
my hand, okay?

711
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,265
Alright.

712
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:03,096
Okay, Kelly, just squeeze.

713
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:04,706
Good.

714
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,882
Keep squeezing.

715
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:23,943
Marielle?

716
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:31,951
Hey.
Everything okay?

717
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:33,866
Please stay.

718
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:36,521
Kristi.

719
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,872
Baby, what--

720
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,830
I just need
you to stay.

721
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:42,831
Baby, what--

722
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,007
I just need you to stay.

723
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:46,487
Hey.

724
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:47,488
Hey.

725
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:48,446
Come here.

726
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,057
Come here.

727
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,847
Hey, it's okay.

728
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,994
I'm gonna...

729
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,604
I'm gonna head
over to the church.

730
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:19,041
I told Donna I'd look
through the stuff

731
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:20,565
that Father Khatri had,

732
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,871
see if there's something
we can read at the service.

733
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:23,916
- Yeah.
- So.

734
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,440
Kenny.

735
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:29,617
Yeah?

736
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:33,099
It's those things.

737
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:36,363
They did this.

738
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:03,259
Hey.

739
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:05,871
Hey.

740
00:42:05,914 --> 00:42:08,613
I've, uh,
been looking for you.

741
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:10,440
Sorry, I was just, um...

742
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,714
Promise me it won't
always be this way.

743
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:28,284
You can lie if you have to.
Just please...

744
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:32,201
promise me.

745
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:38,860
Let's get married.

746
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:41,210
What?

747
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:44,605
Look, I know that
we said we'd wait,

748
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:47,477
and, you know, that we'd
do it when we got back home,

749
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:50,785
but I... you know what?
I don't wanna wait.

750
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:53,614
I don't wanna let this place
be the thing that decides

751
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,007
when we get to be happy.

752
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:58,445
So let's do it.

753
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,579
Let's get married.

754
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,150
Okay.

755
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:09,282
Okay?

756
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,636
We're getting married.

757
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,640
Okay! Okay.

758
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:23,818
We're getting--
We're getting married!

759
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:32,958
Hey.
Is that from Ms. Liu?

760
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:35,221
It was in
the storage closet.

761
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:37,702
She said I could have it.

762
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:38,833
It's a puzzle.

763
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,619
It's so cool.

764
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:47,755
Um, I want to talk to
you about something.

765
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:48,800
Um...

766
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:54,240
I know how much you like
to see everything like a--

767
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:56,808
like a challenge or a quest.

768
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:58,287
But I just wanted
you to realize--

769
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:00,246
I know it's dangerous here.

770
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:02,509
I know it's not like things
are all just make-believe,

771
00:44:02,552 --> 00:44:04,380
and I promise I'll be careful.

772
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:08,036
Good.

773
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:13,651
Hey.

774
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:17,480
I think I got it.

775
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,268
Cool, huh?

776
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:35,629
- Oh, my God. Stand up.
- What's wrong?

777
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,239
- Stand up right now. Right now.
- What's wrong?

778
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:39,067
Let's go. Get in.

779
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:41,548
Get in, get in, get in.

780
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:51,210
Oh, fuck!

781
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:53,691
Fuck!

782
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:02,221
- Hey.
- Hey.

783
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:08,227
Looks like you're
having a shit day too.

784
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,229
Yeah.

785
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,496
There was this, uh, girl
from the bus out in the forest.

786
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:18,454
Kelly.

787
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:20,108
Those things
dragged her out there,

788
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:24,156
and, uh, they took a metal
rod from one of the traps.

789
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,507
They stuck it right in
her head and into a tree.

790
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:29,727
Kid was still alive.

791
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,078
- Did you have to--
- Yeah.

792
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,429
I'm sorry, Boyd.

793
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:39,998
Ellis said she was traveling
with her boyfriend, Brian?

794
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:42,783
Those things got him.

795
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:48,484
Said they... made her watch
what they did to him.

796
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,966
Jesus Christ.

797
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,883
Funny thing, though.

798
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:57,798
My first tour in Iraq,
I was, uh...

799
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:03,151
I was driving with
a few guys from my unit

800
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:05,763
back to our command center.

801
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,982
We drove over an IED.

802
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,898
Standard-issue jeep.

803
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:13,596
The fucking thing
blew right through it.

804
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,817
First two guys,
dead on impact,

805
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:18,688
but there was
this kid from Wisconsin,

806
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:20,778
we used to call him Smuckers

807
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,868
'cause the kid
fucking loved jelly.

808
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:28,437
Anyway, the shrapnel
from the IED, right,

809
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:31,266
ripped right through.

810
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:37,795
He died in my arms.

811
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:41,755
He was crying.

812
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:44,279
Begging.

813
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,589
First time I ever
watched someone die.

814
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,638
Corporal Brian Kelly.

815
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:00,905
How about that?

816
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:05,039
That's a... that's a pretty
big fucking coincidence,

817
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,172
don't you think?

818
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:09,087
Brian Kelly. J--

819
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,740
Boyd, that's--

820
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:14,919
No, no, no. I killed a kid,
and instead of mourning,

821
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:18,618
I'm standing here trying to
figure out how any of this

822
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,185
shit can be fucking real!

823
00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:28,802
Boyd, what happened
in the forest?

824
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:35,200
I gotta go.

825
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,680
Nah! No, no, no!
You do not get to walk in here

826
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,073
and dump a load
of shit like that

827
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,988
and then just walk away!

828
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:42,511
You don't wanna tell me? Fine.

829
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:43,948
You talk when
you feel like talking.

830
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:45,601
Okay.

831
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:48,300
I just need to know
that you got your shit together.

832
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:54,262
I tried doing what you do, okay?

833
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:56,221
And I just got a bunch
of fucking people killed.

834
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:57,526
Donna--

835
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,876
No, I don't need
a goddamn pep talk!

836
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:01,182
I just need to know
that you're back!

837
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:07,275
Because these people can't
take a whole lot more of this.

838
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:13,107
Fuck.

839
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:18,112
I'm not sure how much
more I can take.

840
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:20,680
Okay.

841
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:23,596
Okay.

842
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:04,419
Hello?

843
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:08,510
Hello?

844
00:49:14,342 --> 00:49:15,517
Someone down here?

845
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,415
Hi, Kenny.
