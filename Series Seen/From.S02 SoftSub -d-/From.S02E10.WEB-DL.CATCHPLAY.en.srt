1
00:00:01,107 --> 00:00:02,669
Previously, on From...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,296
There's darkness in the forest.

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,924
Nightmares you can't
even begin to imagine.

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,971
My blood is your blood now.

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:20,312
Every time I see something
really weird, I see this symbol.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,776
I've seen this.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,735
Like in a vision or something?

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,488
No, on the walls in the tunnels.

9
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,323
Victor said his mother wanted
to rescue the children

10
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,450
that were locked in the tower.

11
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,284
That it was the only way
to get everyone home.

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,579
All this time, I thought
the children were trying to scare me,

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,831
but what if
they're just asking for my help?

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,458
Do you hear that?

15
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,086
Help me!

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,754
Please, please, I need help!

17
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,050
- She was talking in her sleep.
- What did she say?

18
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:55,722
"They touch, they break, they steal.
No one here is free."

19
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,224
There's something else here now.
Something new.

20
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,310
It's not safe for anyone
to go to sleep tonight.

21
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,563
- Every one of you is gonna fucking die!
- Get him out of here now!

22
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,899
I just remembered my dream.

23
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:11,697
There was this boy, all dressed in white,
and he kept repeating the same phrase...

24
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,032
"Here they come,

25
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,286
they come for three,
unless you stop the melody."

26
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,915
I know that one.
It's an old nursery rhyme.

27
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:27,045
They touch, they break, they steal
No one here is free

28
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:32,718
Here they come, they come for three
Unless you stop the melody

29
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,885
Julie, stop that.

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,030
They're upstairs.

31
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,875
Your mom and...

32
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,087
Victor took Ethan to the diner.

33
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,800
Hey, Boyd...

34
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,802
You should go upstairs
just in case they need your help.

35
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,120
That kid should be picking out
a prom dress. Not...

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,498
laying in there like...

37
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,877
The problem is
there's too much we don't know.

38
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,049
It's like opening a book
and starting from the middle or...

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,010
Try to imagine
what a jigsaw puzzle looks like

40
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,970
when all you have is a few random pieces.

41
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,723
And they're not even the helpful ones,
like corners or edges. Just...

42
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,394
vague. Fucking...

43
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,731
The trick is
you find two pieces that connect.

44
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,444
Then at least you have a place to start.

45
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:29,292
- Hey, where you going?
- We need to talk to Sara.

46
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,812
Well, if we can't sleep anymore,
then what's the point?

47
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,857
I'm telling you,
we should all just fucking go.

48
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,276
Get some supplies,
set out, and see what we can find.

49
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,777
Boyd tried that already.

50
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,406
Yeah, well, maybe Boyd isn't
the end-all, be-all answer to everything.

51
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,868
What are we even doing out here?
Randall was an asshole.

52
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,455
Yeah, well, you're an asshole, too,
and I wouldn't leave you out here to rot.

53
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,914
Fuck me.

54
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,543
Finally get out of my goddamn room
and I'm on corpse-collecting duty.

55
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,380
Go check out down there. Elgin, this way.

56
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,883
I appreciate you coming.

57
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,593
It feels good to do something useful.

58
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,928
Well, you've done plenty.

59
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,557
That dream of yours? For all we know,
that'll prove to be the answer to this.

60
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,394
- Weird as that fucking sounds.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,188
Maybe.

62
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,356
You're gonna wanna see this!

63
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,615
- I don't think this guy is dead.
- Shit!

64
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,952
Fuck.

65
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,208
Didn't you say
there would be dead monsters out here?

66
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,878
So much for silver bullets.

67
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,630
All right, get him in the van.

68
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,798
Fuck!

69
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,967
- Get him in the van!
- Okay.

70
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,846
Jesus...

71
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,814
Her pulse is nice and strong,
and she's taking big, deep breaths.

72
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,440
Let's see here.

73
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,529
Oh my god! What's happening?

74
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,156
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,907
- I don't know.
- What's going on?

76
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,325
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

77
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,452
Do something!

78
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,207
- Come on! Julie, can you hear me?
- No!

79
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,088
Marielle. Marielle.

80
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,007
Hey, hey. Look at me. Marielle.

81
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,634
Marielle, talk to me.

82
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,929
So, how is this supposed to help?

83
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,640
When we were in the forest,
you said a little boy in white told you

84
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,934
to get into the tree.

85
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,937
It's the same tree
that put me in the goddamn chamber

86
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,271
where all this started.

87
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,856
So?

88
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,151
Well, it turns out, Elgin had
a dream about a little boy in white.

89
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,028
Told him part of a nursery rhyme.

90
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,365
The same one
Paula kept repeating before she died.

91
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,453
They touch, they break, they steal
No one here is free

92
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,541
Here they come, they come for three
Unless you stop the melody

93
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,710
That make any sense to you?

94
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,586
No.

95
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,632
Anything else you can tell me
about the little boy?

96
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,093
He was trying to help us.

97
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,975
Okay, so, this random little kid running
around a magical forest doing good.

98
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,561
Popping up in people's dreams and...

99
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,479
I don't think he really was a little boy.

100
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,774
Come on. Hey, Sara, listen up.

101
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,610
This is it right now.

102
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,947
When I told you there was a chance
that you could still do some good,

103
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,490
that you could help the people here,

104
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,576
it's right now.

105
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,870
You understand?

106
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,542
Okay.

107
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,753
It's right over there.

108
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,469
All right. This is it.

109
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,889
This whole... whole thing was a...

110
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,101
There was someone chained
to a wall right here.

111
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:25,065
Right here, then there was a hole
that went down 40, 50 feet. And I had...

112
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,445
- What's wrong?
- I can hear it.

113
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,574
The music. It's here.

114
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,494
- What are you talking about?
- The music box. It's here.

115
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,496
Where?

116
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,290
Right there.

117
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,253
It's here.

118
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,631
- There's... There's no music box here.
- No, look, there is.

119
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,966
- This...
- There is.

120
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:56,179
I can hear it. I'm telling you. I can...

121
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,225
What's wrong?

122
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,314
What's wrong?

123
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,235
- I can hear them screaming.
- What?

124
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,032
There's... There's something...
There's something. It...

125
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,742
It's here.

126
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,035
It's hurting them.

127
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,417
Boyd, what the fuck is going on? What...

128
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,670
Hey, Sara. Sara, talk to me.

129
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,381
Here they come, they come for three

130
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:34,259
It needs them.

131
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,304
It needs them to stay in.
It needs them to...

132
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,432
Okay. We gotta get her out of here.
Come on.

133
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,727
- Kenny! Come on. Come on, buddy.
- Yeah.

134
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,479
Lift up. There we go.

135
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,731
Come on, let's go out the other side.

136
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,985
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
- No, no, don't! Stop!

137
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,863
Okay. Okay.

138
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,532
Okay. Okay.

139
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,993
All right.

140
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,996
It's laughing at you.

141
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,665
- What?
- For bringing it back to town.

142
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,168
For setting it free.

143
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,462
It wants to hurt us.

144
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,885
It wants to make us suffer.

145
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,765
It got so excited
when it touched your arm.

146
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,976
How do I stop this?

147
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,271
- Sara, how do I stop this?
- Julie.

148
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,772
- Julie?
- Julie.

149
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,441
- Julie.
- Julie.

150
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,360
Ju... Julie.

151
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,823
- Julie... Julie and the others...
- Yeah.

152
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,285
...they're dying. They're dying.

153
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,208
And when they die, it will be too late.

154
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,004
- You need to make it stop.
- Okay, make what stop?

155
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,300
The music. The music.
You have to make the music stop!

156
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,428
Okay, how?
How do I stop something I can't see?

157
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,473
- I don't know.
- Okay. All right.

158
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,442
Just breathe.

159
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,240
That's it. Just breathe.

160
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,410
Close your eyes. Let's pray.

161
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,999
Yea, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death,

162
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,086
I will fear no evil,

163
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,674
for thou art with me...

164
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:42,511
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

165
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,474
Matthias?

166
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,397
Take the guns and lock them in the shed.
I don't want them in the house.

167
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,651
We managed to make it through the night.
Now we just have to see about today.

168
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:57,986
Okay.

169
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,500
Jim.

170
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,502
Come on.

171
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,977
There's something I have to do,
and I need you to say it's okay.

172
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,231
The last time Victor saw his mother,

173
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,859
she told him that there were
children locked in a tower.

174
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,446
That if she helped them,
then everyone could go home.

175
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,115
I don't understand.

176
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,700
All these children I've been seeing,

177
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,620
the dreams I've been having about a tower...

178
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,832
what if she was right?

179
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,420
What if the only way
to save Julie is to find that tower?

180
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,630
- Tabby...
- Honey, I know, I know it sounds crazy.

181
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,217
I had a theory about this place
that almost got me killed.

182
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,928
- Well, this is different.
- How?

183
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,641
This just is.

184
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,480
Jim, our daughter is laying in that room
like something out of a nightmare.

185
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,108
She called for me last night,

186
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,779
and I couldn't do anything to help her.

187
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,574
I was just standing there...

188
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:33,289
and all I could think and see was
Thomas lying on the fucking floor.

189
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,501
I can't, Jim.

190
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,590
We can't sit here hoping for the best.

191
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,348
Victor's mother left this place,
and she never came back.

192
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,354
Whatever she went to do,
she never came back.

193
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,483
Victor had to grow up here alone.

194
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,736
- What if that happens to you?
- I know.

195
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,910
That's why I need you
to tell me that it's okay for me to go.

196
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,039
I have to try this, Jim, please.

197
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,002
When Julie wakes up,
she's gonna be hungry.

198
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,171
- We make her favorite.
- Hey.

199
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,632
- We brought some food.
- Good.

200
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,386
Victor, can I talk
to you for a minute, please?

201
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,471
Is Victor in trouble?

202
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,057
No, no.

203
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,851
You come help me, okay?

204
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,235
You said your mother wanted
to rescue the children

205
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,654
that were locked in the tower.

206
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,244
Do you know the way to the tower?

207
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,628
But I... I know the way

208
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,298
to the bottle tree.

209
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,507
The what?

210
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,399
This is how you get to the tower.

211
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,320
You have to visit the bottle tree.

212
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,825
Can you take me there?

213
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,495
I think so.

214
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,122
Can you give us a second?

215
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,839
Jim...

216
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,592
I have to try this.

217
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,764
I have to at least try.

218
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,644
I just...

219
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,941
I know. I know, baby. I know.

220
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,580
So, what are we supposed to do?

221
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,670
We head back to town.

222
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:27,964
Wait, what?

223
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,551
She just said that the music box
is here. It's here. We have to find it.

224
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,678
- We have to...
- Yeah, how do you expect we do that?

225
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,307
I don't know, but I'm pretty sure
it's not by going back into town.

226
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,394
People's lives are at stake...

227
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,355
Hey, I don't need
a fucking reminder of what's at stake! I...

228
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,362
There's nothing we can do here. Not yet.

229
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,992
Look, we're dealing with things
that are beyond our scope of...

230
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,957
We know more now
than we knew this morning. That's a win.

231
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,625
- Okay.
- Okay.

232
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:08,337
So, what are we supposed to tell people?

233
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,215
You tell people that we are working on it.

234
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:16,512
The best thing we can do now is
help people feel a little more calmer.

235
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,640
Help them feel less afraid.
Can you do that?

236
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,519
Yeah.

237
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,939
- Yeah.
- Good man.

238
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,907
Hey.

239
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,704
You all right?

240
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,500
Why do people always ask that
when the answer is obvious?

241
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,840
Look, man, I'm sorry about last night.

242
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,052
Putting you in that room,
we were just trying to...

243
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,303
It was my fault.

244
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,307
I lost my shit.

245
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,229
Paula was the one
who was good in a crisis.

246
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:14,278
Oh my God,
I never realized how fragile we are.

247
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,740
How easily we break.

248
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,080
I was downstairs making dinner
like an idiot.

249
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,003
There was nothing you could have done.

250
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,964
This was nobody's fault.

251
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,762
Yeah.

252
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,724
- Nobody's fault.
- Yeah.

253
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,609
How's he doing?

254
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,657
Just can't imagine
what I'd do if something like that...

255
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,702
if it was you.

256
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,167
Hey, come here.

257
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,552
It wasn't me.

258
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,100
Let's get married.

259
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,770
- Today.
- Yeah.

260
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:34,191
Look, we have no idea what's gonna happen,
or if your dad's gonna find a way to...

261
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,534
If this is the end,
then I want it to end with you.

262
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,997
I wanna get married.

263
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,046
- Okay.
- Okay?

264
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,965
- Yeah?
- Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.

265
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,929
So, this is what you're doing with my bar?

266
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,848
It's a thought experiment.

267
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,602
I used to find this helpful
when I was developing my...

268
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,732
You died.

269
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,609
Correct.

270
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:01,070
Okay.

271
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,114
Well, just wanted to make sure
we were on the same page.

272
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,254
Well, are you gonna ask me if I'm real?

273
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,339
I imagine this is
some sort of stress-induced psychosis,

274
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,718
and you will disappear
soon enough on your own.

275
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,263
So, what's all this supposed to do?

276
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,975
It's a way of reorienting
my perspective. I'm trying to...

277
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm trying to find
a different way to look at this symbol.

278
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:37,982
Why?

279
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,525
Why?

280
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,029
Because I've been looking at it wrong.

281
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,327
There's gotta be an answer here.
I'm just... I'm not seeing it.

282
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,751
And I just thought...

283
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,004
What, what is it?

284
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,131
You changed the still.

285
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,383
You're welcome.

286
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,555
I think you're overthinking it.

287
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,894
Do you, dead Tom?

288
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:16,979
In what way?

289
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,565
You already know what you have to do.

290
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:23,319
Tabitha told you she saw
this symbol down in the tunnels.

291
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,364
The question is how far
are you willing to go to find answers?

292
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,700
Going down
into those tunnels would be insane.

293
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,619
Even if it saves Julie's life?

294
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,704
Oh fuck!

295
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,915
You know, I don't even know
if I'd find anything down there.

296
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,167
Of course you do. It's natural design.

297
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,964
Same reason your brain is in your skull,
your heart's behind your ribs.

298
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,424
Nature will always put

299
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,844
what's most precious
in the spots most difficult to reach.

300
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,474
Nothing about this place is natural.

301
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,017
Wrong.

302
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,436
Nothing about this place is familiar.

303
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,481
There's a difference.

304
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,026
If there's answers to be found...

305
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,531
and granted, that's a big if...

306
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,909
that's where they'll be.

307
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,119
All right, so, I'm supposed to what...
I'm supposed to take advice from...

308
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:21,585
You ran into a house
that was falling down to save Tabitha,

309
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,545
and she wasn't even there.

310
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,297
And you know what?

311
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,092
Given the choice,
I'd do the same thing again.

312
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,345
Well, then you're a fucking idiot. Like...

313
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,020
You don't make moral choices
based on the outcomes you expect.

314
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,523
You make them based on
whether or not you think they're right.

315
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,651
When I ran into that house,

316
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:50,614
I wasn't thinking about
the trolley problem or determinism. I...

317
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,492
wasn't thinking of any of that.

318
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,871
There's a 16-year-old girl over there
who needs your help.

319
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,296
Did you bury Paula?

320
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:10,968
What?

321
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,095
Did you bury Paula yet?

322
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,391
- Jesus Christ.
- I'll do it.

323
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,643
I'll go and find some people to help.

324
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,653
Boyd?

325
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,071
Yeah.

326
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,407
You're doing the best you can.

327
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:47,796
Fuck!

328
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,611
You putting the guns away?

329
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,323
Yeah, Donna was worried
about leaving them in the house.

330
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,950
That's smart. You need a hand?

331
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,327
No, I'm just about done.

332
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,208
It's okay. It's okay. Yeah, it's okay.

333
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,586
It's just gonna go a little sooner
than the rest of us.

334
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,559
Everything's a system.
Everything's connected.

335
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:01,161
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

336
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,664
Fuck my life.

337
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,217
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Fucking piece of shit. Come on!

338
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,459
Okay.

339
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,086
Okay, I got this.

340
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,714
Easy peasy.

341
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,592
Easy fucking peasy.

342
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,248
Anybody up there?

343
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,628
I'll tell you what...

344
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,507
if you are up there...

345
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,053
you're a real fucking asshole,
you know that?

346
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,473
You enjoying this?

347
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:39,319
If Khatri were here, Khatri would say,

348
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,366
"God moves in mysterious ways."
Oh yeah, yeah.

349
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,618
Because Khatri had a plan.

350
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,541
He thought you put him here
for a reason. He...

351
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,419
He thought that we were gonna walk out
into those woods like Butch Cassidy

352
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,089
and the motherfucking Sundance Kid.
He thought that right up until the time

353
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,634
one of those things
slit his fucking throat.

354
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,179
What did he do with his last breaths?

355
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,141
He prayed.

356
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:17,149
He gasped out that fucking prayer

357
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,734
so that you would know...

358
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,866
so that he could show you
that he had never lost faith.

359
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,492
You know what, motherfucker?

360
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,704
I ain't here to pray.

361
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:36,292
If you are anything
other than some bedtime fucking story

362
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,921
that we tell ourselves,
then you will tell me why!

363
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,216
Why you made me think I could fix this?

364
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:48,012
Some kind of fucking hero,
I'm gonna lead these people home,

365
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:52,559
when all I am is a dumb motherfucker
who keeps getting people killed!

366
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,270
Damn it!

367
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,106
You fuck! You think this is funny?

368
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,108
And you...

369
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:05,197
you up there somewhere
having a fucking laugh, huh?

370
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,992
Just answer me! Answer me!

371
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,204
Say something!

372
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:17,793
You know... tampering
with a mailbox is a federal crime.

373
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,888
Come in.

374
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,646
How's she doing?

375
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,107
She's getting worse.

376
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,403
She's... She's getting cold.

377
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,206
Is this really it?

378
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,296
Is this how it ends?

379
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,010
I don't know.

380
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:10,929
You know, ever since...

381
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,808
she walked off that bus, I actually...

382
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,646
allowed myself to believe
that there was a plan to all of this.

383
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,362
That there was something
we were meant to do here.

384
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,698
But there's no...

385
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,411
there's no grand design.

386
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,414
We're all gonna die here.

387
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,834
And all this would have been for nothing.

388
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,631
You know, my dad used to say...

389
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,052
"It's hard to see the sweater
when you're only just a thread."

390
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,682
I never really knew
what he meant until now.

391
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,479
All the people
that have gotten stuck here...

392
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,068
maybe we aren't the ones
that get to go home.

393
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,696
But maybe...

394
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,282
what we did here...

395
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,703
makes it easier
for the people who come next.

396
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,707
Maybe we're the reason
that they get to go home.

397
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,632
Just because we're only a thread,
it doesn't mean we don't matter.

398
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,436
There you go.

399
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,273
Last thing you need is
Khatri haunting you over everything else.

400
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,152
It's too late for that.

401
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,283
Julie and Marielle.

402
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,494
Randall.

403
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,332
Sara says they're dying.

404
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,209
And once they're gone,

405
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,170
there's no putting
the genie back in the bottle.

406
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,509
Whatever this thing is, it just waits
for us to go to sleep, and then...

407
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,928
Like Paula.

408
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,180
Yeah.

409
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,561
She said the music box is there.

410
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:26,690
Right there in the clearing,
only it's not there.

411
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:32,862
Like looking at an instruction manual
with too many pages missing. How am I...

412
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,739
How am I supposed...

413
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,702
I saw my wife last night.

414
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,414
How'd she look?

415
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,794
There's gotta be rules, Donna.

416
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,172
There's gotta be something

417
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,218
I can hold in my hands.
There's gotta... These...

418
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,931
I did this.

419
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,977
I brought this thing back here.

420
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,771
Yep, you sure did.

421
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,860
You also gave a whole bunch
of people a lot more time

422
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,652
than they would have had
if it wasn't for you.

423
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,614
You gave me more time.

424
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,620
Your son is about to get married.

425
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,790
Nothing official, I guess.
It's not like we have a priest anymore.

426
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:31,087
They're making the most
of whatever time they have.

427
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,424
You should do the same.

428
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,761
Come back to Colony House with me.

429
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,475
I'm not giving up.

430
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,685
Did I say give up?

431
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,275
Boyd, this may be
the last few hours any of us get.

432
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,986
So why don't you just stop
being a goddamn martyr

433
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,031
and come and watch your son get married.

434
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,452
The end of the world will still be here
when the ceremony's done.

435
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,451
Anghkooey!

436
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,913
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

437
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,998
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

438
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,750
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

439
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,460
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

440
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,504
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

441
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,464
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

442
00:36:56,554 --> 00:36:58,049
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

443
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,427
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

444
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,804
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

445
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,766
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

446
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,393
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

447
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,272
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

448
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,013
Did your mother say
anything else about the children?

449
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,390
How was she going to save them?

450
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:52,437
I don't know.
All she said was that they needed her.

451
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:57,609
It's... It should be right here. It...

452
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,946
- No, no, no, no, these trees weren't...
- Hey, hey, hey. It was...

453
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,948
It was a long time ago, Victor. Maybe...

454
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,951
Maybe we took the wrong turn.

455
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,038
Over here.

456
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,002
Who put the bottles there?

457
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,463
I don't know.

458
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,304
This is where I found her.

459
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,556
Your mom?

460
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,729
Yeah, after everyone died,
I came looking for her. Her body...

461
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,111
She didn't make it into the tree.

462
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,492
What do you mean "into the tree"?

463
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,704
Come.

464
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,503
It's a faraway tree.

465
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,764
The night the monsters got
into Colony House,

466
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,977
Julie said you both escaped
by climbing into a tree.

467
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:18,398
And they always take you different places,
and you never know where you'll end up.

468
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,151
But my mother said this one was special.

469
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,989
That it would take her
to the tower, to the children.

470
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,907
And then what?

471
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,538
That's all I remember.

472
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,546
Here.

473
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,258
I...

474
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,888
I put some snacks inside for you.

475
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,599
Here.

476
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,729
- Thank you, Victor.
- Yeah.

477
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,400
Does it hurt to go through?

478
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,027
No, it's just like walking through a door.

479
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,449
Okay. Okay.

480
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,868
Thank you.

481
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,584
Now go back to town.

482
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,377
Be careful.

483
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,130
Yeah.

484
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,107
What are we doing?

485
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,109
He wanted it to be a surprise.

486
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,820
He wanted what to be a surprise?

487
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,118
You're always saying that this view
makes even this place look like a dream.

488
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,745
So I figured...

489
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,665
Is this okay?

490
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,001
This is perfect.

491
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,844
Hey, why don't we just go get him?

492
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,055
He's got a lot on his mind...

493
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,267
Sheriff Stevens!

494
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,352
You made it.

495
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:05,231
What, are you kidding me?
Wild horses couldn't stop me.

496
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,737
Okay, let's get this show on the road.

497
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,238
Okay, wait.

498
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,785
I know it's not much of an aisle, but...

499
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,205
would you do me the honor?

500
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,339
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

501
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,301
You know, you don't have to call me
Sheriff Stevens anymore.

502
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,721
Okay.

503
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,681
Shall we?

504
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,620
Ladies first.

505
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,789
Okay.

506
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,585
My father had a saying.

507
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,424
Well, he had a lot
of sayings actually, but...

508
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,512
my favorite one was always...

509
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,225
"Life is a journey through the unknown."

510
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:28,356
"And though your eyes
and mind may sometimes deceive you,

511
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,775
your heart will never lie."

512
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:36,114
My heart's belonged to you
since the moment I met you.

513
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,202
You're the love of my life,

514
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,539
for as long as that life may last.

515
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,627
So, will you, Ellis Stevens,

516
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,256
do me the honor of being my husband?

517
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,842
I will.

518
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:00,680
I made you something.

519
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,610
- Your turn.
- All right.

520
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,822
It's a tough act to follow.

521
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:31,960
The day my family and I saw that tree,
our lives changed forever.

522
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,135
But the day
that I saw you get out of that car,

523
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,680
that's the day that my life really began.

524
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,268
There have been...

525
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,771
so many times here where I felt...

526
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,275
like I was stumbling in the dark.

527
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,989
But each and every time,

528
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,576
you were the light that guided me through.

529
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,580
You are my love.

530
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,958
You are my home.

531
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,005
You are my light in dark places.

532
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,133
So...

533
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,261
will you...

534
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,264
Fatima Hassan-Rostami...

535
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,685
will you do me the honor of being my wife?

536
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,856
I will.

537
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,318
Well, the rules say we kiss now.

538
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:45,993
Boyd?

539
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,413
Where'd you go?

540
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,248
Are you okay, Dad?

541
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,043
"Light in dark places."

542
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,380
I gotta go.

543
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,007
- I'm sorry. Hey.
- It's okay.

544
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,973
I love you guys.

545
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,017
- All right.
- I love you too.

546
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,277
Will we get to see Thomas again?

547
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,364
What?

548
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,785
If we die,
will we get to see Thomas again?

549
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,425
Yeah.

550
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,177
Yeah, we will.

551
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,141
- Grandpa too?
- Grandpa too.

552
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,770
Maybe it won't be so bad then.

553
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,654
She likes to sleep with two pillows.

554
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,244
Let me help you.

555
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,672
Hey. Reggie?

556
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:23,758
You did this.

557
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,927
Everything was fine
until you went into the forest.

558
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,178
- Hey.
- You're the reason

559
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,179
all this is happening.

560
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,681
Okay. Hey, hey. Listen to me.

561
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,267
Listen to me.

562
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,436
I know you don't understand. I know.

563
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,190
But I think this torch right here,

564
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,734
I think this is gonna help me fix this.

565
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,944
Oh my God!

566
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,114
I'm sorry, Boyd. I always liked you.

567
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:50,409
Oh God! God!

568
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,918
Fucking...

569
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,689
Fuck.

570
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,117
Fuck.

571
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,953
Fuck.

572
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,251
Please.

573
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,379
Come on.

574
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,722
Oh shit.

575
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,059
What...

576
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,580
Julie. Hey, Julie?

577
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,748
Hey, Julie. Hey, Julie.

578
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,126
Can you hear me?

579
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,132
I'm gonna get you out of here.

580
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,094
I'm gonna get you out of here right now.

581
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,014
We're getting out of here.

582
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:41,687
Boyd.

583
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,483
Please. Destroying that box
isn't gonna end their suffering.

584
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,069
- You'll only prolong it.
- No...

585
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,739
The people in this town will suffer,

586
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,366
in ways you can't even imagine.

587
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,036
They're all gonna die, screaming.

588
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,795
What's wrong with her?

589
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,465
- Hey! It's okay.
- What's wrong?

590
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,758
What's wrong with her?

591
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,635
Honey. Honey, please.

592
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,056
You think you need to be the hero.

593
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,476
You think you need
to be responsible to save them.

594
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,313
You don't have to suffer anymore.
You don't have to be afraid.

595
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,607
It's okay. None of this matters.

596
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,236
We can be together. I miss you so much.

597
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,154
Wait, so...

598
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:37,826
Stop, so... So whatever this thing is,

599
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,371
it just lets you come
in here for a little chat?

600
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,873
It knows you won't listen.

601
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,794
It wants you to fight. It wants you
to have hope that you could actually win.

602
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:47,835
Why?

603
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,214
Because hope is
what makes you willing to suffer.

604
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,217
Hope is what sent you out
into the woods that day.

605
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,888
Hope is what made you leave me alone
when I needed you the most.

606
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,393
It's not your fear
that feeds the forest, Boyd.

607
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,478
It's hope.

608
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,202
Let it go, Boyd.

609
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,957
If they don't die today,
they'll just die tomorrow.

610
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,335
No.

611
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,152
Julie... are you okay?

612
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,535
Are you okay?

613
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:03,746
Hi.

614
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,414
What's going on?

615
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:17,926
Honey.

616
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,473
She's okay. You sister's okay.

617
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,186
Hey, baby. It's okay. It's okay.

618
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,647
You're good now.

619
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,460
Fuck you, motherfucker.

620
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,297
You don't break me.

621
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,761
You hear that?

622
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,684
You don't fucking break me!

623
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,379
- Drink this.
- I'm fine.

624
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,881
I know you are. Do it for me.

625
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,694
There's no more buzzing.

626
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,666
Does that mean it's over?

627
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,628
I sure hope so.

628
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,925
Dad?

629
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,764
Where's Mom?

630
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:41,570
Anghkooey.

631
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:44,823
Hello?

632
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,097
Anghkooey.

633
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,451
Anghkooey.

634
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,873
Anghkooey.

635
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,701
I'm sorry.

636
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,870
I really am.

637
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:15,122
This is the only way.

638
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,404
Just a moment.

639
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,112
How are you feeling?

640
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,662
Where am I?

641
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,873
Saint Anthony's Hospital. I'm Dr. Brody.

642
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,377
Three days ago,
a pair of hikers found you in the woods.

643
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,380
You were lying unconscious
on the side of a trail.

644
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:48,632
No.

645
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,094
Do you remember
what you were doing out there?

646
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,470
No.

647
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,558
No. No, no, no.

648
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,729
No.

649
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,821
No.
