00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:11,359
<i>Previously on</i> From...

2
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:12,403
I hear their voices.

3
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:15,015
Sara, just tell me
what you did.

4
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,539
I left the door open.

5
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:19,976
I have Sara tied up in
the basement of the church.

6
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,282
Tell me you're joking.

7
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,501
That girl may be the key to
unlocking all this.

8
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:26,765
That girl may be
the way we all go home.

9
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,680
Let's take a walk.

10
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:29,681
We have to turn around!

11
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:31,509
We can't be here!
Stop the bus!

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,076
Everyone lease return
to your seats!

13
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:34,643
Bad things are gonna
happen if--

14
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:37,689
Stop the goddamn bus!

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,517
Everyone on, right now.

16
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,519
You're gonna get people killed,
you realize that?

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,390
<i>Hello?</i>

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,000
Where are you?

19
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,263
<i>Is this Jim?</i>

20
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,483
<i>Your wife shouldn't be
digging that hole, Jim.</i>

21
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:57,405
You ever wonder
if Abby was right?

22
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:59,363
What if it's all
just a dream?

23
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:01,452
Aah!

24
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,717
My blood is your blood now.

25
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:07,197
Who was in my room?

26
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,633
- Sorry?
- Someone was in my room,

27
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,113
and they took something.

28
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:11,375
Uh, I think I saw Jade

29
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,724
and the Matthews boy
up here last night.

30
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:13,682
You are not
listening to me.

31
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:14,726
No, I am listening,

32
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,250
and I'm telling you
to fuck off.

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,643
Residents don't carry guns.
That's the rule.

34
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:22,256
Well, uh, rules change.

35
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:24,301
The wires aren't
connected to anything.

36
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,390
They were just dangling
from the ceiling.

37
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:29,350
Tabitha, we have
so much to talk about.

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,308
I saw something
that wasn't there.

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,222
What?

40
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:33,745
I saw two children

41
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,835
standing in the middle
of the road staring at me.

42
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:40,709
Hello? Someone down here?

43
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:46,541
Hi, Kenny.

44
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,723
And right through here
we have the common area.

45
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:59,249
And downstairs you'll have
a nice big room all to yourself.

46
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,424
Come on in.

47
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,689
No.

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,388
I don't like it here.

49
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:08,650
It's too sunny.

50
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,218
I-I want to go home.

51
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,915
No, no, Dad.
It's okay, look.

52
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:14,743
Um, this place
is really nice.

53
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:17,267
And, look, there's
a perfect little spot here

54
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,226
for us to play chess.

55
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,924
We stay here together?

56
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,277
I'll give you folks
a few minutes, okay?

57
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:28,713
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,334
Look, Dad.

59
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:43,206
Mom and I are gonna
be right down the street.

60
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:47,297
You know? And we'll
come here every single day.

61
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:49,560
But it's really, really
important for you

62
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,433
to be somewhere where you
can't open the door at night.

63
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:56,959
Dad, what happened last night...

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,397
It's safer this way.

65
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,575
No.

66
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:05,707
I go home now.

67
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,645
Uh, I'll go get
the rest of the stuff.

68
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,752
Kenny.

69
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,580
Sheriff Boyd, hey.

70
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,842
Everything all right?

71
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,239
Yeah, we were just, uh,
we're getting my dad settled in.

72
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,762
I heard you had
a scare last night.

73
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,288
Those things were knocking
on the door, they're--

74
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,727
He was convinced that, uh,

75
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,381
that his brothers
were outside.

76
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:12,817
Right.

77
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,994
My mom tried to stop him
but, uh, he-- he pushed her.

78
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,997
It was, uh...

79
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,695
Yeah, man, it's--

80
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:23,437
It's hard.

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,875
First time seeing
your parents struggle, huh?

82
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,531
Yeah.

83
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:32,707
You know, this place...

84
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,406
...there's not a lot
holding it together.

85
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,757
You know,
everyone is scared and confused,

86
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,499
but a thing
I learned in the army,

87
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,806
it always helps to
have people to look to--

88
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:48,026
people who seem like they know
what the hell they're doing.

89
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,724
That's really all
I'm trying to do here.

90
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,856
Seems like you're doing
a really good job.

91
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:56,774
I could use some help.

92
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,081
Wouldn't mind having
a deputy watching my six.

93
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,433
What do you say?

94
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,480
You think?

95
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,570
I think, right?

96
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,006
Uh, yeah.

97
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:12,094
I mean--

98
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:17,621
Sheriff Boyd!

99
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,972
I have to show you something.

100
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,409
Can it wait?
I gotta--

101
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,975
No, no, no.

102
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:27,065
Um, I have--
I have to show you now.

You want some?

129
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:42,897
Are you okay?

130
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:43,941
Hey.

131
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:48,119
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,122
It happened again, didn't it?

133
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,254
You saw something.

134
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,562
I need you to watch
Ethan for a minute.

135
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:56,998
I need to talk to your father.

136
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,045
Mom, you can tell me.

137
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,050
I know. I know.

138
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,794
Yes, it happened again.

139
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,884
I saw something,
but, listen, I'm fine.

140
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,626
And you're fine, right?

141
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:17,845
- We're good.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,587
I just need to talk to Daddy.

143
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,155
- Okay.
- Okay.

144
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,511
I'll be right back.

145
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,954
Where's Mom going?

146
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,085
Uh, she--

147
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:43,174
Oh, Christ!

148
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,611
Are you people
living here now?

149
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,917
Our house collapsed.

150
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,006
Well...
at least you had one.

151
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,181
It's not my fault you broke it.

152
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,792
Hey, take it easy.

153
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,707
We finally get rid of
those three smelly hippies

154
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,622
from Colony House
and now we got you people!

155
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,584
Still wanna go see Victor?

156
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,281
Yeah.

157
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,724
When I came down earlier...

158
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:14,902
...she was here.

159
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,138
Give us a minute, okay?

160
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:37,577
What?

161
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:38,752
I need to talk to her.

162
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,017
In private.
Wait for me upstairs.

163
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,107
Please, Kenny.

164
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,282
I got this.

165
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:52,983
All right.

166
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,248
All right.

167
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,740
I'm glad you're okay.

168
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,350
Yeah, that's debatable.

169
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:16,180
I got about a thousand
questions for you.

170
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:17,834
What happened to you?

171
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,097
After you pushed me
in that tree?

172
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,795
Where'd you go?

173
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,753
I followed right behind you.

174
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,233
And?

175
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,148
And then I was here.

176
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,759
So you--

177
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,935
You been here since
the other night?

178
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,634
I didn't know what else to do.

179
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,070
Where did you go
when you went through?

180
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,419
That's a...

181
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,988
How did you know?

182
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,164
How'd you know
what that tree was?

183
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,907
A little boy told me.

184
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,779
He was standing up on the ridge,
wearing all white.

185
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,085
He said that Nathan was right,

186
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,000
that we made
this place angry,

187
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,437
but we'd be safe
in the tree.

188
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,396
So, this little boy, that's one
of the voices you hear.

189
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,051
No.

190
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,313
No, this was different.

191
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:03,967
- I think--
- Jesus.

192
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,882
I think he's trapped here
like us,

193
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,406
that he wants to help,
but he's not sure how.

194
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,756
No shit.

195
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:15,239
Look, I am glad
you're back.

196
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,199
I am. I am.

197
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,680
But you being here,

198
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,290
that's a shitstorm
waitin' to happen.

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,379
We need to figure out
how to handle this.

200
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,121
You know
what you have to do.

201
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,863
We're not talkin'
about this.

202
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:33,475
Boyd, it was always
going to end like this.

203
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,390
You knew that when
you brought me out there.

204
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,741
There's no way I can
ever live here again.

205
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,395
Hey.

206
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,745
Just sit tight, okay?

207
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,834
I gotta talk
to Kenny.

208
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,401
Just sit tight.

209
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,059
Boyd?

210
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,455
You didn't tell Kenny,

211
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,806
'bout what happened
that night at the clinic.

212
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:03,810
No.

213
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,348
What is going on?

214
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,872
Look.

215
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,440
Now, I'm just gonna say
this as plainly as I can.

216
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,487
Okay, Sara is uniquely

217
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,489
connected to this place.

218
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,057
Something here has
communicated with her.

219
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,232
Communicated how?

220
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,799
She hears voices.

221
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,933
Ye-- I know,
I know how it sounds.

222
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,761
Believe me.
When Father Khatri came to me--

223
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,066
Father Khatri knew?

224
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,853
Father Khatri
locked her up in the basement.

225
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,245
Apparently Nathan had come
to him

226
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,943
earlier in the day,
he was worried.

227
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:52,075
Thought she might do
something to hurt someone.

228
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,208
So, Father Khatri
questioned her,

229
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,253
and what he found proof of

230
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,255
is that something here
is talking to her.

231
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,042
Using her like-- like--

232
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,130
A pawn.

233
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:08,962
He figured if something
here is using her,

234
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,920
if she really is
connected to this place,

235
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,923
then we can
use that to understand

236
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:16,056
what this place actually is.

237
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,975
Okay, I don't-- So, what?

238
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:24,194
She's just been downstairs
since Father Khatri died?

239
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:26,588
No.

240
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,243
I took her with me
into the forest.

241
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:31,941
Jesus, I--

242
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,552
Look, hey,
when push came to shove,

243
00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:36,293
she's the reason I made it back.

244
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,600
That girl downstairs
saved my life,

245
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,255
and I know,
I know she did bad things.

246
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,996
Horrible things!

247
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,259
But this place, Kenny,

248
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,436
it can make you think you're
doing them for good reasons.

249
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:51,308
She killed her own brother!

250
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,310
She tried to kill
a 9-year-old kid!

251
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,398
Yes, I know!

252
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,096
Do you? Because you lied.

253
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,314
You lied to everyone!

254
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,576
You lied to me!

255
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,317
Yeah, okay, okay.

256
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,102
Okay, you're right.

257
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,974
And I know that what
she did is unforgivable,

258
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,541
but, listen, when she
killed those people--

259
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,935
People?

260
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,066
It was just Nathan.

261
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,286
No, I mean, yeah.

262
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,592
She almost with the--
with Ethan--

263
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,117
You know what
I'm talking about, right?

264
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,292
Kenny!

265
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,340
Boyd.

266
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,169
What's gonna happen
when everyone finds out?

267
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,605
When Jim and Tabitha

268
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,259
and Ethan's
whole family finds out?

269
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,870
Yeah, okay. Well...

270
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,264
- We'll handle it.
- She's dangerous.

271
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,179
Boyd, she belongs in the Box.

272
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,139
Okay, well,
she's not dangerous.

273
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,357
Not anymore.

274
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,142
Okay, would you
still be saying this

275
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:43,883
if it was Ellis that
she almost killed?

276
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,058
She's not goin' in the Box.

277
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,668
If we really wanna
figure this out--

278
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,105
Hey, she's not going
in the goddamn Box, okay!?

279
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:53,240
No one else is going
in-- into the fucking Box!

280
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,200
Oh, okay.

281
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,943
I, uh... I-I-I need some air.

282
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:01,988
I gotta...

283
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:02,989
Boyd!

284
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,090
Boyd.

285
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,094
I can't--

286
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,574
Boyd! Boyd! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!

287
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:26,316
Hey! You okay?

288
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,361
Guys, come on!

289
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,493
Jeez!

290
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,542
Hey.

291
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,717
Hey, slow down.

292
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,294
Not too long, okay?

293
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,425
Okay.

294
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,083
Hey, you.

295
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,391
Guess it's laundry day?

296
00:15:57,521 --> 00:16:00,176
I'm just trying to get things
back to some sense of normal.

297
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,138
I never got to congratulate
you on the engagement.

298
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,314
- Oh.
- I'm really happy for you guys.

299
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:10,621
Well, in that case,
maybe you'd consider

300
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,667
being one of
my bridesmaids.

301
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,103
What?

302
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:15,539
Ellis doesn't wanna wait.

303
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,627
We're gonna--

304
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,501
We're getting
married here.

305
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,112
Oh my God. Seriously?

306
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:24,461
Right?

307
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,028
But I mean, it's--

308
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:31,468
Well, I would be honored
to be one of your bridesmaids.

309
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,383
Why, thank you kindly.

310
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,256
I saw the new guy outside.

311
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:39,650
Elgin, yeah, he's, uh--

312
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,217
I think he's having
a rough time.

313
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,394
Maybe I could talk to him?

314
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,701
Really?

315
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,790
Yeah.

316
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,618
It was nice having
people do it for me.

317
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:08,549
Hi.

318
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,291
What do you want?

319
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,468
I was worried
about you.

320
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:15,991
I'm glad you're okay.

321
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,819
Well, I'm not very
happy with you.

322
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,170
Can I come in?

323
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:22,345
I don't know.

324
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,565
Are you gonna
steal anything else?

325
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:25,696
I told him not to.

326
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,133
I said you wouldn't like it.

327
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,831
Well, you should've
said it louder.

328
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,494
My mom said
you helped her.

329
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,322
Out in the forest.

330
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:44,846
She's a nice lady.

331
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,327
You're lucky to
have a mom like that.

332
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,678
What are you drawing?

333
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,245
New stuff.

334
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,463
What kind of new stuff?

335
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:54,682
Things we saw.

336
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,337
You and my mom?

337
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,686
Yeah. Yeah.

338
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,732
Where did you guys go?

339
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,647
You should go now,

340
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,780
'cause I'm pretty busy.

341
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:08,435
Well...

342
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,654
Please just go!

343
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,226
I found these in
the storage closet.

344
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,488
I thought you might like them.

345
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,547
I'm sorry I made you mad.

346
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:38,552
Okay.

347
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,382
Bye.

348
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,087
Hey.

349
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,480
You're Elgin, right?

350
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,570
Yeah. Julie?

351
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,701
Yeah.

352
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:00,617
How's your dad?

353
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,751
Uh, he's pretty beat up.

354
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,668
Kristi, the doctor,
she's trying to get him

355
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,626
to take it easy for a bit.

356
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,676
You been here a while?

357
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:18,287
Uh, not that long.

358
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:19,854
Kinda feels
like a lifetime.

359
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:28,210
Look, I know you probably have

360
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,908
tons of people telling you
they're here if you wanna talk,

361
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,304
but I'm around
if you wanna talk.

362
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:37,437
Believe it or not,
it actually helps.

363
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:39,787
I appreciate that.

364
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,226
Hey, what's going on?
I thought you--

365
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:45,227
I wanna go home.

366
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,273
Okay, well, ca--

367
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,409
I think that's my cue.

368
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,933
It was nice meeting you.

369
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,239
Likewise.

370
00:19:58,893 --> 00:19:59,937
Hey!

371
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,375
Ethan, wait up.

372
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:05,204
Good.

373
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,901
And then we'll
do the other hand.

374
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,468
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

375
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,948
I'm just tired, that's all.

376
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,689
Oh, given your
vast medical training

377
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,822
I guess there's nothing
to worry about, then.

378
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,349
Now press up as hard as you can.

379
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,222
Good.

380
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:24,788
What about spider bites?

381
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,835
I got spiders on me
when I was out in the forest.

382
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:29,880
Uh, yeah.
Let me take a look.

383
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:32,666
Let's see.

384
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,885
- There's one here.
- Okay.

385
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,887
And then there's...

386
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:41,457
They don't look swollen
or inflamed, which is good.

387
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,373
Uh, but do you wanna
tell me about this?

388
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,375
What? It's nothing. I just--

389
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,550
Boyd!

390
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,813
I just scratched it
on a tree branch.

391
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,384
It's, um...
it's not infected,

392
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:56,907
but keep it clean, okay?

393
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,039
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,393
Those tremors,
have they gotten any worse?

395
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:05,916
They come and go.
I'm dealing with it.

396
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,615
Have you noticed any
symptoms other than the shaking?

397
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:09,920
Such as?

398
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,271
Visual impairment,
muscle stiffness--

399
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,402
- Nope.
- Depression?

400
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,710
Kristi, everybody here
is depressed.

401
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,890
You know, I remember my--
my dad, he got--

402
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:26,328
It started to mess
with his mind at the end.

403
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,025
Yeah, I don't think that's
anything that you need

404
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,766
to be worrying about right now.

405
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,638
Cognitive impairment
with Parkinson's

406
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,815
doesn't happen until way
down the line, if at all.

407
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:37,426
Why? Is there something?

408
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:38,906
No. Just-- Just curious.

409
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:41,430
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

410
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,475
Fine.

411
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,478
Okay, but you need
to rest, okay?

412
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:47,088
In your condition,
you can't afford to be

413
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,872
putting any extra stress
on your body right now.

414
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,968
Boyd, what's going on?

415
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,927
Nothing! I'm sorry.

416
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:04,323
The idea that
anybody here could avoid

417
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:06,629
putting extra stress
on anything is just--

418
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,851
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

419
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,334
This is great.

420
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,727
Uh, not a good idea. Okay.

421
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,990
- Just sit, okay?
- Come on!

422
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,066
For fuck's sake,
there's literally nowhere

423
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:37,503
in this town I can be alone.

424
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:41,594
Wait a second.
You're the bus driver, right?

425
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,772
I'm sorry.
It's been a long day.

426
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,077
Stay as long
as you want, all right?

427
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,427
I'm just gonna...

428
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,608
That boy.

429
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,526
He said to me,
"Turn around."

430
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:03,659
He begged me.

431
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,227
I didn't listen.

432
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,495
When?

433
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:16,890
What?

434
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:20,807
When did he ask you
to turn the bus around?

435
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,158
Was it before
or after you saw the tree?

436
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:26,726
After.

437
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:31,078
Oh, well, then
you were already screwed.

438
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:34,473
Apparently,
it's once you see the tree,

439
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,213
that's when everything,
you know.

440
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,826
Yeah, I wouldn't
spend too much time

441
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,480
kicking yourself
for that part.

442
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,048
Those people.

443
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,703
They got on my bus.

444
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,792
It was my job to get them
where they were going.

445
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,098
All right,
tell me something.

446
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:54,710
Does your pity party
come with music? Hm?

447
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,234
Will you be serving
finger sandwiches?

448
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,106
Look, it's not
your fault!

449
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:00,281
Okay?

450
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,676
I mean, if you wanna
feel like shit, fine,

451
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:08,594
but feel like shit
'cause <i>your</i> life is fucked.

452
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,160
Don't carry around
a bunch of guilt thinking

453
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,640
that you ruined
anybody else's.

454
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:14,513
Besides, no offense...

455
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:16,950
...they were riding a bus.

456
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,606
Their lives couldn't have been
that great to begin with.

457
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,045
It was a bad joke. Sorry.

458
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,318
You know I wasn't even
supposed to be driving that day?

459
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,931
I took that job
to pay for my degree.

460
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,327
Last month I finally
paid off my tuition.

461
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,506
I was all set to hand in
my notice and I thought,

462
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,074
why not stay a few extra weeks?

463
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:56,946
Put aside something extra
so I can treat myself.

464
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:00,994
Take a little trip
and celebrate.

465
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,651
I deserve
a little reward, right?

466
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,090
Is this what I deserve?

467
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,620
I sold my company
right before I got here.

468
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,756
Finally achieved the one thing
I worked my whole life for.

469
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,196
To getting what
we deserve.

470
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,857
Mm.

471
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,034
Ah, it doesn't get easier.

472
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,122
Yeah.

473
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,084
Jim?

474
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,237
Hi.

475
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,804
Hey.

476
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,414
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you come in.

477
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,678
Who are you?

478
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,680
I'm Marielle.
I was on the bus.

479
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,291
Oh.

480
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:22,815
Don't worry, I'm a nurse.

481
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:26,079
I was just helping
Kristi inventory the supplies.

482
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,212
Um, I'm looking for my husband?

483
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,127
Jim?

484
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:33,042
He left a little while ago.

485
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,915
Thank you.

486
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:41,268
This go other storage.

487
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,443
Okay.

488
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:46,752
Jim.

489
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,754
What are you doing, honey?
You should be resting.

490
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,887
We need to talk.

491
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,106
Okay.

492
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:54,760
Over here.

493
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,763
Take, take more.
Take more. Yeah.

494
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,156
Jesus.

495
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,729
I laid down there all night
thinking I was gonna die,

496
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,992
and I just kept
asking myself "why?"

497
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,735
Why did that road
lead us here?

498
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:16,433
What the fuck is
the point of all of this?

499
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:19,045
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't just take this stuff!

500
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:20,307
It doesn't belong to you!

501
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:22,135
Hey! You go! Now!

502
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,354
Fucking people.

503
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,359
Fucking vultures.

504
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,971
Did you know Kristi's
fiancée was on that bus?

505
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:33,929
What?

506
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,018
Yeah.

507
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,717
And what you said about
the wires not being connected?

508
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:39,805
That's not possible.

509
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:41,110
No, no,
I'm telling you--

510
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,026
Oh, no, it's not that.
I know, I believe you.

511
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,162
It's just that there
is no way that...

512
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:54,515
When we build
a new rollercoaster,

513
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,692
we design it to do things
that seem impossible,

514
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,346
because the more
impossible it seems,

515
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:02,175
the stronger the reaction you
get from the people riding it.

516
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,048
I know how this sounds,
but what if...

517
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:11,532
...what if all this was designed
just to see how we react?

518
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:16,319
I mean, what if this is all some
kind of fucked-up experiment?

519
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,411
The radio worked.

520
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:25,459
No.

521
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,417
We made contact with someone.

522
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,245
So, then why is
everybody just standing--

523
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,420
'Cause they don't know.

524
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,424
Right as the storm
was coming in,

525
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,165
just as we were about
to wrap things up,

526
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,820
I heard a voice. A man.

527
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:41,257
That's why I came
running back here.

528
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:43,085
He-he warned me, Tabitha.

529
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:46,349
Or threatened me.
I don't know which,

530
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,351
but he knew my name,

531
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,092
and he said
you shouldn't be digging,

532
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,573
and then just like that,
our house collapsed.

533
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,969
You think someone's
watching us?

534
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:57,970
All I know is--

535
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,580
Honey.

536
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:04,411
All I know is

537
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,282
someone got on
the other end of that radio

538
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:07,501
and they talked to me.

539
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:09,895
Over there.

540
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,246
Did anyone else hear it?

541
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,379
The voice on the radio?

542
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,964
It's your move, Boyd...

543
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,402
but I gotta say...

544
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,884
your options
don't look great.

545
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,322
This ain't real.

546
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:50,196
You're not here.

547
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:53,329
You wanna talk about
what can and can't be real?

548
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,070
That's the part
you wanna focus on?

549
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,553
Yeah, I don't know.

550
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:01,598
I got a little mystery boy

551
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:04,558
sending people through
magic trees in the forest,

552
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:06,255
my hand's
not shaking anymore,

553
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:08,518
but now I got fucking worms
underneath my skin.

554
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:11,652
So, yeah, yeah, maybe that's
the part we should talk about!

555
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:18,224
Or... how 'bout we talk about
what's really on your mind?

556
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:24,447
How exactly are you gonna tell
Kenny that Sara killed his dad?

557
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:26,536
She didn't kill him.

558
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,887
She opened the door.
Potato, pot-ah-to.

559
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,366
You think Kenny's gonna
be interested

560
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:31,977
in the minutiae of exactly
what happened?

561
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,070
Let me ask you something.

562
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,075
What benefit is there
in Kenny knowing?

563
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,948
That you lied to him.
You betrayed him.

564
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,471
- I didn't--
- You found out the truth

565
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:50,691
about how his father died.
You not only spared the life

566
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,911
of the person responsible,
you gave her your trust,

567
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,042
your friendship.

568
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,914
All this was
your fuckin' idea!

569
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:59,395
Oh, come on, Boyd. Really?

570
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,484
It's poor form
to blame the dead.

571
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,053
He'll understand.

572
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:06,402
I did what I had to do.

573
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:07,577
She was valuable!

574
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,579
She--
She may still be valuable!

575
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,106
Oh, yeah,
she may very well be of value.

576
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:17,936
Which is why you need to
keep your fucking mouth shut.

577
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,634
I mean, of what value is
the truth to Kenny right now?

578
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:23,071
What, you think he's gonna be
better off once he finds out?

579
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:26,118
Or will you simply be relieving
the burden of your own guilt?

580
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,513
Oh, man.

581
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:33,516
Somehow you being dead
made you more of an asshole.

582
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:36,432
Leaders sometimes have to
make tough decisions, Boyd.

583
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,217
You of all people know this.

584
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,740
What, you wanna be
everyone's friend?

585
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,221
Go be the new bartender.
Apparently there's a vacancy.

586
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,440
But if you wanna
lead these people home,

587
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,443
sometimes you have to
make a shitty decision.

588
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,577
I tried telling you this before,
you didn't listen.

589
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,231
Listen to me now.

590
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:56,670
I'm not gonna lie to him.

591
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,283
What was that thing Ellis said?

592
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,419
'Bout that thing
that everyone holds onto?

593
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,164
That's what you are
to Kenny now.

594
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:18,083
You're the father
Kenny no longer has.

595
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:21,738
What do you think happens
when you take that away?

596
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:26,613
Broken people don't
survive here, Boyd.

597
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:29,964
It's not a good time, Jim.

598
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,270
You know why I'm here.

599
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,489
To thank me for
looking after your kids

600
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,057
when you ran off
like an asshole?

601
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:38,277
We need to talk about
how we're gonna handle this.

602
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,148
Handle what?

603
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,976
You heard the voice
on the radio.

604
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,499
I know you did.

605
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,158
Get the fuck in here.

606
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:06,696
I'm gonna put this
as delicately as possible.

607
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,743
How fucking stupid are you?

608
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,267
What?

609
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,139
You wanna know if
I heard something?

610
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:15,531
Yeah, I heard it.

611
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,751
I heard
some spooky motherfucker

612
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:19,187
warn you about your wife

613
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:22,451
20 minutes before
your house collapsed.

614
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:27,413
That means that there are
people out there who can see us.

615
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:31,721
And what part of you
thinks that that's a good sign?

616
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,508
Do you realize what happened
here after you ran off?

617
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:38,250
The fucking lights exploded.

618
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,600
One of my people
almost went blind.

619
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,819
If there really
are people watching us,

620
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,257
they sure as shit
aren't helping us.

621
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:46,780
What do you think
they'll do if they find out

622
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,174
we know about them? Huh?

623
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:52,090
And that's assuming
it was actually a person

624
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,656
on the other end
of the line.

625
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:58,705
There are things
around here that walk

626
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,794
and talk just like us,

627
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:04,537
until they walk up to you
and rip your fucking guts out.

628
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,888
How do you know
it wasn't one of them?

629
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:12,545
- I--
- I am not saying ignore it.

630
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,462
But you already
got people's hopes up

631
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:17,724
with your goddamn tower.

632
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:19,595
All the more reason--

633
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,597
To keep our fucking
mouths shut.

634
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,339
Until we know more.

635
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,301
Where's the radio?

636
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,652
What?

637
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,175
What happened to the radio?

638
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,486
It's in the back.

639
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:42,836
It got a little
busted up during the storm.

640
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:44,794
All right.

641
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:47,667
Do me a favor and don't do
anything until I tell you--

642
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:49,756
Hey!
What the fuck are you doing?

643
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:51,236
Oh, fuck.

644
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:52,498
- Hey, calm down.
- Fuck!

645
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,239
Don't tell me to
fucking calm down!

646
00:35:57,764 --> 00:35:59,113
You don't touch my shit!

647
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:00,549
Understand me?

648
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,203
Hey.
What's going on?

649
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,859
He went through my bag.

650
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,775
Are you fucking kidding me?

651
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:12,170
Okay, look, if this is
gonna work, you're gonna--

652
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,911
Enough! All right? Enough!

653
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:18,654
Now, this only works if
he stays out of my shit. Period.

654
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:19,916
We have a way
of doing things here.

655
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,266
That's good for you.

656
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,484
I got a way of
doing things, too.

657
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:23,790
You touch my stuff,

658
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,661
I will smack
the fucking shit outta you.

659
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:27,750
We clear?

660
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:33,365
Good.

661
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:43,288
Boyd said you saved his life.

662
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,947
It-- it wasn't me,
it was, um...

663
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:57,867
It's hard to explain.

664
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:02,002
He said you hear voices.

665
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:09,662
He said that that's why
you tried to kill Ethan,

666
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:12,273
and how you
ended up killing Nathan.

667
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:18,888
How does a voice
inside your head

668
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,890
convince you to do
something like that?

669
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,936
I mean, wouldn't your first
thought be

670
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,633
that you're losing
your mind

671
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,505
or that maybe
it was a bad idea?

672
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:29,638
You don't understand.

673
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:32,815
So help me understand.

674
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:37,733
Because I really
wanna believe

675
00:37:37,864 --> 00:37:39,474
that Boyd is right
about you.

676
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:42,695
I wanna back him up,

677
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,871
but people are gonna freak out
when they find out about you.

678
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,441
And that doesn't just hurt you.
That hurts Boyd.

679
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:51,530
You understand?

680
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,402
And I cannot
let that happen.

681
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:55,751
So, help me.

682
00:37:57,536 --> 00:37:58,450
Please.

683
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:07,067
Sara, I always thought
of you as a friend.

684
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:12,681
And my mom...
my mom adores you.

685
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:15,031
My mom always
thought of you as, like,

686
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,816
the daughter that she never had.

687
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,474
Convince me that you don't
deserve to go in the Box.

688
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:23,562
I can't.

689
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:27,479
Do you think
I want this?

690
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:35,051
Boyd gave me a chance...

691
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:37,097
that I didn't deserve.

692
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,623
I'm grateful
to him for that.

693
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:43,321
I'm glad
I got to help.

694
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:45,888
But now I'm back.

695
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:51,807
And I have done things
I can't undo.

696
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:54,070
We can help!

697
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,942
We can help make
people understand.

698
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,640
You know,
we can do that.

699
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,861
Sara, this town is
so hard on everyone,

700
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:05,952
and I know you thought
that you found a way to...

701
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:11,305
I know that it was horrible,

702
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:12,959
I know that
it was unforgivable,

703
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:16,005
but if we can
make people understand

704
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,659
why you did
the things that you did,

705
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,008
- maybe we could, you know--
- Kenny!

706
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:21,402
Stop.

707
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,538
There's something
I need to tell you.

708
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:35,808
You okay?

709
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,161
I heard about
the fight.

710
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,990
He'll come around.
They always do.

711
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,600
Not this one.

712
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,429
I know his type.

713
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,171
Everything's a personal attack,
a goddamn battle.

714
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,871
Well, maybe...

715
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,702
Maybe we change
the rules a little bit.

716
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,052
Just ease up on
the communal sharing. Maybe we--

717
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:06,578
Maybe we just give him a whole
wing of the goddamn house!

718
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:09,494
That's not what I mean.

719
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:11,670
I mean, it doesn't help--

720
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,845
Oh, fuck this!

721
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,415
Whoa, what are you doing?

722
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:19,025
I'm gonna have a chat
with our little friend.

723
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,418
Donna!

724
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,030
Get up.

725
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,074
What?

726
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:26,989
Get your shit.

727
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,818
You don't like the rules here,
you can live somewhere else.

728
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,648
Get the fuck out of here.

729
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:35,737
Jesus!

730
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,043
Get the fuck up!

731
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:38,131
Okay.

732
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,048
Okay.

733
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,486
You wanna tell me
where we're going?

734
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,705
You'll see.

735
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:55,931
Come on.

736
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,065
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

737
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:06,072
Well, I don't want
people staring at it

738
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:07,116
when they're eatin'.

739
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,944
Can't say I blame you.

740
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:16,648
Welcome to your new home.

741
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:18,954
What?

742
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:20,782
Hop on up.

743
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:48,070
Now, this here is the talisman
from the Matthews house.

744
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,986
They won't be
needing it anymore.

745
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:54,642
What you're gonna wanna do
is hang it on the window.

746
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:57,558
And you wanna make
damn sure it stays there,

747
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,778
because if it falls down at
any point during the night

748
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,693
and one of those
things gets inside,

749
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:04,826
it won't matter if
you have a dozen of those.

750
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:08,656
If they're on the floor at
that point, they're just rocks.

751
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,009
You done swinging
your dick around?

752
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:16,969
You made your point.

753
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,014
No.

754
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:21,016
No, see,
I don't think I have.

755
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:25,760
You don't want anyone
looking through your shit, fine,

756
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:27,632
but I'll be motherfucked
if I let you hurt

757
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,329
any more of my people.
You understand that?

758
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:36,249
You really don't
get what's happening here.

759
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,774
Even after
everything you've seen,

760
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:43,822
you still can't process the fact
that this is actually real.

761
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:47,216
Now, seeing as you
don't strike me as

762
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:49,871
the brightest
of fucking bulbs,

763
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:52,744
I'm gonna bet that it
takes you longer than most.

764
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:55,137
So now you get to live here.

765
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:56,704
No shades on the window.

766
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:59,533
You get to see
everything that's happening.

767
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:02,188
Every night those things come.

768
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,800
There really is no way out.

769
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,199
Best of luck.

770
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:37,919
Excuse me?

771
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:41,619
Sheriff Boyd, right?

772
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,185
Yeah, sorry, I don't, uh--

773
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,143
Tillie.

774
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:45,710
Tillie. Hi.

775
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,711
- Hi, yeah.
- Hi.

776
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:47,973
I was on the bus.

777
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:49,627
Yeah.

778
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:52,107
This, uh, wasn't exactly
my preferred destination.

779
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:57,896
I understand you yourself
had a bit of an adventure.

780
00:43:58,026 --> 00:44:00,942
Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

781
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,770
I need to go
speak with my deputy.

782
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,990
You won't find him in there.

783
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,253
I just saw him heading
towards that medical building.

784
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:26,751
I, uh...

785
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,276
...went to look for
you at the church.

786
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:36,456
You know,
before we came here...

787
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:42,941
...I don't think I ever once
remember seeing my mom cry.

788
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:48,381
I'd see her mad.
I'd see her stubborn.

789
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,774
I'd see her frustrated.

790
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:55,475
And now every
single night...

791
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:00,436
...I hear her sobbing
in her room,

792
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,265
because she's convinced
that it was her fault...

793
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,921
that if she had
been here with my dad...

794
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:11,143
that he wouldn't have
gotten out of the basement...

795
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:18,324
...and he wouldn't have opened
the door to let those things in.

796
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:24,852
But he didn't
open the door, did he?

797
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:29,335
No.

798
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:33,513
You knew.

799
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:37,865
I found out
the night before I left.

800
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,433
Kenny--

801
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:43,871
Don't.
Don't fucking touch me!

802
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,525
I was going to tell you.

803
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:47,222
When exactly were you
planning on telling me?

804
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:54,273
She's going in the Box.

805
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:57,015
No.

806
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:58,494
She's going in the fucking Box!

807
00:45:58,625 --> 00:45:59,713
Kenny--

808
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,236
She killed my dad!

809
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:04,762
They tore him to pieces
and you knew!

810
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:06,459
You fucking knew!

811
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:08,417
Kenny, please, Kenny.

812
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:11,072
Li--

813
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:17,339
You watch your own fucking six.
