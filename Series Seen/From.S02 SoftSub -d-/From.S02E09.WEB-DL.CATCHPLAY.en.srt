1
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:04,505
- Previously, on From...
- There's darkness in the forest.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,965
Nightmares you can't even
begin to imagine.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,382
- Anghkooey!
- Anghkooey!

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,176
No, no, no, no.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,387
No, no, no. Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,226
- Hey! Hey! You okay?
- Did you see them?

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,977
- See what? See who?
- What the fuck?

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,648
Eloise said that's where
my mother went that night.

9
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,900
The night that bad things happened,

10
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,028
she went to save
the children locked in the tower.

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,239
- This mean a lot to you?
- Please.

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,657
Yeah? Fuck you.

13
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,784
You ever come near my mom again,

14
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,662
I will drag your fucking psycho ass
into that box myself.

15
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,914
We pulled something out of that thing.

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,290
Only problem is
we gotta figure out how to get this

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,127
inside another one of those things
without getting ourselves killed.

18
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:45,504
Make some silver bullets.

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,342
You think this place
is one big experiment, right?

20
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,513
And it never occurred to you that some
of the people here might be in on it?

21
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,433
I mean, they'd have to be. How else
do you keep the experiment on track?

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,981
- Randall, what the fuck?
- New plan.

23
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:09,278
Elgin had a dream that he was drowning
and then he started spitting up water,

24
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,532
- and you had cicadas in your dreams, and...
- When the music box started playing,

25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,243
one of them jumped out
and it burned my arm.

26
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,788
Are you honestly saying that
our fucking dreams can hurt us now?

27
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,456
Do you hear that?

28
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,001
Help me!

29
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,753
Please. Please, I need help.

30
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,726
She said...

31
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,646
she said she was gonna take a nap.

32
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,775
I was downstairs.

33
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,237
And I heard her screaming.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,535
I came in, I started shaking her and...

35
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,583
trying to wake her up, and she kept...

36
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,294
She was talking in her sleep.

37
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,674
Saying something over and over.

38
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,594
And then she...

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,433
Something cracked inside her, and her body

40
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,019
and her face...

41
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,982
God. Jesus.

42
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,276
What did she say?

43
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,694
What?

44
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,947
You said she was talking.
What did she say?

45
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,282
I... I don't... I...

46
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,494
- Hey, Reggie.
- I can't... No.

47
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,872
Reggie, hey. Listen, Reggie.

48
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:49,044
I need you to tell me what she said.

49
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,630
Okay.

50
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:55,925
It was...

51
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,724
"They touch, they break...

52
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,522
they steal."

53
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,858
"No one here is free."

54
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,821
And then she just...

55
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,116
Her face just fucking...

56
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,913
And was she still asleep?
Are you sure she was asleep?

57
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:30,711
- Yes, I'm fucking sure!
- Okay, okay. I...

58
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,422
Okay.

59
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,216
Okay. We need to...

60
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:43,390
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.

61
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,336
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah,

62
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,922
little man, everything's great.
Hey, do me a favor.

63
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,050
Do you mind heading home for me, okay?

64
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,013
And do you mind
if your sister stays here for a bit?

65
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,725
Thanks, bud.

66
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,895
Yeah, go on home.
I'll be right behind you.

67
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,480
Okay.

68
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,608
Later.

69
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,612
- We go, you come help make dinner.
- All right.

70
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,033
Kenny.

71
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,789
Listen, we gotta...
we gotta tell the people door-to-door.

72
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,708
Okay, we got 30 minutes left of daylight.

73
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,920
You and Julie cover the town,
I'll go to Colony House.

74
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,964
Reggie will come with me.
We can't leave anyone alone.

75
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,301
What about Sara?

76
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,807
Boyd, what's going on?
What happened in there?

77
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:11,436
Something killed Paula.

78
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,981
But it's not dark yet. I don't...

79
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,401
There's something else here now.
Something new.

80
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,116
It's not safe for anyone
to go to sleep tonight. Okay?

81
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,829
My dad, he's out at the RV.

82
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,372
Okay.

83
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,627
- Randall. What the fuck?
- It's a new plan.

84
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,882
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Oh, yeah?

85
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,218
What are you doing?

86
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,639
- Donna, I'm so sorry.
- Don't apologize to her.

87
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,767
We were right. She's fucking part of this.

88
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,101
Part of what?

89
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,815
I saw you. Up at the clinic.

90
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,734
Yeah. That's right, I followed you.

91
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,279
They were carrying
one of their "monsters" out of the clinic.

92
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,784
What are they? Some kind of animatronic?
You got a faulty model, huh?

93
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,745
- That was a body, you dumb shit.
- Okay.

94
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,706
Boyd killed one of them.

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,666
- He what?
- He killed one of the monsters.

96
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,460
So now they can fucking die?

97
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,713
It's funny how suddenly
the rules fucking change

98
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,384
- once someone catches out your bullshit.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

99
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,846
I thought you'd be more...

100
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,974
This was your idea.

101
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,894
No. This?

102
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:38,105
This... this is fucking crazy.
This was not part of the plan.

103
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,275
She's part of the reason we're still here.

104
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,360
- Fuck her!
- We are not doing this.

105
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,950
You know what I'm startin' to think, Jim?

106
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,413
Maybe you just put this shit
in my head to see what I would do.

107
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,666
How do I know
that you're not part of this, huh?

108
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,504
'Cause my house collapsed on top of me.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

109
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,849
- Jim.
- You wanna dance, Jim?

110
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,899
Drop the fucking knife.

111
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,276
You gonna shoot me?

112
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,116
Okay.

113
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,993
Now, stand over there.

114
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,417
You all right, Jim?

115
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,629
I'm so sorry,
this wasn't supposed to happen.

116
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,257
- Get her.
- Just get me off this fuckin' tree.

117
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,095
We got about five minutes
to get in that van

118
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,889
and get back to town. Who's got the key?

119
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,599
- I don't know.
- Jim.

120
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,851
You mean these keys?

121
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,187
- Hey, don't...
- Hey...

122
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,983
- Oh, fuck.
- Are you outta your goddamn mind?

123
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,569
Guess we're gonna have to stay
the night and see what happens, huh?

124
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,868
Julie, come back inside, honey.

125
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,330
I shouldn't have let him go,
I should've stopped him.

126
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,749
- He's gonna be okay.
- Hey!

127
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,625
The hell's goin' on?

128
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,128
Victor says we can't go to sleep.

129
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,297
Julie, come inside, honey. Come on.

130
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,885
We can't just leave him out there.

131
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,011
Can we go get him?

132
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,184
No, no. Mom's right. Dad's gonna be fine.

133
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,730
- We just... We need to stay inside.
- Yeah.

134
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,817
- I wanna get Dad.
- Hey.

135
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,445
Boyd isn't gonna let
anything happen to your father.

136
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,034
The best thing
we can do for Dad is to be safe.

137
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,139
Thank you for doing this.

138
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,475
I know you don't wanna be here.

139
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,395
I'm not doing it for you.

140
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,487
Things here feel different now.

141
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,449
They feel wrong.

142
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,914
It felt that way out in the forest.

143
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,960
Did Boyd ever tell you
what happened out there?

144
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,724
The further we went out,
the more it felt like...

145
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,942
Boyd said it was like this place feeds
on our pain.

146
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,152
But what if it does more than that?

147
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,865
What do you mean?

148
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,042
Nathan was always terrified of cicadas.

149
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,005
When we were kids, our stepfather

150
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,216
would take us
on these week-long camping trips.

151
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,554
And all night long,
the cicadas would buzz outside our tent.

152
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,724
Nathan would cry the whole night.

153
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,602
He thought they were monsters.

154
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,650
What if the people who die here...

155
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,948
What if their fears
become part of the forest?

156
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,787
What if that really is
Nathan's nightmare out there?

157
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,697
- He's in here.
- Tell me what happened.

158
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,491
She... she went to sleep

159
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:50,288
and something... broke her.

160
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,210
Where's Donna?
I'm supposed to talk to Donna.

161
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,255
- Donna's not here right now.
- She left the clinic hours ago.

162
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,509
- Did she say where she was going?
- Yeah, she said she was coming here.

163
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,304
We're all gonna fuckin' die.

164
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,850
No, hey, Reggie. Look at me. Listen.

165
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,852
You need to tell me
exactly what Boyd said.

166
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,398
We can't go to sleep.
No one goes to sleep.

167
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,943
Okay, okay, great.
Then that's what we focus on.

168
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,696
Yeah? Wherever Donna is,
she and Boyd are gonna figure this out.

169
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,533
So how about right now,
we just focus on doing our part, yeah?

170
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,577
How about you and I
go get you a change of clothes,

171
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,915
and everybody partner up.
Make sure nobody falls asleep, yeah?

172
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,459
Yeah, for how long?

173
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,672
We'll figure that out
when we get to it, yeah?

174
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,842
Hey, Elgin, partner up.

175
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,345
Come on, guys, let's go.

176
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,060
- You guys doing okay?
- Is there maybe a room we could use?

177
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,812
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,438
- Thanks.
- Come on.

179
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,648
Hey, come on.

180
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,900
- You okay?
- Come on, we'll get you upstairs.

181
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,163
What do you mean we can't go to sleep?

182
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,751
Jim, why the hell do you think
I'm out here? Your daughter is terrified.

183
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,422
Just put that over there for me, please.

184
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,591
Okay.

185
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,260
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

186
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,304
Pick a lane, Jim.
Don't you see what this is?

187
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,099
- Not now.
- We come out here,

188
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,685
we actually have them by the balls,
and Sheriff fuckin' DoReady

189
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,105
comes out here with a new story
and you're just like...

190
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,525
No wonder your family's a fuckin' mess.

191
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,110
- Son of a...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

192
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,237
- What...
- Jim!

193
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,656
Hey, hey, hey! What the...

194
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,324
Fuck!

195
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,579
Hold on, hold on. Now hold on. Yeah, yeah.

196
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,874
I am only gonna say this one time, okay?

197
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,836
Whatever stupid fuckin' ideas
you got locked

198
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,465
in that rock-hard head of yours,
they are gonna get you killed.

199
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,050
Or worse off,
they're gonna get one of us killed.

200
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,386
And I'm not planning
on dying here tonight.

201
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,264
Shut the fuck up and sit down.

202
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,141
Yes, sir.

203
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,645
And you.

204
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,898
After all the shit
you've been through here, huh?

205
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,485
- You still think this is a fuckin' game?
- I was trying to...

206
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,947
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

207
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,783
So you led a pig to shit and now
you're surprised he made a mess?

208
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,702
Hey, fuck you.

209
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,162
Fuck you.

210
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,917
I've gotta get back to my family.

211
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,085
- Yeah.
- These old vans,

212
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,005
they've got a pretty basic
ignition system even without the keys,

213
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,215
I think I can probably...

214
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,759
Hey, I'm not gonna lose another person
to "probably," you got me?

215
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,262
We are barely making it through right now,
do you understand what I'm saying?

216
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,055
Hey, I said sit down.

217
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm not listening
to this shit all fuckin' night. Okay?

218
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,688
Sit down.

219
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,484
All right. I don't know what your deal is,

220
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,695
whether you're part of this,
or you're just fuckin' dumber than...

221
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,615
I lost my wife here.

222
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,662
My friend bled to death in my arms,
and you still think I'm lyin'?

223
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:23,042
You want proof? What if I tie your ass up
to one of those trees out there?

224
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,253
Let you find out for yourself.

225
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,772
This the freaky sex room?

226
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,986
First night's rough for some people.

227
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,530
It can get unpredictable.

228
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,661
I'm gonna go grab a few supplies, okay?

229
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,332
You're gonna be okay for a minute?

230
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,172
- Give me a hand?
- Yeah.

231
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,934
- She looks pretty rough.
- Yeah, tonight's gonna be the hardest.

232
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,147
I'm gonna need a pot, washcloth,
and probably some extra linens.

233
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,857
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

234
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,655
All right, look,
I don't really know how to ask this,

235
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,784
but this whole thing about not sleeping,
I mean, do we need to be worried?

236
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,705
About the baby, I mean,
they sleep in there, right?

237
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,708
I mean, if she were further along,
then yeah, maybe.

238
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,795
- But she's six, maybe seven weeks at most.
- Okay.

239
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,798
Look, of all things
we need to worry about tonight,

240
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,759
I promise you that's not one of them.

241
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,890
I mean, yeah, you know...
It's just weird, you know, it's like...

242
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,520
I just... there's a person

243
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,857
growing inside of my fiancée.

244
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:12,693
And anywhere else in the world,
I mean, that would be great.

245
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,695
You know, I would be thrilled, which I am.

246
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,324
But here, you know, I just...

247
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,327
I just keep expecting

248
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,663
that at any second
it's gonna come bursting out of her

249
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,748
with, like, with fangs,

250
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,625
- and claws.
- If it's any consolation,

251
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,836
pregnancy's weird,
no matter where you are.

252
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,673
I mean, it's beautiful,
but it's fucking weird.

253
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,509
We're just used to it
because we see it every day.

254
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,552
It's like the magic ball of fire.

255
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,137
The what?

256
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,263
It's this thing from med school.

257
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,934
The whole world. Even the parts
that we think we understand,

258
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,646
it's all really just one big mystery.

259
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,941
Floating through space
around a giant ball of magic fire

260
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,778
that keeps us warm
from a million miles away. I mean, it's...

261
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,488
it's fucking insane.

262
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,324
We're just used to it, that's all.

263
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,412
Pregnancy's weird.

264
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,292
I can't believe he had a sister.

265
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,170
How do you forget something like that?

266
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,632
I don't know, but you should've seen
his face when we opened the trunk.

267
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,217
It was awful.

268
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,679
Here. Look at this.

269
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,556
See this one.

270
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,391
- Yeah.
- Yeah, see the color of those uniforms.

271
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,852
These are civil war soldiers.

272
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,436
And why the fuck
would a little girl draw pictures of...

273
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:35,025
Wait. No, the pictures came from
the stories his mother used to tell.

274
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,278
All right, then why the fuck am I having
visions of a story some dead woman told

275
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,488
forty years ago?

276
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,420
Do you wanna see something really weird?

277
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,547
Look at this.

278
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,804
So Victor said his mother wanted
to rescue the children that were locked

279
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,930
in the tower.

280
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,266
That it was the only way
to get everyone home.

281
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,227
Since I got here, I've had dreams

282
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,189
about walking up
the steps of a tower just like this.

283
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,279
I mean, all this time I thought
the children were trying to scare me,

284
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,075
but what if
they're just asking for my help?

285
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,249
Okay, everyone come. Sit.

286
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,796
Hey, Ethan. Away from the window.

287
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,381
What are we doing?

288
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,718
We play. Feel better.

289
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,809
Yeah. I mean, if we can't go to sleep,
might as well have some fun.

290
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,645
Right?

291
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,152
Is my dad gonna die?

292
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:06,909
What? No. No, Dad is gonna be fine.

293
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,702
Are we gonna die?

294
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,665
No, no one is gonna die.

295
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,919
When Victor was little, everyone died.

296
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,507
- All at the same time.
- It won't happen like that again.

297
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,217
How do you know?

298
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,184
Look, I know
things are really scary right now,

299
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,605
but remember what the Cromenockle
would do when she got scared?

300
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,482
- She would always say...
- It doesn't matter!

301
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:39,984
She's not real!

302
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:44,029
Doesn't matter what she did.
It's just a stupid story.

303
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,622
My mother used to say
that everything is a story.

304
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:58,127
And we're the ones
who get to decide how it ends.

305
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:03,089
What about her story?
Did it end the way she wanted?

306
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,090
Ethan!

307
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,970
- Be good.
- I don't wanna play any games.

308
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,182
I'm so sorry.

309
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,151
So whatever was in your blood
that killed the creature,

310
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:25,029
- that creature's blood is...
- Bile.

311
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,282
- The what?
- It doesn't matter.

312
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,453
The point is, if it works,

313
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,832
- we're all walking back to town.
- And if it doesn't?

314
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,586
What do you care?
None of it's real, right?

315
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,923
- Why don't you let him do it?
- What?

316
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,635
He's not afraid to go outside,
so give him your gun,

317
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,970
see if these monster killers really work.

318
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,723
One way or another,
we get rid of the problem.

319
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,605
But make up your mind. They're coming.

320
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,775
- How many are there?
- I can see a few.

321
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,320
- Are they close?
- They're getting a lot fucking closer.

322
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,613
All right.

323
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,239
Showtime.

324
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,288
Hey, wait.
You're not gonna let him do this, are you?

325
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,916
He's a big boy. He can choose.

326
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,921
They're over here too.

327
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,714
Boyd.

328
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,969
It's gotta be now. You going or not?

329
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,473
All right.

330
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,396
If you have any second thoughts...

331
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,232
you better get your ass right back here.

332
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,746
- What the fuck?
- Hold on. What's goin' on?

333
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,874
- They've stopped.
- They stopped here too.

334
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,003
What?

335
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,255
Something's wrong.
They don't just do that.

336
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,467
- Do what?
- They don't just stop like that.

337
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,594
Fuck's sake, you people are just crazy.

338
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:26,817
Hey...

339
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,448
Oh, no, no. no.

340
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,719
Get the fuck away from me!

341
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,851
No, Mari, no. What are you doing?

342
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,269
- We have to get out of here.
- Stop.

343
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,813
- We have to go right now.
- Stop.

344
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,065
No, you don't understand.
There's something in here.

345
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,692
- It's just me.
- There's something in the room.

346
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,026
- It's just me and you, okay?
- No.

347
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,528
- There's nothing in here.
- It was a...

348
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,196
You told me once
that when you first went through this,

349
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,075
you saw a lot of things
that weren't there.

350
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,619
There was a guy downstairs.
He said that... that we...

351
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,038
He said that we can't go to sleep,
and that's all.

352
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,624
We know what the monsters look like here,
and they're all outside.

353
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,917
As long as you're in here
and you're awake, you're safe, okay?

354
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,169
- Now, please...
- Don't touch me.

355
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,380
- Mari.
- Don't fucking touch me!

356
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,508
Okay. I'm sorry.

357
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,096
You're sorry? Yeah. This is your fault.

358
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,474
You fucking... You disappeared.

359
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,603
I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep.

360
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,526
You fucking did this to me. You fucking...

361
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,324
I'm sorry.

362
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,994
- I didn't... I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I'm fine.

363
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,122
- We're okay.
- No!

364
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,875
No, we are not fine. We are not okay.

365
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,586
Just... Fuck!

366
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,215
I don't wanna be this.

367
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,927
- I don't wanna be this.
- Hey. Hey.

368
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,930
Come here.

369
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,019
Come here.

370
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,150
I'm right here, okay?

371
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,699
- You're okay. I'm right here.
- I'm sorry.

372
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,327
You're doing great, okay?

373
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,371
Come here.

374
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,146
We should put these on.

375
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,192
I don't think you have to do that.

376
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,779
Yes, I do.

377
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,949
Guess that one is mine.

378
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,663
Which one is yours?

379
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,465
Your mom once told me how grateful she was
that you were all together when you...

380
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,135
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,139
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

382
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,152
I...

383
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:05,035
I never really had the chance to...

384
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:10,082
I just want you to know that I'm sorry.
And I... I know...

385
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,335
I know it doesn't mean anything,

386
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,213
but if I could go back and...
and change what happened,

387
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,966
- I... I would.
- Stop.

388
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,511
I know...

389
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,098
it's painful for you...

390
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,143
seeing me every day.

391
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,062
For you.

392
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,110
- For your mom.
- Okay.

393
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,779
I told Boyd I wanted
to go back out in the forest,

394
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,699
that way, maybe, I could still help,
and he wouldn't have to...

395
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,951
I don't care!

396
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,870
All right? I don't care.

397
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,417
I don't give a shit what you want,
what you feel.

398
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,629
You don't get to sit here
and have a pity party.

399
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,967
Because you're a murderer.
You're a murderer and you...

400
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:07,472
should have gone in the box the second
that Boyd found out what you did.

401
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,517
I know what I've done.

402
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,520
I can never...

403
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,066
I'll never be able to take it back.

404
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,111
I've ruined people's lives.
What I did to you.

405
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,655
- Yeah, you do.
- To your mom.

406
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,907
- No. No.
- You guys were like family to me.

407
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,076
- And your dad...
- Shut the fuck up!

408
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,247
Shut the fuck up!

409
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,667
Don't fucking talk about my dad!

410
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,087
No.

411
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,631
- Excuse me?
- I said no.

412
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,470
I didn't ask for any of this.

413
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,931
You think you're the only one
who lost something?

414
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,768
I've lost everything!

415
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,021
Everything I was,

416
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,192
and everything I could have been is gone.

417
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,989
This place destroyed
the only person I ever get to be,

418
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,407
and I'm tired.

419
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:13,497
I'm tired of being afraid,
and I am tired of being ashamed.

420
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,542
I don't want to be here anymore. I don't...

421
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,586
I don't want to be your monster anymore.

422
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,131
I just want it to be over.

423
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,346
Okay. Okay, you want out?

424
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,849
Boyd keeps a spare gun
in the top left-hand drawer.

425
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,227
Do what the fuck you wanna do.

426
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,791
Wake up! Wake up!

427
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,836
You can't go to sleep.

428
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,797
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Are you listening to me?

429
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,049
The talisman will not protect you.

430
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,927
There is nowhere that you are safe!

431
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,263
- Reggie, stop! You're scaring everyone.
- They should be scared!

432
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,348
You didn't see.

433
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,059
- You don't understand what happens.
- Just take a second.

434
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,144
Hey, get...

435
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,312
Are you okay?

436
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,980
- Hey!
- Hey, you okay?

437
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,232
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Hey, hey. Calm down!

438
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,693
Hey, look at me. Stop. Breathe. Breathe.

439
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,571
- It's okay, it's okay.
- She was... She was my...

440
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,992
- I know, it's okay. It's all right.
- We're gonna die tonight.

441
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:36,371
- Tomorrow, every one of you is gonna die!
- Get him upstairs.

442
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,665
- Get him upstairs. Go.
- Get him out of here now!

443
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,835
- Hey, calm down.
- You don't understand.

444
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:47,090
- Stop! Let go of me, please! Stop!
- It's okay.

445
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,053
The thing,
it's in fucking pieces. How is it?

446
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,477
What are they waiting for?

447
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,691
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go outside

448
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,485
- and see if this thing works.
- No, Boyd. You can't!

449
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,988
Listen to me!
I've heard this music before, Donna.

450
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,283
And every time it plays, bad shit follows.

451
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,785
We gotta get the fuck out of here, okay?

452
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,544
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus!

453
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,837
- What the fuck!
- Fuck!

454
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,757
Fuck this, man.

455
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,593
There is no way, there's no space up here.

456
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,928
Hey, Jim, Jim, Jim.

457
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,847
- Hey, come here, come here. Come, come!
- What?

458
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,518
- Come here. Come, come here.
- What?

459
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,690
- Whatever happens, be ready to run.
- Okay.

460
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,492
No, fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck this.

461
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,622
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

462
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,336
Donna, move. Move.

463
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,842
Okay. Donna.
Hey, if you wanna see your family again,

464
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,344
- you get that fuckin' thing and go, okay?
- I got it.

465
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,438
Go! Go!

466
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,071
Boyd.

467
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,864
Boyd.

468
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,207
Shit.

469
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,797
Come back to me.

470
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,018
Boyd, come on!

471
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,431
Jesus Christ. What the fuck?

472
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,196
Help me! Help me!

473
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,751
Put that away.

474
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,837
Why?

475
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,175
It's what everyone wants.

476
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,719
Isn't it?

477
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,985
You were the one
who said I belonged in the box.

478
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:37,987
That's different.

479
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,572
How?

480
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,534
Put the fucking gun away.

481
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,294
If I was in the box...

482
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,758
it would be out of your hands.

483
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:04,680
It wouldn't be you killing me,

484
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,183
it would be this place.

485
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,564
I don't want to cause you anymore pain.

486
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,487
So we'll pretend that we're in the box.

487
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,867
And we'll let this place decide.

488
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,581
What the fuck are you talking about?

489
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,875
How many should we use?

490
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,085
One?

491
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,506
Sara.

492
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,717
Two?

493
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,219
- Hey. All right. Okay, hey, knock it off.
- Okay.

494
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,056
- Just two.
- Hey, that's enough.

495
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,391
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

496
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,228
No.

497
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,399
You don't get to decide.

498
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,239
Sara, it's okay.

499
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,077
Hey, Sara, stop!

500
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,454
Hey!

501
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,089
What the fuck is wrong with you?

502
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,887
- Yeah, so this is where you can hold...
- Okay.

503
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,179
- Hey.
- And you can tell 'cause it's...

504
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,223
- You doing okay?
- ...all taut and tight like that.

505
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:32,018
So you take... Just hold what you want.
You see, it's right there

506
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,145
Hey, how you guys doing?

507
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,732
- He's teaching me how to crochet.
- You are?

508
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,818
- Yeah.
- Good. Keeping her up?

509
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,822
You're doing a great job, you know?

510
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,741
The way you handled everything tonight.

511
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,494
You're gonna be a great mom.

512
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,290
You're pregnant?

513
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,295
Yeah.

514
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,174
- How did you know?
- Sweetie,

515
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:07,011
I've had four kids
and seven grandchildren.

516
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,348
I know an expecting mother when I see one.

517
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,186
Hey.

518
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,646
Hey, what's wrong?

519
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,900
I just remembered my dream.

520
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:27,991
Donna's back.

521
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,294
- Stop.
- It'll help.

522
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:41,921
I'm thirsty.

523
00:39:43,797 --> 00:39:45,383
I'll go get you some juice, okay?

524
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,469
Don't go.

525
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,015
I'll be right back, okay?

526
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,301
No.

527
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,275
It's not real. No! No!

528
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,369
No! No! No! Kristi! Kristi!

529
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,621
Kristi!

530
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:04,045
Get them off me! They're all over me.

531
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,422
- They're everywhere. I can't...
- There's...

532
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,883
there's... there's nothing on you.
I don't see anything.

533
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,884
Okay, just...

534
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,722
Just breathe, just breathe, baby.
Breathe in. Just breathe, just breathe.

535
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,266
I know, everybody, listen,
I understand. I...

536
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,976
How long do we have to stay awake?

537
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,268
- Yeah. What the fuck?
- If I... If...

538
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:23,398
- Why is this happening?
- Everybody just calm down,

539
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,567
all right? Just calm down.
We know you're scared.

540
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,654
We are trying to figure this out.
But the best thing you can do right now

541
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,534
- is just hang tight and do what Boyd...
- Get out of my way, okay?

542
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,078
- Hey, Jim!
- I gotta get back to my family, okay?

543
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,456
Listen to me. Every time that door opens,
it puts everybody here at risk.

544
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,458
When the fuck are we not at risk?

545
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,712
Hey! Stand down! Stand down!

546
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,549
- I need help up here.
- Fuck, that fucking door stays closed!

547
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,426
- Fuck!
- Mari!

548
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,552
Fuck.

549
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,596
He goes fucking nowhere. Get back.

550
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,681
- Come on, we gotta figure this out.
- Okay.

551
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,018
Marielle. Hey. Hey, hey.

552
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:05,773
- Marielle. Marielle.
- Hey, what happened?

553
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,527
I just left for a second. What the fuck
is wrong with her eyeballs? Look.

554
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,152
Marielle.

555
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,781
- Boyd, what the fuck is going on?
- Okay, okay, okay.

556
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,161
Just do something. Do something!
Boyd, do something!

557
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,956
No, hey, hey. Kristi, Kristi. No, no.

558
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,791
No, no, buddy, buddy.

559
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,794
Look at me. Hey, hey. Look at me.
Look at me, look at me.

560
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,713
She doesn't need her fiancé right now.

561
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,008
She needs a doctor. Okay?

562
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,636
So, calm down. All right?
And do your job, okay?

563
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,723
How? There's... there's nothing
medically I can do for her. I don't...

564
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,975
- I don't know how to help her.
- I know, hey.

565
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,351
I don't know how to help her.

566
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,104
- You can help her.
- Just fuck off, please.

567
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,564
Okay, hey, everybody. Clear out.

568
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,317
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Let's go. Give 'em space.

569
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,527
Listen to me. Hey, hey.

570
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,741
You help her by holding on,
do you understand?

571
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,535
She's still breathing. She's still here.

572
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,661
- You gotta calm down...
- Dad.

573
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,539
...get your shit together, and hold on.

574
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,873
- Dad.
- Not now.

575
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,126
Look, I think you need to hear this.

576
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,254
- Hey.
- I got this, go.

577
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,887
This whole time,
I felt like there was something that...

578
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,849
Like there was a reason
why I had that dream on the bus.

579
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,602
Like there was something
I was supposed to remember.

580
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,773
And I don't know but when Fatima said
she was pregnant, it all...

581
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,497
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

582
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:45,915
No, no, it's okay.

583
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,295
- I didn't... Yeah.
- About the dream.

584
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,758
There was this boy...

585
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,763
all dressed in white and...

586
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,978
he kept repeating
the same phrase, over and over.

587
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:14,527
"Here they come, they come for three,
unless you stop the melody."

588
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,489
Oh, wait. I know that one.

589
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,411
It's an old nursery rhyme.
My grandmother used to sing it to me.

590
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,290
They come... No.

591
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,751
They touch, they break, they steal

592
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:35,882
No one here is free
Here they come, they come for three

593
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,634
Unless you stop the melody

594
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,058
You realize what you're saying
sounds completely batfuck crazy?

595
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,477
Well, you were the one
that said everything's connected.

596
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,317
This. This is a connection.

597
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,069
What if Victor's mom is right?

598
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,948
What if saving those children
is how we all go home?

599
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,493
Get them off me!

600
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,036
Mom!

601
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,331
What's wrong? Julie! Julie, Julie! Stop!

602
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,458
- What's wrong with her?
- Julie, Julie. Julie, stop that!

603
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,960
- Oh, my god. Stop. What's wrong?
- Julie!

604
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,629
- Julie!
- What happened?

605
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,922
- Mom.
- Talk to me, sweetie, please.

606
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,217
- Get them off me!
- I can't, I can't.

607
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,219
Julie. Julie.
