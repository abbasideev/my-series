1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,586
Previously on From...

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:07,341
You ever wonder if Abby was right?
What if it's all just a dream?

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,302
- Who did you come here with?
- My mother.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,763
She was nice.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,139
What are you drawing?

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,432
Things that I've seen.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,393
It's good to draw them
when you see them, so even if you forget,

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,896
the pictures remember.

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,358
When Christopher started seeing
that symbol, things changed.

10
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,152
He changed. Everyone died.

11
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,155
- I've seen this.
- Yeah? Like, in a vision or something?

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,865
No. On the walls in the tunnels.

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,242
What tunnels?

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,118
You heard the voice on the radio.

15
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:39,790
That means that there are people
out there who can see us.

16
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,418
And what part
of you thinks that that's a good sign?

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,421
You already got people's hopes up
with your goddamn tower.

18
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:50,259
- All the more reason that we...
- To keep our fucking mouths shut.

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,928
What if I told you
that drone might get you home

20
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,764
in time for your nephew's birthday?

21
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,142
Experiments have been going on
like this for a long, long time.

22
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,894
This radio is pretty trashed.

23
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,646
The radio's not the problem.
I can handle the radio.

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,441
And it never occurred to you that some
of the people here might be in on it?

25
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,569
How else do you keep
the experiment on track?

26
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,405
You really did it. You killed one of them.

27
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,115
- What do we do with the body?
- This is our chance to learn about them.

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,660
We can open them up,
see what they look like on the inside.

29
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,703
- You fucking piece of shit!
- Kristi, stop it!

30
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,998
- Okay, stop it! Stop!
- Hey, hey, stop! Stop.

31
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,625
You really think injecting them
with that stuff's gonna kill them?

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,004
Honestly, I got no fucking idea,
but it's the best chance we got.

33
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,380
How are we even gonna test it?

34
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,715
I do have this little trick,

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,051
though, for when things
really start to get to me.

36
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,970
I fill up the bathtub,
and I sink down just enough

37
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,847
so that the water's level with my ears,

38
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,225
and I just sit like that
for a while and I breathe.

39
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,532
Ma.

40
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,367
Where's the family?

41
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,078
Everyone's still asleep. Are you hungry?

42
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,580
A little.

43
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,999
Sit down. I'm making your favorite.

44
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,710
Can I help?

45
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,502
You can set the table.

46
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,347
You should answer it.

47
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,986
Hello.

48
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:39,284
Hello?

49
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,163
Here they come. They come for me...

50
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,458
Who is this?

51
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,675
Is everything all right?

52
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,679
I don't know.

53
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,100
What is that?

54
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,976
They're not ready yet.

55
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:14,820
Hey, Son!

56
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,613
You were yelling.

57
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,703
I had a bad dream.

58
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,788
I'm okay.

59
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,973
What the fuck?

60
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,271
So, what's the point?

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,277
Well, I told you, once we re-establish
connection, we can start asking...

62
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,778
No, no, no, not the antenna.

63
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,946
I'm talking about this.

64
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:08,034
Let's say this is
one real big experiment. For what?

65
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,413
Well, there's a lot of value...

66
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,125
in seeing how far
you can push someone before they break.

67
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,712
Look what this place did
to that girl Sara.

68
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,802
The one who tried to hurt your kid?

69
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,008
Yeah.

70
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,553
I'll tell you,
the fact that she's still breathing...

71
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,473
you got a lot more restraint than I do.

72
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,436
I'm not gonna let
this place turn me into something I'm not.

73
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,688
Shit. If they really wanna break people,

74
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,649
I got a few ex-girlfriends
they could hire.

75
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,697
- All right. Let's give it a shot.
- All right.

76
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,706
There we are.

77
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,499
- Keep going.
- Yeah.

78
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,714
- Well, go... go higher.
- Yeah. That's it.

79
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,926
- What?
- That's it.

80
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,889
All right, bring it down.

81
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,809
I got it, I got it.

82
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,190
Look, let's say this thing works,

83
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,109
why would the people running
this thing wanna talk to you?

84
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,778
They already did it once.

85
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,154
Were they tryna help
or just tryna fuck with your head?

86
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,157
I mean, look at this,
look at where we are.

87
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,452
- Listen, if you don't wanna help, you...
- I'm not saying that. I just...

88
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:36,706
Look, if someone out here really wanted
to help, they would find a way to help.

89
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,043
But I still think we'd be better off
looking at the people in here.

90
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,130
Something this big?
You'd have to have someone on the inside.

91
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,341
Nah. You can't just start
throwing around accusations.

92
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,385
Look, I'm not saying accuse, I just...

93
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,555
Look, when you got here,
who told you what was what?

94
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,349
Who laid out all the rules?

95
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,352
Boyd, Donna,

96
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,271
- Father Khatri.
- Father who?

97
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,439
Khatri.

98
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,067
He died.
That night they got into the Colony House.

99
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,111
- Did you see it?
- See what?

100
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,279
Did you see the priest get killed?

101
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,410
No. Happened outside the sheriff station.
I wasn't there.

102
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:16,871
Right.

103
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,208
And of all the people
that died since you've been here,

104
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,919
how many times
have you actually seen it happen?

105
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,463
What's your point?

106
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,552
What if the people these "monsters"
are killing, what if they're all in on it?

107
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,471
I mean, you wanna scare
the shit out of people,

108
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,806
you need a body count, right?

109
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,308
Maybe that's why
they say when you get here,

110
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,852
you gotta keep your blinds down.

111
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,730
'Cause God forbid
you're looking out your window at night.

112
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,069
What about that guy Brick?
What about Tom?

113
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,739
I didn't see it happen. Did you?

114
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,367
I mean, yeah, I saw a body the next day,
but I didn't get close enough

115
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,035
to see if that shit was real.

116
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,663
Have you seen one ounce of proof
that anyone here has actually...

117
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,789
Nathan.

118
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,208
- What?
- Sara's brother.

119
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,086
You know, she killed him.

120
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,088
Slit his throat.

121
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,175
Or she didn't.

122
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,179
Let's just imagine
for a second that I'm right...

123
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,682
and everyone here that dies is in on it,
it's gonna mean one of two things.

124
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,808
One,

125
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,726
that they pushed Sara so far

126
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,396
that she actually killed someone,
of which, you know, maybe she did.

127
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,232
Or... like everything else,
that whole thing with Nathan,

128
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,735
him arriving just in time
to save your kid...

129
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,488
what if that's all just for show?

130
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,328
Maybe poor little Sara's
not as broken as you'd think.

131
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,549
Hey, Sara,

132
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,801
I was gonna come by and check on you.

133
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,969
I wanna go back out.

134
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,511
Excuse me?

135
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,308
To the woods. I wanna go back.
I'll pack a bag. Take a talisman.

136
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,976
What if you were right?

137
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,106
What if the answers are out there?
Maybe we just didn't go out far enough.

138
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,816
Well, we went far enough

139
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,527
that whatever's out there
put us right the fuck back here.

140
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,947
So, that's it? We just give up?

141
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,489
I didn't say that.

142
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,033
I get it. People need you here.

143
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,162
You shouldn't be out there.
But I can... Just let me do this.

144
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,540
Okay. Why?
Why'd you wanna go out there?

145
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,833
Because I wanna help.

146
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,168
I'm sure you do.

147
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,213
But that's not why you wanna leave. So...

148
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,133
There's no place for me here.

149
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,928
No one even wants me here.
And they're right, I shouldn't...

150
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,973
This is something I can do.

151
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,601
There's a difference
between going out there

152
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,227
and running away from here.

153
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,772
Leaving? That'd feel good. It'd be easy.

154
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,232
We don't get to do easy anymore.

155
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,865
I can't just sit in that church anymore.

156
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,951
There's nothing for me to do,
nowhere for me to go.

157
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,287
Okay, good.

158
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,456
Now we're talking
about problems we can fix.

159
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,504
Down there.

160
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,048
That's where I saw
your symbol, and it's...

161
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,677
also the first time I saw the children.

162
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,598
And those things that come out
at night, they're down there too?

163
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,933
- Yeah.
- All right.

164
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,563
This has to mean something.
It can't be a coincidence.

165
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,357
- Why?
- How much do you know about chaos theory?

166
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,948
A butterfly flaps its wings in Wyoming...

167
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,996
a month later, there's a tsunami in Japan.

168
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,666
And on the surface,
the two events appear entirely unrelated,

169
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,170
but in reality, there is
an intricate set of connections...

170
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,047
Jade, what the fuck
are you talking ab...?

171
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,215
It's not an accident! We just...

172
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,343
We need more information
to see how they're connected.

173
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,054
Well, I'm not going back in there.

174
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,807
Yeah, no shit.
I mean, you'd have to be crazy.

175
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,311
Motherfucker.

176
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,606
- What?
- Did Victor see it?

177
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,816
You told me Victor was
down there with you.

178
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,818
- Did he see the symbol on the walls?
- Of course!

179
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,987
- He was the one that pointed it out.
- Of course.

180
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,072
I asked him! I asked him point blank.

181
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:23,368
He promised to tell me everything
he knew about that symbol, yet somehow,

182
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,995
he manages to leave out.

183
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,626
You know, in the entire Venn diagram
of crazy that you and I have seen,

184
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,504
there's one single point of overlap.

185
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,562
Hi.

186
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,315
Is Ethan home?

187
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,277
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, come in.

188
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,613
I'll wait out here.

189
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,782
Okay.

190
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,744
Ethan, Victor's here!

191
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,628
You know, I never got to thank you

192
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,755
for everything you did
that night at Colony House.

193
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,925
I mean, getting me
out of there, you saved my life.

194
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,094
Okay.

195
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,847
- Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,433
- Okay, I'll be ready in two minutes.
- Okay.

197
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,852
We're gonna help Mrs. Liu at the diner.

198
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,562
I brought you something.

199
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,897
Are you gonna come in?

200
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,317
No, you have to come outside.

201
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,112
- Why?
- Because you have to try it on.

202
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,198
Come.

203
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,492
It's getting cold.

204
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,078
You'll need a coat soon.

205
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,497
This used to be mine.

206
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,833
Let me see if it fits.

207
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,920
Yeah.

208
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,470
Here. I drew this for you.

209
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,350
I don't want this.

210
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,518
Why?

211
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,896
Because pictures are
for things that are gone.

212
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,023
But what if something happens to me?

213
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,192
You forget a lot of stuff.
I wouldn't want you to forget me.

214
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,528
I said don't talk like that.

215
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:27,867
Well, if you don't keep it,
I don't want the coat.

216
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,580
Hey, you ready? We gotta go.

217
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:35,875
Wanna come?

218
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,671
- Okay.
- Come on.

219
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,551
- Nice jacket.
- Thanks.

220
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,890
- Are you sure you shouldn't be in bed?
- I mean, no, I'm fine.

221
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,434
You know, I'm not gonna be doing
any push-ups anytime soon,

222
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,560
but I feel great.

223
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:56,938
Seriously.

224
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,065
Did Kristi check you out?

225
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,317
Yeah, yeah,
and she was more surprised than you.

226
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,319
And what about Dale?

227
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,198
Donna's locked him up in his room.
Dad, everything is fine.

228
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,495
What are you smiling about?

229
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,833
I have some news.

230
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:22,171
- Corey said you were looking for me?
- Oh yeah, I'll... One second.

231
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,297
Yeah.

232
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,467
I'll tell you later.

233
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,760
I...

234
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,389
Okay, get some rest.

235
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,100
A'ight... Yeah, look, Dad,
I'm good, but go ahead.

236
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,020
Hey.

237
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,193
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I really don't need this today, Boyd.

238
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,111
I have a headache
like you would not believe.

239
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,365
I'm not asking you to let her stay here.
Look, just throw me a bone.

240
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,742
Give her something
to do, anything. I don't care.

241
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,037
- She just wants to feel useful.
- Okay, I'll do what I can.

242
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,497
Thank you.

243
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,292
But we have bigger problems
right now than Sara being bored.

244
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,586
I got a house full of people
on their last nerve,

245
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,296
a madman locked in the bedroom,

246
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,216
and last night,
Elgin almost drowned in his sleep.

247
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,760
Wha... He what?

248
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,097
Come in.

249
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,308
Hey.

250
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,935
I heard about what happened last night.

251
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,147
- What are you doing?
- I found these in one of the closets.

252
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,150
- Helps me relax.
- Good.

253
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,030
You wanna tell me about it?

254
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,073
This nightmare of yours.

255
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,492
I was...

256
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,454
I was sitting in the bathtub...

257
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,623
in my dream,

258
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,293
and something pushed me under the water.

259
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,921
Then I guess...

260
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,342
someone shook me awake,
and I started spitting up water, and...

261
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,761
How is it even possible?

262
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,727
You didn't tell anybody about anything
that happened at the clinic, did you?

263
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,191
Well, I got some good news.

264
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,445
We... pulled something out of that thing.

265
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,990
Something that might help us.

266
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,452
So, you think it's like a poison?

267
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,289
It could be. The only problem is
we gotta figure out how to get this

268
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,167
inside another one of those things
without getting ourselves killed.

269
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,712
You have a gun, right?

270
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,798
Yeah.

271
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,008
So make some silver bullets.

272
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,975
- No, you're making that up.
- I'm not.

273
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,518
Julie, tell him it's real.

274
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,979
- What's real?
- The Internet.

275
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,065
Oh! Yeah. Yeah, that's a thing.

276
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,734
- Told you.
- Victor. You come carry.

277
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,112
You're up.

278
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,616
Are you just gonna wear
that thing all day?

279
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,743
I like it.

280
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,036
Smells musty.

281
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,292
Ethan, you put here.

282
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,843
What's this?

283
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,638
Where did you...

284
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,100
- Where did you get that?
- It was in the pocket.

285
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,188
What's wrong?

286
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,278
I need you to be brave.

287
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,655
There you are. He's in here!

288
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,699
- Listen, we gotta talk.
- I have to go.

289
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,369
- What are you doing? Hey!
- We had a deal, remember?

290
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,663
I play you the song,
you tell me about the symbol!

291
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,955
Hey! Leave him alone.

292
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,084
- I told you about the symbol.
- You sure you told me everything?

293
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,254
You didn't tell me you saw it
on the wall down in those tunnels!

294
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,713
- Hey! Relax!
- What tunnels?

295
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,465
- Victor, we just wanna talk to you.
- I have to go.

296
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,133
- Hey!
- Mom, what's going on?

297
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,843
- Give me one reason... right?
- Stay here, honey.

298
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,554
- One reason why you wouldn't mention...
- Jade!

299
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,932
...that you saw this symbol
on the wall down in those tunnels.

300
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,976
- Just give me one!
- It's not important.

301
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,103
- It... Yes, it is! Goddamn it, stop!
- Hey, Jade, stop it!

302
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,481
- Stop it!
- No! No, I have done fucking around!

303
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,276
You... Hey! Look at me. You don't get
to pick and choose what you tell us.

304
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,073
Everything, everything you know,
everything you've seen, it all matters.

305
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,409
Because that may be how we go home.

306
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,746
Don't you want that?

307
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,249
Wouldn't you like to go home?

308
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,340
This is my home.

309
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,348
What is wrong with you?

310
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,142
Is it just physically impossible for you

311
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,686
not to be an asshole
for longer than ten minutes?

312
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,855
- Great, you're yelling at me again.
- Fuck off.

313
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,107
That didn't take very long.

314
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,817
Victor.

315
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,753
Sara... we were wondering
if we could talk to you for a minute?

316
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,588
About what?

317
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,715
We're just tryna get
our head around a few things.

318
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,926
- This is Randall. He came on the bus.
- I know who he is.

319
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,762
What do you wanna know?

320
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,935
You came with your brother?

321
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,561
Where were you going?

322
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,564
Back to Boston.

323
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,357
Where were you coming from?

324
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,317
Why does it matter?

325
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,403
What's going on?

326
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,157
We're just trying
to figure out if there's any pattern

327
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,075
to how people end up here.

328
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,910
We just want your help.

329
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,748
Pennsylvania.

330
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,335
I was living in New Hope, but it wasn't...

331
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,255
Nathan came to bring me back home.

332
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,257
So, you guys were close?

333
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,677
He was my best friend.

334
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,263
That day, at the barn...

335
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,266
No, I don't want to talk about that.

336
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,438
Sara...

337
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,525
I know you didn't want to hurt Ethan.

338
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,861
I know that.

339
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,823
And what this place did
to you, it isn't fair.

340
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,035
- But please...
- Is your brother still alive?

341
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,330
- What?
- It's a simple fucking question.

342
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,000
- Ease up.
- The hell is going on?

343
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,046
This is convenient.

344
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,089
Excuse me?

345
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,715
You just show up here out of nowhere

346
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,718
the moment we start
asking fucking questions?

347
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,887
- The fuck are you talking about?
- Nothing.

348
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,392
Boyd says you're looking
for ways to be helpful.

349
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,936
I got a bunch of clothes
that need stitching. You sew?

350
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,523
- Yeah.
- Great.

351
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,943
Here you go. Start with that.
You two, get the fuck out.

352
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,236
Who are you?

353
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,281
You think you're some kinda big shot?

354
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,701
Got a little power? Little pull?

355
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,872
'Cause you'd like that, right?

356
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,042
You know what you are?

357
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,045
You're a fucking tollbooth operator.

358
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,297
- You're gonna wanna leave right now.
- All right.

359
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,343
Everything's fine. Everything's okay.

360
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,220
We're gonna go right now, let's go.

361
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,946
You okay?

362
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:47,366
Why were they talking about Nathan?

363
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,910
Why do they think he's alive?

364
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,499
- What was that?
- What was what?

365
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,710
You wanna figure this thing out,
or do you wanna be everyone's friend?

366
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,045
I saw the look on her face

367
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,423
when you asked her about Nathan,
she doesn't know anything.

368
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,218
- Donna might.
- No. That's exactly what we cannot...

369
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,555
We cannot go around assuming
every little thing, okay? But look...

370
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,099
we need to watch.

371
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,934
What?

372
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,186
It's what you said about people
keeping their shades drawn at night.

373
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,648
These things that come from the forest,
we need to see what they do

374
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,693
when they don't know
they're being watched.

375
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,862
And how do we do that?

376
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,823
Go back to the bus. Go about your day.

377
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,618
When it gets closer to dark,
you sneak out, you meet me at the RV.

378
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:32,869
We'll stay the night out there,

379
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,497
maybe see some things
they don't want us to see.

380
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,047
Hey.

381
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,132
- Dad!
- Hey, how's it going in here?

382
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,676
Good.
We're just getting ready to clean up.

383
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,846
- Where's your mom?
- She said she was going to Colony House.

384
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,349
Victor and Jade were in here,
and Jade started yelling at him,

385
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,477
so I think
Mom just went to go check on him.

386
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,148
Are you okay?

387
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,611
Yeah, come here.
I wanna talk to you for a second.

388
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,574
- This one?
- Ethan, come.

389
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,534
- What's up?
- I'm not gonna be home tonight.

390
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,287
I got an idea.

391
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,080
Something that can get us out of here.

392
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:19,166
I just need some time to figure it out,

393
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,501
but I'm gonna be fine.

394
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,380
- I got a talisman, I'm gonna be inside.
- Inside where?

395
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,215
I'm gonna stay the night in the RV.

396
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,759
I'm telling you this so you won't worry.

397
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,513
When you see your mom,
you tell her I'm all right.

398
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,431
Okay?

399
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,976
Please be careful.

400
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,769
Always.

401
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,654
Jim... can I have a word?

402
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,073
- Look, if this is about before...
- Are you some kind of moron?

403
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,534
What?

404
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,244
What is wrong with you?

405
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,292
I'm just looking for answers,
same as everybody else.

406
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,586
- By taunting Sara?
- Come on.

407
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,923
You asked if her brother was still alive.

408
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,384
Look, I tried to talk to you about this.

409
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,305
Jesus Christ! Is this about
that fucking voice on the radio?

410
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,350
Why do you say it like it's strange
that I don't wanna just let it go?

411
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,270
Don't even tell me
you put this shit in Randall's head.

412
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,064
- Listen...
- No, you fucking listen.

413
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,569
That guy is a fucking powder keg.
If you start putting ideas in his head...

414
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,071
I didn't tell him about the voice. Okay?

415
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,827
Talking to Sara was stupid. I get it.

416
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,371
We all just wanna go home.

417
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,374
Are we done?

418
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,419
- Yeah.
- Okay.

419
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,182
Victor, I need you to be brave.

420
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,352
- But I'm scared.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

421
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,896
You just...

422
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,359
You just draw your pictures.
And no matter what happens,

423
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,196
you do not come out
until morning. I love you.

424
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,701
Mom!

425
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,111
- Hello.
- Hello.

426
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,280
May I come in?

427
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,367
Yeah.

428
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:07,542
I just wanted to say thank you
for the coat you gave Ethan.

429
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,586
That's very thoughtful of you.

430
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,676
I remember these.

431
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:21,013
Ethan said he found it in one
of the pockets, that you were upset.

432
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,475
Can I have that, please?

433
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,769
Yeah, of course.

434
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:31,900
Yeah. I hadn't seen it in a long time.

435
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,363
Victor...

436
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,828
why didn't you tell Jade
we saw that symbol in the tunnels?

437
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:49,667
Because it's not good
to ask questions. It's not good.

438
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,840
- People shouldn't go looking for answers.
- Why not?

439
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,095
Because they don't come back.

440
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,351
But looking for answers
is our only way out.

441
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,478
I don't think there is a way out.

442
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,148
I know you're afraid
that bad things might happen, but...

443
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,403
but Victor, bad things happen here,
no matter what.

444
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,906
If you know something that could help us...

445
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,414
My mother said that we were going home.

446
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,917
The night
that the bad things happened, she's...

447
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,130
she's... I don't know.

448
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,383
What? What did she say, Victor?

449
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,719
I don't remember.

450
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,430
- Come on, Victor, please.
- I don't remember.

451
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,484
The pictures might.

452
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,823
Well, your pictures were
inside the house when it collapsed.

453
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,450
No, not these pictures.

454
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,120
I put them somewhere else.

455
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,792
Put them away somewhere
where I would never have to look at them.

456
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,126
So I would never...

457
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,173
have to remember.
So that no one else would die.

458
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,636
Do you know where you put them?

459
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,909
Hey. I...

460
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,912
What happened there?

461
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,581
I...

462
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,752
I don't know. Somehow,
I managed to burn myself in my sleep.

463
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,754
It's nothing.

464
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,633
What?

465
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,343
Nothing.

466
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,262
Elgin, that kid from the bus,

467
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,516
he had a pretty interesting idea
about how we test our theory.

468
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,227
- Okay.
- Silver bullets.

469
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,564
What?

470
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,652
You take the bullets,
dip them in the bile, coat them,

471
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,072
fire from a safe distance. Then we see.

472
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,413
We're gonna need the rest of that bile.

473
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,707
I'm heading there now.

474
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,335
Deep breaths, okay?

475
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,296
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

476
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,050
What's going on?

477
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,761
Something's happening downstairs.

478
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,388
Okay, deep breaths.

479
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,851
Are you sure the sound
was coming from the boiler room?

480
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,190
- Okay.
- What were you doing down there?

481
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,817
Does it matter?

482
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,739
I haven't... This just happened.

483
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,784
- Do you really think that thing could...
- I don't know.

484
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:15,082
But if you see anything
coming from... up these stairs, you run.

485
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,376
Do you understand me?

486
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,337
- Yeah.
- Okay.

487
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,018
You don't need to be down here.

488
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,896
I'm good.

489
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,495
Go upstairs.

490
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,580
No.

491
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,083
Come on.

492
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,825
What the fuck?

493
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,577
Boyd.

494
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,497
- No, Boyd, wait...
- Hey.

495
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,691
Get her some water. Okay?

496
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,819
No, I mean,
this is what I was talking about earlier.

497
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:11,323
- What?
- I saw those things in the dream.

498
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,908
I saw those, I...

499
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,910
In my dream, I hung up the phone,

500
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,412
and I heard the exact same buzzing.

501
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,665
All right? And I looked
inside the pot, and it was full of them.

502
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,960
- Jesus.
- Look, okay, let's just try to calm down.

503
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,255
Wait. Elgin said that he had a dream

504
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,258
that he was drowning,
and then he started spitting up water.

505
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,136
And you had cicadas in your dreams,

506
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,556
and those bugs are swarming
in that thing downstairs?

507
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,099
No, it wasn't just the bugs.

508
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,560
When the music box started playing,

509
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,647
one of them jumped out,
and it burned my arm.

510
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,400
- Is that what you...
- Yes.

511
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,947
I'm sorry, are you honestly saying
that our fucking dreams can hurt us now?

512
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,739
- Marielle.
- Kristi?

513
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,492
- Hey, hey.
- You here?

514
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,619
I was hoping I could borrow some...

515
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,457
You look glum.

516
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,503
What the fuck's going on?

517
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,767
Victor?

518
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:28,567
You're a nice lady,
and Ethan is my friend, and I wanna help.

519
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,527
I know you do.

520
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,948
But I'm afraid to remember.

521
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,747
I know. But I need you
to be brave, Victor.

522
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,960
That's what my mother said
to me that night.

523
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,145
It's right through here, so...

524
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:54,801
I saw you less than two hours ago,

525
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,053
when the fuck were you planning
to tell me about this?

526
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,138
I'm telling you now.

527
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,599
No, I walked in on you
and caught you, it's not the same.

528
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,226
I needed time to...

529
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,603
I just didn't want anybody
jumping to conclusions.

530
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,772
- And since when am I just anybody?
- Donna.

531
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,274
No, no, no, don't give me
that patronizing bullshit.

532
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,110
You came to my house this morning,

533
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,404
looked me straight in the eye,
and you asked me for a goddamn favor,

534
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,282
knowing full well
this thing was down here.

535
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,326
Okay, you're right.
I should have said something. I'm sorry.

536
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,036
Okay, it won't happen again.

537
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,043
And you think you pulled something
out of it that can help kill the rest?

538
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,462
Well...

539
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,881
we found something that's worth trying.

540
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,591
All right.

541
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,094
Well, let's get a look
at this thing, then.

542
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,387
Okay.

543
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,390
Just watch your step.

544
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,560
This...

545
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,522
The fuck?

546
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,485
Jesus.

547
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,915
Piece of shit.

548
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,833
There were bugs.

549
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,170
Hundreds of them,
crawling out of the body.

550
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,506
Look, Kenny saw them too.

551
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:16,466
They probably scattered.

552
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,635
We closed the door.

553
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,514
You need to burn this thing.

554
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,849
Now.

555
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,026
Make sure you get it out far enough,
people don't see the smoke

556
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,027
and get curious.

557
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,195
Right.

558
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,614
Just push.

559
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:43,326
- So, look, this stuff with the dreams.
- Yeah?

560
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,371
We burn the body,

561
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,957
and that should take care
of whatever has...

562
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,625
has been...

563
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,963
But still, it's probably
a good idea if people sleep in shifts.

564
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,256
Just in case.

565
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,841
What about Sara?

566
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,136
I'll bring her to the sheriff's station.

567
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,471
You and Marielle should come too.

568
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,181
Hey, look, I've seen withdrawals before,

569
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,768
and that's about to get
a whole lot worse before it gets better.

570
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,479
I'm not staying
under the same roof as Sara.

571
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,357
We'll stay at Colony House,
if that's okay?

572
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,109
The more the merrier.

573
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,819
All right, then.

574
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,655
I forgot, do you have any aspirin?

575
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,282
No, sorry.

576
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:26,202
Great. You have fucking monster bile
and no aspirin.

577
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,122
- Try a warm compress.
- Fuck right off.

578
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,172
- Hey, come on.
- Jesus.

579
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,008
Would you...

580
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,718
Are they in there?

581
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,764
Do you want me to look?

582
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,989
Victor, I need you to be brave.
I'm counting on you.

583
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,001
No, please...

584
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,544
Hey, it's okay.

585
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,797
- Victor, Victor, what's wrong?
- No, no, no, no.

586
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,050
No matter what happens, you cannot leave.

587
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,309
You need to protect your sister.

588
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,018
Please don't go, Mommy.

589
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,814
These aren't mine. They are not mine.

590
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,315
- What?
- They were hers.

591
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,652
You just draw your pictures, okay?

592
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,321
And you stay here all night.
And when I come back,

593
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,116
we're gonna go home. I love you.

594
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,203
No!

595
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,540
Oh my God, Victor. It's okay, it's okay.

596
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,377
Okay. Okay. Protect your sister.

597
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,128
- Mommy, no, no!
- No, don't go!

598
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,175
- No...
- Victor, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

599
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,010
- No!
- Yes, it's okay.

600
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,305
Mommy, wait!
Please, I wanna come with you!

601
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,931
Eloise, no!

602
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,436
Okay, it's okay.

603
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,031
It's okay.

604
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,951
Eloise?

605
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,830
Eloise. Come back.

606
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,349
Donna...

607
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,060
I come in peace.

608
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,438
What do you want?

609
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,274
To apologize.

610
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,651
Sincerely.

611
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,239
Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot...

612
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,078
I was just hoping that we could talk.

613
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,791
We're all in this together.

614
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,547
Okay.

615
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,425
Okay.

616
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,660
You wanna do the honors?

617
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:57,121
Yeah.

618
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,264
You know, I thought I'd gotten
so used to being scared that it just...

619
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:17,725
felt normal.

620
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,396
This feels different.

621
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,440
I know.

622
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,693
I mean, it's one thing
having monsters come out of the forest.

623
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,862
They start coming out of our dreams?

624
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,451
That's a kind of scary
I can't even imagine.

625
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,206
Yep.

626
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,263
Mama told us to hide, and I...

627
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,976
I was supposed to take care
of her, protect her.

628
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,064
But she was so scared
that she ran, and I...

629
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,154
I was so afraid that I...

630
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,489
I should have run after her, and...

631
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,242
Victor, you were just a little boy.

632
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,705
I didn't come out until morning.

633
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,008
We should go.

634
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,638
Victor, what is this?

635
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:40,850
That's...

636
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,898
Eloise said that that's
where my mother went that night.

637
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,567
The night the bad things happened.

638
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,781
She went to save
the children locked in the tower.

639
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,165
- See, that was fun.
- Yeah.

640
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,794
You do good work. You come back tomorrow.

641
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:09,712
Hi, Sheriff!

642
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,797
How you doin' there, young man?

643
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,341
Good.

644
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,093
Good. You guys working?

645
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,260
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

646
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,344
Hi.

647
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:20,931
Do you hear that?

648
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,236
Oh God! Help, somebody!

649
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,447
Help me! Please!

650
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,282
Please, I need help!

651
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,868
Oh God!

652
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,141
Randall?

653
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,477
Jim?

654
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,994
Randall, what the fuck?

655
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,079
New plan.
