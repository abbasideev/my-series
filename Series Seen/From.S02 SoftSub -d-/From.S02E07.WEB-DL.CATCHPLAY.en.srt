00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,854
Previously, on From...

2
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:09,901
- Anghkooey.
- Anghkooey.

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,863
- No, no, no.
- Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

4
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,990
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me! No!
- Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

5
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:15,533
No! Don't!

6
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:17,993
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

7
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,579
- Did you see them?
- See what? See who?

8
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,832
We heard a voice on the radio.

9
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:28,253
He knew my name, knew what my wife
was doing in the house, in the basement.

10
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:30,548
- Jim?
- I think people are watching us.

11
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:32,758
We've gotta start
working together on this.

12
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:33,843
I gotta go, Jim.

13
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:37,970
You were on your way to rehab
and you ended up here.

14
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:39,223
Did you take anything?

15
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:41,642
- Yeah, just a little bit of morphine, so...
- Marielle.

16
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:44,604
Okay, fine. Do whatever the fuck you want.

17
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:49,357
They're coming. You have to get out
before the music stops.

18
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:54,363
I'm sorry. My blood...

19
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:58,283
"...is your blood now."
Look, I got worms under my skin

20
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,786
and it feels like
something's coming for me now.

21
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:04,540
I can't have new people
stealing what little food we have!

22
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:06,417
- Get outside.
- Dale, come on.

23
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:07,543
Get off me!

24
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:10,796
Open the door!

25
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,590
Boyd, Kenny, I'm gonna need you out here.

26
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,176
- Breathe in, okay?
- Ellis, what's happening?

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,513
- We're gonna relieve the pressure, okay?
- Okay.

28
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,932
- You can't put my blood into him.
- Boyd.

29
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,977
Whatever's inside me
is going to go into him.

30
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:26,521
- Boyd.
- I got an idea.

31
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:33,819
My blood is your blood now, motherfucker!

32
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,164
- I almost lost him.
- But you didn't, okay?

33
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:47,667
I need to ask you something.

34
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,210
Yeah, of course.

35
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:53,256
Do you have any pregnancy tests?

36
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:00,680
Are you sure?

37
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,184
As sure as I can be
given the circumstances.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,355
Have you said anything to Ellis yet?

39
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:14,151
No. No, not yet. I...

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,112
I know these
aren't the most ideal conditions,

41
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:20,741
but women have been giving birth
for thousands of years.

42
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:22,451
Right.

43
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:24,954
And...

44
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,958
not all of them
have a third-year medical student

45
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:29,959
to guide them through.

46
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,337
Look, talk to Ellis, the three of us can...

47
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:36,924
I can't.
I don't wanna say anything to him yet.

48
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:42,763
- Hey, sun's coming up.
- Yeah, we'll be right there.

49
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:45,099
Fatima, what's going on?

50
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:47,935
- Fatima...
- We should go.

51
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:50,354
I'm telling you, we should go.

52
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:08,413
All right.

53
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:42,823
Jesus.

54
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,326
You really did it.

55
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,621
You killed one of them.

56
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,957
What do we do with the body?

57
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,252
- We should burn it.
- No.

58
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,172
We take it inside.

59
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:00,966
Tell me you're joking.

60
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,095
No, he's right,
this is our chance to learn about them.

61
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:08,099
We can study them, open them up,
see what they look like on the inside.

62
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:10,767
We don't even know
if it's safe to touch this thing,

63
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,520
you're talking
about operating on it.

64
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:16,273
You guys?

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,442
Kristi.

66
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:20,486
It's your call.

67
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,154
Let's bring it in.

68
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,409
I'll get a sheet. We can drag it.

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,077
Thanks.

70
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,288
- I'll grab some sticks.
- Ellis.

71
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,166
I need you to head back up
to Colony House.

72
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,795
No, I wanna stay.

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,548
You do that, we gonna have dozens
of people coming to check on you.

74
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,174
And we gotta keep this quiet.

75
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:45,094
At least until we have a chance
to get a look at it.

76
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:48,389
Hey, Kristi,
are you good if we head back?

77
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,558
Yeah, but you gotta take it easy.

78
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:54,103
You come back to me immediately
if you have any trouble breathing, okay?

79
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:56,939
Keep the bandage nice and dry,
and I'll check on you later.

80
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:57,982
Okay.

81
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,275
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

82
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:01,152
- Elgin.
- Yeah?

83
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:04,822
What?

84
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,365
You all right?

85
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,118
I'm fine.

86
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:14,165
- Be careful.
- Yeah, always.

87
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:22,964
Let's go.

88
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,717
You guys.

89
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:28,721
All right, can we please just stop
and talk about this for a second?

90
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,723
Kenny, what is there to talk about?

91
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:37,396
You are about to willingly
bring something evil into your home.

92
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,607
Do you understand that?

93
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,025
I do.

94
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,445
I also understand that we may never
get this opportunity again, so is that it?

95
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:47,363
Okay?

96
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:54,705
Let's go.

97
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,547
Is Ellis gonna be okay?

98
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,467
How the fuck should I know?

99
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,720
I spent the whole night
putting food in salt water.

100
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:17,097
Well, what are you gonna do with me?

101
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,641
You gonna put me in the box?

102
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:23,812
That's what they do down there
in town, right? Is that who we are now?

103
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,069
I'm sorry about what happened to Ellis,
I really am. He's a...

104
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,405
He's a good kid.

105
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,787
But I'm not wrong
about those people from the bus!

106
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,789
There's too many people here.

107
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:44,541
And I saw how much food
you brought down yesterday.

108
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,293
There are some hard choices coming

109
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,628
and no one here
seems willing to make them.

110
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:52,758
I'd be careful how much you lobby
for people to make hard choices.

111
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,229
No one gets in or out.

112
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:06,522
Right.

113
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,773
So what happens now?

114
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,234
- We see how Ellis is doing.
- And then what?

115
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,279
You can't honestly expect us to live here
with someone who tried to kill us.

116
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,658
He wanted us to go outside
in the middle of the night.

117
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,409
He was ready to put both of us out...

118
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,952
Yeah, I heard the recap.

119
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,080
And I'm asking you
what you're gonna do about it?

120
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:26,417
Donna! The van just pulled up.
Ellis and Fatima are back.

121
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,839
Listen, I promise you, you are safe here.
And we are gonna figure this out.

122
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:33,340
You're one of us.

123
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:36,969
The fuckwad in the room notwithstanding,
we take care of our people.

124
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:43,684
Okay. Everyone, come on.
Give him room. Okay?

125
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,857
Come here. Okay, okay. Lean right on me.

126
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,693
Okay, I got ya.

127
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:55,946
Okay, here you go. Easy does it.

128
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:58,449
Easy does it.

129
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,953
- I think we should flip them.
- No.

130
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,331
- But they're ready.
- Not ready.

131
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,958
Hey, never argue with a master chef.

132
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:13,047
You've given away
the secrets of the trade?

133
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,758
I wanna see Victor today.

134
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,134
So do I.

135
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,596
- I don't think that's a good idea, buddy.
- Why not?

136
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:22,847
I can take him.
I was gonna go up there anyways.

137
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:24,474
Nobody's going to Colony House.

138
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,894
Hey, Jim.
I think it's okay for them to go.

139
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:30,564
Could we talk outside for a minute?

140
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,486
Save me some pancakes, okay?

141
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,500
What's up?

142
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:53,921
I don't know what's going on with you.

143
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,047
Excuse me?

144
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:56,799
We have to be a team here.

145
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,719
So when I say no one goes to Colony House
and you immediately undermine me,

146
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,846
- it doesn't help.
- Okay, what do you wanna do?

147
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:04,723
Do you wanna lock them in the basement?

148
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,521
Two days ago, you took Ethan to confront
the person that tried to kill him.

149
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,690
- That was different.
- No, it was you and I accepting the fact

150
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:17,027
that we can't just lock them away
until we find a way home.

151
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,447
You want them sneaking out?
Because that's what will happen.

152
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:23,617
This way, we know where they're going,
we know they're together.

153
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,285
I just don't want our nine-year-old son

154
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,164
hanging out
with some emotionally-stunted freak

155
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:31,249
who walks around town
with a gun in his lunch box.

156
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,294
Wait, wait, wait, no.
That emotionally-stunted freak

157
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:37,548
saved your daughter's life.
And he saved mine.

158
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,716
Or maybe that's what
they want you to think.

159
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,761
I heard a voice on the radio.

160
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:47,766
- Why is that nothing to you?
- Because I think you're wrong.

161
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,394
I know you want all this to make sense.

162
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,064
I know you want there
to be a rational explanation,

163
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:57,067
but if you had been down in those tunnels,

164
00:11:57,442 --> 00:12:00,946
- if you'd seen what I saw...
- Maybe that's what they wanted you to see?

165
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:03,699
Oh, God.

166
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:07,535
Okay.

167
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:11,999
How did they do it?

168
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,958
How did they...

169
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,671
create monsters that come out at night?

170
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:22,634
Because I've seen those things.
Up close, Jim. I've seen them.

171
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,890
You are so sure
this voice you heard on the radio...

172
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,351
is the answer
to all those impossible things.

173
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,273
Have you ever stopped to wonder
if that voice was even a person?

174
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,941
Of course it's a person.

175
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:42,696
- What else do you think it was?
- I don't know.

176
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:47,242
And that is fucking terrifying.

177
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:49,535
You know what? But for now,

178
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:53,582
I'm gonna go back inside
and have pancakes with my children.

179
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,251
You're welcome to join us if you want.

180
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,375
Okay. You got it?

181
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:38,919
All right.

182
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:40,754
Okay, so...

183
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:42,798
how's this work?

184
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:44,966
What do you need?

185
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,469
It looks like
it has some sort of rib cage,

186
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:51,014
- so we'll probably need a saw.
- Okay.

187
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,809
There's a few
of those in the tool shed by the bar.

188
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:57,312
Gloves wouldn't be a bad idea, either.

189
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:58,939
All right.

190
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:02,484
Hey, Kenny, you think your mom
has anything in storage we could use?

191
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:06,863
Kenny?

192
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,535
You had worms or something
crawling underneath your skin,

193
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,082
and you put them inside
this thing and now it's dead.

194
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,458
Yeah.

195
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,128
So what happened to the worms?

196
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:23,755
Huh? Are they dead too?

197
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,259
- What do you...
- Excuse me.

198
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,761
Mari, hey!

199
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,139
Hey.

200
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:33,515
Mari.

201
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:36,476
Hey.

202
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:38,562
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

203
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,023
- Hey.
- You okay?

204
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:42,649
She's going through withdrawal.

205
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,780
- Is there anything we can...
- I need gloves

206
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:51,115
and something to cut through bone.
I don't want this thing down here

207
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,869
any longer than it needs to be,
so let's just do it and get it done, okay?

208
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,121
Please.

209
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,460
Hey, come on, let's go back here.

210
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,093
I'll go down to the shed.

211
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:20,312
Hey.

212
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:23,231
I'm sorry about the flyby, I was just...

213
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,275
- fucking around.
- That's all right.

214
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,362
You're pretty good with that thing.

215
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,615
It was supposed
to be for my nephew's birthday.

216
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,409
Figured I'd get my money's worth.

217
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:39,748
Hey, I...

218
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,167
I never thanked you for...

219
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:46,296
what you did the other day.
Helping out down in the basement.

220
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:48,673
You're welcome.

221
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,136
Though, seeing as your wife
wasn't even down there,

222
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:56,014
it kinda seems like you got those two
other guys killed for nothing.

223
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,810
That feel good just now saying that?

224
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:04,189
Buddy, fuck off, okay?
You said thank you. You're welcome.

225
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,441
Now, what else do you want from me?

226
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:11,238
- How much you think that thing can carry?
- What? Why?

227
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,782
Take a walk with me.
I wanna show you something.

228
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:17,369
- Where?
- Just down the road, outside town.

229
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,080
Oh, you want me
to help find your dog, right?

230
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:22,040
- What?
- You sound like one

231
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:24,209
of those fucking perverts
that hang out at playgrounds.

232
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:26,086
What is wrong with you?

233
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,590
Just leave me alone, okay?

234
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:35,929
What if I told you
that drone might get you home in time

235
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:37,514
for your nephew's birthday?

236
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:50,735
Did they move again?

237
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:53,989
What are you doing here?

238
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,534
- I came to see you.
- Go away.

239
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:00,704
Why are you being so mean to me?

240
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:03,248
I thought we were friends.

241
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:04,958
We are friends.

242
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,252
It doesn't feel like it.

243
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,671
I'm trying to protect you.

244
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,010
It's just...
It's safer for you to stay away from me.

245
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,470
Why?

246
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:20,682
Because bad things happen
to my friends here.

247
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,686
Well, what's the point
of being friends if we can't be friends?

248
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:28,773
Okay.

249
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,026
Bye.

250
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:39,284
The orange was dry.

251
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:41,619
What?

252
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,333
The markers you gave me.
The orange was dry. It was a bad gift.

253
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:49,294
Sorry.

254
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,593
There's a lot of measuring to do.

255
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,727
I guess you can help if you want.

256
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,123
They need you out there.

257
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,251
They can wait.

258
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,797
- Just go.
- There.

259
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,049
I'll be fine.

260
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,425
You're shivering. Here.

261
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,640
Just do what you need to do.

262
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,269
Just try to drink some water, okay?

263
00:18:48,478 --> 00:18:49,479
Yeah.

264
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,276
I'll be right back.

265
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:12,502
- She okay?
- Not great. She's trying to sleep.

266
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,380
Okay.

267
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,465
Let me help you with that.

268
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,259
I'm...

269
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,555
She's gonna be all right,
you know. She's got you.

270
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,732
When I met her,
she'd been sober for almost a year.

271
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:39,362
She worked so hard. She was so proud.

272
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,866
And then I...

273
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:44,993
- disappeared.
- Hey.

274
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:46,869
Hey, listen...

275
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,166
this is not on you.

276
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:53,417
I didn't even notice
she was going through withdrawal,

277
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,629
because I was so caught up
in that fuckin' thing.

278
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,713
- I...
- No. Kenny's right.

279
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,842
We have no idea what we're in for
once we open that thing up.

280
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,720
I know.

281
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:05,680
I know.

282
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,600
Are you scared?

283
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:15,273
Yeah.

284
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,111
Yeah, me too.

285
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,200
Okay.

286
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,163
Yeah!

287
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,376
You know it's a bar, right?
You don't have to knock.

288
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:37,837
What are you doing?

289
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:43,301
Well, you have arrived
at a fortuitous time.

290
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:47,472
I think I figured out how to make
the alcohol not taste like stomach acid.

291
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:53,394
I needed a project that wasn't terrifying.

292
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:55,521
Hey, come on.
Could you give me a hand with this?

293
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:57,773
No, I actually need to ask you a question.

294
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:04,071
When you found me in the woods
the other day, I was...

295
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:06,700
rolling on the ground and screaming.

296
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:08,993
You were not surprised.

297
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,247
Why?

298
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:15,500
I like you a lot better
when you're not yelling at me.

299
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,420
Oh, come on, Jade.
Just answer this question, please.

300
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:32,267
Your husband found me like that
once before.

301
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:34,352
He ever tell you that?

302
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:37,897
No. No.

303
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,317
Well, to be fair,
I wasn't entirely forthcoming

304
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,652
with the details.

305
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,407
If I recall correctly, I got up...

306
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,578
I told him to fuck off
and then I ran away.

307
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:53,705
What happened?

308
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,879
I was being attacked
by a very angry Civil War soldier.

309
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:04,883
What?

310
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:06,509
That's all you get.

311
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,095
You want more,
you gotta help me with this.

312
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,556
And you're not allowed to yell at me.

313
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,898
So you sent out a call for help?

314
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:24,027
Someone actually answered
and no one's doing anything about that?

315
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:25,487
Yeah.

316
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,449
And you think this is one big
mindfuck designed to...

317
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,911
Designed to what? See what we all do?

318
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,040
Experiments have been going on
like this for a long, long time.

319
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,211
And when you see the ones
that finally get declassified,

320
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,340
you start to wonder about the ones
they still manage to keep under wraps.

321
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,052
Holy shit.

322
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:53,306
- This where you and your...
- Yeah.

323
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,017
Fuck.

324
00:22:58,102 --> 00:22:59,103
Come on.

325
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,369
The key is the antenna.

326
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,665
Yeah, I can get
the signal up over the treetops.

327
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,167
That's why
we put it on the roof the last time.

328
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:25,797
Yeah, if we can strip
this thing down, get it light enough,

329
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,883
- this drone can carry it up...
- Yeah, I get it,

330
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,678
you can get the antenna up
as high as you want, right?

331
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:41,813
This radio's pretty trashed.

332
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:44,440
Radio's not the problem,
I can handle the radio.

333
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:46,317
You sure about that?

334
00:23:49,654 --> 00:23:52,156
- You think I'm crazy?
- I don't think you're crazy.

335
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:56,452
Shit, with everything
I've seen here so far,

336
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,830
you're the first person
that's making any sense. I'm just...

337
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:03,209
wondering why you haven't asked
yourself the obvious question.

338
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,128
And what's that?

339
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:08,214
Well, you think this place
is one big experiment, right?

340
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,174
And it never occurred to you

341
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:12,343
that some of the people here
might be in on it?

342
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:14,596
I mean, they'd have to be.

343
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,806
How else do you keep
the experiment on track?

344
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:24,772
Jesus. He stabbed you?

345
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:28,609
Yeah, things have been
a little intense around here lately.

346
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:31,195
But you guys are both okay?

347
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:33,364
- We're fine.
- Yeah.

348
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,199
Really, we're fine.

349
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:37,535
Okay.

350
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:40,704
Okay. Well,
I'll let you get some rest then.

351
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:41,664
Hey.

352
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:49,672
I miss you guys.

353
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:51,758
We miss you too.

354
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:54,260
You're always welcome here.

355
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:57,972
- You know that, right?
- Yeah, I do.

356
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,184
And you guys are
always welcome at the Liu House.

357
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:02,936
We'll keep that in mind.

358
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:05,647
Sorry.

359
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:08,398
- Leaving so soon?
- Yeah.

360
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:10,984
I gotta make sure
my brother's not building a spaceship

361
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:13,946
- or something with Victor.
- Best get on that then.

362
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:18,325
I thought you two might be hungry.

363
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:20,744
I thought
we were in the middle of a food shortage.

364
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:25,833
We are in the beginning stages
of a minor and temporary shortage.

365
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,670
But you need to get your strength up.

366
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,129
Donna...

367
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,799
I am fine.

368
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,134
Really, I am.

369
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:37,845
But it never should've happened
in the first place.

370
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,263
I should have been here.

371
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,850
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I'm...

372
00:25:43,518 --> 00:25:46,936
so glad
that you finally decided to apologize,

373
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:50,733
because another grown man losing his shit
and stabbing me is clearly your fault.

374
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,609
You know what I mean, smart-ass.

375
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:56,406
You did good.

376
00:25:58,116 --> 00:25:59,701
Getting him down to the clinic.

377
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:02,744
You did good.

378
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:15,133
Hey, Julie?

379
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,218
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:26:18,302 --> 00:26:19,846
We have to stop meeting like this.

381
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,516
On the porch.

382
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,436
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

383
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:28,563
What's up?

384
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,357
You said if I ever wanted to talk...

385
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,359
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

386
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,656
You have time for a walk?

387
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:40,867
Okay.

388
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:47,832
These were all I could find, so...

389
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,042
Yeah, they're fine.

390
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:52,003
All right.

391
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:57,133
- How can I help?
- Catch me if I fall.

392
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:00,428
Sorry, bad joke.

393
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,640
- I'm gonna open up the shirt.
- Okay.

394
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,310
I'll take...

395
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:21,365
Okay.

396
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:26,079
I'm just gonna make an incision
across the chest, okay?

397
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:28,664
Here we go.

398
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:36,755
- The fuck!
- It's fine.

399
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,923
I just...

400
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:40,467
- Think I hit a nerve or something.
- No. Let's stop. Stop.

401
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:42,219
- It's fine.
- Kenny, Jesus Christ!

402
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:43,262
Stop!

403
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,015
All right, we shouldn't be doing this.

404
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,393
We should have fucking burned it.
We shouldn't be doing this!

405
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,061
- Hey!
- You're fucking crazy.

406
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:52,647
- Hey, hey!
- I got it.

407
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:54,690
I got it.

408
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:57,234
Kenny.

409
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:01,155
Kenny.

410
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,241
Kenny, stop.

411
00:28:04,242 --> 00:28:08,037
Fucking stop!
Are you really gonna walk away right now?

412
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,750
We never should have brought
that thing inside.

413
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,792
It's dead, how is it going to hurt us?

414
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:17,838
I'm not worried about the monster.

415
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:20,340
Kristi, I'm worried about the thing
that fucking killed it.

416
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:23,845
Boyd brought something back with him.

417
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,265
He had worms crawling underneath his skin.

418
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,267
He put them inside the scariest thing
I have ever seen in my goddamn life,

419
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:33,311
- and now that scary thing is dead.
- But that's why we need to...

420
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:36,690
Look, whatever Boyd brought back
is like a poison to those things,

421
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,359
and now it's in his blood.

422
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,569
If we could extract it and use it,

423
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:42,530
we may finally have a way
of fighting back.

424
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:45,199
Or there's something
in there that'll kill you

425
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,410
the moment you open that thing up,
how do you not see that?

426
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,329
Fine, I'm willing to take that risk.

427
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,958
Look, Kenny, all I do here
is put broken things back together.

428
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,960
This is a chance to just finally...

429
00:28:57,378 --> 00:28:59,881
And yeah, I'm scared.
I'm fucking terrified,

430
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:02,049
and that's why I need you
in there with me.

431
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:06,262
I can't do this without...

432
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:11,642
We're in this together, remember?
You and me.

433
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,151
No.

434
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:22,612
No, we're not.

435
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:26,782
Not anymore.

436
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:29,911
Are you fucking kidding me?

437
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:32,580
No, I... That's not... I'm saying...

438
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,541
Look, it's okay.

439
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:37,418
It's okay.

440
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:39,629
I'm glad she's here.

441
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:42,882
Truly, I am. I...

442
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:47,637
Kristi,

443
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:49,680
I love you.

444
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:55,228
And all I want is for you to be happy.

445
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,232
But I can't go in there and watch you

446
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:03,069
do something that might get you killed.
I just... I can't do that.

447
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:06,572
I just can't.

448
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:10,660
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:13,913
Kristi?

450
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:31,389
Kristi?

451
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:44,235
Kristi?

452
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:57,164
Kristi?

453
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:07,341
No.

454
00:31:09,218 --> 00:31:10,511
No, no, no.

455
00:31:11,387 --> 00:31:13,639
Kristi! Kristi!

456
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:15,975
You feeling okay?

457
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:18,978
- Where is it?
- What?

458
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,189
The body. The fucking body.

459
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,066
Run.

460
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:26,777
Marielle, run!

461
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,143
Hey, Donna.

462
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,311
Hey.

463
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:04,648
You all right?

464
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:07,735
The plants keep dying.

465
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,781
It's like they're growing
in poisoned soil.

466
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,702
Boyd, all he ever wanted
was to find...

467
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:17,787
I'm pregnant.

468
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:25,628
Oh, sweetie! Oh, this is...

469
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:31,550
Oh, I wish I could've seen Ellis' face
when he found out he was gonna be a dad.

470
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,803
I haven't said anything to him yet.

471
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,347
- Is he not...
- No, of course he is.

472
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:44,355
Donna, I was told I can't have kids.

473
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,193
What's happening right now
is medically impossible.

474
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:58,202
And all I can think is

475
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:02,456
what if this place
is trying to torture me?

476
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,000
Mock me?

477
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,627
Like those things that come out at night.

478
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:10,381
The way they smile at us.
What if this is just...

479
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:16,136
What's happening?

480
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,222
I'm standing here thinking
I'm at the end of the line,

481
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:22,226
that everything
I thought about this place was...

482
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:26,397
We have seen

483
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:31,152
so much unbelievable shit in this place.

484
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,280
Roads that lead nowhere.

485
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:36,949
Monsters that come from the dark.

486
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:40,660
According to Boyd,
there are evil fucking trees

487
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:42,955
that trap you in dungeons.

488
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,332
Don't ask.

489
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:49,128
The point is...

490
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:55,342
we have seen a lot of horrible

491
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:57,720
impossible shit here.

492
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:02,682
So we just assume
that anything impossible

493
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:04,768
that happens here is bad.

494
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:07,730
But look at you.

495
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:14,236
Sweetie, you met the love of your life

496
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,697
in the middle
of your worst fucking nightmare!

497
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:22,077
You're gonna have a baby,
that you were told you could never have.

498
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:25,331
That sounds like a pretty good
impossible to me.

499
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,418
Donna, it's impossible.

500
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,339
What, you're gonna sit here
and tell me with all you've seen,

501
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:35,799
that you can't
wrap your head around a miracle?

502
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:40,221
Because a miracle
is just the other side of a nightmare.

503
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:46,143
What if you're wrong?

504
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,565
I've got a different question for you.

505
00:34:54,318 --> 00:34:55,736
What if I'm right?

506
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,198
There we go.

507
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,159
So first it was the guy crushed
by the rock in the root cellar.

508
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:06,914
He was stuffed inside
that giant armoire in the back.

509
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:09,875
And then...

510
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,797
And then it was the Civil War soldiers.
Then the other night, Christopher,

511
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,300
which was easily the creepiest

512
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:20,553
fucking thing
I've ever experienced in my life.

513
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,888
Wait. Christopher?

514
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,350
Oh, yeah.

515
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,393
Oh, yeah.

516
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:33,315
Christopher's the guy holding the journal.

517
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,026
And you see that kid in the background?

518
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,321
Yeah, that's Victor.

519
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:43,867
Wow, you caught that
a lot quicker than I did.

520
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,247
Okay, so...

521
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,545
For you, what you see
is different every time?

522
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:59,133
I mean, except for the symbol.
Why, what do you see?

523
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,263
I just see children.

524
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:07,474
What, like, little kids?

525
00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:11,645
Yeah. Yeah, but...

526
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:15,565
They're fucking terrifying.

527
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,657
I thought I was losing my mind
or I was being punished.

528
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:25,534
Punished for what?

529
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:31,332
Oh, my...

530
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:37,046
My son, Thomas,
was a few months old when he died, so...

531
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,049
You know.

532
00:36:43,052 --> 00:36:44,053
Fuck.

533
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:50,893
God, I'm so sorry.

534
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,567
Well, look, I mean,

535
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:01,070
the good news
is you're not being punished.

536
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:03,739
Maybe this is just a fucked-up place,

537
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,408
where scary shit happens.

538
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:10,036
And there's no explanation why.

539
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,081
Yeah.

540
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:16,877
I'm gonna go home.

541
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,840
I appreciate the help.

542
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,890
Wait. Is this the symbol
you were talking about?

543
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:34,103
Yeah, that's Christopher's
incel book of crazy.

544
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:36,689
I've seen this.

545
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:40,984
- Yeah? Like in a vision or something?
- No.

546
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:44,446
No, on the walls in the tunnels.

547
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,202
What?

548
00:37:50,953 --> 00:37:51,954
What tunnels?

549
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,543
How many times do we have to do this?

550
00:37:58,669 --> 00:37:59,670
A lot.

551
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:03,424
We have to be thorough.
We have to be sure.

552
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,097
They're losing their leaves.

553
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:13,809
What?

554
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,520
The trees.

555
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:20,399
So?

556
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,402
- That happens every year.
- Well, not here.

557
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:26,697
It's always the same here.

558
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,536
Is it bad
that they're losing their leaves?

559
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:37,207
When things change here, it's usually bad.

560
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:42,296
Well, if it's never happened before,
maybe it's good.

561
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:51,680
Almost got it.

562
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,016
There.

563
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,189
Okay.

564
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,150
- Now we have to remove the sternum.
- Great.

565
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:06,527
What?

566
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:23,253
- Okay, on the count of three.
- Okay.

567
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,672
Hold that hand steady, okay?
One...

568
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:29,426
two, three!

569
00:39:36,558 --> 00:39:37,559
What the fuck?

570
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,020
What's wrong? What is it?

571
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:41,855
It's human.

572
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,944
I mean, at least it was.
It's got the exact same anatomy.

573
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:50,322
There're the lungs. The heart. Liver.

574
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,991
But they're shriveled.

575
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,161
Desiccated. It's like some shit
that you see at a museum.

576
00:39:57,246 --> 00:40:00,040
Okay, hey, hey.
Look, slow down. Just talk to me.

577
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:02,209
It's supposed to be in the blood.

578
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:05,462
"My blood is your blood,"
that's what you said to it, right?

579
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:08,465
Right, but maybe their blood
is different than ours.

580
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:13,011
This thing is bone dry inside.
There's no fluid, there's no lymph,

581
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:15,055
- there's nothing we can...
- Hey, it's okay.

582
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:17,683
No, it's not okay. This was our chance.

583
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:21,143
This couldn't have been for nothing, okay?

584
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,022
There's gotta be something.

585
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:26,233
There's gotta be something in here.

586
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:30,821
There's gotta be something in here.

587
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:34,616
All right, be careful.

588
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:40,288
You fucking piece of shit.

589
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:41,748
- Okay, stop!
- Fuck you! You fuck!

590
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:42,958
- You fuck!
- Kristi, stop.

591
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,168
Hey, Kristi, stop!
Okay, just... Kristi!

592
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:46,795
Hey, hey, stop!

593
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:49,797
What is that? What's that stuff?

594
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:56,179
That's the gallbladder.

595
00:40:57,431 --> 00:40:58,306
That's...

596
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,768
- That's bile.
- That's bile.

597
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:06,648
It's good, right? It's liquid.
It might be something we could use, right?

598
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,026
Yeah. Maybe, it's something.

599
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:12,070
Maybe? You goddamn right that's something.

600
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:16,991
- Bile is something.
- Bile is something.

601
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,785
- Can you go get me one of the...
- Yeah.

602
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,620
...droppers, so we can collect it.

603
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:23,081
You did good. You did great.

604
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:27,044
Wait, what do you mean he killed it?

605
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:30,172
I'm telling you,
he went outside and did something,

606
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:32,049
and the thing started screaming.

607
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:37,179
When we went out this morning,
it was dead.

608
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:40,306
Jesus.

609
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,393
Hey, you can't tell anyone.
Not even your parents.

610
00:41:44,227 --> 00:41:45,646
- Why?
- I don't know.

611
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,606
Boyd said he doesn't want
anyone to know yet

612
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:50,024
and I really don't want him
pissed at me, so please.

613
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,945
Okay. I won't say anything, I promise.

614
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,364
Look, this is a good thing.

615
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:59,618
I mean, if we can hurt them,
if we can kill them.

616
00:42:01,036 --> 00:42:03,038
Everybody here
is gonna be a whole lot safer.

617
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:06,667
- I know.
- So why are you upset?

618
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,588
You know that dream I had?

619
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:14,007
On the bus?

620
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:15,884
Yeah.

621
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:19,053
I can't shake this feeling,

622
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,472
like there's something
I'm supposed to remember.

623
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,141
Something that...

624
00:42:27,354 --> 00:42:30,315
When I seen that thing lying there
in the dirt this morning,

625
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:32,109
it was like I could...

626
00:42:33,402 --> 00:42:35,904
it was right there. And I...

627
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:40,033
It's like before I could move
my head, it was gone. And I...

628
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:43,536
I don't know
if what I'm supposed to remember is real

629
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:47,582
- or if my mind is just so messed up that...
- No! No.

630
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:52,004
Everything about this is crazy.

631
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:54,672
I get it.

632
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:59,469
This place, it's like...

633
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,472
As soon as you start to think,

634
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,267
"You know, maybe today I won't go insane."

635
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:09,563
Something new comes along and it's like,
"Hey, wait till you see this."

636
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:13,025
We all go through it.

637
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:15,277
You seem pretty together.

638
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:20,907
Seriously?
You must be in pretty bad shape then.

639
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,871
I do have a little trick though,

640
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:29,041
for when things really start to get to me.

641
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,379
I fill up the bathtub,

642
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:38,633
and I sink down just enough,
so that the water is level with my ears.

643
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:41,178
And the sound is like,

644
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,930
when you're standing by the ocean.

645
00:43:45,098 --> 00:43:47,309
And I just sit like
that for a while and I breathe.

646
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:50,395
It's peaceful.

647
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:52,314
I don't take baths.

648
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:54,900
Okay. Well, then I don't know how
to help you.

649
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:03,533
- Hey.
- Hey.

650
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,497
I have just accepted
that I'm never gonna be comfortable again.

651
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,338
You okay?

652
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,049
Yeah.

653
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:24,930
You okay?

654
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:29,351
Yeah.

655
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,143
I am.

656
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:35,482
There's something I need to tell you.

657
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,289
Big day.

658
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:54,876
Yeah, it was.

659
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:59,672
You really think injecting them
with that stuff is gonna kill 'em?

660
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:03,301
Honestly, I got no fucking idea,

661
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,012
but it's the best chance we got.

662
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:09,431
How are we even gonna test it?

663
00:45:12,853 --> 00:45:16,273
I tell you what.
Let's make that a problem for tomorrow.

664
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:21,361
I should get home.

665
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:23,697
Tell Kristi...

666
00:45:24,573 --> 00:45:25,448
You know.

667
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,033
Yeah, okay.

668
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:30,829
Hey, Kenny.

669
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:33,039
Hey.

670
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,500
If you ever want that badge back...

671
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:40,672
I'll see you around.

672
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:44,342
Yeah.

673
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:05,947
How'd it go?

674
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:10,118
I don't really know yet.

675
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,665
- I guess we'll have to wait and see.
- Okay.

676
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,751
How are you?

677
00:46:20,128 --> 00:46:22,714
- I had a bad dream.
- Oh, no.

678
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:25,717
What was it about?

679
00:46:27,844 --> 00:46:29,429
That thing in the basement...

680
00:46:30,764 --> 00:46:32,181
came alive and...

681
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:36,978
I think there was a music box.

682
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:42,067
Your friend Boyd
is giving me his nightmares.

683
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:45,445
I'll be sure to talk to him about that.

684
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,245
I'm gonna be all right, you know.

685
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:57,623
You don't have to worry about me.
