<i>The housekeeper knew, more than most,</i>

4
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,541
<i>that deep experience was never peaceful,</i>

5
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>and because she knew this
ever since she'd first called Bly home,</i>

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,708
<i>she would always find
her way back to peace</i>

7
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,208
<i>within her daily routine,</i>

8
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,333
<i>and it had always worked.</i>

9
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:31,708
<i>Always.</i>

10
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,333
[Owen] We can't count on the past.

11
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,791
We can't count on the past.

12
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,375
That's what I learned taking care of Mum.

13
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,750
Hm. It's kind of what dementia is,
isn't it?

14
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,083
I suppose I learned a lot on this.

15
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,833
I mean, we... we think we have it
trapped in our memories, but…

16
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,500
memories fade, or they're wrong.

17
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,750
Any of us could die, at any moment.

18
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,458
Or we could forget our entire lives,
which is like dying.

19
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,416
So, then, think about it.

20
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,166
We can't count on our future, either.

21
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,833
No past.

22
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,250
No future.

23
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,791
Oh, my God,
it's scary, I know, but, Owen…

24
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:26,916
you're young.

25
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,583
Like, you have a past, you have a future.

26
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,166
Now, I'd argue you can count on both.

27
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,250
Poor, sweet, drunk man.

28
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,958
- Know what I noticed?
- What?

29
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,458
You spend a lot of time
caring for other people.

30
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,708
It's my job.

31
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,791
Nah.

32
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,750
It's more than that, isn't it?

33
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,666
I mean, if you could
just take that responsibility,

34
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,333
and put it down for a minute…

35
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,083
I mean, I can.

36
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,833
Fuck it.

37
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,625
I... [sighs]

38
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,791
I'm sorry to say it, hm?

39
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,291
I shouldn't say it.

40
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,958
It's-It's-It's a horrible thing to say,
but I'll say it.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,375
It's a bit of a relief.

42
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,000
It's not horrible.

43
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm untethered now,
whether I like it or not.

44
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,541
And now I'm thinking…

45
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,375
[exhales heavily]
…maybe I'll go back to Paris.

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Well, you, um…

47
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,083
I mean, you…

48
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,458
You could, couldn't you? You…

49
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,125
- I could.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And you know…

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,666
you could, too.

52
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,333
[scoffs]

53
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,416
[chuckling]

54
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,958
Say it with me.

55
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:04,333
- Hannah Grose in Paris.
- [Hannah] What would I do in Paris?

56
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,958
Eat croissants
and-and drink good wine.

57
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,166
And live, Hannah.

58
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,708
Live.

59
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,583
Do whatever the hell occurs to us
in the bloody moment.

60
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:17,958
You and me.

61
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,083
While we still can.

62
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,333
[Jamie] So sorry to interrupt,
but I'm turning into a pumpkin.

63
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,625
Come on, Owen. Time to go home.

64
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,791
[Owen]
All right, well, it's about that time.

00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,708
[sighs]

66
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,083
I'll-co-hol you later.

God, even for you.

68
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,708
Drive safe.

69
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,708
[Jamie]
I know the road. We'll be fine.

70
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,166
It's all good.

71
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,875
[Owen] <i>Are you Hannah?</i>

72
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,833
Uh, Owen Sharma.

73
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,250
It's so nice to meet you.

74
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,250
Right.

75
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,833
Right, yes.

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,875
Sorry,
I-I'm a little discombobulated today.

77
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,583
And, typically, job interviews aren't my…

78
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,541
Well, I'm… I'm far more comfortable
on the other side of the table.

79
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,291
- [chuckles]
- But Charlotte, um, Mrs. Wingrave,

80
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,666
she had to, um…

81
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,375
She had to…

82
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,166
Right, yes. Well, I'm… I'm all set.

83
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,625
Hannah Grose. It's a…

84
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,166
It's a pleasure, please do…

85
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,083
So, um, you…

86
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,125
You-you studied in… in Paris?

87
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,791
- Uh, yes. Uh, for, for two years.
- Oh.

88
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,083
Yeah. Best two years of my life,
if I'm honest.

89
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,125
I worked in a restaurant in Le Marais.

90
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,833
Oh, uh…

91
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,375
Well, I'm afraid this job might bore you.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm sure there's a posh restaurant
that could use you.

93
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,583
I mean…

94
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,583
why do you want to work at Bly?

95
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,541
- Because it's close to home.
- Oh, well, that's honest.

96
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,958
Well, I-I'm… I'm too honest.
It's, it's probably pathological.

97
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,041
No, honesty is never that.

98
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,416
I'm, I'm looking at this
as an opportunity to hone my skills.

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,958
In-In Paris, I was a sous-chef,

100
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,083
which means
they only let me chop vegetables.

101
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,846
Here, I'll put everything together myself.

102
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,000
It would be a…
a great learning experience.

103
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,833
Well, you'll have two children
to cook for.

104
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,250
I'm not sure
that's the type of experience you want.

105
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,791
Miles is seven, and, well, picky.
Flora's five, and…

106
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,583
a darling. They both are, really.

107
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,291
The Wingraves,
they're here for holidays and summers.

108
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,041
They've been good to me.

109
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,563
And-And, look, I know it sounds
very <i>Upstairs, Downstairs, </i>but…

110
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,041
this is my home,
and I take great pride in it.

111
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,791
We need a cook
who intends to stay on for a while.

112
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,125
Well, um…

113
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,375
when my mum…

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,500
That-That is, um, when it's time to…

115
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,833
Uh…

116
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,375
God, I wasn't gonna say this.

117
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,541
Um…

118
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,958
But it's part of it, I guess,

119
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,125
if you wanna know
why I'm applying for this.

120
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,333
Yesterday, my-my mother thought
it was 1962.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,125
And that I was my grandfather.

122
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,875
And that's why I'm here.

123
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,541
To make a living while I mind her, and…

124
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,583
I don't know how long that will, um…

125
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,541
But I won't go running off.
[chuckles]

126
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,000
I-I promise you that.
That's... That's not who I am.

127
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,708
It must be very difficult.

128
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,125
It-It is.

129
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,333
Uh, and it isn't.

131
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,458

Oh, um…

133
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,000
No, I'm... I'm afraid not.

134
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,416
- Tell me.
- Well, he-he was a… He was a monk.

135
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,333
Oh.

136
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,416
He said,

137
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,791
once we get past consciousness,
and identity,

138
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,833
and-and all of the things
that occupy the front of our brains…

139
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,958
you…

140
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,250
reach a transcendence…

141
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,750
an infinitely abundant source,
or what have you.

142
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:09,083
So, if you take someone
with dementia, for instance,

143
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:12,416
and-and their consciousness
is wearing away every day, right?

144
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,166
You see underneath it, and it's…

145
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,750
Look, I…

146
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,500
I don't know if it's transcendent,

147
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,333
but I'm…

148
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,583
learning a lot about being alive.

Hello, Flora, darling.
Now, have you had a fine school year?

- [Charlotte] Careful! Straight upstairs.

We'll have tea this week.

You'll tell me all about
how numbingly constant everything is.

00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,703
[chuckling] Well, I should like that
very much, ma'am.

178
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,250
[lighter clicks]

179
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,625
[clicking continues]

180
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,625
Um…

181
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,791
You'll bring those in directly, will you?

182
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,416
Immediately.

183
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,583
[lighter clicks]

184
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,416
[ominous music playing]

185
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,416
[wails]

186
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,291
[yells]

187
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,125
[wailing]

188
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,541
[somber music playing]

189
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
[Charlotte] Hannah?

190
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,375
Oh, my God.

191
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,791
I'm, uh…

192
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,500
sorry, ma'am. I…

193
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,416
I…

194
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,750
I thought you'd left.

195
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,166
You usually leave before…

196
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,291
Is Sam coming to get you?

197
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,875
No.

198
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,583
Is he all right?

199
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,666
I don't know how he could be, ma'am.

200
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,583
Apparently, he is… Apparently, he's…

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,125
He's just fine.

202
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,416
Somehow, him and…

203
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,333
whoever she is, they're…

204
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,208
They're just fine.

205
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,791
Oh, my.

206
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,750
Oh, my.

207
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,291
I can arrange a ride for you.

208
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:16,416
Surely, you're not walking back to town,
surely. I'll arrange a ride.

209
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,416
- Or take you myself.
- No, really, I'm…

210
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,125
Or you can stay here, you know.

211
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,208
For as long as you like.

212
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,291
Forever, if you need to.

213
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,791
Come, let's have a drink.

214
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,458
[jarring rumble]

215
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,500
[birds chirping]

216
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,916
[footsteps approaching]

217
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,208
[ominous music playing]

218
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,500
[Jamie] What do you want?

219
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,416
Oi!

220
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,875
- Stop it!
- [Hannah] Miles! Stop that this instant!

221
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,958
That is not funny, mate.
Don't ever do that again, you hear me?

222
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,208
Or I will beat the living shite
out of you. No bullshit.

223
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,333
I will fucking end you.

224
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,458
Try me.

225
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,250
Look at you, all flushed.

226
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,000
You're pretty when you blush.

227
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Miles!

228
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,833
[ominous crescendo]

229
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,041
[groans]

230
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,750
[cracking sound]

231
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,083
[fire crackling]

232
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,666
[Owen, slurring]
Any of us could die at any moment.

233
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,291
Or we could forget our entire lives,
which is like dying.

234
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,333
So, then, think about it.

235
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,416
We can't count on our future, either.

236
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,666
No past.

237
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,250
No future.

238
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,291
Our moments are supposed to be like…

239
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:31,916
Chapters.

240
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,041
No, um…

241
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Markers?

242
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,583
No, that's not it, is it?

243
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,583
They're not.

244
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,625
They're like…

245
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,666
Like…

246
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,625
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

247
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,041
[footsteps approaching]

248
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,708
Pardon me.

249
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,875
[Flora] Wait, please!

250
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,083
- [Peter] Hiya!
- [Flora] Peter!

251
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,625
[Rebecca] It's nearly lunchtime.
To the kitchen, immediately.

252
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,541
You can play with Uncle Peter later.

253
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,541
Uh, slow down, or you'll break
your bloody skulls!

254
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,458
- [Rebecca] Don't touch me!
- [Peter speaking indistinctly]

255
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,976
You can't just talk to me
like I'm some kind of whore,

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,809
disappear and then come back,
and try and act like everything is normal.

257
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,583
- That won't fly with me!
- [Peter] What?

258
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,226
You talk to me like rubbish,
and I haven't heard from you in days!

259
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,642
- [Peter] Keep it down.
- [Rebecca] Don't tell me what to do!

260
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,958
[Peter] I'm not. I just don't understand
why you're upset.

261
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,250
[Rebecca] Last time I saw you,

262
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,416
you were banging on
about me having Owen's batter in my mouth.

263
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,375
[Peter sighs]

264
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,833
Oh, come on.
I forgot all about that, Becs.

265
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,666
- I didn't.
- Becs, I… [sighs]

266
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,458
Look, okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

267
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,083
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,708
Come here.

269
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,666
Please. Hey.

270
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,041
I don't even know who that was.

271
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,125
I'm just in deeper than I thought,
I guess.

272
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,750
You don't get to talk to me
like that again.

273
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,125
No, never. Never.

274
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,833
I pr... I promise. I do.

275
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,916
I promise.

276
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
Okay?

277
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,291
Okay.

278
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,208
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.

279
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,583
Can I kiss you?

280
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,166
[giggles]

281
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,666
[kissing]

282
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,083
[door creaks]

283
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,333
[vacuum turns on, whirs loudly]

284
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,833
[kicks vacuum off]

285
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:01,958
Honestly, Hannah.

286
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,333
You should give the vacuum a rest.

287
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,291
Live a little.

288
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,125
[eerie music playing]

289
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,541
[jarring thud]

290
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,500
[drawer creaks open]

291
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,416
- [ominous thud]
- [Peter chuckles]

292
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,125
Hannah. You scared me.

293
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,125
What are you doing up here?

294
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,416
Henry asked me to pick up a few things.

295
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,458
What, from Charlotte's vanity?

296
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,500
Well, he's a sentimental bloke.

297
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,958
Show what's in your pocket.

298
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,125
Jesus, Hannah, buy me dinner first.

299
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,458
Very well.

300
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,291
So, Henry asked <i>you</i> to get that for him?

301
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:25,875
That's right.

302
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:26,791
Hm.

303
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,791
- What does he want with that?
- I don't know.

304
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,666
- I'm just following orders.
- Uh-huh.

305
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:36,333
You know, Charlotte once told me
that necklace is over 400 years old.

306
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,166
It's probably worth thousands.

307
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,250
Hm.

308
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,875
Well, you wouldn't think it
looking at it, would you?

309
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,416
You wouldn't have guessed.

310
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,843
Funny thing
about cleaning a house for years.

311
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,750
You know exactly where everything is.

312
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,416
Henry might be too much of a mess
to notice what you're up to,

313
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,333
but I'm not.

314
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,625
- And what am I up to?
- You're taking things that aren't yours.

315
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,708
[chuckles softly]

316
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,333
You know… [clears throat]

317
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,458
…it's a mistake, isn't it?

318
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,541
Thinking that they're your family.

319
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,291
That this is your house.

320
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,541
There's them,
and then there's us, Hannah.

321
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,500
We're the help.

322
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,875
What do you suppose happens
when you're told to push a mop?

323
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,250
What? You think Henry
will take care of you?

324
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,916
Or what? The kids?

325
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you know many housekeepers
who stay on after they retire?

326
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,291
Their lives go on, Hannah.

327
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,250
Leaving honest people like us
in its wake.

328
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,333
Honest, are you?

329
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,958
[scoffs]

330
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,083
I'll have the necklace, please.

331
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,750
Here.

332
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,666
Thank you.

333
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,250
You know… [clears throat]

334
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,208
…you should be nicer to me, Hannah.

335
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,541
I mean, one word from me, and…

336
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,750
you'll be thrown out
with nothing but your last week's wages.

337
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,833
This is my home, Peter Quint.

338
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,541
You'll leave long before I do.

339
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,625
[lighter clicks]

340
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,208
[clicks shut]

341
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,916
[wind whistles eerily]

342
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,958
[water dripping]

343
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,125
[terrifying music playing]

344
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,958
[footsteps]

345
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,875
[terrifying crescendo]

346
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
[chilling music playing]

347
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,333
[music crescendos abruptly]

348
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,500
[Owen] I'm looking at this
as an opportunity to hone my skills.

349
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,208
In Paris, I was a sous-chef,

350
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,291
which means
they only let you chop vegetables.

351
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,375
Here, I'll be putting together
everything myself.

352
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,583
It'd be a great learning experience.

353
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,166
You'll have two children to cook for, and…

354
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,833
So, I'm sorry. Um…

355
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,041
This is...
It's going to sound strange, but…

356
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,750
haven't we already done this?

357
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,916
Yes.

358
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,416
But we have to do it again.

359
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,083
Why?

360
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,041
You tell me.

361
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,125
What?

362
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,750
It's okay.

363
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,250
Let's get back to it.

364
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,125
In Paris, I was a sous-chef,
which means you can only cut vegetables.

365
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,500
Here, I'll be putting
everything together myself.

366
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,500
It'll be a great learning experience.

367
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,125
Um…

368
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,250
You'll have two children to cook for.

369
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,416
I don't know if that's the type
of experience you want.

370
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,500
- Miles is seven and rather picky...
- Miles?

371
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,250
- [Hannah] Mm.
- Tell me more about him.

372
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,500
What kind of boy is he?

373
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh.

374
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,666
- Oh, Miles is a good boy.
- Huh.

375
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,791
He's sweet.

376
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,541
He's troubled, but deep down,
oh, he's a good boy.

377
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,500
Troubled?

378
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,375
Yeah, he hasn't been the same
since his parents died.

379
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,750
But then what child would be?

380
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,625
Is he ever cruel?

381
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,375
Whatever would make you say that?

382
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,291
Little boys can be very cruel.

383
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,583
I should know.

384
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,000
- I was one.
- Oh, Miles is a good boy.

385
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,833
So you said.

386
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:06,750
He is.

387
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,000
He is a good boy,

388
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,416
- and he would never do anything to...
- Hurt you.

389
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,833
Is that what you were gonna say?

390
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,875
- Whatever would make you say that?
- I don't know, you asked.

391
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,666
Okay, okay, he wouldn't hurt you.

392
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,625
But you admitted
he hasn't exactly been himself

393
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,875
since his parents died.

394
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,416
No, that's not what I meant.

395
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,250
[yelling] Miles Wingrave!

396
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,041
What do you think you're doing?

397
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,375
Hey.

398
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,833
- [lighter clicks]
- What on earth has gotten into you?

399
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,541
Enjoying a fag on a nice, sunny day.

400
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,333
What are <i>you</i> doing?

401
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,333
[sighs]

402
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
Listen, Miles…

403
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,208
Look, I know you miss Peter,

404
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,416
and-and I know it's confusing
the way he's run off.

405
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,420
If you wanna keep his lighter,
it's okay with me,

406
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,875
as long as you're safe with it.

407
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,625
But you cannot, under any circumstances,
be smoking.

408
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,748
Or do you want to die
a horrible, choking death, hm?

409
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,750
[chuckles] Oh, Hannah.

410
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,666
Honestly.

411
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,083
Uh, Miles.

412
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,166
[lighter clicking]

413
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,125
Honestly.

414
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:10,958
Miles!

415
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,625
Miles, we're not finished here.

416
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,875
Miles!

417
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,041
Oh, God.

418
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,125
Miles!

419
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,833
Oh, hello.

420
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,291
Oh, hello. Did Miles come in here?

421
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,833
Just now.

422
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Come have a seat.

423
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,166
Oh, I lit it for you.
I hope you don't mind.

424
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,541
Who is it for?

425
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,541
Well, that's the spirit!

426
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,083
Moving on and moving up.

427
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,708
That's for Sam.

428
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,166
He may not be dead,
but nobody's perfect, are they?

429
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,333
[laughs]

430
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,791
I didn't think you lit
remembrance candles for the living.

431
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,125
Oh, you don't normally.

432
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,500
But, for him, a special case.

433
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,375
Come sit,
I want to talk to you about something.

434
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,458
Oh.

435
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:10,458
What would you say
to making your position live-in?

436
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,541
Oh, uh…

437
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,083
[both laugh]

438
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,875
- I'd have to sell my house.
- Precisely.

439
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,625
And that would be
a lovely nest egg for you.

440
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,291
And we would compensate you accordingly,
of course.

441
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,208
Oh, but Sam…

442
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,541
Well, we light that candle for him,
don't we?

443
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,208
Because Sam is gone.

444
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,708
Because Sam is gone.

445
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,625
I appreciate the offer.

446
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,458
Really, I do, Charlotte, but, um…

447
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,125
Sam is…

448
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,125
He's just going through a phase.

449
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,625
And he'll be back.

450
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,166
He will.

451
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:50,791
He will be back.

452
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,333
[Charlotte] It's funny.

453
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,375
Marriage is like religion, in a way.

454
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,666
You are told to have blind faith in God,
even though you can't see him.

455
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,958
And you're told
to have blind faith in your husband,

456
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,833
even if you hardly ever see him.

457
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,791
But is that realistic?

458
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,416
How long can you actually believe
in something?

459
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,416
I mean, truly believe in it,

460
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,166
without seeing it.

461
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,375
They both have their limits
in that regard.

462
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,416
Well, what's the alternative?

463
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,458
Believe in nothing?

464
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,166
Then what?

465
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,166
What have you got when your back's
against the wall when there's…

466
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,250
nothing left for you but faith?

467
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,166
I mean, I…

468
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,500
I still love him.

469
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,458
God help me, I do.

470
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,166
I still love him.

471
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,791
And what he did was…

472
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,333
It was horrible, but…

473
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:50,916
Yes.

474
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:52,791
Yes, it was.

475
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,666
[Rebecca] <i>I used to be a Daddy's girl.</i>

476
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,750
[bells tolling in distance]

477
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:03,791
What?

478
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,708
Until, of course,
I grew up and I wasn't anymore.

479
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,375
I was a woman with my own opinions,
desires, and aspirations,

480
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,791
and my father
didn't much encourage those.

481
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,333
As far as he was concerned,
my dreams were far out of my reach.

482
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,541
And he felt I needed
to be reminded of that constantly.

483
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,541
So, when you find someone…

484
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,250
who truly sees you,

485
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,833
who truly believes in you,

486
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,083
sometimes more
than you believe in yourself,

487
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,708
that you are smart enough,

488
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,958
and capable enough, and tells you so…

489
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,125
well, you hold on to them,
and you don't let go.

490
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,166
Even if they're rough around the edges.

491
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,375
Even if they're not perfect.

492
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,791
Even if you lose yourself just a little.

493
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,750
You don't have to lose yourself
to find happiness, you know.

494
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,250
Don't you, though?

495
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,250
I mean, we all do it.

496
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,750
Not always. No.

497
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,208
I know what you're going to say, so don't.

498
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,041
Well, if you know what I'm gonna say,
then you know why I'd say it.

499
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,750
Look, I know. I know, okay?

500
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,250
I've never met anyone like him.

501
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,000
- I know he's not perfect.
- More than that, though, isn't it?

502
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,166
Forgive me for saying so, Rebecca, but…

503
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,375
he scares the shit out of me.

504
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,625
You don't know him, Hannah.
You don't.

505
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,041
He scares me, too.

506
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,958
But in the best way.

507
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,000
Being with him
might be scary at times, but…

508
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,875
it's also exciting, and fun.

509
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,750
And for the first time in my life,

510
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:51,291
that little voice in my head saying
I'm not good enough has disappeared.

511
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,375
It's gone.

512
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,000
And I've never felt so alive.

513
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,708
Oh, darling.

514
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,708
Hey, there's a difference

515
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,375
between feeling good and feeling alive.

516
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,833
The two aren't always the same.

517
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,458
I mean, look at you.

518
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,583
You look like you haven't slept
for a week.

519
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:17,958
[sighs]

520
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,416
You worry too much, okay?

521
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,708
- I've been with men like him before.
- No.

522
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,750
No, that's not true. You told me yourself.

523
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,208
You told me
you've never met anyone like him before.

524
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,041
And you don't get to have it both ways.

525
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,625
Hannah, honestly.

526
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,500
[sighs in frustration]

527
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,416
Rebecca.

528
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,750
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

529
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,250
Rebecca.

530
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
[gasps]

531
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,583
[ominous music playing]

532
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,375
[breathes heavily]

533
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,958
[water dripping]

534
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,041
[lighter clicking]

535
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,291
[Owen] <i>Hey.</i>

536
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,708
Let me get your opinion, Rebecca.

537
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,166
More salt in the stew?

538
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What?

539
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,541
What are you stewing on?

540
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,166
[Rebecca] Um…

541
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:17,666
Um…

542
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,625
No, thank you. I'm… I'm not hungry.

543
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Huh.

544
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:25,333
The sweetest honey
is loathsome in its own deliciousness.

545
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,208
And in its taste confounds the appetite.

546
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,708
It smells delicious in here.

547
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,375
Um, Becs, can I borrow you a moment?

548
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,583
[Rebecca giggling]

549
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,708
[Hannah]
We had a mouse problem a few years back.

550
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,708
The old gardener
brought in these glue traps.

551
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,583
A tile about yea big, coated in glue.

552
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,583
No springs, no cage.

553
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,083
No violence. That's what he said.

554
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,458
No violence.

555
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:00,833
A few days later,

556
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:03,351
I come across one of these traps,
and there's something in it.

557
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,041
Something quite small.
Not-Not a mouse, mind. Um…

558
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,458
A caterpillar, I thought, maybe.

559
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,625
And I pick it up, I look at it.

560
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:14,791
It was a leg.

561
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,833
Bloody mouse leg.

562
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:21,375
Poor mouse was a few feet away.
It chewed its own leg off to escape.

563
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,166
The poor thing bled to death.

564
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,291
That man is a glue trap.

565
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,875
And when Rebecca realizes it,
she won't come out whole, she'll just…

566
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,541
She'll think she's okay.

567
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,125
Till she realizes she's stuck.

568
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:45,916
Denial.

569
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:50,875
[jarring crescendo]

570
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,158
I'm looking at this
as an opportunity to hone my skills.

571
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:56,128
In Paris, I was a sous-chef, which means
they only let me chop vegetables.

572
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,046
Here, I'd be putting together
everything myself.

573
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,666
It'd be a great learning experience.

574
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,625
Uh…

575
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,043
We need a cook
who intends to stay on for a while.

576
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,500
Oh, when the time comes,
I won't go running off.

577
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:09,708
I promise you that.

578
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,458
No.

579
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,041
I'll be stuck in this glue trap of a town
just like everyone else.

580
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,541
- You're familiar with glue traps.
- We talked about that once.

581
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,041
Not yet, we haven't.

582
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,208
Technically.

583
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,000
But I thought about it
for weeks after we did.

584
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,750
Thought about what that must feel like.

585
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,291
That glue…

586
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,750
setting in…

587
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,250
before we really know it.

588
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,000
That bottomless,

589
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,750
icy terror…

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,416
realizing that we may be stuck forever.

591
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,291
Do you think a mouse
is capable of that kind of realization?

592
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:59,083
Does a mouse know when it's already over?

593
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,083
Do we?

594
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,250
We?

595
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:06,833
People.

596
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:12,916
Do we realize when we're in the glue?
Or when the water around us is boiling?

597
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,166
Or do we sit there,

598
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,333
saying this will be okay?

599
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:18,666
I'm okay.

600
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,125
[yelling] Denial!

601
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,333
[panting]

602
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,208
That's morbid.

603
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:26,875
God, that's what this is.
This is… This is morbid.

604
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,500
- Be careful.
- It's morbid!

605
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,208
[clock ticking]

606
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:50,166
[Rebecca moans softly]

607
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,916
[Rebecca] Mm-mm.

608
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Stay.

609
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,267
[Peter chuckles]
I have to be at the bank in the morning.

610
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,166
[Rebecca] Just stay a bit longer, please.

611
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,416
[Peter] I wish I could.

612
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,416
I have to tell you something.

613
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,541
What?

614
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,916
[somber music playing]

615
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,333
What is it?

616
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,833
I've never had anything in my life.

617
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,541
I've never had…

618
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,041
money, or, um…

619
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,750
a family…

620
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
or…

621
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,125
love.

622
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:34,458
Or safety.

623
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,250
Until I found you.

624
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:42,708
What's going on?

625
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,541
I'm doing something big.

626
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,166
Something big for both of us.

627
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,083
[Rebecca] You're not making much sense.

628
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,708
We're not like them, Becs.

629
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,416
Okay? We're not.

630
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,541
Henry's never gonna give you
the pupilage.

631
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,125
He's never gonna make me a partner.

632
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:05,166
The only thing
the English care about is class.

633
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:07,625
And you and I…

634
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:11,208
we're always gonna be the help,
in their eyes.

635
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Aren't we?

636
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,958
And we both know that, deep down.

637
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,375
But the only thing Americans care about…

638
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,250
is money.

639
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:25,833
And…

640
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,583
if I had enough of that…

641
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,166
in the States,

642
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,166
I mean, you can be
whatever kind of lawyer you want.

643
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,375
I can be anything at all.

644
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:40,666
And we... The things that we could be,
in America.

645
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,291
With money.

646
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,416
Do you understand what I'm saying?

647
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,583
So, I…

648
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,750
I need you to pack your bags
and be ready to go.

649
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,673
- Tomorrow night.
- What are you talking about?

650
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,333
- I can't just...
- Please, please.

651
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,000
Please, just do that for me.

652
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,500
And I promise,
I'll explain everything when I get back.

653
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But you trust me?

654
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:05,041
Yes, I...

655
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:11,458
You be ready to go.

656
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,333
And don't tell anyone.

657
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,708
Anyone. You understand?

658
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,291
There's a few things for me to do,

659
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,250
and then I'm coming back here for you,
I promise.

660
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,166
I promise.

661
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:28,875
I love you.

662
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,166
We're getting out of here.

663
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:38,208
We're getting out of here.

664
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:45,333
The things that we're gonna be,
you and I,

665
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:46,916
in America.

666
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,125
Ohh… A lord…

667
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,083
and his lady.

668
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:55,166
No, a queen and her stable boy.

669
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,625
[laughing]

670
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,541
All right.

671
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,791
This is one of my favorites.

672
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,291
I don't find myself in this one
too often, but… [sighs]

673
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,083
…I like it when I do.

674
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,791
Because he is…

675
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,125
[sighs]

676
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,208
Well, you saw.

677
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,208
He's so much himself in this one.

678
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,250
Before it went bad.

679
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,791
I haven't seen you
in this one before, though.

680
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,791
What are you doing here? Ho...

681
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,375
- How did you slip into my...
- I-I'm so sorry.

682
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,666
- Miss, I'm so...
- No, I wouldn't go out there.

683
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,708
I think this is when it happened.

684
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,833
I can never bring myself to watch.

685
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,750
- I-I… I'm so sorry, Miss...
- Hannah!

686
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,250
I'm so sorry.

687
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:03,291
[Peter] What are you doing up?

688
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,541
I…

689
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,083
What, you couldn't sleep?

690
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,708
We heard something.

691
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,375
Something downstairs.

692
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,750
And Flora's doll house, well…

693
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,666
something strange.

694
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:22,916
I'm sure it's fine.

695
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,416
Go on back to bed, both of you.

696
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,916
[drawer unlocking]

697
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,000

698
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,083
[sighs]

699
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,541
I thought I said go back to bed.

700
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:35,666
[jarring thud]

701
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,583
[Peter grunting]

702
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,708
[Miles screaming] Peter!

703
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:39,541
No, Miles, stay here.

704
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,166
[sinister music playing]

705
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,083

[frightening musical swell]

[music stops abruptly]

709
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,041
I thought I said go back to bed.

710
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,083
What's with the faces?

711
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,500
Come on, back to bed.

712
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:29,625
What happened?

713
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,833
- What do you mean?
- What did she do to you?

714
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,833
Who?

715
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,125
Rebecca?

716
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,625
You're a bit too young to hear, my lad.
[chuckles]

717
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,750
What's that?

718
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:48,125
It's…

719
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,166
the lady.

720
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,375
From the lake.

721
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,041
She's…

722
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:58,916
Don't you remember?

723
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,250
[haunting gust]

724
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,208
[Peter grunts]

725
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:17,416
[haunting gust]

726
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,916
[chuckles nervously] What?

727
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,750
No, no, no. No, no, no.

728
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,333
[chuckles softly]

729
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,958
[chuckling]
She's a creepy little thing, though.

730
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,291
- [Flora] Hm.
- Did you make that yourself?

731
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,958
I've seen her before.

732
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:46,458
The others…

733
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:48,291
they say…

734
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:49,875
"Stay away from her."

735
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What others?

736
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,958
[slow footsteps in distance]

737
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,083
Oh, no.

738
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:01,666
She's coming back.

739
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,625
[wet footsteps approaching]

740
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:20,916
[Peter] Stop.

741
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,541
[yells] Stop!

742
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,291
Stop, let me go.

743
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
[clattering]

744
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,375
Let me go! Let me go!

745
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,791
You bitch!

746
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,291
Let me go!

747
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,375
[breathing shakily]

748
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,000
- [frightening bang]
- [Hannah gasping]

749
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,416
- Ah!
- [cracking sound]

750
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,416
[Owen] This as an opportunity
to hone my skills.

751
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,666
In Paris, I was a sous-chef,
so I only cut vegetables.

752
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,416
Here, I'll be doing everything myself.

753
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,083
- It'll be a-a great learning experience.
- Again?

754
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:12,666
- Yes, apparently, we're doing this again.
- Why?

755
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,375
[sighs heavily] You tell me.

756
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,041
I mean, this is all you.

757
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,708
I'm you, aren't I?

758
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,708
We've been doing this
since it happened, haven't we?

759
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,208
I'm sorry, uh… [sniffles]

760
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,708
I'm having a difficult time.

761
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,666
Owen, is it?

762
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,041
You know what?

763
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:35,833
Sure. Yes.

764
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,625
- Owen.
- You see, um…

765
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:41,208
I'm having the strangest of dreams.

766
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,125
- Are you?
- Yes, I am, but…

767
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,208
they're so strange.

768
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,750
I'm having somebody else's dream.

769
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,041
To sleep,

770
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,000
to sleep perchance to dream.

771
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,416
Ay, there's the rub.

772
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,458
For in that sleep of death,

773
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,375
what dreams may come

774
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,416
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil.

775
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:08,041
What dreams?

776
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,625
Oh, well, of Peter.

777
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,708
And of, um…

778
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:15,500
I don't know, actually, um…

779
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:17,458
A woman.

780
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,000
Okay. So, a woman in bed with him.

781
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,083
Oh, my!

782
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,666
- This woman I've not met before, have I?
- Haven't you?

783
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,750
Oh…

784
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:26,458
Rebecca.

785
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,750
It's two years away.

786
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,875
Not yet, huh?

787
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,666
Needs to cook a little longer, I think.

788
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,083
All right, then.

789
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:41,875
One more time.

790
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:44,750
- You are Hannah Grose.
- Yes.

791
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,833
The year is 1987.

792
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
You're at Bly.

793
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,291
Dominic is dead, Charlotte is dead.

794
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,416
Rebecca is dead.

795
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,541
Peter is missing.

796
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:57,291
You think.

797
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:58,875
Flora is eight.

798
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:01,708
And Miles…

799
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:07,166
Something is wrong with Miles.

800
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,541
[birds chirping]

801
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,166
[lighter clicks]

802
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,791
- [ominous music plays]
- [Hannah] Peter Quint!

803
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,625
You step away from that boy,
do you hear me?

804
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,500
The police have been looking
and looking for you,

805
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,666
and when they find out that you're back…

806
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,375
Hannah Grose.

807
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:45,583
Step away, Miles.

808
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:46,750
- He won't.
- He will.

809
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:48,958
Miles, step away.

810
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:51,541
Honestly, Hannah,
do you ever get tired of being such...

811
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:54,333
- Miles.
- I swear, you're such a bore,

812
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:57,541
- and you don't know when...
- [Miles] To leave well enough alone.

813
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,000
For fuck's sake, woman!

814
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:05,750
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

815
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,333
- Miles.
- No.

816
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:10,916
Most of the time, but not right now.

817
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,166
And believe me,

818
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,833
nothing would make me happier

819
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,750
than to be arrested by those police
you were talking about.

820
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,958
To be dragged off this fucking property.

821
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:25,625
Away from this god-awful trap!

822
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,250
But I can't, can I?

823
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:31,916
You can't.

824
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,125
Because?

825
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,416
You're dead.

826
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:38,375
Mm.

827
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,416
And it's such a shame…

828
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:44,833
that you had to go and follow us.

829
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,708
It was going so well.

830
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:51,625
Honestly, Hannah!

831
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:52,833
[Hannah cries out]

832
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:54,208
[dramatic music plays]

833
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:57,833
[thud]

834
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,166
[water dripping]

835
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,125
[Miles] Mrs. Grose? What's happening?

836
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:22,125
What?

837
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:24,958
Mrs... Mrs. Grose,
I'm having the strangest dream.

838
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,333
[Flora] Miles! She's here!

839
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:31,375
She's here, and she's even prettier
than I imagined!

840
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,250
Oh, this is her?

841
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:37,041
[Dani] Hi, Miles! It's nice to meet you.

842
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,500
- So pleased to meet you, my lady.
- Oh!

843
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,041
[chuckles]

844
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,666
Well, aren't you the gentleman?

845
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,250
And this must be Mrs. Grose.

846
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:47,083
[chuckles] Hi.

847
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,291
- Oh.
- Dani.

848
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:51,875
Oh, I'm so sorry, I was, um…

849
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,351
- Goodness, I wa... I was miles away.
- [Dani laughs]

850
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,041
Yes, sorry, Hannah Grose. It's, uh…

851
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,041
- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

852
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:01,041
Was the journey okay?
I see you made it in one piece.

853
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:01,958
Oh… [laughs]

854
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,333
Yeah. Oh, it was perfect.

855
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,833
[Hannah] Oh, that's good.

856
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:07,916
Yes, uh, wonderful.
That Owen is a fine young man.

857
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,320
- He's a good sort.
- [Dani] Yeah.

858
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:13,125
- [Dani laughs]
- Right, well, let's find our way inside.

859
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,791
I'm sure Miss Clayton is eager

860
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,208
- to see the house.
- [Dani] Yes.

861
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:17,666
[Hannah] Right. Well, come along.

862
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,166
- Now, how will I...
- You can call me Dani.

863
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,750
[Owen] <i>We can't count on the past.</i>

864
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,208
[fire crackling]

865
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,291
[melancholy music playing]

866
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:28,291
We can't count on the past.

867
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,916
That's what I learned,

868
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,541
taking care of Mum.

869
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,708
That's kind of what dementia is, isn't it?

870
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:39,041
I suppose I learned a lot in this.
Or maybe not.

871
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,958
But that's the biggest thing.

872
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:45,250
We can't count on the past.

873
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:50,958
I mean, we think we have it
trapped in our memories, but…

874
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,333
memories fade.

875
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,666
We could fade at any time.

876
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,166
Paris.

877
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,041
Say it with me. Hannah Grose in Paris.

878
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,250
What would I do in Paris?

879
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,791
Well, I don't know.

880
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:12,125
Eat croissants and-and drink good wine.

881
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,333
And live, Hannah.

882
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Live!

883
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:17,250
Do whatever the hell occurs to us
in the bloody moment.

884
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:20,125
You and me.

885
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,750
While we still can.

886
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,208
Yes.

887
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,708
Yes, Owen, I, um…

888
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,041
I will go to Paris with you.

889
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,791
Yes.

890
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yes.

891
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,125
- I'll-co-hol you later.
- No, wait.

892
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,083
No, no, um…

893
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,833
I know the road. It's fine.

894
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,625
Wait.

895
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,166
Please.
