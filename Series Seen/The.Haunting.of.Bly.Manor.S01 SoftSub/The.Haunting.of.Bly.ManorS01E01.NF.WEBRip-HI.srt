[gentle music playing]

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,875
[woman]
<i>We lay my love and I…</i>

[insects chirping]

5
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>…beneath the weeping willow.</i>

00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,916
[water gurgling]

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
[gasps]

8
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,208
[woman] <i>But now alone I lie…</i>

9
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,625
…<i>and weep beside the tree.</i>

10
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,500
<i>Singin', "O willow waly…"</i>

11
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,750
…<i>by the tree that weeps with me.</i>

12
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,291
<i>Singing, "O willow waly…"</i>

13
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,791
…<i>till my lover return to me.</i>

14
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,875

[dinging]

16
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,833
[man] <i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

17
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,458
You'll get to your meals momentarily,
but first…

18
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,583
the bride has asked me to speak.

19
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,000
I thought she was joking!

20
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,750
Why invite such catastrophe

21
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,250
upon your own wedding?

22
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,916
- [guests chuckling]
- [man] But, as she explained,

23
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,125
"No, heavens, no. Not the wedding,

24
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,583
the practice meal."

25
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,250
The rehearsal dinner, for God's sakes!

26
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:52,541
I must claim my right as a slightly drunk,
completely jet-lagged Englishman

27
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,916
to well and truly speak my mind.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,791
Because I want to warn you all,

29
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,666
you young people
have absolutely no idea

30
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,166
what you are letting yourselves in for.

31
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,208
Oh…

32
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,958
Here's a horrifying statistic.

33
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,750
Did you know
that almost half of marriages these days

34
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,000
do not end up in divorce?

35
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,750
[guests chuckling]

36
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:21,750
That means there's a strong probability
that you two get to watch each other die.

37
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,458
And that's the preferred outcome.

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,166
To truly love another person

39
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,958
is to accept that the work of loving them

40
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,791
is worth the pain of losing them.

41
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,750
And that's it.

42
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,791
That's all.

43
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,958
And if that scares you
as much as it scares me,

44
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,166
then I say run.

45
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,708
Go off and do drugs on a beach in Bali.

46
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,833
Devote yourself to a life
of the mind. Run!

47
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,625
Run while you still can. You're young,
you're strong. The world… [fades out]

48
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,791
[bride] No, I'm serious,

49
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,416
- we actually refused to stay here.
- <i>She </i>refused.

50
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,980
[female guest 1] I didn't know
staying here was even an option.

51
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,721
[bride] There's three suites
in the castle,

52
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,934
- and Jack wanted to stay here…
- [Jack] Just one night.

53
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,375
…before we left for the honeymoon.

54
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,625
Just tomorrow. Just after the reception,
so we could just stumble upstairs.

55
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,291
[bride] But I said,
"No way, not after those stories."

56
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,458
[female guest 1] Wait, just the stories?

57
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,375
- You didn't <i>see </i>her?
- No! God no, I didn't see her.

58
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,750
If I saw a dead woman, a dead nun,
no less, crying in the corners,

59
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,833
- we would not be getting married here.
- Okay, it's just a story.

60
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,541
This place used to be a convent for, like,
a few decades in the '40s.

61
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,865
It's part of the sales package.

62
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,583
They can charge a few hundred extra
for the ghost story.

63
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,791
Look, I love a good ghost story,
I just don't want to sleep in one.

64
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,583
[female guest 2]
We honeymooned in Ireland.

65
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,208
They kept telling us
to look out for Seamus,

66
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,166
the stable boy.

67
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,000
- Oh, Seamus.
- [guests chuckling]

68
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,375
[female guest 2] They said his head was
crushed in where a horse had kicked him.

69
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,625
[bride] Ghost stories are worse
when there's a kid.

70
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,375
[female guest 2] Adds a little something,
doesn't it? [chuckles]

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,541
I have a story.

72
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,208
Well…

73
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,666
…it isn't really my story.

74
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,708
It belongs to someone I knew.

75
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,666
And it's not exactly short.

76
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, it seems we have time enough, and…

77
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,083
wine enough.

78
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,875
Why not?

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
All right, then.

80
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,875
A ghost story.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,458
Again, this story isn't mine,

82
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,625
but it is full of ghosts of all sorts.

83
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,375
And if a child gives the effect,

84
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,958
another turn of the screw…

85
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,958
…what do you say to two?

86
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,458
<i>The teacher was, by choice,
a solitary young woman.</i>

87
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,916
<i>Come up to London in trepidation
to answer in person an advertisement…</i>

88
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,166
…<i>placed by one Lord Henry Wingrave</i>

89
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,791
<i>regarding his young nephew and niece,</i>

90
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,833
<i>who were in need of an au pair.</i>

91
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,500
<i>A full-time position, it said.
Live-in, at that,</i>

92
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,208
<i>in his old family home in Essex.</i>

93
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,916
<i>A great good place,</i>

94
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,458
<i>alone in the country.</i>

95
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,000
[cars honking]

96
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,875
Miss Clayton, is it?

97
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,041
Oh, call me Dani. Hi there.

98
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,458
Please, have a seat.

99
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,958
- You're a teacher?
- Yes.

100
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,875
Or I was.

101
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Fourth grade.

102
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,875
In the States.

103
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,416
Mm-hmm.

104
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,375
Been in England long?

105
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,958
[sighs] About six months.

106
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,541
Six months? During which time, you've…

107
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,833
Well, I've…

108
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,036
[in British accent]
…fallen quite in love with London.

109
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,041
God.

110
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,375
Tea? Coffee?

111
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,541
[without accent] No, thank you.
Haven't quite mastered tea yet.

112
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,791
I'm used to it coming in a pitcher.

113
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,208
Full of ice cubes…

114
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,875
…and lemon wedges, and…

115
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,541
Well, it's a whole different thing here.

116
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,833
[Henry] Yes, it is.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,625
You've no previous experience
as an au pair.

118
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,708
Well, I…

119
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,166
I've quite a bit of experience
with children, Mr. Wingrave.

120
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,208
In a classroom,
but this is a full-time, live-in position.

121
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,708
I know, that's actually why

122
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,125
- I responded to the ad.
- The children are wonderful.

123
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,541
Exceptional, really,
my niece and my nephew.

124
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,916
Exceptional children, as I said.

125
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,458
But challenging, both.

126
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,708
Miles, my nephew, is back home
from boarding school early.

127
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,583
He needs structure,

128
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,500
discipline more than ever, I fear.

129
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,625
Mm-hmm.

130
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,541
Well, can I ask why he was sent home?

131
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,434
- Spring session shouldn't end...
- You'd be expected to tutor him

132
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,916
so he doesn't fall behind.

133
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:10,333
In that respect, your classroom experience
may actually be of use.

134
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
The same with Flora,

135
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,583
my niece.

136
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,583
You'd tutor her as well.

137
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,458
Your ad mentioned the position
was in the countryside?

138
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,000
In Bly,

139
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,416
my family's country house.

140
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,875
The children are used to Bly, they…

141
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,833
spent summers and holidays there
with their parents,

142
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,666
before they passed.

143
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,291
It's a great good place, the manor.

144
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,750
There are few others on the grounds.

145
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,000
A cook, groundskeeper.
They stay in town.

146
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,375
There is a live-in housekeeper,
but the children…

147
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,958
would be your responsibility
and yours alone.

148
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,750
Don't call on me
unless it's an emergency.

149
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,375
I'm extraordinarily busy.

150
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,291
I understand.

151
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,375
You know,

152
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,625
one of my more unique assignments
at my school

153
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,333
was specific
to some of our highest-need children,

154
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,708
- one of whom had actually lost their par...
- What's the catch?

155
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,708
I'm sorry?

156
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,833
The catch. You're what?

157
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,083
Thirty?

158
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,333
Mid-twenties?

159
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,333
I wonder…

160
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,125
What's the catch?

161
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,041
You're younger than most
who'd apply for this sort of thing.

162
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,125
What makes a woman of your age

163
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,958
want to give up her life
to take care of someone else's children?

164
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,125
A life in America, at that.

165
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,791
Full-time as well.

166
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,958
It seems odd… to me, to be frank.

167
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,125
Hm.

168
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,250
It seems odd to me too.

169
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,750
The listing, I mean.

170
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,625
A full-time position
in a beautiful country manor

171
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,250
to two exceptional children.

172
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,750
But I saw your ad six months ago.

173
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,208
When I first arrived in London.

174
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,666
And I have seen it every month since.

175
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,000
Seems to me an easy position to fill.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,666
At least as you've described.

177
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,458

I know I didn't get the job,

187

and that's totally cool.

188
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,250
But that was the most awkward
job interview of my entire life.

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,833
So, I think we should toast to it,
Mr. Wingrave.

you can tell me now, right?

193
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,208
I'm honestly so, so curious.

Oh, come on. No one?

201
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,166
We did find someone for a while.

And then, she… [sighs]

207

Well, I-I suppose she died.

208
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,583
It was her own fault, to be blunt.

209

Her choice, to be blunter,

210
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,958
but she died on the grounds.

People are superstitious,
especially in the country.

212
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,250

Never mind the parents died abroad.

Never mind the governess took her own…

217
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,916
So, yes, the story precedes the job,

218

- at least at all the agencies.

And you try to help…

234

I could. I could make a difference.

355
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,041
Oh, it was perfect.

356
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,625
- Oh, wonderful.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,833
Yes, that... that Owen is a fine young man.

358
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,708
- Good sort. [chuckles]
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,458
Right, well, um,
let... let's find our way inside.

360
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,083
I'm sure Miss Clayton
is eager to see the house.

361
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,125
- Oh, yes.
- [chuckles] Right, well, come along.

362
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,833
- Now...
- You can call me Dani.

363
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:48,750
Nonsense.

364
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,708
Children, you will call her Miss Clayton,
like we agreed.

365
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,666
[storyteller] <i>Her first look at Bly
yielded no discomfort,</i>

366
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,291
<i>no foreboding.</i>

367
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,208
<i>It was exactly as Lord Wingrave
had described.</i>

368
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,208
<i>A great, good place.</i>

369
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,666
<i>And it yawned open to welcome her home.</i>

370
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,166
[door creaks shut]

371
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,291
This is the foyer,

372
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,125
and it's perfectly splendid.

373
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,666
- It's beauti...
- Come along!

374
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,333
This is the kitchen,

375
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,791
and it's perfectly splendid.

376
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,625
And this is Owen.

377
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,333
He's the cook,

378
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,750
and he's splendid.

379
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,953
- [Dani] Mm-hmm.
- Perfectly.

380
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hello, everyone.

381
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,083
Hey again.

382
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,000
Hi!

383
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,125
Hi, Flora.

384
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,500
- This way.
- [Dani chuckles]

385
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,583
[Flora] The paintings are all original,

386
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,166
which means they're painted by hand,

387
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,541
and they're perfectly splendid.

388
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,000
This is the classroom.

389
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
It's…

390
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,166
…quite boring.

391
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,958
These are the lovely stairs,
but you mustn't run on them.

392
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,101
If you fall, you can injure yourself,
and the stairs are not forgiving.

393
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,083
Not forgiving in the least. Do you see?

394
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,208
Mrs. Grose says
they're brutal on the knees…

395
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,125
- Oh.
- …but I don't have any issues.

396
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,968
- [laughs gently] Gorgeous!
- [Hannah] It is.

397
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,720
A great good place.
Heaven for the children.

398
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,125
But mind the stairs,
they're brutal on the knees.

399
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,041
[Dani chuckles]

400
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,875
And this is where our parents
used to live.

401
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,125
We don't go in there anymore.

402
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,500
[Flora] We don't go in there anymore.
It's all covered up.

403
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,291
[Hannah]
This room is closed at the moment.

404
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,916
And covered up. But underneath it all,

405
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,875
it's all just perfectly splendid.

406
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,833
[Hannah]
Let's leave Miss Clayton to freshen up.

407
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,291
[Flora] Of course.

408
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,625
But then we must show her
the statue garden.

409
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,458
She'll see it all eventually, Flora.

410
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,291
We'll see you after you've settled.

411
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,583
And once you have,
we'll have to show you the rest.

412
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,500
[Hannah] Flora!

413
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,583
[Flora] Coming.

414
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,875
[giggles]

415
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,875
Oh!

416
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,916
I'm sorry. May I come in?

417
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,666
Yes. Of course.

418
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,083
Perhaps knock from now on.

419
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,416
Of course.

420
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,750
I just wanted to say
how happy we all are that you're here.

421
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,000
And to give you this.

422
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,000
Not much, I know.

423
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,875
Just a little something
to make you feel more welcome.

424
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,750
Thank you.

425
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,666
It's very pretty.

426
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,416
I'm just gonna finish up here
and see you in a few minutes, okay?

427
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Of course.

428
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,416
Thank you.

429
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,208
[teapot whistling]

430
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,250
[Dani] I hope it's all right.

431
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,416
I haven't quite figured out tea yet, so…

432
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,125
Mm. It's fine, dear.

433
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,458
- [Miles] Mm.
- [Owen] Dinner is served.

434
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:12,291
- [gasps theatrically] Wow!
- [Owen] There you go, mate.

435
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,791
- [Miles] Thank you.
- Owen makes the best dinners.

436
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,125
He made me
a macaroni-and-cheese sandwich once,

437
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,041
which was divine.

438
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,000
So, what brings a young American like you
to England?

439
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,458
And Bly of all places.

440
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,625
Oh, you know,
just wanted to see the world.

441
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,908
- [Hannah] Mm-hmm.
- And what do you think of it so far?

442
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,708
- Um, Bly? Or the world?
- I want to go to Australia.

443
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,833
Or Florida, because it's almost my name.

444
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,875
- [Hannah chuckles]
- That's right.

445
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,125
- It's just so gorgeous here.
- Yeah.

446
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,875
I know I keep saying that,
but there's no other word.

447
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,291
- I could think of a few others.
- Oh, hush now, Owen.

448
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,250
- He likes to wind me up.
- She likes being wound up.

449
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,250
Aren't you joining us?

450
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,208
Oh, uh…

451
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,458
Um, not tonight, sweetheart.
I've got to go home to my mom.

452
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,583
Disappointing.

453
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,625
You sound just like her.

454
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,291
Is she feeling better?

455
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,375
Much.

456
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,125
Better every day, I reckon.

457
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,458
All right. [sighs]

458
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,875
Good night, you lovely young lady.

459
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,083
And good night to you, too, Flora.

460
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,041
[Hannah] Ugh, heaven help me, this man.

461
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,125
Enjoy.

462
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,208
So, he lives with his mother?

463
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,041
[sighs] Lives <i>for </i>her, more like.

464
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,291
That's why he came back from Paris.

465
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,708
- [Dani] Mm.
- She took ill. Quite ill, I've heard.

466
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,083
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

467
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,625
He said she's getting better.

468
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,875
Yeah, better every day.

469
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,500
He says that, but he leaves earlier
and earlier these days.

470
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,375
He used to stay every night for supper.

471
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,458
Maybe she feels well enough to eat,

472
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,250
so he has to get home in time
to cook for her.

473
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,333
I'm sure you're right, sweetheart.

474
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,416
What? You're not gonna eat?

475
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,250
Oh… Oh, well, yeah.

476
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,041
- I'll have it later.
- [Dani] Okay.

477
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,225
[whispering]
I'll give you some pointers.

478
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,750
Thank you.

479
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,541
[Flora]<i> I wish to look like a gnome.</i>

480
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,625
A bubble gnome.

481
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,916
[chuckling]
Well, you're sure getting there.

482
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,375
[Flora giggles]

483
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,833
What?

484
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,958
It really is very silly, isn't it?

485
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,333
[Dani chuckles]

486
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,958
Yes, you're a very silly girl.

487
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,708
Where did you get that?

488
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,166
- What?
- The butterfly clip.

489
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,250
Oh…

490
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Um…

491
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,750
Miles gave it to me.

492
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,833
He shouldn't have done that.

493
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,166
Why not?

494
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,791
Because it doesn't belong to you.

495
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,416
Who does it belong to?

496
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,041
- Miss Jessel.
- Who's that?

497
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:49,875
The other one.

498
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,958
- Before you.
- I'm…

499
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:53,916
I'm so sorry.

500
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I…

501
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,291
I'm so sorry.

502
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,041
I was wrong. It's actually fine.

503
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:09,833
Can I get out now?

504
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,125
Can I play with my dolls?

505
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,666
Yeah. Fifteen minutes, okay?

506
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
[ominous music plays]

507
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,125
[mirror squeaks]

508
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,750
[Dani sighs]

509
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,958
You know, I've gone
to every kind of school you can think of.

510
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,166
Have you?

511
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,541
Even a boarding school once, like you.

512
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,375
I know how hard it can be.

513
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:49,375
It's not so bad.

514
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,208
Well…

515
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,916
…you're home now, aren't you?

516
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,166
Look, you can talk to me
about whatever you'd like.

517
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,208
About school.

518
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,166
Anything that happened there.

519
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,750
I promise, I've heard it all.

520
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,583
It's very kind of you.

521
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,125
Good night, Dani.

522
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,083
Good night.

523
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:26,166
You know, Mrs. Grose seems to think
you should call me Miss Clayton.

524
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,125
Didn't you like it?

525
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,125
I'm sorry?

526
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,666
The butterfly.

527
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,125
Oh, I… [clicks tongue]

528
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,625
[sighs]

529
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,041
You know, Flora…

530
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,208
was a little upset, I think.

She's always a little upset.

532

Whether she admits it or not.

533
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,291
But she's so, so glad you're here.

534
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,041
And so am I.

535
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,875
Well, thank you for making me feel
so welcome.

536
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,166
[Dani] Bedtime!

537
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,250
- And I'm finished.
- [Dani] Mm-hmm.

538
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:08,958
Perfect timing.

539
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:12,875
Is that me?

540
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,083
Why, no, silly. You're you.

541
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,000
It's just a dolly.

542
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Touché.

[gentle piano music plays]

00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,208
[Dani] Who are all these?

545
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,750
[Flora] Why, they're dolls, of course.

546
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:26,833
[Dani chuckles]

547
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,791
You, miss, have a lot of dolls,

548
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,458
and we're going to learn

549
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:36,125
how to pick them all up
before we go to sleep, okay?

550
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,208
[Flora] Put her back.

551
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,458
She stays…

552
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,041
there.

553
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,000
And you're all tucked in.

554
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,000
And it's time for bed.

555
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,583
It's just lovely that you're here.

556
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,791
Thank you, Flora.

557
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,958
But you have to promise me something.

558
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,416
Of course.

559
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,375
You have to promise me

560
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,541
that you'll stay in your room.

561
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,083
Don't leave your room at night.

562
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,208
Stay in your bed until morning.

563
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,625
I don't think I can promise that.

564
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,267
But it's certainly a good rule
for you and your brother...

565
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,583
But you must.

566
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:39,708
Okay.

567
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:41,666
At least for tonight.

568
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,250
Now get some sleep.

[Miles] Miss Clayton!

Come see what I found!

00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:17,166
You left your room last night
even though you promised you wouldn't.

- Miss Clayton!
- [Dani] How do you know that?

602
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,000
You've got to stay in your room.

603
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:21,958
Come and see!

604
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,250
- Why?
- So she doesn't see you.

605
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:25,583
[Dani] Who?

606
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,750
The lady.

607
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:30,875
What lady?

608
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,125
- The lady in the lake.
- [Miles] Flora.

609
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,583
Flora, look.

610
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,375

Look, I've been a teacher
for nine years, Miles.

00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,416
That's almost your whole life.

[tender piano music plays]

616
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:01,625
In all that time, a lot of kids have tried
to scare me in a lot of different ways,

617
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,416
and you know what I learned?

618
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,708
I'm a lot braver than people think.

619
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:10,458
Including me.

620
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,750
[Miles] I wasn't trying to scare <i>you,</i>
Miss Clayton.

621
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,401
I knew you wouldn't be frightened.

622
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,208
Did you?

623
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,791
Of course.
I knew that about you right away.

624
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,750
Hm.

625
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,041
Is that something you used to do
at school?

626
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:27,375
Play pranks?

627
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,333
Tricks.

628
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,916
I never quite saw the point of tricks.

629
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,666
Your uncle told me a little bit
about your problems at school.

630

You spoke with my uncle?

631
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,250
Well, of course. He hired me.

632
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,250
Did he ask about us?

633
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,875
All he did was talk about you two.

634
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,625
He misses you both.

635
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:55,916
Very much.

636
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:00,541
No, he doesn't.

637
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,291
Of course he does.

638
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,708

working on the grounds today?

People that wanna have a look
at the gardens.

They take liberties,

They can't get up there,
not without going through the house.

The only way up there
is through the old wing.

And where don't we go?

00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,625
[both] The old wing.

- You're not gonna eat anything?
- Oh, no, I already ate.

709
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,500
Just here for the company.

710
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,000
You must try this.

711
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,291
[Hannah] Flora, don't.

712
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,166
[birds chirping, insects chittering]

713
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,291
[quiet, unsettling music plays]

714
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:47,708
[Dani gasps]

715
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,291
Oh…

716
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,916
Did you... Did you find anyone?

717
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,666
- No.
- [Hannah] Oh.

718
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:56,958
I didn't.

719
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,208
But…

720
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,291
I did find some…

721
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,833
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting you?
[chuckles awkwardly]

722
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,083
Oh, no. No, not at all.

723
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,166
What did you find?

724
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,166
Ah.

725
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,166
It's Flora.

726
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:14,500
- Ah, Flora, Flora…
- I've seen a few of these.

727
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,791
Well, you can't judge them.

728
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,625
Not after what they've been through.

729
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,916
Mr. Wingrave told you about their parents,
I'm sure.

730
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,833
- Only that they passed.
- Mm.

731
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,500
Two years ago, now.

732
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:31,083
Miles was only eight. Flora, six.

733
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:32,250
[Dani] Mm.

734
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,583
And that's enough bad luck
for two children to bear,

735
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:35,708
but then to think…

736
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,666
what came after.

737
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,791
Your... your predecessor.

738
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,500
- Miss Jessel?
- Yeah.

739
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,416
Rebecca.

740
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,583
God…

741
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,583
Rebecca. Poor Rebecca.

742
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:52,916
She was…

743
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,416
She was a bright young thing.

744
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,958
She was ambitious, intelligent.

745
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,125
Kind of heart.

746
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But…

747
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,500
…there was a man.

748
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:11,666
Which really is the only thing
that can bring down a woman like that.

749
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,791
All the world's vices
in disguise of its graces.

750
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,666
Anyway, the less said about him,
the better.

751
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,500
You know he skipped town?

752
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:24,000
With a tidy sum of Henry's money
and the poor thing's heart.

753
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,791
Stole a lot, that one. Sticky fingers.

754
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:31,125
And to see her
in the days leading up to it.

755
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:35,250
So broken.

756
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,208
So empty.

757
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:42,916
She was gone long before
she waded into that lake.

758
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:45,791
Oh…

759
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,333
Flora found her.

760
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,208
And Jamie found Flora.

761
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,291
To hear her tell it…

762
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,583
Rebecca's body in that water.

763
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,875
Face down.

764
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,750
And little Flora just…

765
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,166
…stone-still…

766
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,208
…staring.

767
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,208
And I…

768
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,083
To think I used to cringe
when I heard the children…

769
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,416
running through the house,
screaming and kicking up a fuss.

770
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,375
But in the weeks
after Miss Jessel there…

771
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:23,166
Silence, it never felt so terrible.

772
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:25,541
And now…

773
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,375
Now, when I hear them…

774
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,333
cry, or… [sniffles]

775
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,250
…scream, or yell…

776
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,541
God, it's the most beautiful sound
in the world.

777
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,500
- I'm so sorry.
- [Dani] No.

778
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,208
- It's all right.
- Oh, God, look at me.

779
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,291
[sighs]

780
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,625
Oh…

781
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,041
It's a talisman.

782
00:43:57,208 --> 00:44:00,000
A tiny game of Flora's
to keep us all safe.

783
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:02,916
Us.

784
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,791
God. My God, these children.

785
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,666
Both of them
trying in their own way, I think.

786
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,333
[Dani] Mm.

787
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,041
[inhales deeply]
You know, I should head back.

788
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,750
Owen and Jamie
will be leaving for the evening.

789
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,791
But I'm happy to watch the children
before bed if you'd like a moment.

790
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,875
Wh-What are the candles for?

791
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,291
The dead.

792
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,750
There's more of them than I'd like,
the older I get.

793
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,666
I'm sorry.

794
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,583
Oh, God, no need. [sniffs]

795
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:35,916
I have been, and I remain,
a very happy woman.

796
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,541
[Dani laughs gently]

797
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:44,625
[somber orchestral music playing]

798
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:46,708
[insects chittering]

799
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:53,708
Good evening, Miss Clayton.

800
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:55,791
Time for bed.

801
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:58,541
Is it?

802
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:00,708
I shouldn't think so.

803
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:02,708
No more games, Miles.

804
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:05,416
Do you like games, Dani?

805
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,083
Not at bedtime.

806
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,333
[Miles]
It's the best time for games, really.

807
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,375
[Flora] Stop being weird, Miles!

808
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,875
He's so weird sometimes.

809
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,916
[Dani] And you…

810
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,750
sweet thing.

811
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,500
Imagination.

812
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,375
I love…

813
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,333
your imagination.

814
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:42,583
And everyone in this house is so lucky…

815
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,583
that you're using yours to keep us safe.

816
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:48,458
Just promise me…

817
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,875
that when you're keeping us all safe,

818
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,458
that you keep yourself safe first.

819
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,750
And no going on the parapet.

820
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:57,458
Okay.

821
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,416
You really are, you know?

822
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
I'm what?

823
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:04,166
Perfectly splendid.

824
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,375
[Dani chuckles softly]

825
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,458
Good night, sweet girl.

826
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,166
Oh…

827
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,833
I'm sorry!

828
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,666
You know, you need to make sure
that you pick these up.

829
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,791
I would hate to break…

830
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:31,208
Where would you like her tonight?

831
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,583
In the house or under the dresser?

832
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:36,000
[Miles] Miss Clayton?

833
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,833
[Dani sighs]
I was just about to tuck you in.

834
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,416
There's an electric fan
in Flora's cupboard.

835
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,416
I cannot sleep without it, I'm afraid.

836
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,083
That... that's right.

837
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:47,375
My cupboard.

838
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,958
Would you fetch it for me?
I'm awfully sorry.

839
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:53,625
Oh…

840
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:54,708
Sure thing.

841
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Well…

842
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,333
here you go.

843
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:03,125
She can sleep with you tonight.

844
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:10,208
Okay, let's look.

845
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,375
Hmm.

846
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,958
- I don't see it!
- [Miles] It must be under some clothes.

847
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Okay.

848
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,333
- [door slams]
- [lock clicks]

849
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:36,625
Guys.

850
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:38,500
I said no games.

851
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,833
Open up!

852
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:43,583
Open the door!

853
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,375
Open it!

854
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,333
- [lock rattling]
- [Miles] I'm trying!

855
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,166
Miles!

856
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,125
[Miles] I'm trying!

857
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,375
Flora!

858
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,583
[Flora] It's stuck. We're really trying!

859
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,750
Okay, it's not... it's not funny.

860
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:01,083
Open the door.

861
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:03,875
[Flora] We'll have to find the key.
It really is stuck.

862
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,416
- We're very sorry!
- The key is in the lock, Flora.

863
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:07,666
Turn the key.

864
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,916
- [door rattling]
- [Miles] It's not! We can't find it!

865
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,416
I'm being serious.

866
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:17,916
Open the door!

867
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,666
[door stops rattling]

868
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,750
[ominous music playing]

869
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Miles!

870
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:28,083
Flora?

871
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,458
Open the door!

872
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:33,166
[door rattling]

873
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,500
[yelling] Open the door!

874
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,333
- [pounding on door]
- [Dani yelling] Open the door!

875
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,583
[screaming] Open the door!

876
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,208
[panicked breathing]

877
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:43,291
No!

878
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:44,958
Open the door!

879
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Guys!

880
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,291
[Dani screams]

881
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,083
[panicked whimpering]

882
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,708
[screaming] Let me out!

883
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:00,916
Let me out!

884
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,083
Let me out!

885
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,500
[Dani crying]

886
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:07,791
- Let me out! Let me out!
- [pounding on door]

887
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,750
Let me out! Let me out!

888
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,625
[Dani pounding on door, whimpering]

889
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:16,416
[insects chirping]

890
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,166
