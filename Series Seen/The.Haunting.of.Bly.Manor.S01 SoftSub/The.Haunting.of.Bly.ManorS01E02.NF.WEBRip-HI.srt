00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,916
[theme music playing]

2
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,791
[music fades to silence]

3
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,250
[water sloshes]

00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,458
[storyteller] <i>The housekeeper
was no stranger to muddy footprints.</i>

5
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:27,458
<i>A few times a year, it seemed,
she started her days with a mop.</i>

6
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,583
<i>Always the same path.</i>

7
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,375
<i>From the door to the forbidden wing,
and back again.</i>

8
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,083
The door got stuck.

9
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,125
It was stuck,
and we couldn't get it open.

10
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:50,958
Honest.

11
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,500
And the mess in the hall?

12
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,416
It's just a bit of mud.

13
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,625
[Dani] Hm.

14
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:01,833
Well, I forgive you.

15
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,875
But I'm afraid I…

16
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,333
I don't believe you.

17
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,000
That's the issue.

18
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,041
[Flora grunts]

19
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,458
[Dani] Miles!

20
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,875
[Hannah exclaims]
Miles, I just mopped that bit!

21
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,958
[Miles breathing heavily]

22
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,666
[chute bangs shut]

23
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,791
[Dani] Can I have that, please?

24
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,333
- What are you...
- [Dani] Not me.

25
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,458
You.

26
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,541
That was entirely unacceptable,
and now you are going to finish mopping.

27
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,750
- But that's not fair!
- [Dani] Hey.

28
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,166
It's just a bit of mud.

29
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,291
[Miles sighs]

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,666
Now, you'll finish mopping

31
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,125
while Flora and I go get her doll back.

32
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,666
A-Assuming…

33
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,750
[inhales deeply]

34
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,833
…that's all right with you, Mrs. Grose?

35
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,541
Oh, n-no, it's... fine by me.

36
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,333
In fact,
we've had this conversation before,

37
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,833
haven't we, Miles? Hm?

38
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,916
Every few weeks, it feels like these two
are off on a midnight run,

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,208
and muggins here
is left to mop up their mud.

40
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:31,958
[sighs]

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,041
[cheerful whistling]

42
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,208
[Owen] Good morning.

43
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,583
[Dani] Excuse us, Owen.

44
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,333
- Hi, Owen.
- Flora.

45
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,750
Come on.

46
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,250
I don't like the cellar.

47
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,791
It's perfectly dreadful down there.

48
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,958
Can I stay and have a glass
of orange juice with Owen, please?

49
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,916
- [Dani chuckles]
- [Flora] I'm sorry, I'm not being cheeky.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,375
It's just… I quite hate the cellar.

51
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,458
It's perfectly dreadful.

52
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,375
[Dani chuckles] Is that all right?

53
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,041
I'll just be a sec.

54
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,791
Somebody's brother threw their doll
down the laundry chute.

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,875
Oh… of course.

56
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,166
Thank you.

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,333
[Owen] Hmm.

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
[switch clicks]

59
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,666
[clicking]

60
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,708
Brothers can be
perfectly dreadful sometimes, can't they?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,041
He isn't, though.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,958
He really isn't.

63
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,583
You have a fine heart, miss.

64
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,083
[light fitting creaking]

65
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,833
[footsteps ascend quickly]

66
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,833
[door creaks]

67
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,916
[door slams shut]

68
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,166
[Dani] <i>Look who I found.</i>

69
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,208
What's her name?

70
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,333
She can't remember.

71
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,458
Are you gonna hang it in your room?

72
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,208
For protection?

73
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,083
No, I took it down.

74
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,166
- [Dani] Why?
- [Flora] Because it doesn't work.

75
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,875
[Dani] Miles?

76
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,208
Miles?

77
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,125
You can go get dressed.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,583
[creaking sound]

79
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,708
Miles?

80
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,458
Miles?

81
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,291
[echoing] Miles, are you okay?

82
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,041
[school bell ringing]

83
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,125
[door opens]

84
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,541
[students chattering]

85
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,333
[man] All right, boys.

86
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,416
Let's settle down.

87
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,708
Let's find our seats, shall we?

88
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,083
[student] Hello.

89
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,708
Welcome.

90
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,416
Good morning, gentlemen.

91
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,875
[students] Good morning, Father Stack.

92
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,333
[sighs] I trust you all had
a very festive Christmas.

93
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,791
- [students] Yes.
- [Father Stack] Excellent.

94
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,708
I think we have a majority.

95
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,750
Well, then…

96
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,416
spring term.

97
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,958
Congratulations. Seems like you've made it
through the winter,

98
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,083
though not without a few casualties.

99
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,750
I'm afraid Brian Duncan
won't be joining us for a bit.

100
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,541
- Yes?
- Is he ill?

101
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,791
No, Mr. Hooper. Nothing quite so serious.

102
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
He took a bit of a tumble.

103
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,416
He is on the mend
and will be back with us shortly.

104
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,666
So…

105
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,000
shall we begin?

106
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,708
Bibles.

107
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:47,708
"Now, there on the hillside,
a great herd of swine was feeding."

108
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,416
"And the unclean spirits begged him,

109
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,250
'Send us into the swine.'

110
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,208
'Let us enter them.'"

111
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,125
"So, he gave them permission."

112
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,958
"And the unclean spirits came out
and entered the swine."

113
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,333
"And the herd rushed down the deep slope

114
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,166
into the lake and were drowned there."

115
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,166
So…

116
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,208
…there we have it.

117
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,333
Three Gospels,

118
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,916
three slightly different accounts
of the same event.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Three different places
that it could have happened.

120
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,666
But the broad strokes remain the same.

121
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,416
Jesus cast the demons,
known as "Legion" in Luke and Mark,

122
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,916
unnamed in Matthew,

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,500
out of a single man,
according to Luke and Mark,

124
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,583
two men according to Matthew, into…

125
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,958
and on this they all agree,

126
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,125
- a herd of pigs.
- [boy 1] That then go jump in the lake.

127
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,041
That then go jump in the lake, exactly.

128
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,375
[boy 2] Um, but why was Matthew
being so contrarian?

129
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,291
- [boy 3] What's contrarian?
- It means he was being a tit.

130
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,875
- [students giggling]
- Hey, language, Obermann. Final warning.

131
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,000
Miller, excellent question.

132
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,916
Why do the Gospel accounts differ?

133
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,625
Well…

134
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,541
because man is fallible.

135
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,291
Even the men who wrote these Gospels.

136
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,166
Even me, which I'll have to remind
some of your parents, no doubt,

137
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,958
once they get wind of this conversation.

138
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,500
They needed permission?

139
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,541
The demons?

140
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,750
- Permission to…
- [Miles] To enter the pigs.

141
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,083
Ah! Yes, they did.

142
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,791
Did they need it for him, though?

143
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,250
Did they need it for the man?

144
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,041
Ah… Excellent question, Wingrave.

145
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,166
And that, actually,
is the… the big takeaway here,

146
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,708
so thank you for asking that.

147
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,541
We are, all of us,
free to make our own choices.

148
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,291
It's one of the most important gifts
that God has given us.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,208
A gift that not even the demons
in this story could usurp.

150
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,166
See, evil exists,

151
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,250
and we are tempted.

152
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,291
But we are not compelled.

153
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,708
So, yes.

154
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,166
They did need his permission.

155
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,333
[school bell rings]

156
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,583
As they need ours!

157
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,416
All right, gentlemen.

158
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Wingrave.

159
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,958
Uh, quick word.

160
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,875
The headmaster passed this onto me
this morning.

161
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:20,041
It's not often that a... a student
gets any post on the first day.

162
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,250
And judging by the writing
on the envelope,

163
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,958
- I assume it's from...
- My sister.

164
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,125
Very thoughtful of her
to have it waiting for you.

165
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,625
Something to make you feel
a bit more at home, no doubt.

166
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,375
You asked some excellent questions today,
by the way.

167
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,916
Thank you, sir.

168
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750
You are most welcome.

169
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,541
And, Wingrave…

170
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,666
I want you to know that this room
is a... a safe place for questions.

171
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,333
Not just about your studies.

172
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,416
About anything you like.

173
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,916
I am here,
as are the other members of the staff,

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,208
so if you feel the need to talk,

175
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,833
we'll listen.

176
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,208
You're in none of this alone,
is what I'm driving at.

177
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,291
Thank you, sir.

178
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,833
Well, I won't keep you.

179
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,125
Oh…

180
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,041
John 16:22.

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,041
It's brief, I promise, but it's helped me

- I'm glad you're all right.
- Yeah.

217
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,666
Why'd you do it?

218
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,416
Do what?

219
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,041
Why'd you jump?

00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,166
What was that?

222

I didn't jump.

[weakly] Here.

- Yes.

Okay, let me get you up.
Thank God.

- Loosen your tie. There you go.

Okay, everybody back to class, now.

248
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,625
Go on, all of you.

- [bird coos]
- [Father Stack] So, you started it?

250
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,833
Had he wronged you in some way?

251
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,500
Said something to you?

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,291
Something to set you off?

253
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,875
Look, Miles…

254
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,166
I wanna help you,
but I need you to help me,

255
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,333
to understand this.

256
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,083
And not only me, Hooper's parents.

257
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,458
They could push for a suspension.

258
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,916
And the headmaster
will want to mollify them. But…

259
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,625
…I put myself ahead of that.

260
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,916
The headmaster and I have already spoken…

261
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,583
…and I have made it clear

262
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:25,166
that your well-being is my responsibility,
and priority…

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
moving forward.

264
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,916
But, Wingrave…

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,125
…this isn't the way.

266
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,250
Look, I understand
what you're going through.

267
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,916
Or, you know what? Maybe I don't.

268
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,583
Maybe I don't, so…

269
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,458
So, tell me.

270
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,666
Be <i>my </i>teacher.

271
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,333
Hm?

272
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,541
We all do terrible things sometimes.

273
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,500
That's expected.
It's... it's baked into us from the start.

274
00:16:56,083 --> 00:17:01,666
But it's that feeling of remorse,
that guilt, that terrible guilt,

275
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,833
burning inside your chest, that's…

276
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,208
that's what distinguishes us
in God's eyes.

277
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,500
None of us are blameless.

278
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,916
Except the soul that's not yet conceived
and the animals.

279
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,875
Like Pidge over there.

280
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,625
They're the only innocents.

281
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,208
Then it wasn't fair, was it?

282
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,250
What wasn't?

283
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,791
What Jesus did to the pigs.

284
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,583
In the demon story.

285
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:34,958
Maybe not.

286
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:39,750
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
A cliché, I know, but…

287
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,125
…true.

288
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,416
And death is something to mourn,

289
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,916
not fear.

290
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,500
And you've had to deal with death…

291
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,750
…far, far more
than a child your age should.

292
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,958
Far more.

293
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,708
[sighs]

294
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,500
They're in a better place, Miles.

295
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,583
I don't know everything, but…

296
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,750
I do know that much.

297
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,083
They're in a better place.

298
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,125
They're not coming back.

299
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,250
I'm afraid not.

300
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,291
That's not fair either.

301
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,791
No, it isn't.

302
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,500
Why do the bad ones get to come back,

303
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,291
and not them?

304
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,666

[man, sternly] Master Wingrave…

311
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,750
is there anything you'd like to say?

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Anything at all?

313
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,166
I have a mind to expel you, young man.
I truly have.

314
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,291
But Father Stack…

315
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, Father, I'll let you say it.

316
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,708
[Father Stack sighs]

317
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,083
Wingrave…

318
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,708
Miles.

319
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,583
What you've done,
it… it can't be minimized, it…

320
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,916
can't be avoided by not talking about it
or by you being sent home.

321
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,250
It follows you.

322
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,666
Do you understand? It…

323
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,083
It stays.

324
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,208
But remorse,

325
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,333
or demonstrating remorse,

326
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,000
won't make all of this go away,

327
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,541
I'm not gonna lie to you,
but it is the first step

328
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,458
towards some kind of absolution.

329
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,083
Hm… Towards grace.

330
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,083
Look, I-I know
that you have been through a lot.

331
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,416
Do not feel sorry for me.

332
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,458
Your parents… and your au pair.

333
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,250
- More than we could hope to understand.
- Don't.

334
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,166
And the weight of all that
could cause one, anyone,

335
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,791
to do terrible things,
even if they didn't mean to.

336
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,291
It could press one,

337
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,875
- drive one to commit acts that...
- We are not compelled.

338
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,958
What our chaplain is saying

339
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,916
is that we're going to start
with an apology and go from there.

340
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,833
He is correct
about your special circumstances…

341
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,458
…but I at least have to insist
on the apology.

342
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,291
For God's sake,
we at least have to have that.

343
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,166
[raises voice] Speak!

344
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,083
That animal is dead
because of you, Wingrave.

345
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,375
Dead doesn't mean gone.

346
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,541
[headmaster] What did you say?

347
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,750
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,333
I know you are, Miles.

349
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,833
I know that, and I also know that…

350
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,916
- together, you and I...
- I'm sorry I didn't do worse.

351
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:09,375
Cut off its head, spread out the insides,
or burn it.

352
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,333
I'm sorry I didn't do worse.

353
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,000
- [headmaster] Ahem.
- [Father Stack sighs]

354
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,333
[headmaster] Right, then.

355
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,500
Get Master Wingrave's uncle
on the telephone, please.

356
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,583
[Miles] I'm sorry, Father.

357
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:36,791
I…

358
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,500
I needed to find your key.

359
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,416
That's all.

[storyteller]
<i>And so the reason for Miles's expulsion</i>

361
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,083

<i>He was expelled, it turned out,
for an injury,</i>

363
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,333
<i>an accident, a crime,</i>

364
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,250
<i>a fight,</i>

365
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:03,833
<i>and, finally,</i>

366
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,541
<i>an affront.</i>

367
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,166
<i>Why he'd done any of these things,
no one would understand.</i>

368
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,416
<i>Only the letter from Flora,</i>

369
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,250
<i>delivered when he arrived,
forgotten in the dormitory,</i>

370
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,500
<i>would offer a possible clue</i>

371
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,625
<i>as to why he tried so, so hard
to be sent home.</i>

372
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,041
[whispering] "Come home."

373
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:51,666
[sighs]

374
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,416
I'm finished.

375
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay, I'll be with you in just a sec.

376
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,125
- Are they gonna go back in their house?
- [Flora] Later.

377
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,750
Okay.

378
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,250
Spick and span!

379
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,208
- I imagine you learned that at...
- Boarding school.

380
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,083
Yeah. Professional, I'd say.

381
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,916
[chuckles] Why don't you come
teach your sister how to do it?

382
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,708
She'll think it's just splendid.

383
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,666
- Oh... But...
- Just splendid.

384
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:44,125
[footsteps receding]

385
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:51,666
[cup clatters]

386
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,000
What are you up to?

387
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,166
Hannah's got the day off, it seems.

388
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,375
Mm. The new missus put the children to it.

389
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,458
Yeah.

390
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,250
For real?

391
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,833
- [Miles] Mm.
- [Hannah] Mm-hmm.

392
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,250
[Dani chuckles]

393
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,333
Nice.

394
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,250
How are they doing?

395
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,208
Perfectly. [chuckles]

396
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:15,958
I could get used to this.

397
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:20,416
[Hannah] Oh, I don't know, I feel lazy.
Like some sort of lazy layabout.

398
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,958
Go on, admit it.

399
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,708
- You're loving having this wee break.
- Oh, I suppose.

400
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,750
I just don't like seeing them punished,
is all.

401
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,500
They're not the first to track mud
through the halls. You should know.

402
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,500
Every time I see you
marching towards the house,

403
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,583
I find my hand drifting towards the mop.

404
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,041
Firstly…

405
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,416
I always wipe my feet, I'll have you know.
And, secondly…

406
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,970
what about when
they locked her in a closet?

407
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,041
Oh, now, you can't blame them for that.

408
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,916
Given what they've lost,
strangeness is expected.

409
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,958
You can't give them a pass forever.

410
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:54,666
Look, you clean up after them,
Owen feeds them, Rebecca…

411
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,166
Rebecca coddled them.

412
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,375
But this one…

413
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,375
- This one's got them doing hard labor.
- Oh, come on, now.

414
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,791
[Jamie laughing] What?
That shite works.

415
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,208
Well, it worked on me.

416
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,875
Look at me now.
I'm a shining beacon of reform.

417
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:10,875
[both laugh]

418
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,250
[Jamie] Ah, thank God. You're a star.

419
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,416
- Cheers.
- Hannah?

420
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,458
[Hannah] Hm?

421
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,875
- G and T?
- Oh, no.

422
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:21,750
No, thank you. Not for me.
Gin is a sad drink.

423
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,541
[Owen groans]

424
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,541
- [Jamie] So, Owen…
- Hm?

425
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,500
Thoughts on the new au pair.

426
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,000
- Gossip.
- What?

427
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,916
It's just Christian concern, Hannah.
All right, fine.

428
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,750
On a scale of zero to American,

429
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,000
how would you rate her?

430
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,958
- [Hannah and Owen] American.
- [all laugh]

431
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,666
[Jamie] There we have it.

432
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,041
Though, maybe a bit too pretty.

433
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,458
Do you think she's pretty, Owen?

434
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,416
Jamie!

435
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,791
- [Jamie laughs]
- Uh…

436
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:48,916
[Jamie] Look at him!

437
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,333
He's tongue-tied.

438
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,333
- He can't answer.
- [Owen clears throat]

439
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,250
It's just romances don't fare well at Bly,
do they?

440
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,392
- [Jamie] We're just having a laugh.
- [Hannah] I know.

441
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,958
But then that's how it starts.

442
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,500
Don't worry.
I only have eyes for you, Hannah.

443
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,958
- Oh.
- Enjoy your break, ladies.

444
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,750
Oh, I almost forgot.

445
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,166
Um, in the kitchen,
there's a crack in the ceiling.

446
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,916
Would you mind popping in
to have a look?

447
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,333
Where exactly?

448
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,416
Uh, by the stove,
high up towards the ceiling.

449
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
You can't miss it.

450
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,250
I'll get round to it.

451
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,958
Great work, you lot! Keep it up!

452
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,208
[footsteps approaching]

453
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,875
[door creaks]

454
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,583
[Dani] Flora, you cleaned!

455
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,958
Well, how sweet of you.

456
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:36,916
You're welcome.

457
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,583
I put all your things into the wardrobe
and chest of drawers.

458
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,333
[suspenseful music plays]

459
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,291
Are you cross with me?

460
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,166
I-I found these, too.

461
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,791
I didn't break them. I promise.

462
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,083
- They were like this already.
- It's fine.

463
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:07,833
It's fine.

464
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,583
[gasping softly]

465
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:20,958
Excuse me a minute.

466
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,208
[panicked breathing]

467
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,458
[gasping, sobbing]

468
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
You all right?

469
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,541
Kids.

470
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,791
Run you ragged.

471
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:57,833
[Dani] Yeah.

472
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,125
[Jamie] Well, people really.

473
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,708
- All of them.
- Mm-hmm.

474
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,166
That's why I prefer plants.

475
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,125
Easy to get along with.

476
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,208
And I find if I don't like one,

477
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,083
one looks at me kind of funny,

478
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,291
I can always just…

479
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:13,958
you know…

480
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,208
[makes choking sound]

481
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
[Dani sniffles]

482
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,750
So, if it's child-rearing advice
you're after, I'd just…

483
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,000
[Dani laughs]

484
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,625
…start there, maybe.

485
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,083
There we are.

486
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,333
It's not so bad, right?

487
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:30,875
Yeah.

488
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,625
I cry three, maybe four times a day
around here.

489
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,541
Five, if I'm really being honest
with myself.

490
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,958
How else do you think
I keep all these fucking plants watered?

491
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,750
With my endless well of deep,
inconsolable tears.

492
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,083
That's how.

493
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,708
It's what got me the job
in the first place.

494
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,750
Look, you're doing great.

495
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,833
You're doing great.

496
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:58,916
Thank you.

497
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:00,708
Anytime.

498
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,083
[Dani sighs]

499
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,000
Right. [clears throat]

500
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,250
Well, back to it, then.

501
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,083
Chin up, Poppins.

502
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:13,708
[door opens]

503
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:15,958
[door closes]

504
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,541
[footsteps approaching]

505
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,250
Uh, where are you off to?

506
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,916
Heading back to the garden.
I have a few more weeds to pull.

507
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,958
Trying to earn time off
for good behavior, then?

508
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,500
Have a lovely afternoon, Jamie darling.

509
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,125
"Darling?"

510
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,333
[sighs]

511
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,208
[water running]

512
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,541
[echoing bang]

513
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,750
[cabinet door squeaks]

514
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:10,625
[water turns off]

515
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,583
[exhales heavily]

516
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,666
[clears throat]

517
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,416
[birds chirping, insects chittering]

518
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,666
No, no, no, no, not too much,
or they'll come to take you away.

519
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,791
Who will?

520
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,041
The food police.

521
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,458
For a salt and buttery.

522
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:35,541
[Flora giggles]

523
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,333
Oh, my God.

524
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:40,083
You're such a lovely man, Owen.
Why must you speak?

525
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,750
- [Dani laughs]
- [Miles] Miss Clayton?

526
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,041
Might I have a word?

527
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,041
Yeah, sure thing.

528
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:47,833
In private.

529
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,166
[phone ringing]

530
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,583
- [Owen] We've got this, right?
- Right.

531
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,125
Wingrave residence.

532
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,541
[Flora in distance] Hello? Hello?

533
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,166
Hello?

534
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,375
So?

535
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,958
I'd like to apologize.

536
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:24,583
For all of it.

537
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,875
For locking you in the wardrobe closet,
for the mess in the hall.

538
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,458
All of it.

539
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,041
But, most importantly,
for being such a child about it.

540
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,958
Being around Flora,
I sometimes forget myself.

541
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,708
Wow.

542
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,125
That's, um…

543
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,250
I think
Flora just misses Miss Jessel terribly.

544
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,250
So, we play little games
to keep her from feeling sad.

545
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,333
Mm.

546
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,083
Such a draining thing.

547
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:00,958
Dealing with children.

548
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,833
[Miles whistling]

549
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,541
Little shit.

550
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:18,916
Hey.

551
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,375
Little fucking shit.

552
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,708
Hey, he's just a kid.

553
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,250
I'm gonna kill him.

554
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,041
- I swear to God...
- No. Hey, they're just a few flowers.

555
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,291
Oh! Sure. Well, that's fine, then.

556
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,958
A little boy cut a few flowers.

557
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:33,708
- What's the big deal?
- They weren't ready to be cut!

558
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,333
[Jamie sighs]

559
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,125
Look, I just…

560
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,976
I have a way of doing things,
and I don't like people

561
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,541
- messing about in my garden.
- No, you're right.

562
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,333
You're right.

563
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:50,916
I'll talk to him.

564
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,333
[sighs] 'Course.

565
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,875
[sighs] Look, could we just go back
to the bit

566
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,583
where, uh, you were acting mental

567
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,625
- and I had to talk <i>you </i>down?
- [Dani laughs]

568
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,000
[crickets chirping]

569
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,250
Ten minutes, okay?

570
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,625
I wanna see teeth brushed,
hands washed, and pajamas on!

571
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,416
Good day?

572
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,833
- Great day.
- Aw.

573
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,333
- [Dani] Now…
- Mm.

574
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,541
I've got a little surprise set up
for the kiddos,

575
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,875
if you wanna join.

576
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,375
Oh… Oh, uh…

577
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,333
No, I couldn't.

578
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,791
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

579
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,875
I just, well…
I haven't been sleeping very well.

580
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,708
I think I'll turn in for the night.

581
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,166
- Okay.
- Good night, darling.

582
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,458
- Good night.
- Good night.

583
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,958
[Dani] All right, you two, line up!

584
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,625
[Dani giggles]

585
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,083
Hmm.

586
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,000
Pajamas seem to be in order.

587
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,500
[chuckles]

588
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:50,708
Let's see those hands.

589
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,166
Good, good.

590
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,250
Sure. Teeth!

591
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,875
[teeth clack]

592
00:34:58,958 --> 00:34:59,958
Ahh.

593
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,666
[Dani giggles]

594
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,250
You did so well…

595
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,208
that, as a reward,

596
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,958
we can play a game.

597
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,416
Hm?

598
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,125
Any game you like.

599
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,916
We'll be back in our beds
before too long, right?

600
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,458
We can't be out of our rooms too late.

601
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:20,875
[Dani] We won't.

602
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,625
Hide-and-seek!

603
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,208
Okay, hide-and-seek, sure.

604
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,291
- Is that all right with you, Miles?
- [Flora] Please?

605
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:36,166
[crickets chirping]

606
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:43,583
- [Dani] Ten, nine, eight…
- [footsteps running]

607
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,083
…seven, six…

608
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,500
five, four…

609
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,250
three…

610
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,000
two, one.

611
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,791
Ready or not, here I come!

612
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:06,000
- [clock ticking quietly]
- [door creaks]

613
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,375
[wind whistling softly]

614
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,083
[Dani] You aren't down here, are you?

615
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,541
This wing is off limits, game or not.

616
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,166
Okay?

617
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,125
[thud]

618
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,333
[music box playing "O Willow Waly" softly]

619
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,708
[door creaks open]

620
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,458
[music box tune grows louder]

621
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,833
[Flora humming "O Willow Waly"]

622
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,541
[reedy voice joins Flora
humming "O Willow Waly"]

623
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,041
[music box continues playing]

624
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:12,000
[Flora and voice continue humming]

625
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,250
[Flora stops humming]

626
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,458
[other voice grows loud and strangled]

627
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,375
Shh!

628
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,458
[voice stops]

629
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
[Flora resumes humming]

630
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,458
[music box continues playing]

631
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:30,666
- Got you!
- Jesus, Miles!

632
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,559
- Got you.
- I'm supposed to be looking for you,

633
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,642
- and this wing is off...
- I'm going to start counting,

634
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,833
and it'll be your turn to run and hide.

635
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:38,958
I'll find you.

636
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,125
[strained] Ease up!

637
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:41,583
Ease up!

638
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,791
[Miles, yelling] One! Two! Three!

639
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,500
- Four!
- Miles!

640
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,291
- Five…
- No, game over!

641
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,041
- [Miles in distance] Seven! Eight!
- Miles!

642
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,125
[Miles] Nine!

643
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,000
[Dani] Miles.

644
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,416
[rapid steps]

645
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,041
Flora!

646
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,583
Olly, olly, oxen free!

647
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:10,500
Hm.

648
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,583
[creaking sound]

649
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,500
[wind whistling]

650
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:19,833
Hey.

651
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,333
[sighs]

652
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
[wind howling eerily]

653
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,958
[door creaking]

654
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,000
Shit. [breathes shakily]

655
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,125
[gasps softly] Oh.

656
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,083
[echoing gasps]

657
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,708
[wind resumes whistling]

658
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,416
[eerie music building]

659
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:02,583
[frightened gasp]

660
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,000
[panting]

661
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:19,500
[softly] I'm gonna call
the fucking police. I'm... I'm gonna…

662
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,000
[yells] I'm gonna call the fucking police!

663
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Dani.

664
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,375
I-I don't feel so good.

665
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,333
- [thuds]
- [Dani gasps]

666
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,583
- Oh, God.
- [Dani] I saw him.

667
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,916
I swear to God.

668
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,875
In the window.

669
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,916
Same guy. Same guy as yesterday.

670
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,125
I-I'll lock the doors.

671
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,791
Hey! Hey, hey!

672
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:53,625
It's okay! You're okay, you're okay!
He's awake!

673
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,041
[sinister clashing sound]

674
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,583
- [Hannah] Oh, thank goodness.
- [Dani] He's awake.

675
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:59,375
- [Hannah] Thank God.
- [Dani] He's awake.

676
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,458
He's awake.

677
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,666
[frightening music building
to final close]

678
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,833
[closing music playing]
