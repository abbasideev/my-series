1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,916
[theme music playing]

2
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,708
[Flora, echoing] She hasn't moved.

3
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,500
[Miles, echoing]
Are you certain? I don't like this.

4
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,250
[Flora] Neither do I.

5
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,541
[Miles] We're not arguing, it's just…

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,375
It's more that I don't see
how this is part of the game.

7
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,958
[Flora] People shouldn't bleed in games.

8
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,583
Oh, see?

9
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,416
Here she comes.

10
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,548
[in clear voice]
Were you tucked away just now?

11
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,267
- [muffled moans]
- [Flora] Where did you go?

12
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,000
If you don't mind me asking.

13
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,791
But why not?

14
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,583
- [Dani crying]
- She's our friend.

15
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,708
[screams]

16
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,333
- [Dani screams]
- She's worried. Look.

17
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,416
[screaming]

18
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,125
[Miles] She can't even hear you.

19
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,083
I think she'd feel better
if you told her this yourselves.

20
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,791
[Dani continues moaning]

21
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,250
Come on. She's scared.

22
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,375
[panting and crying]

23
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,333
[panicked moaning]

24
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,166
[Dani whimpering]

25
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,541
What's the matter, Miles?

26
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,250
Like I said,

27
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,041
this feels wrong.

28
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,916
You know…

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,625
life is a bit funny in that way.

30
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,958
Sometimes,

31
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,041
right can seem wrong,
and wrong can seem right.

32
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,291
[Dani continues moaning]

33
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,041
But that's the difference
between children and adults.

34
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,833
Seeing the big picture.

35
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,041
Now, you can see it.

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,750
And…

37
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,875
I already know that.

38
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,083
Like the bird at school.

39
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,041
You see…

40
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,125
that felt wrong,

41
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,625
but it got you back home to Flora,
and she needed you home.

42
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,791
So, you did what you had to do
in order to keep Flora safe.

43
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,958
It's not the same.

44
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, heavens, no. No.

45
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,250
Helping someone be quiet

46
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,583
is not even a little bit
the same as the bird.

47
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,791
- But you've done nothing wrong, okay?
- [Dani panting]

48
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,375
[Peter] Both of you.

49
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,708
- Nothing wrong.
- [Miles] She's hurt.

50
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,166
[Peter] No, she's not hurt. She's just…

51
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,666
scared.

52
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,958
[Dani crying]

53
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,666
She doesn't know yet…

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,958
there's nothing to be scared of here.

55
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,625
Please, don't be frightened.

56
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,583
C-Can't you just tuck her away?

57
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,875
Somewhere nice,

58
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,875
till she feels a little bit better.

59
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,250
[Dani moaning softly]

60
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:51,041
Where would you like to go,
if you could pick anything?

61
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,958
- The best thing you can remember.
- It's not quite that simple, Flora.

62
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,791
Why not?

63
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,500
Well, she's never gone
dream-hopping before, has she?

64
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,875
I mean, it takes a little practice.

65
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,583
Remember?

66
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,833
She's very clever.

67
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,833
She'll learn fast.

68
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,541
Faster than me, I think.

69
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,375
[Rebecca] It's different, Flora.

70
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,416
It's not quite the same.

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,708
- [Hannah, echoing] <i>Priceless heirlooms.</i>
- It's… It...

72
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,833
Um…

73
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,416
- Well, I mean, it...
- [Hannah, echoing] <i>Priceless heirlooms.</i>

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,684
<i>- They're not missing, they're stolen.
- </i>[Rebecca] Well…

75
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,875
- Um, it's…
- [Dani moaning]

76
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,958
- [Hannah] <i>They're not missing.</i>
- I mean, um, it's…

77
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,750
<i>- </i>[Hannah] <i>They're stolen.</i>
- I…

78
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,041
- [Hannah] <i>Priceless heirlooms.</i>
- Becs, you're slipping.

79
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,083
Becs, Becs, you're slipping. Stay with me.

80
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,166
Becs! Becs!

81
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,083
[Dani breathing rapidly]

82
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,875
It's okay.

83
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,708
It's okay, kids. She's just, uh…
she's dream-hopping a little.

84
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,208
She'll be back.

85
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,291
The important thing is…

86
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,708
is we need to figure out

87
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,208
- what to do with our friend here.
- [muffled moaning]

88
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,750
I mean, she could get us
in a lot of trouble, couldn't she?

89
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,208
So, we need to find a way…

90
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,416
to help her…

91
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:13,958
but also…

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,166
maybe make it so
that she could dream-hop, too.

93
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,583
Wouldn't you want that for her?

94
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,666
For her to learn?

95
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,250
[Dani] No!

96
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,500
It isn't always very convenient,

97
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,125
and I don't like it much

98
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,333
when it happens unexpectedly,

99
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,041
but, the other times,

100
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,416
it's perfectly splendid.

101
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,791
- [crying]
- [melancholy music playing]

102
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,708
You'll like it.

103
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,791
But…

104
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,208
there are different keys, aren't there?

105
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,375
[knocking on door]

106
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,083
[loud knocking]

107
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,833
[Peter] That's Hannah, at the door.

108
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,291
Right, Miles,
I need you to say exactly what I tell you.

109
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,208
What?

110
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,875
- When she knocks again, I need you...
- Knocks?

111
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:09,458
Again, I need you to talk to her,
but don't open the door,

112
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,666
and you say exactly what I tell you.

113
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,291
I don't hear any.

114
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,958
Any knocking, I mean.

115
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,625
- [Peter] No.
- [pounding on door]

116
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,291
[Flora] He's hopping away.

117
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,666
- What should we do?
- [pounding continues]

118
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,125
[Flora] We never can tell,
just when you're going to be back.

119
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,333
[jarring musical crescendo]

120
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,208
No.

121
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,083
[woman] That's what you say to me.

122
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,541
All this time,

123
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,333
that's what you say.

124
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,250
And look at this.

125
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,333
Look at you.

126
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,875
And look at this.

127
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,750
You're... You're out?

128
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,041
I'm out.

129
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,916
How long this time?

130
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,458
[woman] Forever.

131
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,041
Well, I suppose they'd say I'm cured.
[chuckles softly]

132
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,375
They did.

133
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,708
They said I'm cured, free to go.

134
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,416
Wasn't much truly wrong to start with,

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,750
but here we are.

136
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,833
What do you want, Mum?

137
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,958
Just a little help.

138
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,666
Trying to get started fresh.

139
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,291
It's difficult.

140
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,625
And the doctors,

141
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,291
they don't give you anything.

142
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,166
Not even a note.

143
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,625
Nothing to say you're well.

144
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,416
Petie, I'm scared.

145
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,125
If I can't get my own place,

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,333
if I can't get my own job, well…

147
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,833
doesn't leave me a lot of options.

148
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,375
And where do I go if not your father?

149
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,916
He sent you, didn't he?

150
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,708
You know, he'd kill you if he could.

151
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,583
For what you did to him.

152
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,000
For what <i>I</i> did to <i>him?</i>

153
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,750
He says it all the time.

154
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,000
For what <i>I</i> did to him?

155
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,541
I just said I didn't want
to have to turn to your father.

156
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,500
After all he did?

157
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,875
Or to the streets. Where do I go?

158
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,125
Did you practice this together, did you?

159
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,250
I mean, where <i>do</i> I go?

160
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,833
To your father?

161
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,041
To the street?

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
To your boss?

163
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,416
You're shaking me down?

164
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,291
Lord Henry Wingrave, I presume.
[chuckles softly]

165
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,125
Amazing how far you've climbed.

166
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,916
He wound you up,

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,041
and now you're shaking me down.

168
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,166
I suppose those juvenile records,
he might not even know.

169
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,958
Sealed, aren't they?

170
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,416
How odd him not knowing.

171
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,750
I don't have any money, Mum.

172
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,916
- Oh, you're not a rich man, Petie?
- No.

173
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,208
Just work for one, do you?

174
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,291
- Forgive me if I misread.
- [jarring crescendo]

175
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,625
[Hannah] Priceless heirlooms.
They're not missing, they're stolen.

176
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,833
My apologies. Missing and stolen
are interchangeable in my speak.

177
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,625
But I'm afraid stolen heirlooms
are the least of it, ma'am.

178
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,875
What do you mean?

179
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,625
Well, Mr. Wingrave asked us
to make a full report,

180
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,458
and, uh, it appears that Mr. Quint
was quite the burglar,

181
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,791
and that, well,
I suppose he's been embezzling.

182
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,000
[scoffs] Of course he has.

183
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,166
[sighs]

184
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,625
Did he say anything at all
to you, Rebecca?

185
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,791
- Even the slightest hint.
- There a reason he'd confide in you?

186
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,791
[Rebecca] Well…

187
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,958
we-we were… I…

188
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,416
- I mean, I-I was...
- Mm. Got it.

189
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
So, did he?

190
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,416
I… um…

191
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,458
Rebecca, please. If you know anything,
anything at all, you have to tell him.

192
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,750
No, he…

193
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,833
He said…

194
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,416
[sighs] Well, he mentioned something
about having some money.

195
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,000
- [Hannah] Mm-hm.
- Just a little bit of money, maybe?

196
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,541
Quarter million pounds?

197
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,708
- What?
- No.

198
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,791
- He just said to pack a bag.
- Pack a bag?

199
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,875
Yes.

200
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,000
That we were going to America, together.

201
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,333
Sounds lovely.

202
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,458
All he said was that he had a plan,

203
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,375
and that we would live
in the States together.

204
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,791
- And this all made sense to you?
- I didn't know...

205
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,083
On a butler's wage?

206
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,291
- He isn't a butler.
- [scoffs] Didn't raise any alarms, then?

207
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,916
No.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,666
Not like you're saying it now.

209
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,833
And you're certain he didn't say
where he got this money from?

210
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,708
- No.
- [constable] No, you're not certain?

211
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,416
- Or no, he didn't say?
- He didn't say.

212
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,916
Not even to his girlfriend?

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,125
Just pack a bag.
No explanation beyond that?

214
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,208
Nothing at all?

215
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,416
I can't help you.

216
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,541
[scoffs] I'd have thought he'd tell
his girlfriend

217
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,000
- if he gave a damn about her.
- No, he wouldn't...

218
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,958
If he loved her,
I'd think he'd tell her more.

219
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,625
- He wouldn't just...
- Maybe not, since he did leave you behind.

220
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,468
- He wouldn't run away!
- [jarring crescendo]

221
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,625
[crying]

222
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,708
- [breathing shakily]
- [fire crackling]

223
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,458
[Miles] You're right.

224
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,291
Miles, you should be in bed.

225
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,125
[Miles] I couldn't sleep. I don't…

226
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,333
I feel like
I might never sleep again, frankly.

227
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,666
I heard what he said,
the policeman, before he left.

228
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,916
Flora and I listened from the stairs.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,833
It's nothing to worry about, okay?
Go back to bed.

230
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,208
You're right.

231
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,458
He didn't run away.

232
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,750
We told Hannah and the policeman,
but they didn't believe us.

233
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,333
Didn't believe what, Miles?

234
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,625
About the monster.

235
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,958
The monster that took him,
and it was awful,

236
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,166
and we thought he was…

237
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,875
But he's still here,

238
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,875
so it's actually all right.

239
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,000
He told me to tell you not to worry.

240
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,416
So, don't worry.

241
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,708
He's still here.

242
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,875
Miles?

243
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,333
[Rebecca pants]

244
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,041
- Miles!
- [jarring thud]

245
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,875
[Hannah] Why don't you use a mixer?
Save you some elbow grease.

246
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,291
[Owen] A mixer? Do I look like an amateur?

247
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,083
A mixer damages the gluten molecules,
Hannah, my dear.

248
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,500
[Hannah] Oh, would it?

249
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,666
- Not the gluten molecules.
- [Owen] Baking is just chemistry.

250
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,375
[Hannah] Oh, well, so is mopping floors.

251
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,000
One part bleach, two parts water,
and lots of lovely washing-up liquid

252
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,666
for the lemon scent, of course.

253
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,541
Seriously, just throw it
in a bloody mixer.

254
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,625
[Owen sighs]

255
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,250
What is that?

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Dough.

257
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,458
Uncooked dough?

258
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,500
Brilliant, I'm starving.

259
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,333
Well, can't rush genius, Jamie.

260
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,583
See, a mixer would damage
the gluten molecules, and we mustn't.

261
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:41,250
God help us all if those gluten molecules
aren't tippety-top.

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,166
You having one of Owen's
cooking physics classes again?

263
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,875
Oh, yes, a fine lecture.

264
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,333
It's chemistry.

265
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,375
- Mm.
- [Jamie] Certainly is.

266
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,458
What's that?

267
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,000
Hi, Rebecca, love.

268
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,833
Lunch is gonna be late today.
Something about gluten atoms.

269
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,708
I'll let the children know.

270
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,166
Why don't you stay?
Sit with us and have a brew?

271
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,041
The kettle's still warm.

272
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,708
[Owen] Uh, kids can handle 15 minutes
by themselves.

273
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,583
[Rebecca] Um…
I'm not thirsty, thanks.

274
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,750
I think I'm going to get some air.
Feels quite warm today, doesn't it?

275
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,041
[footsteps receding]

276
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,583
- [Owen sniffs]
- [melancholy music playing]

277
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,583
[birds chirping]

278
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,541
How you doing, chick?

279
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,666
Here to gloat a little, Jamie?

280
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,250
Tell me you were right about him.

281
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,000
Not just a shite but a thief,
it turns out.

282
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,188
Is that what we're doing here, is it?

283
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,916
Not here to talk about him at all.

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,583
Someone should point out
that this is a moment for you.

285
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,000
A moment you have been waiting,
and waiting, and waiting for.

286
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,500
And it is finally here,
and you're too busy moping to even see it.

287
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,791
I thought I should speak to that.

288
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,125
Cause I'd want someone
to do the same for me.

289
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,000
What are you talking about?

290
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,958
Go and speak to our phantom boss.

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,250
Tell him you want that pupilage
you talked about.

292
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,291
All this drama?

293
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,708
Quint? The imposition of it all?

294
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,750
He could do right by you, right now.

295
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,416
Get you back on your barrister track.

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,125
Get you back
to whatever goal it was you had

297
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,333
before you even knew
what a Peter Quint was.

298
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,416
Well, that's…

299
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,375
Sorry to see you hurt so much.

300
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,916
You don't deserve it.

301
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,166
And I'm sorry to see it.

302
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:17,000
And if there is anything at all
that I can do to help,

303
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,875
please tell me.

304
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,041
I'd be happy to do so.

305
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,041
Thank you.

306
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,750
[Rebecca sighs]

307
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,458
[insects chirping softly]

308
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,125
[sighs] Hm.

309
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,166
Becs.

310
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,625
What…

311
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,250
- Where the hell have you been?
- Quiet, please.

312
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,500
You said you were coming back.
You said to pack a bag!

313
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,583
- They're gonna hear you, please.
- Good! They should hear me.

314
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,625
They should call the police
because you stole.

315
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,041
- I know. I just...
- You stole from them, and I…

316
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,333
My God, I said I would come away with you,
and you made me an accomplice.

317
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,050
You would have turned me
into a criminal, too,

318
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,875
and I would have been fucking clueless.

319
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,458
- It's not like that.
- You left.

320
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,250
- I didn't.
- Not even a note.

321
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,493
- I never... Mm.
- Never what?

322
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,708
You never loved me.

323
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,458
- Y... You never told me the truth.
- No, I never left you.

324
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,083
I was here,

325
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,416
this whole time,

326
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,500
but I... I couldn't…

327
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,583
[breathing deeply]

328
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,625
You couldn't see me, not right away.

329
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,750
I had to figure out a way to make it so…

330
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,375
So that you could see me.

331
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,458
Oh, you'll need to do better than that.

332
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,916
- Much better than that.
- Becs, don't come…

333
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,208
[scoffs] What is it?

334
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,958
- Afraid I'll hit you?
- No.

335
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,583
- You don't think you deserve it?
- No.

336
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,875
- Because you do, Peter...
- Please, just listen!

337
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,000
Just for one moment.

338
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,166
[Peter panting]

339
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,500
I never left you, Becs.

340
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,750
I won't.

341
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,875
I wouldn't leave without you,
and I-I won't leave without you now.

342
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,416
That's why I'm here.

343
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,500
I'm sorry we were apart, uh…

345
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,125
however long that was, I don't…

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't even know
how long that was that…

347
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,541
What does that mean?

348
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,916
This is going to upset you.

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Upset?

350
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,291
Oh, I'm much more than just upset.

351
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,208
Please, just…

352
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,041
hold out your hand.

353
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,166
What?

354
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,500
Why?

355
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,083
Just hold out your hand.

356
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,166
[Peter takes deep breath and sighs]

357
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,708
And please…

358
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,541
Please think…

359
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,708
What's the one thing…

360
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,375
the only thing…

361
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,500
that would ever keep me from you?

362
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,791
[melancholy music playing]

363
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,458
[swoosh]

364
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
[Rebecca gasping]

365
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,125
[whispers] I…

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,708
[Miles] May we be excused, Miss Jessel?

367
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Miss Jessel?

368
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,583
[Hannah] Rebecca?

369
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,625
Are you still down here?

370
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,375
Are you all right?

371
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,291
Yes, um, I suppose.

372
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,333
- The children are asleep.
- Oh, I know. I know.

373
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,958
[Hannah sighs]

374
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,125
I'm worried for you, love.

375
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,291
I... I'm fine.

376
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,458
[Hannah] Hm.

377
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,208
Fractions, eh?

378
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,291
[chuckles]

379
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,458
Oh, yes.

380
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,125
[exhales]
Hated those when I was a little girl.

381
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,666
- Flora, um… She's quite good at them.
- [Hannah] Oh.

382
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,541
You know, uh…

383
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,333
a friend once told me something
about fractions, and…

384
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,333
grieving her breakup.

385
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,041
The maths of it.

386
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,375
How long it takes to grieve it.

387
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,833
Right, and what was that?

388
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,750
They said it's the length
of a relationship, halved.

389
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,333
- Halved?
- Mm.

390
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,416
To get over it.

391
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,000
The length of a relationship, halved,
which for you, well it…

392
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,500
it really isn't that long now, is it?

393
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,416
Well, not everything has a half-life,

394
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,250
does it?

395
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,916
[clock ticking quietly]

396
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,375
Quite right. [sighs]

397
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,828
[Rebecca, whispering] Peter.

398
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,333
[louder] Peter?

399
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,291
Gosh, it's been all I can do all day
not to just come up here.

400
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,416
Knowing you're up here
while I'm down there, it's just torture.

401
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,375
I know. I know.

402
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,500
I can see you in the classroom.

403
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,291
Couldn't risk it, you know,
'cause of the kids.

404
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I've been thinking.

405
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,000
What if… [sighs]

406
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,875
What if we still did it?

407
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,666
Did what? [chuckles]

408
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,125
Went to America.

409
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,666
I know, just…

410
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,208
we do it anyway,

411
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,708
and… and people can think I'm some
batty old witch who talks to thin air,

412
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,416
- but at least we'd be together.
- [chuckles]

413
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,875
I can't leave Bly.

414
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,875
I can't get past the end of the drive.

415
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,625
I walk and I run, and the moment…

416
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,750
[sighs] The moment I reach
the edge of the property,

417
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,083
I'm right back here.

418
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,333
Inside. Right on the spot where it…

419
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,583
Will you tell me now?

420
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,083
How it happened?

421
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,458
No.

422
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,916
[ghostly whooshing]

423
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,666
You're right there.

424
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,041
You're right there,
and I can't even touch you.

425
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,833
[crying] I can't smell you,
I can't feel you. No, it's not fair!

426
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,208
- Shh.
- It's not fucking fair! [sobbing]

427
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,611
- You're here. I can hear you...
- Shh! You've got to be...

428
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,625
- [Rebecca] Quiet, Becs!
- [ominous crash]

429
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,583
[music box playing "O Willow Waly"]

430
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,458
Becs?

431
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,625
Becs?

432
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,250
[Rebecca pants]

433
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,125
[gasping]

434
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,000
[jarring crescendo]

435
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,250
[Rebecca breathes heavily]

436
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,375
- Please.
- Peter?

437
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,041
- Oh, hell.
- What?

438
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,416
Wh-Where was I? What just happened?

439
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,583
I don't… I don't know.

440
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,666
[knocking on door]

441
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,916
What the hell?

442
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,666
What is that? Can you hear that?

443
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,333
[Rebecca] I-I was…

444
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,576
- All of a sudden, I-I was somewhere else.
- [pounding]

445
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,125
[Peter] What's that knocking?

446
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,666
What did you do to me?

447
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,750
What is that?

448
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,416
[pounding grows louder]

449
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,916
[jarring crescendo]

450
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,041
Oh, no.

451
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,250
That's what you say to me?

452
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,791
You're here, again.

453
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,416
And look at this.

454
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,833
Look at you.

455
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,166
- Look at this.
- No. No, enough.

456
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,625
Enough.

457
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,125
[breathing heavily]

458
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,208
Back.

459
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,458
Back. I have to go back.

460
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,958
Have to go back.

461
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,458
Have to go back.

462
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,708
[jarring crescendo]

463
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,791
[music fades]

464
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,833
[footsteps approaching]

465
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,625
Hey, where have you been hiding?

466
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,166
Hiding?

467
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,583
You look better of late.
Did you speak to Henry?

468
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,083
Henry?

469
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,666
About working for him in London,
like we talked about.

470
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,208
How could I forget? Oh, yes.

471
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,208
I called him.

472
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,666
Thought you said you were gonna visit,
do it in person.

473
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,958
I changed my mind.

474
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,375
- Well?
- Well, what?

475
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,583
Well, what did he say?

476
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,750
Uh, just…

477
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,958
that he'll consider.

478
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Consider?

479
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,166
For real?

480
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:32,791
Twat.

481
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,250
He owes it to you.

482
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,208
Are you okay?

483
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Yeah.

484
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,000
[door closes]

485
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,041

[birds chirping]

487

[somber music playing]

491
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,291
It didn't work.

492
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:31,958
No.

493
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,958
- [Hannah] Wait.
- [Flora giggles]

494
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,166

<i>- </i>[Flora] Can I try doing it?

495
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,291
[storyteller]
<i>Peter had not been back to find her.</i>

496
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,250
<i>He had left her at the boundary of Bly.</i>

497
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,125
[Flora] Miles, stop it!

00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,166
[storyteller] <i>The boundary impossible
to walk through together.</i>

[Flora] Miss Jessel!

00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,291
Miles, stop!

much like losing time being tucked away,</i>

Peter?

505
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,333
Peter.

506
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,041
[lamp switch clicks]

507

[whispering] Becs.

508
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,000
Where the hell have you been?

509
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,625
- It's been almost a week.
- [in normal voice] I'm sorry, I…

510
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,666
I've been learning. I've been e...

511
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,708
exploring.

512
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:12,833
What? Where?

513
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,833
Here, at-at Bly.

514
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:17,541
I've seen things. I've seen, um…

515
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,708
You trust me?

516
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,750
I need you to trust me,
because I have a plan.

517
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,041
A plan that'll let us be together again.

518
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,583
And touch each other,

519
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:34,541
and… and-and taste each other.

520
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,333
So, um…

521
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,166
these little…

522
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,916
little hiccups when I'm inside...

523
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,083
I don't know if I like those,
being pushed away into a memory.

524
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,625
No, I know. I don't like them, either.
You always push me...

525
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,148
- Yeah, but I don't try to.
- I know.

526
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,625
But that's the thing, it's…

527
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,333
It's temporary.

528
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:57,875
It's just a blip.

529
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,666
But what if there was another way?

530
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,083
A way…

531
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,416
for us to be truly together,

532
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,166
fully together?

533
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,041
- How?
- Well, that's the thing. [chuckles]

534
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,791
It's like those other times, like those…

535
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:17,333
little blips,
but I think if-if it works, that…

536
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,916
If it works, it could last forever.

537
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,458
It would be the two of us…

538
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,708
sharing a life.

539
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,875
I don't understand, but how?

540
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,458
Well, it's simple.

541
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,958
I think a lot simpler than you think, but…

542
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,416
It just boils down to you.

543
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,875
It's up to you.

544
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,000
That's why those…

545
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,250
little blips never take.

546
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,458
That's why
I keep getting pushed out, because…

547
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,208
Because you didn't invite me in.

548
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,416
You just need to decide that it's forever.

549
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,333
Permanent.

550
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,541
Uh... I…

551
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,125
H-How would I even…

552
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:01,750
- What...
- I-I don't know, I…

553
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,250
I don't know e-exactly, but…

554
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,208
But I think it's just, well…

555
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,375
I think it's just you…

556
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,416
and me…

557
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,333
b-becoming us.

558
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:19,416
It's you.

559
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's me.

560
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,541
You'll take care of me, yes?

561
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,625
Of course.

562
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,291
And we'll be together?

563
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,166
We'll share it all, everything. Equals.

564
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:33,416
I promise.

565
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,333
I love you, Peter.

566
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,833
I love you, Becs.

567
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,041
[sighs shakily]

568
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,166
[Rebecca] It's you.

569
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,291
It's me.

570
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,083
It's us.

571
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,166
[inhales sharply]

572
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,666
[moaning]

573
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
[sighs deeply]

574
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:13,625
[jarring static]

575
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,142
- [music box playing "O Willow Waly"]
- [Rebecca] You all right?

576
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,000
[Peter] Yes, just, um…

577
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:24,125
Let me show you how beautiful you are.

578
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,958
- [shutter clicks]
- [camera whirring]

579
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,541
- Can I see?
- No.

580
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,250
- [laughing]
- [Rebecca] Come on.

581
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,250
- [shutter clicks]
- [camera whirring]

582
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,958
- [laughs]
- [Peter] Come here, come here.

583
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,250
Turn around. Come here.

584
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,708
[kiss]

585
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,791
- [shutter clicks]
- [camera whirring]

586
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:51,208
[Rebecca sighs]

587
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,291
[kiss]

588
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,208
[melancholy music playing]

589
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:06,583
I'm…

590
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,416
I'm tucked away again, aren't I?

591
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,666
- Yes.
- I…

592
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,791
I-I thought... I thought we'd be together.

593
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:20,666
But we are.

594
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Peter.

595
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,625
[storyteller]
<i>He had promised they'd be equals.</i>

596
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,125
<i>But she was safe,</i>

597
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,833
<i>tucked away in a memory of them,</i>

598
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,125
<i>where they could be together.</i>

599
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,625
<i>And he was here, alone.</i>

600
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,583
<i>And he had spent
too much of his life alone.</i>

601
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,708
[water lapping]

602
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:56,291
[inhales and sighs deeply]

603
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,583
It's us, Becs.

604
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,875
- [water lapping quietly]
- [nocturnal chirping]

605
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,041
[emotional music playing]

606
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,208
[Rebecca gasps]

607

[muffled screams]

608
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
[muffled screams]

609
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,291
[water gurgling]

610
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,208
[unsettling music playing]

611
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,583
- [nocturnal chirping]
- [water gurgling]

612
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,208
[rain pattering]

613
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,250
[Rebecca sobbing hysterically]

614
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,333
No!

615
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,333
No!

616
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,375
[screaming] No! [crying]

617
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,041
No!

618
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,041
[sobbing continues]

619
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,916
Hey, Flora.

620
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,541
What are you...

621
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,416
[gasps] Fuck.

622
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay.

623
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,083
You're okay.

624
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,750
You're all good.

625
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,708
- [ghost] No!
- [Rebecca] <i>Whose is that?</i>

626
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,750
[Peter]
<i>Henry said this was yours, if you want it.</i>

627
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,476
<i>- Took a little convincing.</i>
- [distant sobs]

628
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,083
<i>I'm persuasive when I need to be.</i>

629
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,125
[music box playing "O Willow Waly"]

630
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,916
- You can be convincing.
- [Peter chuckles softly]

631
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,250
[Peter] You know, fur like that,

632
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,875
you have to feel it on your skin.

633
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,541
You have to.

634
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:30,958
Once in your life.

635
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,041
There's nothing like it.

636
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,125
[Rebecca] No, no.

637
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,833
Not this one.
Not this one, please.

638
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:43,916
[cries]

639
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,333
Let me show you how beautiful you are.

640
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,125
[Rebecca] Oh, no.

641
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,208
Please, not this. Not this memory.

642
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,583
It's not a memory, Becs. I…

643
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,875
I just thought it would make you happy.

644
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,708
[Rebecca] But it was.

645
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,958
- [shutter clicks]
- [camera whirring]

646
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,250
I just kept getting tucked away.

647
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,333
I know.

648
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,583
- I know.
- [Rebecca] Because you hid.

649
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,625
You…

650
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:23,416
Y-You... You hid from me, a-after the lake.

651
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,416
You hid,
and-and I just keep coming back here.

652
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,083
[Peter]
Let me show you how beautiful you are.

653
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,791
- [shutter clicks]
- [camera whirring]

654
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,833
Let me show you how beautiful you are.

655
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:36,958
[shutter clicks]

656
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,041
Because you left.

657
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,625
So beautiful.

658
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,333
- [shutter clicks]
- [camera whirring]

659
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,250
[Rebecca sobs] You left.

660
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,541
After the water came into my lungs,

661
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,083
- you just left.
- So beautiful.

662
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,208
[sobbing] You just left me to do it alone.

663
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:57,708
This isn't what you said.

664
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,500
It's not what I agreed. I…

665
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,291
I-I didn't…

666
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,541
I didn't agree.

667
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:09,458
- Beautiful.
- I…

668
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:10,958
[shutter clicks]

669
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,500
- [camera whirring]
- Beautiful.

670
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,666
[melancholy music playing]

671
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,708
I had to.

672
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,375
[Rebecca] What?

673
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,375
[Peter] I'm so sorry.

674
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,250
But I had to, so that…

675
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,750
Well, so that we could be together.

676
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,041
Fucking son of a bitch!

677
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:45,291
[screaming] You fucking lied!
You're a fucking liar!

678
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,708
- I had to!
- [Rebecca] No!

679
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,625
- I'm sorry, but I had to.
- [Rebecca sobs]

680
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,958
And you'll have to, too.

681
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,500
How dare you!

682
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,625
- Look, you'll understand.
- [knocking on door]

683
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,375
When…

684
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:00,791
[knocking]

685
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
[sniffles]

686
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,833
When you... When you meet the others.

687
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,833
When you see
what happens to us here, Becs.

688
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,500
- [pounding on door]
- Please.

689
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,333
[pounding continues]

690
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,416
Now, I-I-I know,
I know that there's a way out.

691
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,833
You proved that. We've proved that

692
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,276
- there's a way for...
- [pounding]

693
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,333
How?

694
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,791
- Please, not now.
- How?

695
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:24,875
Not now.

696
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,625
How? How do I get out?

697
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,833
- I'm gonna show you. I'm...
- [pounding on door]

698
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,250
Damn it, I was right in the middle…

699
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,041
[pounding on door]

700
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,833
- [pounding growing louder]
- [unsettling music building]

701
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,916
[breathing heavily]

702
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,541
No.

703
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,958
And look at this.

704
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,375
Look at you.

705
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,708
Again, we have to do this?

706
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,750
I was in the middle of something,
something important.

707
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,291
I doubt that.

708
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,333
You know the others?

709
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:11,791
Well, they seem to go to lots places,
don't they?

710
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,750
Becs, the kids.

711
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,666
They get to hop around
into the warmest little memories,

712
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,250
the nicest little moments.

713
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,083
And I always end up here.

714
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,833
Is that so bad?

715
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,000
It's hell.

716
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,416
It's like I'm in hell.

717
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:35,583
Well, where else would you go?

718
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,291
At first, I thought…

719
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,375
[pensive music playing softly]

720
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:42,541
this-this isn't so bad. I mean, it…

721
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:45,666
could've been worse.

722
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,583
I mean, I could be back there at home,

723
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,416
with Dad.

724
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,416
I could've been tucked away
in one of those nights.

725
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,916
But then I started to realize
why this was worse than that.

726
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,958
Why this was hell.

727
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,833
Because I... I was a kid back then.

728
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:12,083
I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

729
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,958
I didn't know what it meant, and…

730
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,958
And you were there.

731
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,458
You were there
to tell me that it was okay.

732
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,833
That what he was doing…

733
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,458
was okay.

734
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,666
You said I was being silly.

735
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,458
That's what you said.

736
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,166
But I was innocent, wasn't I?

737
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,208
I didn't know any better.

738
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,333
But here, this time…

739
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,833
Well, I know better, don't I?

740
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:48,083
This time, seeing you
in that fucking doorway…

741
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:53,458
I've thought about every kid
that ever spent the night.

742
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:59,333
And how you knew what you knew,

743
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,166
and you didn't stop him.

744
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,750
[sobbing breaths]

745
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,000
Why didn't you stop him?

746
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,166
He'd kill you if he knew where you were.

747
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,041
<i>You </i>killed me, Mum.

748
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:20,916
You killed me asking me to do this. I…

749
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,791
I did what you wanted.

750
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,083
And it killed me.

751
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,416
I hope you know that,

752
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:31,958
late at night,

753
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,000
that you killed your own son.

754
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:38,333
Honey, I don't even know that you're dead.

755
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,125
But I was…

756
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,375
I was... I was right…

757
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,833
in the middle…

758
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,000
of something.

759
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,416
[Dani groaning]

760
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,791
Thank you. [sobbing] Thank you.

761
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,541
Flora? Flora, hurry.

762
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,767
- Please, hurry.
- [unsettling boom]

763
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:58,791
Please, keep going.

764
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,375
- [Peter] Stop it.
- Please.

765
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,333
- [Peter yelling] Stop right...
- There! Stop it, Flora.

766
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,083
- No, no, no. [muffled cries]
- She has to stay where she is.

767
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,250
Sorry! Sorry!

768
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,708
- [Dani] Flora.
- Sorry.

769
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,791
Is it?

770
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:15,416
The minute I'm gone,
you're spinning these kids up.

771
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,708
- You're taking...
- Advantage of their good intentions!

772
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,500
- [gasping breaths]
- Shameful.

773
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,500
You're supposed to warn me.

774
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,708
- I'm sorry, I had to.
- I don't like it when you don't warn me.

775
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,166
I know. I'm sorry, okay?

776
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,750
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
It won't be like that anymore, okay?

777
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,583
- I promise.
- [Dani sobbing softly]

778
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,083
I'll explain, but it won't…

779
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:35,916
[Rebecca] Peter?

780
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,250
How long was I…

781
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,375
Oh, you're back.

782
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,708
- Are you okay?
- [Dani moaning]

783
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,250
Oh, you're back.

784
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:44,833
I'm sorry.

785
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,375
No. No, no, no, it's okay.

786
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,916
It's okay. I slipped away, too.

787
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,750
But we're back now.

788
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:53,541
We're back.

789
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,458
And we're almost done.

790
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,208
We have to finish it now.

791
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:03,083
- No, no, but it's too soon.
- No, but it's right.

792
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:04,541
It's right.

793
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,541
A little longer, we…

794
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,958
We should give them a little longer.

795
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,041
We're out of time.

796
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:14,333
She'll take them. We're out of time.

797
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,166
[Miles] What are you talking about?

798
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,166
Well…

799
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:25,166
it's what we've been talking about
this whole time.

800
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,250
That…

801
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,916
- special thing, that…
- [Dani gasping]

802
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,291
…one last thing
we've been asking you kids.

803
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,791
The forever house.

804
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:33,958
[Peter] That's right.

805
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:35,750
The forever house.

806
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,125
It's time?

807
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,666
- It is.
- ["O Willow Waly" playing]

808
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,083
But why can't we just keep it
the way it is?

809
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,666
Those… Those little hiccups
aren't so bad.

810
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,875
I know, but it's just…

811
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,541
Well, Miss Jessel and I,

812
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,833
we just need a little more from you both.

813
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,625
It's like what we've talked about,
remember?

814
00:43:56,708 --> 00:44:00,500
That special present
that will let Miss Jessel and I, well…

815
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,875
Well, let us be your friends.

816
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,333
Your best friends, forever.

817
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,375
And it's gonna save us.

818
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,375
It's gonna save us from…

819
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,291
well, you know what.

820
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,791
But I-I thought you said that...

821
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,791
I-I know what I said, Miles.

822
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,500
But we have to finish it now, okay?

823
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,625
We have to.

824
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:21,708
[Rebecca] Peter.

825
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,958
Maybe we can wait until…

826
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,333
Wait until what, Becs?

827
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,750
What? Until we fade away?

828
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,458
Until we look…

829
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:34,791
- Like this?
- [woman gasps]

830
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:36,750
[Dani yells]

831
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:41,541
'Cause that's what's gonna happen, Becs.
This is what will happen, Miles and Flora.

832
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,011
You don't want that
to happen to us, do you?

833
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:45,833
To Miss Jessel? To me?

834
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,083
No. No, of course not.

835
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,666
Because this is what happens
to everyone who dies here at Bly.

836
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,458
- [Dani screams]
- [Miles] It's fine.

837
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,750
- [woman cries out]
- [thud]

838
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,041
But not with your help.

839
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,541
[Peter] You…

840
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,958
You both can save us.

841
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:14,083
You're gonna help us break out
with that game we've talked about so much.

842
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,208
Jailbreak?

843
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,833
That's right, jailbreak.

844
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:21,333
I'm still not sure this is a good idea.

845
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,416
[Dani sobbing]

846
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,833
Miss Jessel,

847
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,000
do you promise this is a good idea?

848
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,041
Flora, I…

849
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,083
[gentle piano music playing]

850
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,833
Look, I know it's scary, but…

851
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,791
we're out of time.

852
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,291
And so, Miles, I need your help,

853
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,708
and Miss Jessel needs you, Flora.

854
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:43,791
Isn't that right?

855
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,041
It's easy.

856
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:51,708
You just have to…

857
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,541
think as hard as you can.

858
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,250
Think about you,

859
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,750
and me,

860
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,833
and then think us.

861
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:04,916
As hard as you can, just think… us.

862
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,166
- [Dani crying]
- [Peter] You have nothing to worry about.

863
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,125
Nothing at all,
'cause you're gonna be tucked away.

864
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:12,958
In the forever house, just like we said.

865
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:15,666
- With Mum and Dad?
- That's right.

866
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,291
With your loving Mum and Dad.

867
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,000
[Flora] You promise?

868
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:23,583
When we get tucked away,
we'll be tucked away with Mummy and Daddy?

869
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,291
That's right.

870
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,875
[Flora] We'll be with Mummy and Daddy,

871
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,500
and they won't fade, right?

872
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,500
That won't happen to them.

873
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,333
Because they died somewhere else.

874
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:39,875
They'll keep their faces, and so will you.

875
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:41,625
And it will be happy.

876
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,625
And then everyone will be just…

877
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,916
You promise?

878
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,500
We promise.

879
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:50,708
Now, both of you,

880
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:53,166
as hard as you can, think…

881
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,833
[breathing deeply]

882
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,750
Flora…

883
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,833
look at Miss Jessel,
and, Miles, look at me, and think us.

884
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,250
- [Dani moans]
- What about Miss Clayton?

885
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,291
- What will happen to her?
- Nothing bad.

886
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:09,958
Nothing bad, I promise you that.

887
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:13,291
See, Miss Clayton?
There's nothing to worry about.

888
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,125
I'm going to the forever house
with my mum,

889
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,333
and it's going to be just…

890
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,083
perfectly splendid.

891
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,375
[muffled] No!

892
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:22,458
Yeah, that's right.

893
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,416
- Go and see Miss Jessel.
- [Dani crying out]

894
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:29,583
I still don't feel...

895
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:31,541
No, no more pain.

896
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,083
No more sadness, ever, ever again.

897
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:39,708
No more school, no more bullies.

898
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:41,750
I'm gonna take all of that.

899
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,250
I'm gonna take it all.

900
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:48,250
Nothing sad will ever touch you,
ever again.

901
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,708
You just get your mum and your dad…

902
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,583
and a safe place.

903
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,958
With two people who love you so much.

904
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,125
So much.

905
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:06,000
That makes you
the luckiest man in the world.

906
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,916
The richest person.

907
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,166
I wi... I wish…

908
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,791
I wish I could be that rich.

909
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,583
So, have pity on me.

910
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:26,291
[Dani panting and sobbing]

911
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:28,333
Go on, be a good lad.

912
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,333
[Dani yelling] No! No!

913
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:33,541
It's you.

914
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,041
- [Dani whimpering]
- It's me.

915
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,583
It's us.

916
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,125
- [screams]
- [thud]

917
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:46,500
No!

918
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,791
[Dani screaming]

919
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,666
[Dani crying]

920
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,166
- No!
- It's us.

921
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:54,000
[thud]

922
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:56,208
[Dani screaming] No! No!

923
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,666
[sobbing]

924
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,833
[haunting echo]

925
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:07,916
Becs.

926
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,208
[panicked breathing]

927
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:15,625
Becs, is that you?

928
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:21,541
Oh, God. It's so strange, isn't it?

929
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,875
- It's so strange.
- [Dani whimpering]

930
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,541
We just…

931
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:29,666
Do you feel her?

932
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,166
I do, a little.

933
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,333
Miles is just, well…

934
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,666
He's just a little tickle now, isn't he?

935
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,625
Way at the bottom.

936
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:43,250
[Hannah, distantly] Dani! Children!

937
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,416
[Dani screams]

938
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,916
We've got to put that one away for good.

939
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:51,375
Becs, can I trust you to finish this one?

940
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,166
I'm still not sure why we have to.

941
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:54,375
[Dani moaning]

942
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,791
[Miles] Because she knows.

943
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,125
It's okay.

944
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:01,125
Just keep her quiet,
and I'll do it myself.

945
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:03,250
- [Hannah, distantly] Flora! Miles!
- [Dani screams]

946
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,125
- [Dani] No!
- Coming!

947
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,041
[Dani panicking]

948
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:10,500
I'll be back. Don't go anywhere.

949
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,208
[Hannah] Miles!

950
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:14,791
[Dani gasping]

951
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:22,583
Oh, there you are. Where is everyone?

952
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:26,333
Hannah, you beautiful, beautiful thing.

953
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:27,791
[scoffs]

954
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,208
I have a surprise for you.

955
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:31,291
Would you come with me?

956
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:34,041
All right, but where are we going?

957
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:36,416
I'll show you.

958
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:38,583
Come.

959
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,250
[Hannah] So, where... Where are we going?

960
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,666
[Miles] You know…

961
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,000
[nocturnal chirping]

962
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:52,333
I've been wondering
what makes you so special, I mean…

963
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,583
I know it's disorienting at first,
but y-you've…

964
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:58,750
- You really made it difficult, didn't you?
- Hm?

965
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,791
Walking around. Day to day.

966
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:03,791
Cleaning up and dreaming up new clothes.

967
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,875
Carrying on like nothing happened.

968
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:10,583
I thought you were just stubborn,
but it was more than that, wasn't it?

969
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,333
I asked the others.

970
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,541
They say it takes… a moment.

971
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,333
We're all on our own time,
it seems, but you.

972
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,875
You just kept on dreaming.

973
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,125
Then, I worked it out.

974
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,541
I realized who you reminded me of.

975
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,041
[chuckles] What are you talking about?

976
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,541
We're almost there. You'll see.

977
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:36,750
I was thinking about a cartoon
I used to watch when I was little.

978
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,875
- [Hannah] Oh, well…
- [Miles] Wile E. Coyote.

979
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:42,708
[Hannah chuckles] Hate to break it to you,
Master Miles, but you're still little.

980
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:45,833
[Miles chuckles]

981
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:49,333
Wile E. Coyote, remember those?
It would happen all the time.

982
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:51,458
He would run off a cliff.

983
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,666
Run straight off it.

984
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,416
And he'd keep on going.

985
00:51:56,916 --> 00:51:59,625
That's you.
That's who you remind me of, Hannah.

986
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:01,833
You just went off that cliff,

987
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:03,833
and you just kept going.

988
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:05,541
Carrying on.

989
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,708
Cleaning the house,

990
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:12,625
dreaming up new outfits and earrings,
the whole thing.

991
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:15,541
- What on earth are you going on about?
- But the thing is…

992
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:18,541
when Wile E. Coyote looked down…

993
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:20,958
then he'd fall.

994
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:23,208
Only when he looked down.

995
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:29,416
You just need to look down, Hannah.

996
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,791
Then you can stop this charade.

997
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:36,791
Just fall already,
into whatever dream you like,

998
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:40,750
while your face melts away,
like some forgotten memory.

999
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,333
[inhales sharply]

1000
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:44,916
Don't be ridiculous. Come on.

1001
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,291
- Let's go inside.
- No.

1002
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:52,625
I have gotten so sick of watching you,

1003
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:54,666
strutting around like this.

1004
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,625
No, you need to be put in your place.

1005
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,583
You need to look down.

1006
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,250
[breathes shakily]

1007
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,500
[sobbing quietly] No, no, no, no, no, no.

1008
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,875
[haunting echo]

1009
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:39,625
[ominous music playing]

1010
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Meep, meep.

1011
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,166
[music intensifying]

1012
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,208
[Owen]
<i>This is an opportunity to hone my skills.</i>

1013
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:08,375
In Paris, I was a sous-chef, which means
they only let me chop vegetables.

1014
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,458
Here, I'll be putting
everything together myself.

1015
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:12,875
It'll be a great learning experience.

1016
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,541
You'll have two children to cook for.

1017
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:17,666
I don't know
that's the type of experience you want.

1018
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,583
Miles is seven, and… [chuckles]
…bloody picky.

1019
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,666
Flora's five and a darling, but…

1020
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,250
Miles is gone.

1021
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:30,250
And Flora might be, too.

1022
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:38,250
And there's nothing...
nothing I can do about it, because… [sobs]

1023
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,666
Because I'm dead.

1024
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,375
[Hannah sniffles] Oh, God.

1025
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,291
[sobs] Oh, God.

1026
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,041
Oh, God.

1027
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,833
- [melancholy music playing]
- Oh…

1028
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,750
[Dani breathing heavily]

1029
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,791
[whimpering]

1030
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,500
[breathing shakily]

1031
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,458
How did I do?

1032
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,375
You did very well.

1033
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,625
- [panicked breaths]
- She told me to pretend.

1034
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,625
He couldn't see her anymore.

1035
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:33,000
So, she told me what to say.

1036
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:34,916
Untie her, Flora. Quickly.

1037
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,125
I still don't understand.

1038
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,791
I thought we were playing a game.

1039
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,666
- And I thought you needed my help.
- [Rebecca] No, Flora.

1040
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,375
No one should ever need that much help.

1041
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,083
Not from anyone else.

1042
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:53,416
Miles?

1043
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:56,291
It's too late.

1044
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:58,250
It's too late, but not for her.

1045
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,416
Get her away from here.

1046
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:03,875
You get her as far away from this house
as you possibly can.

1047
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:08,000
Go on. Quickly.

1048
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,583
[panting]

1049
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:12,375
Thank you.

1050
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,375
[suspenseful music playing]

1051
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:25,958
[ominous musical swell]

1052
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,333
- [Flora] What about Miles?
- [Dani] It's okay, okay?

1053
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:30,041
We gotta get out of here.

1054
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:33,125
- [Flora] Where are we going?
- [Dani] I don't know, anywhere. Anywhere.

1055
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,250
No! I don't like this game!

1056
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,625
- [yells] I'm not leaving!
- Shh! Flora!

1057
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,083
And you can't make me!

1058
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,625
- Shh!
- [screaming] Miles!

1059
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:42,184
- We gotta go!
- Miles, where are you?

1060
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,541
[frightening music playing]

1061
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:47,166
[Flora screams]
