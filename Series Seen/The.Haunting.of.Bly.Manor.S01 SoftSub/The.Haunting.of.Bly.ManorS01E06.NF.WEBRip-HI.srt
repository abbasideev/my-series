00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,541
The post is here.

00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,208

- You're welcome.

[storyteller] <i>Lord Wingrave greatly
preferred the confines of his office</i>

11
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,833
<i>to the comfort of his London flat.</i>

12
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,625
<i>He trapped himself there,
day and night tucked away in his work,</i>

13
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,666
<i>in his nightly routine,</i>

14
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,083

[receptionist] Miss Clayton phoned.

20
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:27,958
And?

21
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,833
Just an update.
Wanted to report about the children.

22
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,500
And how are the children?

23
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,583
She says they're well,
but she's a bit concerned,

24
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,041
and that she's happy to elaborate,
if you'd like to schedule a call.

25
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,041
Says there's some things,

26
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,958
nothing alarming she says, but…

27
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,541
some things you may want to hear about.

28
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,166
No need.

29
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,875
I'm happy the children are well.

30
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,833
Of course. [inhales deeply]

31
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,166
Have a good weekend.

32
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,916
[receptionist] Uh…

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

Scotch or bourbon tonight?

42
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,166
Scotch it is.

[Dominic] Charlotte!

00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,583
Charlotte!

54
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:35,750
Too late?

55
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,392
- [Henry] You're on time.
- I'm on time?

56
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,000
- Yeah, she's close but not yet.
- Thank God for that.

57
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,916
Charlotte, I'm here!

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,583
I… I don't think she cares much
right now, to be honest.

59
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,958
She's early.

60
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,166
She's quite early.

61
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,625
It happens, doesn't it?

62
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,875
I'd never have left
if I'd thought she'd be this early.

63
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,666
Well, you made it, you're fine.

64
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,791
I'd never miss the birth
of my own daughter.

65
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,041
[panting] I'd never.
Why not the hospital?

66
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,805
It was faster
to have the doctor come here.

67
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,675
This early,
you should take her to a hospital.

68
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,916
A hospital is two hours away.
The doctor was 40 minutes away.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,833
- Miles?
- He's fine. He's asleep.

70
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,916
Okay.

71
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,180
- I'm here, darling.
- [Charlotte groaning]

72
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,875
Here's my girl.

73
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:11,958
My girls.

74
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,708
How are my girls?

75
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,166

[Jamie] Don't usually see you
this early in the a.m.

84
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,250
Uh…

85
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,250
Yeah, well, I-I knew… um…

86
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,083
I know that y-you start early
on Thursdays.

87
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,083
[Dani] So,

88
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,208
I thought I'd bring you some coffee.

89
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,583
You Yanks and your coffee.

90
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,333
You might like it.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Cheers.

92
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,416
Cheers.

93
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,833
- [spits]
- I'm not the best at coffee, either.

94
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,500
- [chuckles]
- [Jamie] Ahem.

95
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,833
How's your week been?

96
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,583
It's been okay.

97
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,333
Yeah, um…

98
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,666
The kids have been
a little strange, lately.

99
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,416
Everything's been a bit strange, really.

100
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,500
And no Owen.

101
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,166
No you.

102
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,875
[Jamie] Mm. [clears throat]

103
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,416
I seem to see less and less of Hannah.

104
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,416
She just…

105
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,916
goes out, I guess.

106
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,375
By herself.

107
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,250
Sometimes, I just turn around,
and-and she's gone.

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sometimes, people just need to be alone.

109
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,416
Did you wake up just for this?

110
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,250
No.

111
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,125
You just waited for me to come back.

112
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,333
I-I knew that you were coming back
today, but…

113
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875
no, no particular reason.

114
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,500
Are the kids awake?

115
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,875
Um, no. No, they're asleep.

116
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,750
So, you just got up with the sun.

117
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,541
And you're, uh…

118
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:40,458
tiptoeing around the kitchen
making awful coffee by yourself,

119
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,416
just to come say hi at six in the morning,

120
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,750
for no particular reason?

121
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,583
Poppins, you flirt.

122
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,041
Fine.

123
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,708
I-I… I don't like the way we left it.

124
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,041
And how did we leave it?

125
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,708
Wrong.

126
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,875
And-And I wanted to…

127
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,458
I wanted to start doing something right.

128
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,125
So, I thought I'd start with coffee.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,083
Are you sure about that?

130
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,000
Because every time
I think you might be sure,

131
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,875
you've got this irritating habit
of jumping back,

132
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,318
like you've just seen a scary bug.

133
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,833
Maybe that's best, really.

134
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,375
I like you.

135
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,000
But I also like my life the way it is.

136
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,750
Nice and boring.

137
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,250
[scoffs]
Yeah, I-I wouldn't want to disrupt that.

138
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,333
[in forced Cockney accent]
Gotta keep things proper borin',

139

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
[Jamie snickers]

141
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,916
[in normal accent]
Look, there's-there's a pub in Bly, right?

142
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,291
There is.

143
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,708
Would you want to get a drink?

144
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,208
Away from the house.

145
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,333
Away from all this.

146
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,750
That could be <i>kind </i>of boring, right?

147
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,208
Could be dreadfully boring.

148
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,416
Okay, so I could ask Hannah
to watch the kids one night.

149
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,291
And you and me…

150
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,208
could get a boring, old drink…

151
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,500
in a boring, old pub…

152
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,416
and see where that takes us.

153
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
You know I live above that pub, right?

154
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,083
I told you that already, didn't I?

155
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,291
Got a little flat.

156
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,125
Right above the boring, little pub.

157
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,875
[eerie music playing]

158
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,375
Flora?

[eerie music plays]

Flora, Flora!

162
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,125
Hey, hey.

163
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,083
Hey.

164
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,166
What are you doing?

165
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,416
I don't feel good.

166
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,541
How long have you been out here?

167
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,166
I just woke up.

168
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,375
I don't know.

Is that you?

Wait!

Who are you?

179
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,833
Did you hear me?

00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:22,958
Mummy!

187
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,250
What is it?

188
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,333
There's someone in my room.
A little boy.

189
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, Miles!

190
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,583
- For God's sake.
- It's not Miles.

191
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,875
It's not. It's…

192
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,333
Uncle Henry?

193
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh.

194
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,963
- Hello, Flora.
- [Charlotte chuckles awkwardly]

195
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,583
What are you doing here?

196
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,000
I didn't drive back
to the city last night.

197
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,500
Uncle Henry slept over.

198
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,916
In one of the guest rooms.

199
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,583
And I was just saying good morning
just now.

200
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,500
[Charlotte] Yes.

201
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,458
And I-I just heard you say
there was someone in your room.

202
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,791
Come! See, quickly!

203
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,916
You see? No one there.

204
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,625
Not now,

205
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,291
but there was.

206
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,083
There definitely was.

207
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,541
And stop saying there wasn't!

208
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,708
All right, all right. There was.

209
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,583
There was a little boy, you say?

210
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,166
Little, like me.

211
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,166
Oh, surely no one is as little as you.

212
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:32,833
[Charlotte chuckles]

213
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,916
Well, if there is a little boy,

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and you're the only one who can see him,

215
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,333
perhaps he'd like to be your friend.

216
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,458
No, there's something wrong with him.

217
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,958
His face isn't finished.

218
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,958
- Oh, no.
- [Charlotte chuckles]

219
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,166
He doesn't even have a mouth.

220
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,375
Well, I should think
he would be a very good listener.

221
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,958
And there's almost nothing
more important than that in a friend.

222
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,291
[Charlotte] That's right.

223
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,125
And if he <i>can</i> listen, perhaps he'd love
to hear some of your stories, Flora.

224
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,500
But… how can he be my friend

225
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,125
if… he can't tell me his name?

226
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,375
Well, perhaps you could give him a name.

227
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,791
You could give him
a whole story of his own.

228
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,708
Uh, I had a friend
when I was your age, too.

229
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,333
In this house, in fact.

230
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,833
He was a soldier,

231
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,250
and I was very afraid of him,

232
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,291
until I gave him a story.

233
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,375
Was he happy when you gave him one?

234
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,625
Oh, he was.

235
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,083
So, maybe I could do that.

236
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,875
Give him a story.

237
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,333
That's my sweet girl.

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,500
When's Daddy coming home
from Scotland, Mummy?

239
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,166
Uh…

240
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,250
U-Um…

241
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,583
Soon, my love.

242
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,500
This is strange.

243
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,291
It is?

244
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,041
I think…

245
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,166
because…

246
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,875
Well, I suppose it's because I'm too old.

247
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,833
Isn't it?

248
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,166
Yes, I expect that's it.

249
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,541
I feel like I should be littler.

250
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,666
Well, you should be five years old,
in fact.

251
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,416
You were five years old
when this happened.

252
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,708
[Flora] So,

253
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,541
why aren't I five years old?

254
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,250
I'm not five years old,
I'm eight years old.

255
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,166
Why is my age all wrong?

256
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,791
You know why, don't you?

257
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,875
Because this is a memory.

258
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,250
That's right.

259
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,041
[Flora] I've been tucked away again,
in another memory.

260
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,458
You have.

261
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,333
This is happening more and more,

262
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,416
isn't it?

263
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,208
It is.

264
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,416
[Flora] I keep getting tucked away
in one memory or another,

265
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,125
and, then, I start to realize it,

266
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,750
and it'll be over as soon as I…

267
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,833
Wake up.

268
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,458
Wake up.

269
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,083
Hey.

270
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,666
Hey. [chuckles softly]

271
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,791
Hey, you just…

272
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,666
You just nodded off there.
[chuckles]

273
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,791
You just, um…

274
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,750
What... What happened?

275
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,250
[sighs] I don't know.

276
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,250
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,166
I'm having a bit of a moment.

278
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,875
Oh, it's all right, we…

279
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,291
We, uh…
we just wanna make sure that you're okay.

280
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,416
What were you doing?

281
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,375
[Dani] We were talking.

282
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,291
We were, uh, talking about the walk.

283
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,916
Your-Your walk last night.

284
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
And, uh…

285
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,333
And you just, um…

286
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,583
Well, it-it looked like y-you fainted,

287
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,291
but, uh…

288
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,375
are you okay now?

289
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,916
I'm quite tired.

290
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,291
I'd like to go back to sleep.

291
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,041
But to dream…

292
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,250
not a memory.

293
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,458
Dream, this time.

294
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,458
[Dani] Okay.

295
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,416
Okay.

296
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,083
[knocking on door]

297
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,833
It's Miss Clayton.

298
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,916
Said Flora's been sleepwalking.

299
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,791
- And she's all right? [sighs]
- I'm not sure.

300
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,750
If she's all right, that's all.

301
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,875
If she isn't?

302
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,625
If she isn't, then why isn't she calling
a bloody doctor?

303
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,708
[quietly] Yes.

304
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,458
- [drops pen]
- [sighs]

305
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,666
[clocks ticks quietly]

306
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,708
[sighs quietly]

307
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,333
[distant siren wailing]

308
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,833
[line ringing]

309
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,416
[Flora] <i>Flora residence.</i>

310
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,708
Well, hello, Flora.

311
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,583
It's Uncle Henry.

312
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,083
<i>Hello.</i>

313
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,916
How are you doing, darling?

314
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,666
I-Is your mother…

315
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,750
<i>What about Mummy?</i>

316
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,583
Well, I mean to say, uh…

317
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,666
have you seen that little boy again?

318
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,750
<i>Oh, no, not yet.</i>

319
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,916
Oh, well, that's fine, isn't it?

320
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,708
Now, are you working on a story for him?

321
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,416
<i>I'm trying.</i>

322
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,375
<i>But Daddy says he's a type of mint.</i>

323
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,541
I'm sorry?

324
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,291
<i>He says he's a type of special mint.
And that's all.</i>

325
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,541
<i>A fig mint, he says.</i>

326
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,625
<i>- In my imagination.</i>
- [Henry laughing]

327
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,000
Well, you-you tell your dad
even "fig mints" need a story.

328
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,750
<i>Tell him yourself.</i>

329
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,958
<i>Dad, Uncle Henry's on the phone!</i>

330
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,208
What?

331
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,416
<i>Hang on.</i>

332
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,291
<i>He says fig mints need stories, too.</i>

333
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,208
- [sighs]
- [Dominic] <i>Thanks, sweetheart.</i>

334
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,208
What's this, then?

335
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,083
Hi, you're, you're back.

336
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,666
<i>I am. Just for a bit.</i>

337
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,416
Flew in last night,
last flight out of Glasgow.

338
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,458
Spur of the moment thing, but, uh…
But don't worry about the case.

339
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,208
- <i>I'm heading back tomorrow.</i>
- Uh, well done.

340
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,291
I-I'm sure the children
are beyond thrilled to see you.

341
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,375
<i>How did you know?</i>

342
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,291
Know what?

343
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,791
That I was back.

344
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,166
Or were you... Why are you calling?

345
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,791
I was…

346
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,666
I was looking for you. I…

347
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,833
I tried Glasgow,
and I couldn't find you, so…

348
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,375
I thought Charlotte would know
if you'd swapped hotels.

349
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,083
No, no, I'm still at the…

350
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,291
Well, anyway, you found me.
What's happening?

351
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,625
Well, I've…

352
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,416
<i>Well, I've answered
my own question, actually.</i>

353
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,958
In the time that we've been… talking,

354
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,625
<i>I've sorted it out.</i>

355
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,625
Oh, well.

356
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,708
Well done.

357
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,625
<i>Sure.</i>

358
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,166
Safe travels.

359
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,208
[footsteps receding]

360
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:53,791
[Henry sighs]

361
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,125
Fuck.

362
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,125
[sighs heavily]

363
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,208
[ominous music playing]

364
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,500
Don't know who you're trying to hide from.

365
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,375
Might as well come in.

366
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,250
[alter ego] So…

367
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,833
we decided on Scotch <i>and </i>bourbon tonight.

368
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,208
[chuckles] And the '62, at that.

369
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,625
Are you sure we can still afford it?

370
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,583
After Peter robbed you blind.

371
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,000
Hardly blind.

372
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,958
What's a quarter mil?

373
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,583
And Miles' money, after all, not yours.

374
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,416
I replaced all of it as…

375
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,625
You know this.

376
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,958
Don't know why I bother
explaining myself to you.

377
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,750
You know everything.

378
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,541
Oh.

379
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,833
She's likely asleep by now.

380
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,875
You'd get the cook again,
or the housekeeper.

381
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,625
Or that cute little American.

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,291
The calls are spooking them.

383
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,375
You know it.

384
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,791
The Scholarship Society.

385
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,750
[scoffs] Well, they should know better,
shouldn't they?

386
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,625
[laughs]
They've had years to figure it out.

387
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,625
The receptionist could handle this.

388
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,291
This… and all his correspondence.

389
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm perfectly capable.

390
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,375
She could send out a notice of death,
and stop the incoming mail.

391
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,583
Could send a dozen.

392
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,625
Could send a notice
every time something comes in

393
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,458
without ever bothering you with it.

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,416
You wouldn't even need to know it.

395
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,666
I'm perfectly capable.

396
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,666
Hm.

397
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,791
You insist on handling it
so that no one does,

398
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:52,458
because every time you send out
a notice of death,

399
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,583
the world where you can pretend
your brother's still alive

400
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,083
gets a little bit smaller.

401
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,375
Doesn't it?

402
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,500
I'm not pretending a fucking thing.

403
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,750
Well, then take down the address
on this envelope,

404
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,166
and draft a notice of death
for Dominic Wingrave,

405
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,291
and put it in the post.

406
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,416
[Henry sighs heavily]

407
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,333
[drawer slides open]

408
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,750
[drawer slams shut]

409
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,333
[chuckling]

410
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,041
[sighs]

411
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,375
- [insects chirping]
- [footsteps creaking]

412
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,250
How is she?

413
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,875
She slept all day.

414
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:43,791
[Hannah] Hm.

415
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,375
[sighs] No fever, though. I keep checking.

416
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,916
Poor thing must be exhausted.

417
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,333
[Dani] We-We missed you this afternoon.

418
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,750
Where did you run off to?

419
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,750
[Hannah] Oh, um…

420
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,833
I'm not…

421
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,958
Well, I suppose I <i>was</i> around.

422
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:03,875
[scoffs] God, what does that say about me?
I can… can hardly remember this afternoon.

423
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,142
[Dani] If she's the same tomorrow,
I'll call the doctor.

424
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,166
- Yes. Yes, that sounds about right.
- I called Henry, but…

425
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,166
he didn't call back.

426
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,708
I… don't understand. I mean…

427
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:16,833
how could a person…

428
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,541
They're his only family.

429
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,416
Henry's not exactly himself anymore.

430
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:25,791
Not really, I mean…

431
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,375
he hasn't been for a long time.

432
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:32,333
[sighs] Ever since Charlotte and Dominic
went on that blasted trip.

433
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Well, I suppose none of them came back.

434
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,458
I mean, Charlotte and Dominic,
obviously, but…

435
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,875
neither did Henry, if I'm honest.

436
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,291
Oh.

437
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,208
All three of them just…

438
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,291
[splutters]

439
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,083
gone.

440
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,750
Are you coming down?

441
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,291
In a bit.

442
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
All righty.

443
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,375
[quiet, unsettling music playing]

444
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,583
[Owen] <i>We can go…</i>

445
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:40,166
Like, we can go this weekend.
It's Patrick Swayze, come on.

446
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,666
- Yeah, in concert.
- [Hannah muttering indistinctly]

447
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,916
You're still here?

448
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,958
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yeah, had to wash up.

449
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,875
Besides, I was asked to stay behind.

450
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:49,958
[Dani scoffs]

451
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,583
Now, who would ask you to do that?

452
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,916
[Owen clears throat]

453
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,375
[Jamie] Don't touch that.

454
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,750
You'll just desecrate it.

455
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,958
[laughs] Hey, I, uh…
I thought you left a while ago.

456
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,166
Made it halfway home,
and I thought, "Rough day.

457
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,791
Maybe Poppins
might fancy a little boredom."

458
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:11,958
What do you say?

459
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,541
- The kids, I...
- Already taken care of.

460
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,875
[Hannah] I've got things handled here.
You, uh…

461
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,166
You go and enjoy yourselves.

462
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,583
- Uh, <i>we </i>have things handled here.
- Yes.

463
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,166
Any nightmares, bogeymen,
or monsters under the bed

464
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,916
will be dealt with swiftly and fairly,

465
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,416
in an impartial court.

466
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,625
[Dani laughs]

467
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:29,708
Come on.

468
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,708
- [rain pattering]
- [animal howls]

469
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:37,791
[Dani] Where, uh…

470
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:39,666
Where are we going?

471
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,208
Are you taking me out here to kill me?

472
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,875
[Jamie] Keep talking, I just might.

473
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,166
So, uh…

474
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:55,166
there's not many secret spots,
even on grounds this big.

475
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,791
- But this one… special.
- [Dani] Wow, that's beautiful.

476
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,166
- You planted that?
- Yeah.

477
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,250
It's a moonflower.

478
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,916
Bloody hard to grow in England.

479
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,750
[Jamie clears throat]

480
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:10,833
Yeah, but…

481
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,208
worth it.

482
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,208
[Jamie] Is it?

483
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Isn't it?

484
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,375
This plant only blooms two months a year.

485
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,458
And only at night.

486
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,916
Each bud, only once.

487
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,333
These flowers will be dead by morning,

488
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,083
and tomorrow night,
new buds will bloom, and then they'll die.

489
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,791
In three weeks,
this entire plant will be dead.

490
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And in the spring, I'll have to plant
a whole new moonflower.

491
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,500
That's a lot of work
for a flower that only blooms once.

492
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,583
That's what people feel like to me.

493
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,291
Exhaustive effort.

494
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,833
Very little to show for it.

495
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:00,625
All of them?

496
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,750
All of them.

497
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:04,916
Even you.

498
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:07,791
Even me.

499
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,541
Especially me.

500
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,375
So, I figured I'd save you some effort.

501
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,583
[night animals calling distantly]

502
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,833
[Jamie] Skip to the end.

503
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,250
Take a shot.

504
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:28,791
Why not?

505
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,791
So, here goes, okay?

506
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,666
[Dani] Mm-hm.

507
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,916
Okay.

508
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,875
[emotional music playing]

509
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:42,958
Mum was Louise.

510
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Dad was Dennis.

511
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,125
Dennis met Louise when she was 18.

512
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:48,958
He was 24.

513
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,833
Total surprise, a year later,
my brother Denny.

514
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,416
And me, less of a surprise, I guess.

515
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,583
Dad starts working in a coal mine.

516
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,250
It's, uh, more money.

517
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:02,916
Slightly more,

518
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:07,375
but he's barely home now,
and Louise, well…

519
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,541
Louise is home with the kids,
but she's basically a kid herself.

520
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,833
A kid with two kids,
and a husband 600 meters down.

521
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,583
So, she does what kids do.

522
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
She plays.

523
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:25,083
So, Dad's underground,
and Mum's under some bloke, and…

524
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,291
the thing about a coal mine…

525
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,291
Well, the thing I think about most
now I'm older…

526
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,333
No plants down there.

527
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
No life at all.

528
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,541
See, these men…

529
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:46,500
We send them down into this dark mess,
digging for something dead.

530
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:50,541
So… dead that it's now lumps
of dead things,

531
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:54,541
so old and lifeless
that they will literally burn,

532
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,833
and that was his life.

533
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,291
While she did
whatever she could to feel alive.

534
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,750
All that death,

535
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,791
that dark, powdery death
is all over his face,

536
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,333
his hands, his fucking lungs,
when he comes up.

537
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,291
There's not a leaf, not a branch,
not a flower in his world,

538
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,583
and when he finally
climbs out of that grave,

539
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,833
finally climbs back
to the land of the living…

540
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,666
they laugh at him.

541
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,250
They laugh because the whole town knows
that the new baby,

542
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,208
my little brother Mikey, isn't his.

543
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,833
So, Dennis buries his head in the soot,

544
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,541
and they… [chuckles]
…praise him for his loyalty,

545
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,833
while they mock him for a cuckold.

546
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,833
Louise, on the other hand,

547
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,416
call a spade a spade,
and they call my mum a whore.

548
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,541
Call the daughter one, too,

549
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,875
bully her at school, on the streets.

550
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,208
Even makes its way home.

551
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,208
Little Denny piles on,

552
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:03,500
tries to save his own skin
by blaming all the females in the family,

553
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:06,416
and in '67, Louise bolts.

554
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:08,583
She splits,

555
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,583
and I come home from school to find Mikey…

556
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:13,541
alone…

557
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,208
screaming his little head off.

558
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,083
He's still a baby,

559
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,791
and he doesn't understand
what he's done wrong.

560
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,875
I try and take care of him.

561
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,333
But I'm just a kid.

562
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,458
Kids can't raise kids.

563
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,625
I forget things.

564
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,958
Like watching over a pot when it boils.

565
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,916
So, one day there's an accident.

566
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,583
Social Services gets involved,
and we're split up.

567
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,750
Dad did his best.

568
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,293
He spent so long underground, didn't know
what to do with a kid, let alone…

569
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,541
three kids.

570
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,083
So, he disappeared into the dirt.

571
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,083
Then, it was foster care.

572
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,750
Just a bunch of stale, perverted men

573
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,458
with bitter wives,

574
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,916
hoping to make a few quid
by taking care of the local trash.

575
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,250
I left for London pretty soon after that.

576
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,541
[sniffs] Got myself
into all sorts of trouble there.

577
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,333
Wound up serving a couple of years.

578
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,083
And it's there I start gardening.

579
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:28,333
Busy work for idle hands.

580
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,208
But I fucking love it.

581
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,666
Love it.

582
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,041
And it's so clear then…

583
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,125
how <i>people…</i>

584
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,791
aren't worth it.

585
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,458
But plants…

586
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,208
you pour your love,

587
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:48,791
and your effort,

588
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,916
and your nourishment into them…

589
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,416
and you see where it goes.

590
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,708
You watch them grow,

591
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,458
and it all makes sense.

592
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,208
So, yeah.

593
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,291
[scoffs]

594
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,500
Everyone is exhaustive.

595
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:09,875
Even the best ones.

596
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,750
But sometimes…

597
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,666
once in a blue goddamned moon, I guess…

598
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:18,833
someone…

599
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,500
like this moonflower,
just might be worth the effort.

600
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,250
Look, I know you're struggling.

601
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,750
I see it.

602
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,083
I know you're carrying this guilt around,

603
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,958
but I also know that you don't decide
who lives and who doesn't.

604
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,416
I'm sorry, Dani, but you don't.

605
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,750
Humans are organic.

606
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,875
It's a fact.

607
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:48,541
We're meant to die.

608
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:50,708
It's natural…

609
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,291
beautiful.

610
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:57,500
And it all breaks down and rises back up,

611
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,125
and breaks down again,

612
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,875
and every living thing
grows out of every dying thing.

613
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,625
We leave more life behind us
to take our place.

614
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:10,416
That life refreshes and recycles,

615
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,916
and on and on it goes.

616
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,125
And that is so much better

617
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,916
than that life getting crushed,

618
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:18,958
deep down in the dirt,

619
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,958
into a rock that will burn
if it's old enough.

620
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:27,166
So much better to see the leafling…
and flower.

621
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,166
We leave more life behind
to take our place.

622
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,041
Like this moonflower.

623
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,333
It's where all its beauty lies, you know.
In the mortality of the thing.

624
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,083
[emotional music continues]

625
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,583
[Dani sighs]

626
00:34:58,541 --> 00:34:59,666
[Dani pants softly]

627
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,250
[clock ticking quietly]

628
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, dear.

629
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,416
What are we going to do about this?

630
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,625
I don't know.

631
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,958
I truly don't know.

632
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
[unsettling music playing]

633
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,583
[soft growl]

634
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,708
[Peter grunts]

635
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,500
Is that all of it?

636
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,000
- One more piece in the car.
- Okay, I'll grab it.

637
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,208
[Charlotte gasps]

638
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,250
Oh, my God!

639
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,166
What have you done?

640
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,000
I found a gentleman in Sussex
who makes these.

641
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,166
It's, well…

642
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,750
- It's close enough, I suppose.
- [Charlotte scoffs]

643
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,791
Couldn't match it exactly, obviously.

644
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,916
Oh, she's going to lose her mind.
[gasps]

645
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,666
I'm sorry I won't make the party.

646
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,958
Hopefully, this smooths it over.

647
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,208
Oh, she's six.
She'll only notice the presents.

648
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,291
[Henry chuckles]

649
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:52,875
Not here.

650
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:55,958
[Henry] Hm.

651
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:59,541
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Henry] I'll get the last of it.

652
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:02,583
Uh, perhaps we could hide this
in the study until the party.

653
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,166
[Charlotte] Sounds good.

654
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,375
Darling, look what your brother's brought.

655
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's terrific.

656
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:14,125
I'm sorry I can't make the birthday party.
You know how it is.

657
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:17,458
- I'll call you when I get to Berlin.
- Sounds perfect.

658
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:23,708
[door opens]

659
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,666
[door creaks shut]

660
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,041
[somber music playing]

661
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,083
[rain pattering]

662
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:52,416
[footsteps descending]

663
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,500
[Charlotte gasps, laughs nervously]

664
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,125
Oh, my God!

665
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:04,416
What…

666
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,375
Whatever are you doing here
just sitting in the dark?

667
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,666
I just wanted something small
before going to sleep.

668
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:14,625
Extra energy.
It's going to be a blitz in the morning.

669
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,041
All those extra children running around.

670
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:20,208
You should get some rest as well.
Are you coming to bed?

671
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,708
[Dominic] Flora's birthday…

672
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,416
got me thinking…

673
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,375
what a strange night that was.

674
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,458
[Charlotte] Was it?

675
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,750
I don't remember much.

676
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,125
Beauty of childbirth.

677
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,500
We're supposed to forget, they say.

678
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:47,208
A chemical in the brain, in fact.

679
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,833
It's the only way
we'd ever have another one.

680
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,916
She was so early.

681
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,583
She was.

682
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:04,666
Right.

683
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,750
And I was so surprised.

684
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:09,000
But for a baby that early…

685
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,541
she wasn't nearly as small as I expected.

686
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,541
Math didn't work, did it?

687
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,458
I don't know what you mean.

688
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,666
I mean, that if she wasn't early,

689
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,375
if she was actually right on time,

690
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,666
that math wouldn't work.

691
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,708
She kind of had to be early, didn't she?

692
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,625
Or else it would mean
she was conceived in August.

693
00:39:58,625 --> 00:39:59,791
While I was in Russia.

694
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,541
Six years.

695
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,208
Took me six years to do the math.

696
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,125
I suppose I didn't want to, did I?

697
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,041
I was gone an awful lot, wasn't I?

698
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,375
Lonely…

699
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,916
a house this size…

700
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,541
just you and Miles.

701
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,750
Lonely.

702
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Do you love him?

703
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:44,833
[sighs]

704
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,250
[sniffles]

705
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:06,386
[storyteller]
<i>The au pair could not remember</i>

706
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:08,375
<i>the last time she'd slept this well.</i>

707
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,541
<i>And she thought perhaps she never had.</i>

708
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
[quiet, unsettling sound]

709
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,000
[Dani sighs]

710
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,166
[unsettling music playing]

711
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,250
[Dani] Flora!

712
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:49,041
Flora! Flora, what are you doing?

713
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,041
Where am I?

714
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:55,625
What's happening? Are you okay?
Were you sleepwalking again?

715
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:56,708
I don't…

716
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,458
I don't know.

717
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,958
I think I was tucked away again.

718
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,041
Okay, come on. Let's go inside.

719
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,208
Why does this keep happening?

720
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,000
[ominous music playing]

721
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,750
[music fades to silence]

722
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,333
[sniffles]

723
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,958
I'm terribly sorry for the trouble.

724
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:28,625
I was just going on a walk.
I didn't mean to alarm you.

725
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:33,750
Let's get some breakfast, shall we?
I'm positively famished.

726
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,583
[Dani chuckles]

727
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:36,791
[somber music playing]

728
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,291
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

729
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,416
[clears throat]

730
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,208
[clears throat louder]

731
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,625
I'm sorry to interrupt.

732
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,000
Miss Clayton called, again.

733
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,166
- I think maybe you should...
- Is anyone hurt?

734
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,625
Do they need an ambulance?

735
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,416
No, I don't think it's that simple.

736
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,958
Jesus, I told you!

737
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,833
[yells] I'm unavailable
unless someone is hurt!

738
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,208
[Henry sighs heavily]

739
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,250
[sighs]

740
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,250
Goddamn it.

741
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:22,666
Fine!

742
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,166
[exhales]

743
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:26,916
Fine.

744
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:29,083
Get her back on the phone.

745
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,166
[unsettling music playing]

746
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,708
- [men speaking indistinctly]
- [objects shuffling]

747
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:36,708
[Henry] Hey.

748
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,958
What's all this, then?

749
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,791
Just put those in the car, will you?

750
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,958
You keep the office, is what this is.

751
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,125
What are you talking about?

752
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,833
I don't want to see any of this,
ever again.

753
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,041
How stupid you must have thought of me.

754
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,250
How fucking stupid.

755
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:59,333
- I-I don't...
- Babies rarely adhere to a schedule, Dom.

756
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:01,791
But listen,

757
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:04,000
and this is the important part.

758
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,458
She's my daughter.

759
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,958
In every way that matters.

760
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,291
When she skins her knee,

761
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,541
calls out with a nightmare…

762
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
it's me.

763
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,208
First time some asshole
breaks her heart…

764
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,833
I'll be there to console her.

765
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,875
And when she asks her father
to walk her down the aisle…

766
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,791
me, not you.

767
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:33,333
Do you understand me?

768
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:35,541
She didn't tell you?

769
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:37,958
Well, look at that.

770
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,458
I get to be here when the penny drops.

771
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,500
I've been thinking.

772
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,250
I've been thinking
about what the right word must be.

773
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,916
And I keep getting stuck on "banished."

774
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,791
It's close.

775
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:52,875
It has teeth.

776
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,500
But not nearly enough.

777
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,458
And it'll do for now.

778
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:02,250
You're banished, little brother.

779
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:05,416
You're banished from my house.

780
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:09,125
You're banished from my wife, my children.

781
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,291
Banished.

782
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:14,583
You don't have a brother anymore.

783
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,041
Or a niece.

784
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,750
Or a nephew.

785
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,166
Nobody.

786
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:23,416
Just yourself.

787
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:25,750
And yourself, Henry…

788
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:29,000
your real self…

789
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:32,833
he's an evil shit.

790
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,500
A grotesque little demon, isn't he?

791
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:41,708
I pity you.

792
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,416
'Cause you have to live with him.

793
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,541
You have to live with yourself.

794
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,666
And he's a shit, grinning,
fucking monster.

795
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:56,666
Isn't he?

796
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,041
[door slams]

797
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,875
- [Flora] How far away is India?
- [Charlotte chuckles]

798
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:22,250
It's further than "I'll miss you,"
but closer than "goodbye."

799
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,500
I know what you're thinking,
but you shouldn't worry.

800
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,416
It's going to be fine.
It's just a few weeks, my darling.

801
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,041
[Flora] Can I come with you?

802
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,583
A couple of weeks is a terribly long time,

803
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,750
and I don't want to be here all alone
with Miles and Mrs. Grose.

804
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,333
Hm.

805
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,416
Ah. Here we are.

806
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:52,291
This is called a talisman.

807
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,250
I used to make them.

808
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,333
Well, sometimes I still do. Old habits.

809
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,791
I've made them
since I was your age, really.

810
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,083
[Flora] What does it do?

811
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,875
Well, it protects people,
and it keeps them happy.

812
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,041
[sighs] It's happening again…

813
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,083
isn't it?

814
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,666
What?

815
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,041
I'm not really here.

816
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,250
I'm too old.

817
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:20,666
It's like…

818
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,250
the math doesn't work.

819
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,500
That's right.

820
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm tucked away again in another memory.

821
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:30,625
Tucked away safe.

822
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:35,125
I miss you, Mummy.

823
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:38,375
[Charlotte whispering] Oh…

824
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
My darling.

825
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,875
[in normal voice]
You should probably wake up now.

826
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,958
[ominous music playing]

827
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,375
[eerie swish]

828
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:04,308
- [Owen] Remember these? Was in the spring.
- [Dani] You remember.

829
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:07,833
[Dani and Owen laugh]

830
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,125
How can you have two helpings?

831
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,708
- [all chuckling]
- Look at him go.

832
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,208
[Flora] You've… You've…

833
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,541
What are you doing?

834
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:17,458
[Dani] Flora!

835
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:18,750
Hey!

836
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:21,458
You're eating dinner without me.

837
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:22,750
W-What?

838
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,916
- Wh... Flora, what?
- You already ate, in your room.

839
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,708
- Owen made you soup.
- It was some of my best work.

840
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:30,875
I don't remember that.

841
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,375
Told you she wasn't herself.

842
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,458
She seems fine.

843
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:36,708
But weird.

844
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,500
I don't like this game.

845
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,625
It's okay.

846
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:41,750
I don't like it!

847
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,559
- [phone rings]
- [Dani] Probably your uncle.

848
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:46,375
Everything's gonna be okay, Flora.
Don't-Don't worry.

849
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:47,458
Hello?

850
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,458
Hello?

851
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,333
<i>Hello?</i>

852
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:56,408
<i>- It's another freaking prank call.</i>
- [line disconnects]

853
00:48:58,291 --> 00:48:59,125
[sighs]

854
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:02,416
[alter ego] Do you <i>really</i> think
she'll answer one of these times?

855
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,041
[scoffs]

856
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,750
It's getting sad.

857
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:07,750
[phone hangs up]

858
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:10,041
I don't imagine
there's much in it for you.

859
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:13,291
One in ten times you call,
she might answer.

860
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,166
You might hear her say,
"Flora residence."

861
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:18,958
Unlikely.

862
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:20,041
[snickers]

863
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,916
In the meantime…

864
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,875
[laughing] …they think you're some pervert

865
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,750
breathing into the phone.

866
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:27,875
Just a crank.

867
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,208
Pathetic, really.

868
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:31,708
[knocking on door]

869
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,666
Here we are again.

870
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:39,000
Well, it's not real,
but you probably should get it anyway.

871
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,083
[footsteps approaching]

872
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:50,583
[sighs]

873
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,291
I'm sorry to come by.

874
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,750
Uh…

875
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,500
Well, I-I was nearby, and…

876
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,125
[sighs]

877
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,708
I wasn't nearby.

878
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,250
I made up a story. I don't have long.

879
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,250
What are you doing in here?

880
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Oh, I was…

881
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,958
[sighs]

882
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I don't rightly know. [laughs]

883
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm sorry.

884
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:28,583
Flora.

885
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:29,916
I'm so sorry.

886
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,041
I should have told you.

887
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,750
I should have done
a lot of things differently.

888
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,500
We're leaving tonight.

889
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,750
India.

890
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,041
For a few weeks.

891
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,416
Retracing our honeymoon.

892
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:49,791
I see.

893
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:53,833
I wanted to say goodbye.

894
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,291
- Charlotte.
- I mean it.

895
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,291
I'm going to make this work.

896
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,333
My husband, my family.

897
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,291
I needed you to hear it from me…

898
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:06,666
why I'm going on this trip.

899
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,458
I can fix it.

900
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:16,833
But I couldn't leave without…

901
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,916
I love you, Charlotte.

902
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,125
I know.

903
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,000
[crying]
There's a lot more to it than love.

904
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,166
A lot more to it.

905

[Charlotte sniffles, breathes heavily]

00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:10,083
[footsteps receding]

907
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:20,166
[unsettling, ethereal music playing]

908
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,135
[alter ego]
Jumping ahead, if you don't mind,

909
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:32,041
to my favorite part.

910
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,541
No, please.

911
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,458
That hurts. That really hurts.

912
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,250
I want to see it again.

913
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,666
- No.
- The night we met.

914
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,083
[phone rings]

915
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,250
- [alter ego] Come on.
- [sighs]

916
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,500
[alter ego] Answer it.

917
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:47,958
- No.
- [ringing]

918
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,166
[alter ego]
But you have to. You know that.

919
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:53,500
- I don't want to.
- [alter ego] But you always do.

920
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:56,916
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of.
You know who it is.

921
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,083
It's the British Consulate in India.

922
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,541
No, please.

923
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,208
They have terrible news.

924
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,875
- Please.
- There's been an accident.

925
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,000
[ringing continues]

926
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,166
[sighs]

927
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,833
[ringing]

928
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,208
[Henry sighs]

929
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,375
[clears throat] Hello.

930
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:29,958
Yes, speaking.

931
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,833
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

932
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:42,958
[sniffs]

933
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
[inhales sharply]

934
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,958
What sort of an accident?

935
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,625
Oh…

936
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,791
Well, surely, they're all right.

937
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,875
[inhales sharply]

938
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:10,541
[breathes heavily]

939
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:11,625
You're wrong.

940
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,125
[clears throat]

941
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:17,083
You're mistaken.

942
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:23,833
[exhales]

943
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,166
[pants]

944
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,250
[whimpers]

945
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:30,125
[pants, cries out]

946
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,166
[panicked breaths]

947
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,541
[ominous music playing]

948
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,208
[screaming]

949
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:47,458
[sighs]

950
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,750
[sniffles]

951
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,625
[panting]

952
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,500
[alter ego] That wasn't so bad, was it?

953
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,083
[exhales heavily] It was hell.

954
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,375
Every time is hell.

955
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,708
No.

956
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,833
That wasn't the worst of it.

957
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,916
Not even arranging their funerals,

958
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
or burying those empty coffins.

959
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,500
No.

960
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:17,375
Hell was having to call Bly,

961
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:20,208
having to break the news,

962
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:23,833
and having her voice
be the first one you heard

963
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:25,500
when she picked up the phone.

964
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,666
Her little voice saying…

965
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:30,958
[Flora] Flora residence.

966
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:41,250
[Jamie] Sleep talking, sleepwalking.

967
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,750
She's having a rough time of it.

968
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Yeah.

969
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,333
Yeah, I…

970
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,875
I don't know what else to do.

971
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:55,500
So, yeah, I think I'm gonna take her
to a doctor in the morning.

972
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,625
She needs a psychologist.

973
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:01,333
We have mandated therapy inside.

974
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,541
I hated it.
Didn't think it would do anything.

975
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:10,083
My assigned psychologist, Tamara,
she was relentless.

976
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,041
A dog with a bone, that woman.

977
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,166
So, I started talking just to shut her up.

978
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,041
After a month, I realized
I was sleeping through the night.

979
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:22,041
Wow.

980
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,375
Yeah.

981
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:26,666
You might be right.

982
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:29,083
[sighs]

983
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:31,958
I'm gonna go.

984
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:33,750
Oh.

985
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:36,083
I should change my clothes, at least.

986
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:37,708
[laughs]

987
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:40,541
Well, um…

988
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:43,333
y-you could…

989
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,375
come back.

990
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:47,916
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

991
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:49,833
Tonight.

992
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:53,208
I don't know, Poppins.

993
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,541
I don't know, you've got your hands full.
[sighs]

994
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:04,333
Well, I'm gonna be up all night
checking up on her, anyway.

995
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,375
Good night.

996
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:10,458
Just good night.

997
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:14,583
There are other nights,

998
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,750
and there will be other nights.

999
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:18,583
You promise?

1000
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,583
[Jamie chuckles]

1001
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:27,875
[Dani laughs gently]

1002
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,166
- Promise.
- [Dani] Mm.

1003
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,916
[sighs] Fuck it.

1004
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:43,916
This again.

1005
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:50,583
Disconnected.

1006
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,291
Phone trouble?

1007
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,083
[Henry sighs]

1008
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,250
[ominous rumbling]

1009
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,916
Phone's disconnected.

1010
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:02,583
So?

1011
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:06,208
So, it shouldn't be. It wasn't earlier.

1012
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,625
I'm sure it's nothing.

1013
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,708
[ominous rumble, drone]

1014
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,166
- What are you doing?
- Going.

1015
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:19,958
- What?
- I'm going to Bly.

1016
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:22,333
- [ominous boom]
- [scoffs] That's insane.

1017
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,625
It's a three-hour drive,

1018
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,666
and you've been drinking all...
Well, for two years, really.

1019
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,583
- That's no reason.
- [ominous boom]

1020
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:31,416
[sighs]
What's the point? The nanny has got this.

1021
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,208
You couldn't do anything, anyway.

1022
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,250
- I have a terrible feeling.
- [ominous boom]

1023
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,666
Oh, well, that settles it.

1024
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:41,291
I haven't had a feeling like this since...

1025
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:44,875
So, you'll go to Bly, then?
They'll be so happy to see you.

1026
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:47,666
And maybe you can tell
those little kids to their faces

1027
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,625
exactly how their parents died.

1028
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:52,333
And you can tell them
why they were taking that trip

1029
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:53,666
in the first place.

1030
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,416
[ominous boom]

1031
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,208
Hello?

1032
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:26,916
Wait!

1033
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:41,666
Hello?

1034
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,083
There you are.

1035
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,250
Don't be scared.

1036
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:06,833
[somber music playing]

1037
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:08,500
I'm sorry I was scared before.

1038
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:12,250
That was very rude of me, but…

1039
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,083
I thought I'd give you a story.

1040
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:17,375
You poor boy.

1041
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:20,250
I'm so sorry about your face.

1042
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,375
Here.

1043
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:31,458
Try this.

1044
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,791
There.

1045
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:41,875
There you are.

1046
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:45,458
Now, let's come up with a story…

1047
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:47,375
just for you.

1048
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,750
I've done it again, haven't I?

1049
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,375
I'm tucked away again in another memory.

1050
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,708
Because the night I did this,

1051
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:02,291
the night I gave you a new face,

1052
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:04,791
I was only just five years old.

1053
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,791
Wasn't I?

1054
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,958
Why do you keep doing this to me?

1055
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,208
Just tell me.

1056
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:16,000
Why do you keep pushing me aside?

1057
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,416
Miss Jessel.

1058
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,333
Come on, now.

1059
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,250
No more.

1060
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,416
I don't like this game.

1061
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,208
Stop hiding from me.

1062
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,291
I want to talk to you.

1063
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,208
[suspenseful music playing]

1064
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:41,833
I'm very cross with you.

1065
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,750
But why?

1066
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,500
Everything is just fine.

1067
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,125
- It's perfectly...
- It's not.

1068
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,291
I'm tired of being tucked away.

1069
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:54,541
I'm tired of forgetting things,
and I'm tired of acting strange.

1070
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:56,875
And of Miles acting strange.

1071
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:00,125
What's the matter with Miles?

1072
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:02,458
Miles is perfectly splendid,

1073
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:04,458
except when he isn't.

1074
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,333
Isn't splendid?

1075
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:08,083
Isn't Miles.

1076
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,791
[Flora sighs]

1077
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:13,458
No.

1078
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:15,125
Don't do that!

1079
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,041
You mustn't keep doing that.

1080
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,875
Get back here and let me see you!

1081
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,791
What are you doing to me?

1082
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:25,625
- I…
- [door creaks open]

1083
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:26,666
[Dani] Flora?

1084
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:28,541
[frightening music playing]

1085
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,750
Flora.

1086
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:35,166
Come here.

1087
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:39,083
[Flora] It's okay.

1088
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:41,833
It's only Miss Jessel.

1089
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,208
Shh, shh, shh.

1090
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:47,625
Miles!

1091
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,500
Miles!

1092
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:51,708
- [frightening boom]
- Well…

1093
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,291
this is awkward.

1094
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,291
Miles!

1095
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,083
[music intensifies]

1096
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,291
[music fades into silence]

1097
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:00,750
What?

1098
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,083
Flora. Flora!

1099
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,791
No, Flora! Flora!

1100
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,000
[footsteps pounding rapidly]

1101
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,208
Flora!

1102
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:10,625
Flora.

1103
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:12,875
[suspenseful music playing]

1104
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,375
Flora, where are you?

1105
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,500
Flora.

1106
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:20,500
Flora, we gotta go.

1107
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:22,875
Come on.

1108
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:25,958
I'm sorry.

1109
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,083
[frightening musical swell]

1110
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:31,208
- [thud]
- [music abruptly stops]

1111
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,750
[closing music playing]
