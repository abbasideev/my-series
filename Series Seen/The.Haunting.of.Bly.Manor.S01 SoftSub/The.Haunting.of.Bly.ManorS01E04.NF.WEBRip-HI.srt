They were far away when they died.

180
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,708
They had to bury empty boxes.

181
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,541
But we had to pretend anyway.

182
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,250
And I thought that was quite silly.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well…

184
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,666
…you know,
your parents loved you so, so much that…

185
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,791
…in a way, they'll always be here.

186
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,375
They're not here.

187
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,875
I'm sorry, Miss Clayton.

188
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,333
They're really not.

189
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,041
I've looked and looked. But…

190
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,625
we can pretend
if that makes you feel better.

191
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,416
Oh. No.

192
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,708
Okay, now. Come along, sweetie.
Your pants are getting wet out here.

193
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,791
[Flora giggling]

194
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,875
- What?
- [gigglng continues]

195
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,833
What's so... Hey! No!

196
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,500
Mrs. Grose,
my trousers got wet in the graveyard,

197
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,916
- and Miss Clayton said I wet my pants.
- [Hannah] Oh!

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Because in America,
"pants" mean "trousers."

199
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,291
[laughing] That is funny.

200
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,833
She said I wet my pants like a baby.

201
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,791
[Hannah chuckles]

202
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:13,875
Oh, Miss Clayton,

203
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,250
let me do one for you.

204
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,000
You haven't seen this.

205
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,583
I'll do it in blue, to match your eyes.

206
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,375
- Mm.
- It will be splendid.

207
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,458
[chuckles] Okay.

208
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,083
I, uh…

209
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,833
I guess you didn't make it
to the funeral either.

210
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,125
Oh, no, not my cup of tea,
the church in the village.

211
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,208
I haven't been there since…

212
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,166
God…

213
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,958
since I was married.

214
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,041
Hm.

215
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,166
I had nothing but respect
for Owen's mom, but…

216
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,958
she was long gone.

217
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,916
Dementia is a savage thing.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,041
Jamie said that Owen said it was okay
if we missed it.

219
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,791
No, yeah, that's true.

220
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,083
[sighs] I pay my respect in my own ways.

221
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,833
He understands that funerals
are for the living.

222
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,583
It's up to the living to decide
what they can and cannot bear.

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
[Dani] Hm.

224
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,416
[Hannah] Right, you. Come along.

225
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,250
Let's get some supper started
for you children, shall we?

226
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,208
Mm-hm. Me and Miles will help.
I can chop things up.

227
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,375
[Hannah]
Oh! I'm not letting you chop things up.

228
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,833
- [Flora] Aww.
- [Hannah] Ohh.

235
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,541
I thought you said you were making
our favorite for dinner.

236
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,541
I didn't say it was your favorite.
It's Owen's favorite.

237
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,541
But Owen isn't here.

238
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,833
- Hey, you lot.
- Hello.

239
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,291
- [Hannah] How was it?
- Oh, you know, just a barrel of laughs.

240
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,000
Any chance for a brew?

241
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,583
Yeah, I'll make tea.

242
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,791
[Hannah and Jamie] No!

243
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,791
I'll make it.

244
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,041
Can you, uh…

245
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,541
make sure these two
don't chop their fingers off?

246
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,166
[Jamie] Owen did his best.

247
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,583
Almost no one even remembers how she was
when her mind hadn't gone.

248
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:24,916
Hate to say it,

249
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,208
but, on some level, it must be a relief.

250
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,958
For Owen, I mean.

251
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,583
Uh, did he, um…

252
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,750
Did he seem relieved?

253
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
No.

254
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,916
Didn't seem much of anything.
Shell-shocked.

255
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,291
I'd be relieved, though.

256
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,833
Losing yourself like that.

It's not fair on anyone.

262

comes into it, dear.

No damage done.

Uh, I just needed to leave,

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
[clears throat]

355
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,666
You're not dying, you know.

356
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,166
[melancholy music playing]

357
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,791
[Owen] What do you mean?

358
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,041
When Mum and Dad died,

359
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,416
I thought I was going to die too.

360
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,750
I was sure of it.

361
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,750
But then I thought…

362
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,541
…what if I was already dead?

363
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,208
But nobody else knew,

364
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,916
and I was walking around dead.

365
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,250
But everybody could see and hear me.

366
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,791
That was dreadful.

367
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,291
It only felt like dying…

368
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,500
…because actually, I was still alive.

369
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,916
You have to be to feel that way.

370
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,708
I wasn't dead.

371
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,375
I was just really, really sad.

372
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,250
But then I learned a secret.

373
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,000
I didn't even need to be sad anymore.

374
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,458
What secret?

375
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,000
Dead doesn't mean gone.

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So…

377
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,166
you don't need to be sad.

378
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,125
- Miss Clayton?
- [Dani] Hm?

379
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,083
I think I ought to be allowed
a glass of wine.

380
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,041
[Dani] Mm.

381
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,041
You know, I disagree.

382
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,208
You're all having some.

383
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,500
Anyway… Peter let me have wine sometimes...

384
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,333
For pity's sake.
Will we ever hear the end of Peter Quint?

385
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,541
My mum used to water mine down.

386
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,250
Yeah, gave me half a glass.

387
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,458
My mom too.

388
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,083
Except without the water.

389
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,083
[Owen chuckles]

390
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,846
They do that in France
for the little kids.

391
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,916
[yells] I don't want it watered down!
I want an actual bloody drink!

392
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,416
- [tableware clatters]
- Uh-uh. No!

393
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,791
[ominous music playing]

394
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,166
Good night, Owen.

395
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,583
[Owen] Good night.

396
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,500
Come on. Both of you.

397
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,791
[footsteps receding]

398
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,250
[Dani follows]

399
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,041
You know…

400
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,750
I do like that young woman.

401
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
[creaking]

402
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,833
[eerie music playing]

403
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,333
[Flora] Miss Clayton…

404
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,291
…please don't move things around
in my doll house.

405
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,166
Oh, I...

406
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,083
I have a very particular system.

407
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,666
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,958
[Flora] Oh…

409
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,500
You've got Peter.

410
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,166
Flora.

411
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,875
Yes?

412
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,708
Have Miles or you…

413
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,666
…seen Peter Quint?

414
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Since he left.

415
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,625
Maybe you…

416
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,916
let him into the house.

417
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,666
Look, I'm not angry.

418
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,166
I'd just like for you
to tell me the truth.

419
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,250
No.

420
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,041
Of course not.

421
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,875
We don't let him in the house.

422
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,000
That's not how it works.

423
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,958
- What are you looking at?
- [gasps]

424
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,416
I-I'm sorry?

425
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,041
You do that, a lot.

426
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,208
You look over my shoulder.
What are you looking at?

427
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,166
I don't know what you mean.

428
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,291
Well, that was quite the display,
wasn't it?

429
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,791
What was?

430
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,166
Miles, you and I are a lot alike.

431
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,791
Are we?

432
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,208
Yeah… We are.

433
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,375
In one of the biggest ways people can be.

434
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,666
I didn't have parents growing up either.

435
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,666
[melancholy music playing]

436
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,666
My dad died…

437
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,041
when I was about Flora's age.

438
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,916
And my mom…

439
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,625
…was alive, but, um…

440
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,583
…she wasn't really there anymore.

441
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,000
So, a lot of the times,
I had to be my own parent.

442
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,916
The kids like us…

443
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
…like you…

444
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:06,875
…and me…

445
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,083
…and Flora…

446
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,250
…we're special.

447
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,875
We grow up faster than other kids.

448
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,500
Hm.

449
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,750
And even more special…

450
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,750
we really get to choose the grown-ups
that we keep in our life.

451
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,791
Well, mostly, anyway.

452
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,416
I suppose that is pretty special.

453
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,083
I'm saying this 'cause I want you to know
that I understand.

454
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,000
When you talk a little bit
more grown-up, or…

455
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,291
you wanna act like the grown-ups,
I understand.

456
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,458
I was the same way.

457
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,500
You lost somebody too.

458
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,250
I did.

459
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,583
I've lost people a few ways in my life.

460
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:53,875
But…

461
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,958
wow!

462
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,458
Miles, you've got some great grown-ups.

463
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,083
Some great people here
to choose for your family.

464
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,125
If you want to.

465
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,458
Good night.

466
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,208
We're all outside, and you're joining us.

467
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,416
[Dani] Hm.

468
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,375
[Owen] Oh, there she is.

469
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,675
Dig in. Some of this wine
hasn't seen daylight

470
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,309
- since before you were born.
- [Dani] Huh.

471
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,791
[Owen] Hannah, give her a bottle.

472
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,208
Hannah.

473
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,125
- Hm?
- [chuckles] Where did you go, love?

474
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,375
I'm so sorry.

475
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,666
I, um… I've been drifting lately.
Quite a bit, I'm afraid. [chuckles]

476
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,916
[light classical music playing]

477
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,291
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

478
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,916
- Hey.
- [Dani biting]

479
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,083
- Easy.
- Oh.

480
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,583
You're gonna hurt yourself.

481
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:51,833
[chuckles nervously]
I'm sorry. I-I… I keep trying to stop.

482
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,208
Look, I know it's been…

483
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,291
it's been a lot.

484
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,976
You always hear that planning a wedding

485
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,881
is one of the most stressful things
you can do.

486
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,666
But you're doing great.

487
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:05,291
And I just wanted
to give us a night where…

488
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,395
we don't have to talk about any of it.

489
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,708
Uh… Actually…

490
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,208
Eddie, I was thinking
we could just tone it all down.

491
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Maybe just…

492
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,875
I don't know, I don't think
we have to go so… crazy with it.

493
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,166
Y-Yeah, I thought
you wanted a big wedding.

494
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,250
I-I…

495
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,375
If you don't,
that's all perfectly well and fine.

496
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,458
I…

497
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,041
thought I wanted it.

498
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:36,958
I wanted…

499
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,583
to want it.

500
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,250
But it's just so expensive,

501
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,750
and…

502
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,250
so much…

503
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,250
to organize.

504
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,625
So many people to let down...

505
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,500
Y-Yeah, no, easy. It's dumb.

506
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,375
For a second,
I thought you were gonna say

507
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,333
you didn't wanna get married at all.

508
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Eddie.

509
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,791
I can't.

510
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,333
What did I do?

511
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,583
- Nothing.
- What didn't I do?

512
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,125
- It's not like that.
- Well, then, what's it like, Danielle?

513
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:24,833
[sighs]

514
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,333
[sniffles]

515
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,250
Thank you.

516
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
[somber music playing]

517
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,041
This makes no sense.

518
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,416
I should have said something sooner.

519
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,458
- Yeah, you think?
- I didn't wanna hurt you… or your mom.

520
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,916
Or your family.

521
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,166
And then it was just what we were doing.

522
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:54,500
- Jesus Christ...
- I just…

523
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,958
thought I was being selfish.

524
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,791
That I could just stick it out,

525
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,916
and, eventually, I would feel
how I was supposed to.

526
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,166
You didn't wanna hurt me, huh?

527
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,250
And…

528
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:05,875
I love you.

529
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:09,791
So much.

530
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,041
Even still.

531
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:15,041
- It's just not... I don't...
- Fuck you, Danielle!

532
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,625
How... W-Why are you doing this to me?

533
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:22,708
I, um…

534
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:24,541
I don't... Eddie…

535
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay. Yeah.

536
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,625
- Eddie.
- No, let me go.

537
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,625
- Eddie!
- Let me go.

538
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,948
- I'm sorry!
- Jesus, have you not... You've done enough!

539
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,958
[Dani, sobbing] I'm sorry.

540
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,375
Eddie! Eddie!

541
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:43,958
- [screaming]
- [tires screeching]

542
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,750
[ominous music playing]

543
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,958
[gasping breaths]

544
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Eddie!

545
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,916
[breathing shakily]

546
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,250
[gurgling breaths]

547
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,625
[fire crackling]

548
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,625
Oh, damn it! Fallen soldier.

549
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,250
Owen, be a hero, pass us a fresh bottle.

550
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,583
[Hannah] Oh, I love a bonfire, I do.
Reminds me of being a little girl again.

551
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,541
Mind you,
I do appreciate the adult beverages.

552
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,625
[Jamie] You know, in the old days…

553
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,333
I mean, the really old days,

554
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:35,333
they used to build giant bonfires
at this time of year.

555
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,333
And talk about the people they'd lost.

556
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:42,375
Toss in offerings
to drive away evil spirits.

557
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,875
- Old bones, mostly.
- [Owen] I remember.

558
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:48,333
[slurring slightly] That's why
they call it a bonfire, isn't it?

559
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,875
As I was sayin',

560
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,333
that's why it's called a bonfire.

561
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,583
From the old English, meaning "bone fire."

562
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,041
Build a pile of old bones
and burn away the shadows.

563
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,000
Because from here on in,

564
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,916
the shadows get deeper…

565
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,333
…the nights get longer.

566
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:09,250
We're heading into the dark,
and we have to hang onto each other.

567
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,583
So we can only carry so much.

568
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,000
So…

569
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,375
anyone got any old bones to throw?

570
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,583
All right, I'll start.
[sniffs]

571
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,666
[melancholy music playing]

572
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:32,291
[Hannah sighs]

573
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,166
Rebecca.

574
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,375
Rebecca Jessel.

575
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, my God, it's been almost a year.

576
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,666
A year focused on the wrong person.

577
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,541
But, wherever she is,

578
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:51,416
she's still worth ten of that man.
I won't say his name.

579
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,958
She was brilliant.

580
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,750
She was beautiful.

581
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,250
And she was punished for it.

582
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:02,416
I don't know why brilliant young women
are always punished.

583
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,250
Rebecca.

584
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,083
All right, my turn.
[clears throat]

585
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,583
Lord and Lady Wingrave.

586
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,083
Dominic and Charlotte.

587
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,000
They were good people.

588
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,000
Old-fashioned…

589
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:24,583
kind people.

590
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,583
And their kids really miss them.

591
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,250
Nothing can fix that.

592
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
Not ever.

593
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,291
But here's Dani Clayton.

594
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:39,000
She's a bit of a weirdo,
but she's a lot stronger than she thinks.

595
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,125
And if anyone can bring Miles and Flora
back to themselves,

596
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:43,875
she can.

597
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,291
I'm glad she's here.

598
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,958
I think they would be too.

599
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:49,958
[sniffs]

600
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,958
What about you, Poppins?

601
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,250
Um…

602
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
No, thank you.

603
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,375
That's all right.

604
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,333
No, you... you don't have to.

605
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:15,958
So…

606
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:17,625
my mom.

607
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,375
Margaret Sharma.

608
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,916
She was 67.

609
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,333
Except sometimes,
by the end, she forgot that.

610
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,833
Called me by my dad's name,
or her brother's.

611
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,208
You know, I tried to pretend

612
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,458
that I didn't know
who I was supposed to be.

613
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,833
They didn't say
any of that at the funeral.

614
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,250
They wouldn't. They just…

615
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,458
…smoothed it over.

616
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:51,958
Made it nice.

617
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,416
So, they left out all the bad stuff.

618
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,750
And all the good stuff.

619
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,375
They didn't say how funny she was.

620
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,541
How she would…

621
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,250
wink at you
from across the breakfast table.

622
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,625
She had a sweet tooth.

623
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,833
And a dirty laugh.

624
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:18,833
And she loved me…

625
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,458
so hard…

626
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,166
it hurt.

627
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,250
Sometimes.

628
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,125
No matter what I did.

629
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,625
She was gone long before she died.

630
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,041
And I miss her.

631
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:39,666
She was my anchor.

632
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,208
And then I suppose she was my…

633
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,416
…burden.

634
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,416
Christ.

635
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,041
She seemed so small,

636
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,833
at the end.

637
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:58,666
But still so…

638
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,250
…heavy.

639
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,750
And I…

640
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,375
And all I could do was just…

641
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,416
let her hang onto me

642
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,125
until it was time for her to let go.

643
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,041
And soon I'll let her go, too.

644
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,625

[man] I'm so sorry.

655
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,708
[woman] I'm so sorry.

656
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:51,208
[man] Thank you.

657
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,625
I'm so sorry, Danielle.

658
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:58,958
He was a wonderful young man,
and you were a lovely couple.

659
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,041
[Dani] Thank you.

660
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,083
Forgive me.

661
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:14,125
[distorted] You're doing so well, honey.

662
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,458
[echoing] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

[ghostly echo]

664
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,250
[distorted] You made him so happy,
right till the end. I hope you know that.

665
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,833
You're being so brave, honey.

666
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,541
I'm really proud of you.

00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,583

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

674
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,041
Hm.

She had been tired for so long.</i>

676

<i>Yet without even realizing
she was doing it,</i>

677
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:53,250
<i>she found herself taking her own advice
that she'd given to Miles.</i>

681
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:13,375
I'm not gonna ask if you're all right,
'cause I don't like being lied to.

682
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,708
So, what's wrong?

683
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I thought I saw…

684
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,750
Peter Quint.

685
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,416
- But it wasn't?
- No, of course not.

686
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,125
It's not the first time I've…

687
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,375
seen things that…

688
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,000
aren't there.

689
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
So, what else?

690
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,375
Well…

691
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,291
I, uh, I…

692
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,708
I guess I…

693
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,500
…told you about my fiancé…

694
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,791
earlier, didn't I?

695
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,875
Oh, you did.

696
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Yeah.

697
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:00,625
I was, uh…

698
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,791
hoping we'd, uh, get round to that one.

699
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:04,875
Yeah.

700
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:09,833
We were…

701
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,125
We were engaged, and he... he died.

702
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,666
He died and I, uh…

703
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,916
I sometimes, I… It's like…

704
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,708
I see him.

705
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,875
I've never told anybody that.

706
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,583
I'm…

707
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,416
…so, so sorry.

708
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,750
We were about to break up.

709
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
We, uh…

710
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,458
I'd broken…

711
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,416
We had broken up.
I'd broken up, I guess.

712
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,083
Right before.

713
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,625
I mean, right…

714
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,916
…right before.

715
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,500
Jesus, Dani, the same day?

716
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,333
Yeah.

717
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,041
Is he here now?

718
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,958
No.

719
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,833
[Dani sighs]

720
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:30,916
Good.

721
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:35,541
'Cause, you know,
I'll sort him out for you if I have to.

722
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:38,916
Oi…

723
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,458
dead boyfriend!

724
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,791
Give it up, mate! It's over!

725
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,458
Seriously, Poppins.

726
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,291
How are you still standing?

727
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:58,333
Think I'm crazy?

728
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,375
I think you're surprisingly sane,
considering.

729
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,250
[sniffles]

730
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,333
[Jamie] Look…

731
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:08,958
I know what it feels like…

732
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,583
to feel like you can't find your...

733
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,000
You sure?

734
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,166
Yes.

[terrified gasp]

738
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,833
Okay.

739
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,208
Right. [clears throat]

740
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,291
- So… [awkward chuckle]
- I don't know what to…

741
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,958
- I don't know what to say.
- Just forget about it.

742
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,500
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

743
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:51,583
I'm sorry, just…

744
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,500
- Jamie.
- You were just telling me.

745
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,708
Literally telling me
that you weren't up for this.

746
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,375
Just…

747
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,458
Let's…

748
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,333
Let's get back.

749
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,625
Uh, another night, maybe.

750
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,541
Another time, maybe.

[storyteller] <i>But what the gardener
didn't yet understand</i>

752
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,208

had been telling herself</i>

753
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,958
<i>- to wait another night…</i>
- [knocking]

754

[knocking continues]

757
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,833
- [Mrs. O'Mara] Oh, oh, hi, Danielle.
- Oh.

758
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:34,666
Uh, y-you've not been answering
your phone, so I thought I'd come around.

759
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,041
Oh, I'm sorry, Judy, I, um…

760
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,041
Uh, it's, it's, um…

761
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,500
- It's been a bad time.
- Oh, of course.

762
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,708
Honey, I'm... I… I'm worried.

763
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,125
People say
you're not taking care of yourself.

764
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,625
You've got to eat.

765
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,041
I brought some lasagna.

766
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,916
- Oh, my favorite.
- Yeah.

767
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,958
- Thanks.
- No. [laughs gently]

768
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,791
I-I brought something else, too. It's…

769
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,875
Um…

770
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,541
I… [stammering]

771
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,291
I think it's silly, sort of, but…

772
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,666
I thought you might like
to have these.

[eerie music playing]

774
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:09,916
Oh, uh…

775
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,958
No. Judy, I-I'm sorry, but I...

776
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:14,875
Really? They were in his things
that came back from the hospital and…

777
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,958
I can't stand to look at them.

778
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,666
I couldn't bear to throw them away,
so I thought…

779
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:23,375
- Please.
- Okay, of course.

780
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,041
Thank you.

781
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:29,166
Danielle…

782
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:34,291
I hope you know that you're still
a really important part of this family.

783
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,958
I hope you know that I mean that.
Come here, come on.

784
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:39,875
Ohh…

785
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,958
Oh, my sweet thing.

786
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,208
[car approaching]

787
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:53,333
Okay, um, I-I actually have some stuff
I need to get done.

788
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:55,333
- Oh, sure, of course. Um…
- Yeah.

789
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,750
Please, please come by for dinner,
any night.

790
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,708
- Okay, I will.
- Okay.

791
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,041
Real soon.

792
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,208
Lots of love.

793
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,208
Okay. Uh, bye-bye now.

794
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,500
Bye, sweetheart.

You and me<i>,</i> while we still can.

[Jamie] So sorry to interrupt,
but I'm turning into a pumpkin.

800
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,833
Come on, Owen, time to go home.

801
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:32,791
Oh, it's about that time.

802
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,708
Well… [clears throat]

803
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,083
I'll-co-hol you later.

804
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,916
[Hannah] God, even for you.

805
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,291
Drive safe.

806
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,333
[Jamie] I know the road. We'll be fine.

807
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,791
It's all good.

808
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:54,500
Christ, the state of you.

809

815
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
What the heck are you doing down here?

Okay, let's get you two back to bed.

819
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,333
Not just yet.

820
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,375
I'm quite frightened.

821
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,791
It was a horrible dream.

822
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,583
Well, you should be in bed.

823
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,666
Not now, I won't.

[sighs]

825
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:47,875
What happened?

826
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:51,916
There was something horrible
and loud in the wardrobe.

827
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,833
Mm-hm.

828
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,333
Moving from in there to under…

829
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:57,833
A creature!

830
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,916
A creature under my bed.

831
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,541
And it knew my name.

832
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,166
And it was reaching out,
and it knew my name.

833
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,416
And it said it wanted to do awful things.

834
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,791
And it had bones for hands.

835
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:12,958
That sounds awful.

836
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,750
It was my mum.

838
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,333
I am so…

839
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:22,375
sorry, Flora.

840
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,666
That sounds like an awful dream.

841
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:27,333
Well.

842
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,666
Let's get you two back to bed, okay?

843
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,291
Just a minute.

844
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,541
I don't want to just yet.

845
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:37,416
I was so scared,

846
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,916
but I'm feeling better already.

847
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:42,416
Just…

848
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:44,791
a-a few minutes more.

849
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,458
Just a minute, really.

850
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,166
In... in fact,

851
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,916
c-could I have a glass of milk?

852
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,291
[Dani] Of course.

854
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,375
I'm sorry.

855
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:39,625
No.

856
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,708
It's okay, okay?
There's nothing to be scared of.

857
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,500
- Quite right.
- Yeah.

858
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,750
Good night…

859
