- How long, doctor?

192

Months. Months at the most.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,583
And I would keep her separate

<i>She would sleep,</i>

699
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,958
<i>and as happens when one dreams,
she would forget.</i>

700
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,291
<i>And having forgotten, she would wake.</i>

701
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,583
[nocturnal chirping]

702
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:20,875
<i>She would walk.</i>

703
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,291
[somber music playing]

704
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:37,125
<i>Viola faintly noticed
her own attempted exorcism.</i>

705
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,125
<i>And alas, the poor vicar,</i>

706
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,958
<i>the second person
to find himself in Viola's path.</i>

707
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:52,958
<i>She would sleep,</i>

708
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:56,708
<i>forget, and forget, and forget.</i>

709
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:58,708
<i>And with the forgetting,</i>

710
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,291
<i>an ailment altogether monstrous.</i>

711
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,125
<i>All things fade.</i>

712
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:09,000
<i>All things.
Flesh, stone, even stars themselves.</i>

713
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:12,708
<i>Time takes all things.
It is the way of the world.</i>

714
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:18,416
<i>The past recedes, memories fade,
and so, true, does the spirit.</i>

715
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,458
<i>Everything yields to time,</i>

716
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:22,166
<i>even the soul.</i>

717
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,791
<i>Wake, walk, forget even more.</i>

718
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,833
<i>Her name, forgotten.</i>

719
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,250
<i>Her sister's name, forgotten.</i>

720
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,625
<i>As her memories left her,</i>

721
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,750
<i>so, too, her face.</i>

722
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,083
<i>So little did she remember…</i>

723
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:43,291
<i>that one night, she found a child
in her daughter's old bed,</i>

724
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,375
<i>and could not remember
who she had been hoping to see.</i>

725
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,625
<i>She had only the faint notion
that she'd walked this far</i>

726
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,875
<i>hoping to find a child,</i>

727
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,000
<i>and here was a child.</i>

728
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,708
<i>It must be the child whom she'd sought.</i>

729
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,625
<i>It must.</i>

730
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,625
<i>She would sleep, and she would fade.</i>

731
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,875
<i>And fade, and fade.</i>

732
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,375
<i>And the others, too.</i>

733
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,541
<i>Those souls held in her orbit,</i>

734
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,250
<i>those unfortunates
trapped in the gravity well</i>

735
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:18,708
<i>she had made of Bly Manor.</i>

736
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:23,500
<i>They were fading as well.</i>

737
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:39,958
<i>The eldest of Willoughby's daughters,
once Lady Lloyd of Bly,</i>

738
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:43,000
<i>now just a thought, just a feeling,</i>

739
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:47,875
<i>not a woman at all, not a person at all,
not a name or a face.</i>

740
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,416
<i>Just need.</i>

741
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
<i>Need…</i>

742
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,833
<i>and loneliness.</i>

743
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:53,625
<i>And rage.</i>

744
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:55,416
<i>Her fate was a nightmare.</i>

745
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,666
<i>A fate that befell all trapped at Bly.</i>

746
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,666
<i>A fate that befell Viola's once sister,</i>

747
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,208
<i>now forgotten in the attic.</i>

748
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,458
<i>Unaware that she'd ever had
a sister at all.</i>

749
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,083
<i>To murder, or be murdered by.</i>

750
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,375
<i>A fate that befell anyone
unfortunate enough</i>

751
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:14,625
<i>to step into her habitual path.</i>

752
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:15,708
[Peter]Stop.

753

Stop!

[clattering]

757
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:27,625
<i>A fate that befell even those
who died of other causes at Bly,</i>

758
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,083
<i>who found themselves
in the grips of Viola's gravity,</i>

759
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,416
<i>even if never
in the grip of her icy hands.</i>

[storyteller] <i>No hope for anyone
