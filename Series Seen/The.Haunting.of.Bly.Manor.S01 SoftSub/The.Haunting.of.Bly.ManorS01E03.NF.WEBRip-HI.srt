What's your name?

180
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,916
I'm Flora.

181
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,708
That means flower. Latin.

182
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,000
[Rebecca chuckles]

183
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,291
Of course it does.

184
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,708
- And you must be Miles.
- Hi there.

185
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,875
Let me guess,
you ought to be our very own Mary Poppins.

186
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,708
[Rebecca chuckles]

187
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,416
Well, I'm not practically perfect,

188
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,583
but I am…

189
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,500
perfectly splendid.

190
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,166
- Hannah Grose.
- Rebecca.

191
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,833
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you too.

192
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,916
Ah, this is Owen.

193
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,434
- Lovely to meet you, Owen.
- And our...

194
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,458
- Jamie.
- Hello.

195
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,500
You shouldn't be smoking.

196
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,833
Ay, you're right.

197
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,125
Do you like that?

198
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Just flip…

199
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,125
…and click.

200
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,392
- There.
- [Flora] I'll show you everything.

201
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,583
- You <i>must </i>see the statue garden.
- [Rebecca chuckling]

202
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,083
- Let Miss Jessel settle in before you...
- [Rebecca] It's all right.

203
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,166
[Hannah] All right.

204
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,458
The statue garden is my favorite.

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,583
There are flowers, of course.

206
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,041
And much more.

207
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,125
And they're all…

208
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,500
perfectly splendid.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,833
[storyteller] <i>Miss Jessel found herself,</i>

210
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,500
<i>as she walked the grounds of Bly
for the first time,</i>

211
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>wishing that she might never leave.</i>

212
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,666
<i>And it turned out…</i>

213
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,791
<i>- …she never would.
- </i>[owl hoots]

214
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,625
[nocturnal chirping]

215
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,041
- [screams] Jesus!
- Jesus!

216
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,791
[pants]

217
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,083
Shot plenty of rats with it.

218
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,750
More than happy to add
Peter fucking Quint to the tally.

219
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,541
- Not a fan, I take it.
- You don't know the half.

220
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm learning.

221
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,541
You got the right idea.

222
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,125
I think it's a teachable moment for him.

223
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,416
You looked down there yet?

224
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,291
[door creaks open]

225
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,875
[Jamie sighs]

226
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,375
[Jamie]
Hannah must have left 'em burning.

227
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,291
She's always lighting and forgetting 'em.

228
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,041
The place will burn down
one of these days.

229
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,958
[Jamie sighs]

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's go.

231
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,000
No sign of Parapet Pete.

232
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,666
Do you want hot chocolate?

233
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,916
My skin's crawling
thinking he might be out there.

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,375
How about we stay here tonight?
Just in case.

235
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,309
- Yes! A sleepover.
- [Miles] That would be fun.

236
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,934
- [Flora] That would be splendid.
- A sleepover. That <i>would </i>be fun.

237
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,083
What about your mum?

238
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,875
It's just for one night.
She's already fast asleep.

239
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:47,958
It's better I'm here.

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,500
- Just in case you-know-who shows up.
- That would be great.

241
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,875
You haven't touched your hot chocolate,
Mrs. Grose.

242
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,916
Can I have it?

243
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,333
- Uh, no, you'll be up all night.
- [Flora] Yes!

244
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,208
- Let's stay up all night!
- [Dani] Flora.

245
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,041
[Flora] This is all so exciting!

246
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,166
We're going to stay up all night long,
and it's going to be perfectly...

247
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,458
[fire crackling]

248
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,583
What on earth would possess him
to show his face around here again?

249
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,750
It can't be for more money, surely.

250
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,713
He can't have got through
what he stole already.

251
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,041
Oh, no, thanks, love.

252
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,416
One of us needs to be sober enough
to take him on.

253
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,000
You want the poker or the shotgun?

254
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,166
Mm. Candlestick in the library.

255
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,291
[Owen sighs]

256
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:31,958
Here you go.

257
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,125
[Owen] What if he's the one
who's been ringing here…

258
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,916
then hanging up? Hm?

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,791
I thought those were prank calls.

260
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,791
Well, maybe not.

261
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,833
Who would he be trying to call?

262
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,875
Maybe Becca.

263
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,333
- Why would he call a dead woman?
- He might not know she's dead. [sighs]

264
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,041
She certainly wasn't big news
outside the county.

265
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,250
He might not know a thing.

266
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,083
Or maybe he spent all the money, or…

267
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,875
had second thoughts.

268
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
Or maybe he misses her.

269
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,250
So…

270
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,625
he calls the house now and then,

271
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,875
hoping she'll pick up, which…

272
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,375
…she never does.

273
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,666
So…

274
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,375
he comes on back…

275
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,166
to find out why.

276
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,416
Well, that doesn't bode well for anyone.

277
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,708
I wouldn't fancy being there

278
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,583
when Peter Quint
finds out Rebecca Jessel is dead.

279
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,750
- [Rebecca] So, are these two friends?
- [Flora] Yeah.

280
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,125
- They're friends.
- [Rebecca chuckles]

281
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,708
- Best friends.
- Mm-hm.

282
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,833
Dolls are ridiculous.

283
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,125
Dolls are wonderful.

284
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,416
You get to make up all kinds of people
and tell stories with them.

285
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,208
Hello, my name is Flora.

286
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,000
But they're not made up.

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,750
I'll make one of you, Miss Jessel.

288
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,875
What's your favorite color?

289
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,041
Hmm.

290
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,625
I don't have a favorite.
I like all the colors.

291
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,416
Then I'll make you one
with all the colors.

292
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,333
Thank you. [laughs]

293
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,458
[knocking on door]

294
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,541
Come in!

295
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,166
Am I interrupting?

296
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,125
Ah, I'm here on an errand
for Sir Henry, and…

297
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,750
…well, I found these,

298
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,125
and I thought flowers this beautiful
deserve a beautiful woman.

299
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,833
So, these are for you, Flora.

300
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,291
[gasps] Thank you so much.

301
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,416
They're perfectly splendid.

302
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,458
No one's ever given me flowers before.

303
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,500
And I thought they were for Miss Jessel.

304
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,833
And now you're so dreadfully jealous.

305
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,833
Well, we can share, can't we, Flora?

306
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,916
Of course.

307
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,625
Have a flower, please.

308
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,583
Aww.

309
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,416
Well, thank you, Flora.

310
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,750
Let's go and put these
in some water, okay?

311
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,833
Be right back.

312
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,541
You didn't rip up Jamie's garden, did you?

313
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,500
She'll be cross if you did.

314
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,541
Ah, that one was born cross.

315
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,375
I don't know why Flora gets so silly
about a few stupid flowers.

316
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,125
Do you know what life
is really all about, Miles?

317
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,291
- Not flowers.
- No.

318
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,416
Keys.

319
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,833
See…

320
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,125
people are like locked rooms.

321
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,541
They've all got different locks,

322
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,875
and you've got to guess the shape
of their key.

323
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,041
Like how there are…

324
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,791
keys to all the doors in this pointlessly,
excessively large house.

325
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,250
Different keys for different doors.

326
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,750
So, if you want someone to open a door,

327
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,416
you have to try out different keys
until you find the one that works.

328
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,750
Like…

329
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,208
for people like your uncle…

330
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,125
His key is money.

331
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,375
Or flattery.

332
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,833
For horses, it's carrots.

333
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,000
And for women, most of them…

334
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,166
[sighs] …it's flowers.

335
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,750
Then why did you give the flowers
to Flora?

336
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,833
I didn't.

337
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,500
[thunder rumbling]

338
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,000
[wind whistling]

339
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,958
- Still at it?
- [Peter chuckles]

340
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,083
- I'm just about done.
- Mm-hm.

341
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,458
Not looking forward to going out in that.

342
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,875
Uh, then don't.

343
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,583
Have some tea while it blows over.

344
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Okay.

345
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,625
[thunder rumbling]

346
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,416
So, how are you finding it?

347
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,166
It's a fine job, really.

348
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,666
Uh, yes.

349
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,333
The kids are very sweet,

350
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,500
even if I'm mopping up
their muddy footprints sometimes.

351
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,416
Twice now they've snuck out
in the middle of the night.

352
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,750
No, I mean, how are you finding all this?

353
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,666
I mean, living in a mansion,

354
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,125
the statue gardens,
ordering servants about,

355
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,750
this ridiculousness.

356
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,833
I mean, I'm…

357
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,625
hardly lady of the manor.

358
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,833
Uh, I spent the morning
cleaning vomit off the boy's jumper.

359
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,916
[giggles]

360
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,875
I'm sorry, that's not funny.

361
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,208
One like you, as smart as you are.

362
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,291
Well, it's offensive even.

363
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,541
It's fine.

364
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,791
Um, Miles is a sweetheart.

365
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,750
Surely, that's not what you wanted.

366
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:38,041
I mean, I can't imagine
a young Rebecca Jessel

367
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,583
looking out her window,
dreaming up at the sky that someday,

368
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,791
someday, she'd be scrubbing up
some rich kid's puke

369
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,208
while his guardian drinks himself
into a coma.

370
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,583
You're too good for that.

371
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,625
Too good.

372
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,125
And too smart.

373
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,333
I don't care if Henry can't see it, I can.

374
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,291
I saw it the day you walked in.

375
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,625
I said to him,
"One day, I might be working for her."

376
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,500
[thunder rumbling]

377
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,166
Tell me what you want.

378
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:15,291
I mean, everybody wants something in life,

379
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,416
and somehow our betters
have convinced us that's a bad thing.

380
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,625
So, what do you want, Rebecca?

381
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,416
I want to be a barrister.

382
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,291
Now you're talking.

383
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,500
Not a solicitor.

384
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,000
A proper barrister, like Mr. Wingrave.

385
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,041
But, first, I need a pupilage.

386
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,458
Three other women from my year
managed to get one,

387
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,333
and all left within the first year.

388
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,791
A sea of old men
trying to run a hand up your skirt

389
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,416
every day for six months

390
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,000
while you try to persuade them
that your brain isn't between your legs.

391
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,833
So, you took a different route?

392
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,291
I mean, your references,
they're impeccable.

393
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,791
Astor's, Bryce's, Gray's of Norfolk.
People like that get to know you,

394
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:07,041
see the brain power and ingenuity
just taking care of their heirs.

395
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,125
But now…

396
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,333
…now you have their wife or child
fetching for you.

397
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,333
And you remain focused,
you keep on impressing…

398
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,333
…you leap right over
all those grabbing hands

399
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,541
and find someone of worth to mentor you.

400
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,458
[thunder rumbling]

401
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,875
Henry is a QC
and a master in trade legislation,

402
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,041
but you knew that
when you applied, didn't you?

403
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,333
I see you, Rebecca.

404
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I see you.

405
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,833
- [thunder rumbling]
- [Rebecca sighs]

406
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,083
So…

407
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,875
…why are <i>you </i>here?

408
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,375
Why am I here, uh…

409
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,083
on this Earth?

410
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,250
Why am I here in this job
working for Henry, or, uh…

411
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,625
why am I here with you

412
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,291
when I was meant
to be back in London an hour ago?

413
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,833
Let's take them one at a time.

414
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,166
Why am I here on this Earth?

415
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,041
Uh, to make sure I leave behind
more than I took.

416
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,416
Why am I here in this job
working for Henry?

417
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,958
Because you may not know it
to look at me, but…

418
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,791
there is a ceiling that I, too,
cannot break through.

419
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,333
Growing up where I did,

420
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,041
I'm quite simply not part
of the fucking club.

421
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:29,958
So…

422
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,625
…why am I here?

423
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,125
I don't know.

424
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,583
But I feel…

425
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:49,791
…hopeful.

426
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,625
And that doesn't happen often, not to me.

427
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,166
I should go. I'm sorry. Uh…

428
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,791
- Are you sure? It... it's still...
- No, it-it's fine.

429
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:09,958
The worst has passed.

430
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,750
But thank you, uh, for the drink,
and the company.

431
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,416
You're welcome.

432
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,416
Thank you…

433
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,083
for the conversation.

434
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,458
It's been a long time
since I've had a real one.

435
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,208
Good night, Rebecca Jessel.

436
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,125
Good night, Peter Quint.

437
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,708
[sighs]

438
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,666
[eerie music playing]

439
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,125
[jarring crescendo]

440
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,208
[gentle music plays]

441
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,791
Hey, you all right?

442
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,875
Hm?

443
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,458
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

444
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:15,541
[sighs]

445
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,291
If truth be told,
I haven't slept well for days.

446
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,916
Well, Mrs. Grose, it is too late now.

447
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,708
Come on.

448
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,416
Tuck in and relax for a bit.

449
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,750
[sighs]

450
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,833
[chuckles]

451
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,750
Rather that was you curled up there?

452
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,708
[Owen clears throat]

453
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,833
Every girl in the village is mad for him.

454
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,208
He doesn't even know it,
which makes it even worse.

455
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,375
[chuckles softly]

456
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,250
[Dani] They look like Bonnie and Clyde.

457
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,333
[Jamie] Yeah…

458
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,500
if Clyde fucked Bonnie over.

459
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,041
He got away.

460
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,708
She paid the price.

461
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,333
So, what? He's stalking a dead woman?

462
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,833
Risking prison for someone
he didn't even bother to bring along?

463
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,291
That doesn't make sense.

464
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,583
The wrong kind of love can fuck you up.

465
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,666
Follow you.

466
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,416
Make you do some really stupid shit.

467
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,041
[sighs heavily]

468
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,125
And those two…

469
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,041
…believe me,
that was the wrong kind of love.

470
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,142
[Dani] We've all been in the wrong kind
of love for one reason or...

471
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,750
Mm-hm. But I saw
how he twisted himself into her.

472
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,375
Burrowed in deep.

473
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:36,208
I know why so many people
mix up love and possession…

474
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,833
But guess what that means?

475
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,166
He didn't just trap her.

476
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,666
He trapped himself.

477
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,166
And I hope she haunts that fucker forever.

478
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,041
[melancholy music playing]

479
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,250
People do, don't they?

480
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,833
Mix up love and possession.

481
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,333
Yeah, they do.

482
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,541
I don't think that should be possible.

483
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:14,083
I mean, they're opposites, really.
Love and ownership.

484
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,458
Yeah.

485
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,916
[Hannah] They really ought to be in bed.

486
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,458
Oh, yes.

487
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,250
Yes, yes. [chuckles]

488
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,278
- I'll take them.
- [Hannah] Okay.

489
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,750
Up you go.

490
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:35,833
Thank you.

491
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,916
You're the coolest.

492
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
[Jamie chuckles]

493
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,166
- I had a bad dream.
- Oh.

494
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,250
I hurt you.

495
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:49,166
- And it made you feel sad.
- Oh, you never make me sad, poppet.

496
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,250
[kisses]

497
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,541
[rain pattering]

498
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,500
[frightening orchestral swell]

499
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,208
[Dani whimpering]

500
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:31,083
[panicked breathing]

501
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,541
[ominous music intensifying]

502
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,541
[music abruptly stops]

503
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,625
[rain pattering]

504
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,250
[eerie music playing]

505
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,791
[birds chirping]

506
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,541
Do you have any hearts?

507
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
[Flora] No.

508
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:09,041
What a liar you are!
I can see two of them, right there!

509
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,125
Stop peeking at my cards, Miles!
Miss Jessel, he's cheating!

510
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,000
- You're lying, and that's cheating!
- It's not!

511
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,125
[Peter] Stop cheating, Miles.

512
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,958
[Flora giggles] Peter!

513
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,666
What are you doing here?

514
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,000
And, more importantly,
have you brought me any more flowers?

515
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,541
Uh, no. Uh…

516
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,416
I've got some errands
to do for your uncle,

517
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,375
so he sent me here
for at least a few days.

518
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,875
- Days? [giggles]
- That's right.

519
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,416
Mrs. Grose is making up a room for me
as we speak.

520
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,333
Will Uncle Henry come over soon?

521
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,125
I don't know.

522
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:43,750
What's with the face?

523
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:46,666
Nothing.

524
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,041
You know, I lost my dad too.

525
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,500
I was a bit older than you.

526
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,791
And he was pretty crap
most of the time, but…

527
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,333
You've seen this, right?

528
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,208
This belonged to my dad.

529
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,166
It's a little piece of him.

530
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,000
One of the only nice bits, really.

531
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,041
Why don't you…

532
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,541
hold on to it for me?

533
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,083
Would you like that?

534
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,083
Just don't burn the house down, please.

535
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:21,708
[Rebecca chuckles]

536
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,375
Let's play some cards!
[clears throat]

537
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:28,041
[Flora] You just need to watch out,
because Miles is a filthy cheater.

538
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,250
- [Peter] Is that right?
- [Flora] But otherwise…

539
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,208
- it's perfectly splendid.
- [Peter sighs]

540
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,833
[Miles] Yes, and you're perfectly mental.

541
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,250
[Flora] Stop it, Miles!

542
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,583
[sighs]

543
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,500
[floorboard creaks]

544
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,375
[creaking]

545
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,958
[Peter] Sorry, I shouldn't have. Uh…

546
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,958
I-I couldn't sleep, and, uh…

547
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,791
[Rebecca gasps]

548
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:24,625
[both moaning softly]

549
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:27,875
[door locks]

550
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,666
[praying indistinctly]

551
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,375
[Owen] Good morning.

552
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,166
Oh… good morning.

553
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
A-Any sign of him?

554
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,166
Oh, uh, no, not a thing.
Did a quick sweep.

555
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,875
- Safe as houses.
- Oh.

556
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,166
But you know what?
I think Mr. McQueeny next door

557
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,958
could look in on Mum today.

558
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,416
I can call him and, uh, stick around here,
just in case.

559
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,375
No, no, really.
[inhales sharply] I'd feel just awful.

560
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,583
Oh, it's only one day.

561
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,791
And I'm sure she can use a day without me.

562
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,291
It might make all the difference, really.
[chuckles]

563
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,166
Well, thank you for coming to our rescue.

564
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,375
Well, you always come to mine.

565
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,583
[Owen clears throat]

566
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,416
[footsteps receding]

567
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,500
Good morning, it's time to wake…

568
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh, you're already up.

569
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,791
How are you feeling?

570
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,791
Capital. Wonderful, in fact.

571
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,625
Can we have a picnic, do you think?

572
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,708
It's a marvelous day for it.

573
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,000
Once we find Flora,
let's make a day of it.

574
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,125
What do you mean, find Flora?
Isn't she in her room?

575
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,375
[music box playing "O Willow Waly"]

576
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,333
Flora?

577
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,916
- [music box continues playing]
- [flies buzzing]

578
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm all finished.

579
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,000
And I wanted to show you something.

580
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,166
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

581
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,416
You said your favorite color
was all the colors,

582
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,000
and Miles says

583
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,625
if you mix all the colors
in the world together,

584
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:14,833
you get black.

585
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,916
Well, it's beautiful. I love it.

586
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,833
You're beautiful.

587
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,833
Peter was even saying so himself
this morning.

588
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:25,041
He stayed the night, you know.

589
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,791
Well, it is fun to have him here.

590
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:38,875
[frightening music playing]

591
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,333
[Dani] Flora.

592
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,583
- Flora.
- No!

593
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,833
- Flora!
- [screaming] No!

594
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,500
No!

595
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,166
No! No!

596
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,041
- No!
- [screams fading]

597
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,875
[music intensifying jarringly]

598
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,625
[man] No sign of fever.

599
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,166
Tell you what, sweetheart.

600
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,958
You're gonna spend
the rest of the day in bed.

601
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,583
[Dani] <i>She was inconsolable.</i>

602
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,333
I'm afraid this isn't unprecedented.

603
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,166
Well… not surprising
given what they've been through.

604
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,750
[Hannah] Well, yes.

605
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:25,583
Well, when you talk to Henry,
you can tell him I said they're all right.

606
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:27,833
Are they all right?

607
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,833
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with them,

608
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,041
and that's all I can speak to, I'm afraid.

609
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:34,875
I'll see myself out.

610
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,208
- Always nice to see you, Hannah.
- And you.

611
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,458
[footsteps recede]

612
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,375
I can't believe he didn't show up.

613
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,166
I told him I'd called a goddamned doctor.

614
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,583
He said, "Keep me posted."

615
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,541
Tell him you called a coroner,
and then maybe.

616
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,583
No, nothing short of that
would get Henry Wingrave back to Bly.

617
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,226
Said the same thing when I told him
about Quint. "Keep me posted."

618
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,208
I still don't understand, though.

619
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,583
She was by the lake.

620
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,750
But she hates the lake.

621
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:10,833
Yeah.

622
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,666
Miles, darling. Um…

623
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,125
Why don't you go help Owen
with breakfast, hm?

624
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,916
[Miles] She doesn't hate it there.

625
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,625
Why should anyone hate a lake?

626
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,625
She talks about it all the time.

627
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,333
Sure.

628
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,833
But Flora lies.

629
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:32,666
[Hannah sighs]

630
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,458
[Rebecca moans gently]

631
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,291
[kiss]

632
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,125
- Good morning.
- Mm.

633
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,083
Yes, it is.

634
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:11,875
[Rebecca moans]

635
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,208
[chuckles softly]

636
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,958
Oh, my gosh, I need to get up.

637
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,208
- No, in a minute.
- No, no, stop. Seriously.

638
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,625
I'm serious, Pete.

639
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,541
- Come back.
- [chuckling]

640
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,375
Look, just hold that thought, okay?

641
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:26,458
I have to go.

642
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,791
- [sighs]
- But they can wait.

643
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,375
Please.

644
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
You're here another night, right?

645
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:40,541
Right?

646
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,208
At least.

647
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:47,958
I'll tell Henry the house will blow up
if I don't stay the week.

648
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:48,958
[chuckles softly]

649
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,291
Then hold that thought.

650
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,500
Just till tonight.

651
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,166
[exhales]

652
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Come back to bed.

653
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,375
Please.

654
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,250
[chuckles softly]

655
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:09,625
Patience.

656
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,708
[footstep recede]

657
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,000
Owen, apparently, you're cooking
for seven again tonight.

658
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:27,000
- Oh, he... he's staying tonight as well?
- Mm. Apparently.

659
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,916
Although I'm not sure for how long.

660
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,458
[Peter whistling "O Willow Waly"]

661
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,708
What is that?

662
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,125
That is a very specific Bordeaux,

663
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,458
and it would knock
your knickers off, Hannah.

664
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,375
Do you want a glass?

665
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,458
Have you been in the wine cellar?

666
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:43,333
Yeah, it's fine.

667
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,416
Henry's blessed it.

668
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:48,291
I'll save you a glass if you'd like.
It is a lovely year.

669
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,791
[giggling] I can't. I have to get back!

670
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,125
I know, I know.
Just a few minutes, please. Please.

671
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,458
They've been at it again.

672
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:03,416
- Why do they keep tracking mud in here?
- Well, make them clean it up.

673
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,958
Well... They shouldn't be in here at all.
<i>We </i>shouldn't be in here...

674
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,125
It's fine.
We've got permission from the top.

675
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,916
- The children...
- They're set.

676
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,625
I've seen to it, okay?

677
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,916
Okay.

678
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
[sighs]

679
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,333
Do you trust me?

680
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:20,000
Yes, I trust you.

681
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:25,416
- What?
- Wait.

682
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,125
- What are you doing?
- It's a surprise.

683
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,250
Oh, my gosh.

684
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,708
- Okay, a few more steps.
- Mm-hm.

685
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,958
- I don't have long.
- I know, I know, I know.

686
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,666
- [Rebecca sighs]
- Okay.

687
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,750
Open your eyes.

688
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,375
Whose is that?

689
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,166
It's yours.

690
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,875
I don't understand.

691
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:47,583
It's one of my projects,
inventory for this wing.

692
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,375
There's a few things
going to auction, but…

693
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:53,208
Henry said this was yours,
if you want it.

694
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,250
- He didn't.
- He did.

695
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,250
I mean, took a lot of convincing.

696
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,625
But…

697
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,458
I'm persuasive when I need to be.

698
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,000
But…

699
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,041
- this belonged to...
- She never wore it.

700
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,875
He was adamant about that.
She never wore it, so…

701
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:11,833
don't feel bad.

702
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Try it on.

703
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,416
Go on, try it on!

704
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,208
[chuckles]

705
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,416
[music box playing "O Willow Waly"]

706
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
No. No, no, no.

707
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:34,791
See, fur like that…

708
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,708
…you have to feel it on your skin.

709
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,125
At least once in your life.
There's nothing like it.

710
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,666
[song continues playing hauntingly]

711
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,625
[sinister music plays quietly]

712
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
[sighs]

713
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:29,958
[Rebecca moans]

714
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,333
Let me show you…

715
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,500
just how beautiful you are.

716
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
[chuckles softly]

717
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,666
- [giggling]
- [camera shutter clicks]

718
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,083
- Let me see, then.
- No.

719
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,166
Not till the end.

720
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:57,458
[moans softly]

721
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,083
- [Hannah] Excuse me.
- [gasps]

722
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,458
[both breathing heavily]

723
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,125
The children, Rebecca, are on the lawn.

724
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,333
- By themselves.
- [Rebecca] Yes, of course.

725
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,625
- I'm so sorry.
- [Peter] They're fine. They're fine.

726
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:23,083
The blouse, perhaps.

727
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,166
Oh, gosh.

728
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:28,791
I'm so sorry.

729
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,916
- This wing is off limits.
- [Peter scoffs]

730
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,000
Careful, Hannah.

731
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,500
- You know that I can have...
- What? Have me fired?

732
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,250
[scoffs]
Oh, yes, I know that very well, Peter.

733
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,583
You've got his ear.

734
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,250
You could have the lot of us out of here
if you truly wanted. Do you know what?

735
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,333
Right now, I do not care.

736
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,166
You see, if I ever…

737
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:57,708
ever find you in here again,
in Charlotte's things, ever again,

738
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:58,791
so help me God,

739
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,125
I will drag you out of this house
by your bloody ear

740
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,083
and throw you into that dirty lake.

741
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,583
Do you understand me?

742
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,000
[music box continues playing softly]

743
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,625
Good.

744
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,291
Now, clean this up.

745
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's almost supper.

746
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,791
[Owen] Oh, my God, this is divine!

747
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,708
This is going to be an absurd cake.

748
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,625
It needs something. Strawberry or lemon?

749
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,948
- Me first because I'm older.
- I want to try the batter!

750
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,583
I mean, I've made some good cakes
in my day,

751
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,791
but this one is <i>batter.</i>

752
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:47,875
[chuckles softly]

753
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,875
Oh, a lot of long faces tonight.
We might need a bigger cake.

754
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:53,125
- Let me try!
- All right, there you go.

755
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,250
Go on.

756
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,208
Mmm.

757
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,291
- Divine.
- Hm.

758
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,041
- But you should add more strawberry.
- [Miles] My turn.

759
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,750
Hm. More lemon.
It needs more lemon.

760
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,000
You all must try this. It's amazing!

761
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:10,666
You'll agree.

762
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,541
- It needs more strawberry.
- [Miles] Lemon.

763
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,985
- [Jamie] All right, let me try.
- [Owen] Oh, no, not Jamie.

764
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,083
There needs to be enough left
for an actual cake.

765
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,166
[Jamie] Move over.

766
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,083
[clears throat]

767
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,416
- Strawberry.
- Ooh.

768
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Ha!

769
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,125
[Owen] All right, love.

770
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,875
A taste, then a smile.

771
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,583
- Oh, no…
- Oh, come on, come on.

772
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,333
Please, I'll be offended.

773
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,625
There you go.
[gasps] Ooh!

774
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,916
[children laughing]

775
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,125
- Oh.
- Now I've done it.

776
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,416
Oh, don't.

777
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,583
- You're…
- No, no, no.

778
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,083
…a battered woman.

779
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:49,291
- [Hannah] For God's sakes.
- [children giggling]

780
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,458
Mm.

781
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:55,166
It's divine. Perfect just the way it is.

782
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,041
[Owen] Well, that's useless! Hm.

783
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,125
Come on, Rebecca.

784
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,958
- [Rebecca scoffs]
- [Owen] Chin up. Mm-mm.

785
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,208
[Hannah] Thank you.

786
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,833
[Rebecca smacks lips]
Mmm. Delicious.

787
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,375
I say…

788
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:10,791
lemon.

789
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,791
Oh, we have a proper batter royale.

790
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,750
Come on, Pete, you're the tiebreaker.

791
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,500
Oh, no, the pressure.

792
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:24,666
[Owen] Hm.

793
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,541
[smacks lips]

794
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,625
Oh, God, that's amazing.

795
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:33,083
I'm going to say…

796
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:35,875
…strawberry.

797
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,125
[Flora] Ha! In your face, Miles!

798
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,833
[laughing] They're finally asleep.

799
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,583
I swear, Flora's wearing
a cake's worth of batter.

800
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:45,916
What's going on?

801
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,208
I'm going back to London.

802
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:51,333
- Oh, I-I… I thought...
- Yeah, well,

803
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:54,541
we both had a disappointing evening,
haven't we, Rebecca?

804
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,458
Um…

805
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:56,791
When are you coming back?

806
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:58,458
I don't know.

807
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,750
Will it be long?

808
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:01,833
I'm not sure.

809
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,125
But you'll be fine, won't you?

810
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,583
What do you mean?

811
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,083
I mean…

812
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,500
if you're gonna flirt with him
right in front of me,

813
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,125
- why would I stay for that?
- [zips up bag abruptly]

814
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:23,250
If you're hungry while I'm gone,
see if Owen can find something

815
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,933
to stuff into your mouth,
since you're okay with that, apparently.

816
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:28,083
Have you gone mad?

817
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:30,226
- What are you talking...
- I'm talking about that man

818
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,333
who you opened wide for not two hours ago.

819
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:33,500
Mad!

820
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,708
You wanted people to take you seriously.

821
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:41,083
You said you took this job
'cause you didn't want old men

822
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:44,166
looking up your skirt or down your blouse,
but age 'em down and dumb 'em up,

823
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,250
and you just open up
when you're told, is that it?

824
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,250
Do you have any idea what you look like?

825
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:51,875
He... he just…

826
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,208
- He... he asked me to taste his batter.
- God, fuck!

827
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,583
[groans]

828
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,375
You're naive when you want to be.

829
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,208
That's good to know.

830
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:09,083
It's good to know that when a man asks you
to put something in your mouth,

831
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,500
he doesn't have to ask twice.

832
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,625
He... he… He didn't. You misunderstand.

833
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:15,708
You'll be fine.

834
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,875
[door slams]

835
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:26,791
[indistinct conversations in distance]

836
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:29,355
- [Hannah] I'll let you know.
- [Owen] Hannah, don't insult me.

837
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:32,333
- [Hannah] It was only in my mouth.
- [Owen chuckles]

838
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,916
[phone ringing]

839
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:42,416
Hello?

840
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,750
Peter?

841
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,166
[line hangs up]

842
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,708
Attention, please!

843
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,833
[Dani] Flora!

844
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,333
[Miles] Welcome to story time.

845
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,250
How are you feeling?

846
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,958
Oh, my God, you've gone into the makeup.

847
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,750
It's story time.

848
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:08,041
- Oh, God, story time.
- Oh, good, story time.

849
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,333
[Miles] Come along.

850
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:14,833
Like it never happened.

851
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,750
They bounce back fast, these two.

852
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,291
They've had to.

853
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:21,375
That's right, it's your first story time.

854
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:23,125
- Yeah.
- They do this a lot.

855
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,541
- Oh! Uh…
- [Hannah] Yeah.

856
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,185
- Let's get this over with.
- …exciting.

857
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,916
[Owen]
Uh… Story time is a Flora special.

858
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,760
- [Dani] Mm-hm.
- It's like therapy for them.

859
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,250
Means she's processed
whatever she's been chewing on.

860
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,500
- Right.
- [Flora] Attention.

861
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:37,708
Welcome to story time.

862
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,000
Go, Flora!

863
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,958
That's not my name.

864
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:42,916
That's not her name.

865
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,541
[Flora] My name is Tales.

866
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:46,000
And what are you, Tales?

867
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,125
I'm a cat, of course.

868
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,750
A cat named Tales.

869
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,375
I've seen it all.

870
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:55,333
As a kitten, I fell off an apple cart
and had nowhere to live.

871
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,291
I wandered and mewed,

872
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:03,583
and always followed the smell of apples
because maybe that meant I'd find my mum.

873
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,916
My mum was an apple cat.

874
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,583
[Miles] And what did you do?

875
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,541
I found a giant jumper in the forest

876
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,791
and pulled on the yarn.

877
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:14,541
And pulled it all out.

878
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,958
It took oh so long.

879
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,458
Yarn of a tale.

880
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:19,583
[adults chuckling]

881
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:20,875
A tale of a yarn.

882
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,416
But once it was done,

883
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,875
it was so nice and warm.

884
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:27,000
I wrapped myself tight.

885
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:29,666
It was warm, it was right.

886
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,291
In fact, don't react,

887
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,875
like my strange little friend did.

888
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,375
Because, once it was done,

889
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,000
it was purr-fectly splendid.

890
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,958
Yay!

891
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,791
And what is your name?

892
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,500
I'm Poppet…

893
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:48,583
the puppet.

894
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,875
And what are you, puppet?

895
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,666
A puppet named Poppet.

896
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,583
My maker was Claude.

897
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,958
He made puppets aplenty.

898
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,916
He loved them so much… [chuckles]

899
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,541
…even though he had 20.

900
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,083
One was too silly,

901
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,000
and one was too stupid.

902
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,041
One laughed too much,

903
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:12,916
and the other…

904
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
…too little.

905
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,333
Claude went away…

906
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,291
on a journey one day,

907
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,791
and left the puppets at home.

908
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,750
And as time went on…

909
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,083
…soon…

910
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:35,500
- they forgot they had strings.
- [ominous music building quietly]

911
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:36,583
And later…

912
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:39,625
they forgot they were even puppets at all.

913
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,083
And then…

914
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,791
[ominous music intensifying]

915
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,041
…Claude came back…

916
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,250
…so excited.

917
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,875
But they had forgotten him, you see.

918
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,375
And their strings.

919
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,958
They laughed when he said he'd made them.

920
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,583
They laughed at him.

921
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,750
And he was…

922
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,333
so sad.

923
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,458
But they <i>kept </i>laughing.

924
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,250
[yells] These stupid puppets!

925
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,208
These stupid puppets

926
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:17,416
who had forgotten!

927
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,250
So, he pulled on their strings.

928
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:24,875
And it hurt.

929
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,541
[phone ringing]

930
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,083
Thank Christ, Peter Quint to the rescue.
[clears throat]

931
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,125
[phone ringing]

932
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,750
Sorry, Pete. Bad news, but she's dead.

933
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:47,666
Oh, God.

934
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:48,958
Uh…

935
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,291
Yeah, no. Yeah, he is. Just…

936
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,458
Just one… one moment.

937
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,208
I-It's your neighbor,

938
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:57,833
Mr. McQueeny.

939
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:03,250
Look, I am so sorry, Owen.

940
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,541
I'm so sorry.

941
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,250
[whispering indistinctly]

942
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:35,750
[Owen sniffles]

943
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:53,625
[engine turns over]

944
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,750
I'm going to light a candle.

945
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,166
[footsteps receding]

946
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,166
[Dani clears throat]

947
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,166
I'm so glad…

948
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:22,791
you stayed.

949
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,166
I am too.

950
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,666
[melancholy orchestral music playing]

951
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:00,333
Who the hell knew?

952
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:05,250
[door closes]

953
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:06,416
[engine turns over]

954
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,750
[echoing breaths]

955
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,750
[frightening orchestral swell]

956
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:46,166
[distorted sob]

957
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,208
- [abrupt scraping sound]
- [Dani screams]

958
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:52,250
[scream echoes and fades]

959
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,833
[closing music playing]
