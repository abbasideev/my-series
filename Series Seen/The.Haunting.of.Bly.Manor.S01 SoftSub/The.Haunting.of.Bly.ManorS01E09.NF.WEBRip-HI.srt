Shh.

For a lot of things, actually.

My favorite…

232
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,541
was when he taught me how to sew patches
onto the knees of my trousers.

233
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,375
Daddy knew how to sew?

234

Yes, I do.

A lot of them.

242
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,750

It's so quiet, it's so quiet, but…

262
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,875
she's in here.

263
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,791
And this…

it isn't…

269
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,958

rage.

271

277

280

This angry, empty, lonely beast.

It's just out of sight…

285
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,166
but I can feel it.

286
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,333
I know it's there.

287
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
And it's waiting.

[ominous music plays softly]

289
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,416

Do you want company?

294
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,500
While you wait
for your beast in the jungle?

[Dani sniffles]

296

Uh, America, I think.

Well…

303
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,541
I can do that.

304
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,708
I think that's where we're, uh…
where we're gonna go.

305
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,416
First, for a little while, at least.

306
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,041
Then where?

307
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,625
Well, uh…
that's the thing about adventures,

you're not meant to know.

309

- [all chuckle]

310

It's you.

314
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,500
Thank you, Flora.

Well, uh, good show, boss.

- Yeah.
- Be safe.

Oh, well…

I suppose I…

320

I don't know how I will ever thank you.

322
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,208
I'm so glad.

323
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,166
You have each other now.

324
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,541
I know. [chuckles]

325
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,958
It is right.

326
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,458
I…

327
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
Well, I'm just so goddamned lucky,
aren't I?

328
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,208
And so are you, Miss Clayton.

329
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,083
Where would we be, we wretched people…

330
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,500
without the generosity of our betters?

331
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,125
And luck.

You all right, Poppins?

334

Yeah.

[engine turns over]

336
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,500
[Jamie] If we keep driving north,
it looks pretty rural.

337
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,708
There's lots of green.

338
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,500
Maybe in a few weeks
we could take the train.

339
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,208
Get to Vermont around Christmas.

340
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,750
[Dani] Mm.

341
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,375
Snow could be nice.

342
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,291
You'll laugh, but, uh…

343
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,416
part of me's wanted to go since I saw
<i>White Christmas</i> when I was a kid.

[chuckles]

345
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,750
- Doesn't have to be Vermont.
- No, it's not that.

346
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,625
Snow sounds nice.

347
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,208
I just…

348
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,166
I don't think we should plan,
you know, Christmas.

349
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,375
It's a ways away.

350
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,458
One day at a time.

351
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,625
Yeah, no, I know. I'm-I'm sorry, I'm just…

352
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,166
- Just being...
- Realistic?

353
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,750
It's all right.

354
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,083
One day at a time is fine by me.

355
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,791
As long as those days
are with you, Poppins.

356
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,291
One day at a time is what we've got.

00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,458
Is that a moonflower?

367
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,041
Yeah.

368
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,458
They're really rare, you know?

369
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,333
I've got a problem.

370
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,625
Or rather, we've got a problem, Poppins.

371
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,250
Oh, no.

372
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,458
You see…

373
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,458
I'm not sick of you.

374
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,125
At all.

375
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,875
I'm actually pretty in love with you,
it turns out.

376
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,333
[kiss]

377
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:00,750
[Jamie] Mmm.

378
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,333

<i>And there was peace.</i>

387

- No.</i>

- No.</i>

[Jamie sighs in frustration]

397
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:19,625
How many years in this kitchen?
My cooking is still shite.

398
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,250
- What happened there, then?
- Found it on the street.

399
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,375
Wanted to save it.

400
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,291
Give it here, then.

401
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,250
Want me to keep stirring?

402
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,958
Yeah, see if you can salvage it.

403
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,583
What is going on here?

404
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:56,416
Well, there's your problem.
Your roots have been…

405
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,125
- Dani, why is there a...
- Here's the thing.

406
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,708
You're my best friend.

407
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,416
And I love my life.

408
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,125
And I don't know
how much time we have left,

409
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,708
but however much it is,

410
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,166
I wanna spend it with you.

411
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,916
And I know
we can't technically get married,

412
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,666
but I also don't really care.

413
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,750
We can wear the rings, and we'll know.

414
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,708
Okay? And…

415
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,083
that's enough for me.

416
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,583
If it's enough for you.

417
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:41,375
I reckon that's enough for me, yeah.
[laughs]

418
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,833
[kissing]

419
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,458
[Jamie sniffles]

420
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,250
- I love you.
- [Dani] I love you, too.

421
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,333
[laughs]

422
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:10,708

[cork pops]

426
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:21,500
[Owen] This is the best news.
I'm so happy for you both.

427
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,458
- Cheers, mate.
- Thank you.

428
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,958
Owen, this place is so beautiful.

429
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,208
Thank you.

430
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,291
Yeah, I'm, uh…

431
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,208
I'm happy with it.

432
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,250
We have a lot of regulars now,
which is nice.

433
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,958
They'll come in,
and I'll have their order ready.

434
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,750
There's something in knowing you, uh…

435
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,635
you made a place
people like to come back to.

436
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:41,750
- Yeah.
- Nice.

437
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:42,750
[Owen] Yeah.

438
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,666
And no one's, uh, lodged
any complaints about the name?

439
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,416
- Okay.
- [Jamie laughs]

440
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,166
Okay, it does get the occasional eye roll.

441
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,916
But I'll never forget

442
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,333
how badly it annoyed her
until she finally had to laugh,

443
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,500
and nothing was better
than that woman's laugh.

444
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:01,541
Yeah.

445
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:03,916
To Hannah.

446
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,458
To Hannah.

447
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,416
Hannah.

448
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,458
[Owen] Mm.

449
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,750
- [Dani] Mm.
- You heard from Henry recently?

450
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,541
- Uh, I check in every now and again.
<i>- Merci.</i>

451
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:20,083
We haven't spoken to the kids
in ages, though.

452
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,625
- [ominous rumble]
- But, hey, they are growing up

453
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,291
and getting out into the world.

454
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,791
What kid wants to chat
to a couple of old people, eh?

455
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,184
- [melancholy music]
- You all right?

456
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,500
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

457
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:35,041
I, uh, try to go when I can, you know.

458
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:39,500
Actually, uh, they all came here
a few months back, on holiday.

459
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,458
Back across the pond on an adventure.

460
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,750
Henry, Miles, Flora.

461
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,541
Flora's boyfriend.

462
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,500
Flora's got a boyfriend?

463
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,041
She's 12.

464
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,125
[Owen] She's 17.

465
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,166
- Yeah.
- Christ.

466
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,583
And fully smitten.

467
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,958
Henry is terrified.

468
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:00,291
Thank God he's sober now,
or he'd drink himself into a grave.

469
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,833
So, they're all happy?

470
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,041
Yeah.

471
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,833
[Dani] Mm.

472
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,791
It's interesting, though.
The way they talk about Bly.

473
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,625
You talked about what happened?

474
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,708
No. I mean, that's what's interesting.

475
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,083
They don't remember anything about it.

476
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,166
What?

477
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,333
Nothing?

478
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,875
No. Well, just the kids. Henry still…

479
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,541
remembers all of it.

480
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,958
But I mentioned Hannah,

481
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,583
and Flora asked me
who I was talking about.

482
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,625
- It's been this way a while, turns out.
- [Dani] So…

483
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:41,083
Well, if they don't remember Hannah,
they don't remember…

484
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,375
So, they've just forgotten it all?

485
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:47,541
They know they used to stay at Bly
when they were children.

486
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,000
Said they recognized Hannah's picture,

487
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,625
but only as the woman
that used to stay there with them.

488
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,333
The details, the specific moments, the…

489
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,208
the fear of it all

490
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,166
that we were so afraid would infect
the rest of their lives has just…

491
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,791
faded away.

492
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,416
And all that's left is the shape of it.

493
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,500
Bly was their summer home.

494
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,166
They used to live there
when they were children.

495
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,458
Do you think Henry will…

496
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
tell them?

497
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,541
Would you?

498
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,541
I mean, by the signs of it,
they're thriving.

499
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,625
I'd say…

500
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,583
just let them be.

501
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,375
Let them live their lives
the way they should.

502
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,208
Without anything hanging over them.

503
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,083
They deserve that.

504
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:38,833
We all do.

505
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,208
[water running]

506
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,583
Are we gonna talk?

507
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,458
I'll take that as a "no."

508
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,458
[ominous crescendo]

509
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,166
- [dish crashes]
- Jesus!

510
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,666
What's going on?

511
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,750
- Are you okay?
- [breathing shakily]

512
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,458
What happened?

513
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,208
I saw… I saw her.

514
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,333
She's there.

515
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
What did you see?

516
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,625
Her.

517
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,666
[gasps]

518
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,000
[whispering] I keep seeing her.

519
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:28,625
Okay.

520
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,916
- Right.
- [faucet squeaks off]

521
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,666
[water gurgling]

522
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,041
Okay.

523
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,416
- It's gone.
- It's gone?

524
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,291
- Is it?
- It's okay.

525
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,250
We're gonna be okay.

526
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,041
- You can't think the worst.
- Jamie.

527
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,916
- We don't know what this means. We…
- Jamie.

528
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,083
We can have so many more years together.

529
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:49,833
Dani.

530
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,916
We can have so many more years.

531
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,458
We'll keep an eye on it,
and it'll be fine.

532
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,125
[panting]

533
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,208
Okay?

534
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,625
It's gonna be okay.

535
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,125
It's gonna be okay.

536
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,666
I'll do the washing up from now on.

537
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,583
Yeah?

538
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,250
You're shit at it, anyway.

539
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,333
[Dani chuckles]

540
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,291
- [sniffles]
- [chuckles]

541
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,500
Oh, baby, come here.

542
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,125
[kiss]

543
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,208
It's okay.

544
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,083
It's okay.

545
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,291
It's gonna be okay.

546
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,208
Well, the queue was shite,
but I've got it.

547
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,416
Our union is officially civil.

548
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,250
We'll marry again when we can.

549
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,750
- [water gurgling]
- It looks like that's enough for now.

550
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Dani.

551
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,083
Dani?

552
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,166
[ominous music playing]

553
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,875
- [faucet squeaks off]
- Dani. Dani.

554
00:32:58,958 --> 00:32:59,791
[gasps shakily]

555
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:00,791
Dani.

556
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,333
It's okay. It's okay.

557
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,291
It's okay.

558
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,125
Okay.

559
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,291
[whispers] Do you see her?

560
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,500
I only see you.

561
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,458
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:21,500
- All the water, I didn't realize.
- It's okay. It's okay.

563
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,250
Water is easy to clean up.

564
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,333
[sniffles]

565
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,958
I'm so tired, Jamie.

566
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:32,791
I know.

567
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:36,916
I know.

568
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,583
It's like every day
I feel myself fading away,

569
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,250
but I'm still here, and…

570
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,375
Hey.

571
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,666
- I don't really understand how that is.
- You're still here.

572
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:50,875
You're here.

573
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,833
It's like I see you right in front of me…

574
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,291
and I feel you touching me…

575
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,708
and every day…

576
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,416
- [melancholy music playing]
- …we're living our lives,

577
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,583
and I'm aware of that…

578
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,916
and it's like I don't feel it all the way.

579
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:15,333
I'm not even scared of her anymore.

580
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,875
I just stare at her, and…

581
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:26,458
it's getting harder and harder to see me.

582
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:33,083
Maybe I should just accept that.

583
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:38,041
- No… No, no.
- Maybe I should just accept that and go.

584
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:39,708
No.

585
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,166
Not yet.

586
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,791
- Jamie…
- Look, it's fine.

587
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,625
If you can't feel anything…

588
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,541
then I'll feel everything
for the both of us.

589
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,875
But no one is going anywhere.

590
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,041
Okay?

591
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,791
You're still here.

592
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:06,708
[sobs softly]

593
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,875
What if…

594
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:11,958
[sobbing]

595
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,333
…I'm here sitting next to you…

596
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,500
but I'm just really her?

597
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,791
One day at a time.

598
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,416
[rain pattering]

599
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,166
[ominous music slowly building]

600
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,083
[water gurgling]

601
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:50,208
[music intensifying]

602
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,541
[fades to silence]

603
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,125
[melancholy music playing]

604
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:58,666
[breathing rapidly]

605
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,791
[storyteller]
<i>The au pair knew the moment had come.</i>

606
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:37,541
<i>The beast had lurked indeed,
and the beast, at its hour, had sprung.</i>

607
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,666
<i>And she could not risk
the most important thing,</i>

608
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,750
<i>her most important person.</i>

609
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,125
- [sniffles]
<i>- Not for one more day.</i>

610
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:58,333
<i>And so, the gardener found herself
back at Bly Manor one last time.</i>

611
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:00,833
[birds chirping]

612
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,625
[music building emotionally]

613
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
[sighs heavily]

614
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
[inhales sharply]

615
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,833
[water splashing]

616
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,458
[storyteller] <i>The gardener said the words
she'd heard those years ago.</i>

617
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,458
<i>- She willed it with everything she had.
- </i>[muffled screams]

618
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,500
<i>You, me, us.</i>

619
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,125
<i>Us.</i>

620
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,625
<i>"Take me with you,"
she cried in her heart.</i>

621
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,250
<i>"Take me.
Drag me down like you did the others."</i>

622
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,125
<i>But the lady in the lake
was different now.</i>

623
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,708
[muffled screams]

624
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,541
<i>The lady in the lake was also Dani.</i>

625
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,375
<i>And Dani wouldn't.</i>

626
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,416
<i>Dani would never.</i>

627
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,958
<i>In fact, no one would ever be taken again.</i>

628
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,833
<i>And no one has been taken to this day.</i>

629
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,916
[gasps, screams]

630
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,500
[whimpering]

631
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,791
[panting]

632
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:28,791
[storyteller] <i>For the rest of her days,
the gardener would gaze into reflections,</i>

633
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,708
<i>hoping to see her face.</i>

634
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,125
<i>Her own lady in the lake.</i>

635
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,875
<i>She'd leave her door open at night,
just a crack,</i>

636
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,791
<i>should she ever come back.</i>

637
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,791
<i>Waiting for her lover to return.</i>

638
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,958
[Jamie sighs heavily]

639
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,916
[storyteller] Years would go by,

640
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and as she slept underneath the water,

641
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,583
the au pair's memories would fade.

642
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:57,791
Like Viola before her, like the children,
she, too, would forget her past.

643
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,000
She would know nothing of the gardener,
nothing of their life together.

644
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,291
[fire crackling]

645
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:08,958
The details,
the specific moments would all fade away.

646
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,791
More time will pass, and…

647
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:15,250
the water will wash away
the delicate features of her.

648
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,625
Of her beautiful, perfect face.

649
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,666
But she won't be hollow, nor empty.

650
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,791
And she won't pull others to her fate.

651
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,958
She will merely walk the grounds of Bly,

652
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,750
harmless as a dove,

653
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,791
for all of her days.

654
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,125
Leaving the only trace of who she once was

655
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:40,166
in the memory
of the woman who loved her most.

656
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,083
I'm sorry. [chuckles softly]

657
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:47,708
I told you,

658
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,458
the story wasn't exactly short.

659
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,666
[guests chuckle]

660
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,791
My God.

661
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,166
So, is it true?

662
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,250
Which part?

663
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,666
[guest] I mean…

664
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,833
if I were to fly to England,
and I were to visit Bly Manor,

665
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,208
I may…

666
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:10,041
get a peek of this lady in the lake?

667
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:11,625
No.

668
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,625
I expect if you were to fly to England,

669
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,250
you would find no such place by that name.

670
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,041
If you were to find the manor, though,

671
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,291
perhaps you'd see her.

672
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:27,125
Though, no way to know
when she's awake or asleep.

673
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,250
Christ, is that the time?

674
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,208
Big day tomorrow.

675
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,791
Best get some rest.

676
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:38,958
Hm.

677
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,791
[groom] All right. Shall we?

678
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,125
I think I'll stay here a moment.

679
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:57,958
[groom] You okay?

680
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,083
[bride] I'm perfect.

681
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:01,291
Just enjoying the fire.

682
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,000
- All right. I love you.
- I love you so.

683
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,360
- Good night.
- [groom] Good night.

684
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,791
[bride] He's the silliest.

685
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,625
But, damn, if I don't love him the most.

686
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,583
That's how it should be.

687
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,083
I liked your story.

688
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,750
I'm glad.

689
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,000
But I think you set it up wrong,
in the beginning.

690
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,666
Is that so?

691
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,250
Yeah.

692
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,708
You said it was a ghost story.

693
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,708
- It isn't.
- No?

694
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:34,916
It's a love story.

695
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,625
Same thing, really.

696
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:45,916
Well, if you go on to retell it,
make that change up top for me.

697
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,708
Something on your mind?

698
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,541
No.

699
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,750
[chuckles] Not really.

700
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,333
I just keep thinking…

701
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:04,625
about that silly, gorgeous,
insane man I'm marrying tomorrow.

702
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,166
I love him.

703
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,500
More than I ever thought
I could love anybody.

704
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:12,833
And the crazy thing is
he loves me the same exact amount.

705
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,458
We got lucky.

706
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:21,708
Sometimes when I'm sitting next to him,
in that easy silence…

707
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:26,000
[crying]
…you only get with your forever person,

708
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,875
who loves you as much as you love them,

709
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:31,041
I start getting really, really terrified…

710
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:33,291
that he's gonna…

711
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,958
before I do,
and then what am I supposed to do?

712
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,500
How am I supposed
to just live a life that he's not in?

713
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:44,791
[sighs] Sorry.

714
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,000
I don't know what's happening.

715
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,041
[sniffles] I'm a mess. [laughs]

716
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,958
No, you're not.

717
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,333
I cry all the time, for no good reason.

718
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:59,708
You shouldn't be thinking
of losing each other at all.

719
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,166
Don't let that hang over
your happiness right now.

720
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,083
Enjoy that easy silence with him.

721
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,041
It is rare, what you've got.

722
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,583
But, when the time does come,

723
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,875
years and years from now, mind you…

724
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:17,958
[bride chuckles]

725
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,416
…it will be hard every day,
and it won't get easier.

726
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
But…

727
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:26,250
[sighs] …eventually, after some time,

728
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,708
you'll find little moments,
little pieces of your life

729
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,583
that remind you of him.

730
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,166
And they'll be silly and dumb,

731
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,416
or they'll be sad,
and you'll cry for hours.

732
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:41,500
But they'll still be a piece of him.

733
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,125
And you'll hold them tight.

734
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,416
It'll be like he's here,

735
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:49,166
with you.

736
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,750
Even though he's gone.

737
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,541
Now, you have a big day tomorrow.

738
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:02,916
A happy day with your silly,
gorgeous, insane man.

739
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,083
- [sniffles]
- You should sleep.

740
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,458
Thank you.

741
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,208
I feel like I should hug you.

742
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,125
That's all right.

743
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:25,375
You know…

744
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,041
it's funny.

745
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,208
I thought you might be making it up
just off that name.

746
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,291
That name?

747
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,666
But, then, I figured,
"How could you know that?"

748
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,875
It's a funny coincidence, I suppose.

749
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,000
My middle name is Flora.

750
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:45,583
Is that right?

751
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,625
Huh.

752
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,208
Good night.

753
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:51,291
Good night.

754
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,750

755
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:00,750
