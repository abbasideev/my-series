1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,935
Previously on "You"...

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:03,969
Everyone just calls me Beck.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,671
And you are Joe?

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,006
Goldberg.

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,974
A guy needs to protect himself,

6
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,477
and your name was
a glorious place to start.

7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,746
The next thing our little
friend the Internet gave me

8
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,048
was your address.

9
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,450
Professor Leahy.

10
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,419
Professor Obvious
wants to sleep with you.

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,287
Your friends are disloyal,

12
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,256
and that Peach is the queen bee.

13
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,859
How broke are you?

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,095
Benjamin J. Ashby, Greenwich
born, boarding school bred.

15
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,565
God, you make me insane.

16
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,902
Oh!

17
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,204
I think I know you.

18
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,640
Oh, right. Of course.

19
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,177
You're smart, except in
the ways you are really not,

20
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,212
like not locking your phone.

21
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,647
Maybe we could get
a drink sometime.

22
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,249
Sure.

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,884
What you really need is
someone to save you.

24
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,086
Man, I'm thinking maybe--

25
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,954
Whatever you think I did...

26
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,156
I can help, Beck.

27
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,290
...you got the wrong guy.

28
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,294
Let me help you.

29
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,963
Tonight's the night, Beck.

30
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,099
Our first date.

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,603
It just feels right, right?

32
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,342
I'm looking forward to it,
and I think,

33
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,478
obvious hangover aside,
you are, too.

34
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,214
But I've read people wrong
in the past.

35
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,350
One day, I'll tell you
about Candace,

36
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,853
every red flag I was blind to,

37
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,122
how destroyed I was.

38
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,824
What can I say?
We all have baggage.

39
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,227
But I feel like I'm dealing
with it the right way.

40
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,597
Not bothering you,
just checking it.

41
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,304
Hanging with you like this is
admittedly honing skills

42
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:50,176
I never knew I'd need,
but hey, handy.

43
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,515
You can't afford new clothes,
but let's be real.

44
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,152
You'd look perfect
in a potato sack.

45
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,923
Not a criticism,
God knows I am, too,

46
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,426
but you seem distracted.

47
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,797
Of course, a new phone.

48
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,166
Not sure how you went
24 hours without one.

49
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,902
As you activate
your new friend there,

50
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,038
I know you think you're also
deactivating your old one.

51
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,807
But here's where you're wrong.

52
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,442
Your old phone, which I have,

53
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,845
is still logged into the cloud.

54
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,385
And that means
I'm still logged into you.

55
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,554
Sci-fi movies are so wrong.

56
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,456
Technology is our friend.

57
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,591
You've reached Benji.
Leave some love. Namaste.

58
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,426
Hey, look,
you haven't texted back.

59
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,363
Just let me know
you're okay, okay?

60
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,168
That's all I ask.
This is really annoying, Benji.

61
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,672
It is annoying.

62
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,941
You're not thinking about us,
you're thinking about him.

63
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,444
I kind of thought I took care
of that for you, Beck.

64
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,513
Want to start off the class
this morning?

65
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,015
- Sure.
- Good.

66
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,683
My last T.A. was like
a little mouse,

67
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,218
- afraid of public speaking.
- Oh, that's my job.

68
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,786
Well, lucky us,
you're good at it.

69
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,855
We're still on for tomorrow,
drinks, poetry?

70
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,192
Nothing if not up
for both of those.

71
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,735
Hey, they came for the big day.

72
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,604
Want me move them down
to the basement?

73
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,539
No, I'll do that. Just get
started on the window display.

74
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,542
Oh, hey, I was thinking about
making cookies for #ReleaseDay.

75
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,978
Amanda Chantal Bacon has a dope
recipe in "Moon Juice Cookbook:

76
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,147
Cook Cosmically for Body,
Beauty, and Consciousness".

77
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,682
Kill me.

78
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,617
Sounds great, Ethan.

79
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,117
Oh, and that kid is back.

80
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,821
Paco?

81
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,893
Hey, speed reader.

82
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,961
Hi, Joe.

83
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,596
What are you reading?

84
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,064
This book about werewolves
the girls in my class

85
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,565
won't stop talking about.

86
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,869
It's more about love stuff
than werewolf stuff.

87
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,372
There should be right up here...

88
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,710
Yeah, it's right here.
Here, try this.

89
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,346
"Frankenstein"?

90
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,648
Yeah, the monster is
really cool and scary

91
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,184
but also not really the monster.

92
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,186
What does that mean?

93
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,687
Just read it. You can tell me.

94
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,992
Ethan's got snacks. Set 'em up.

95
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,911
Let me the hell outta here!

96
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,213
Now!

97
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,981
Settle down, Benji.

98
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,017
Let's talk.

99
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,192
Okay, granted I didn't think
too far ahead

100
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,927
when I swung that mallet.

101
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,830
I just knew Benji was
the worst kind of poison,

102
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,033
the kind you know is bad
but can't stop taking.

103
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,568
So I did what I had to do
to help you, Beck.

104
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,038
And now, there's
an adult human male

105
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,472
in the basement
of this bookstore.

106
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,740
Somebody!

107
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,941
The basement's soundproof.

108
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,443
Aah!

109
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,378
The owner loved to
read in peace down here.

110
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,314
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,682
I told you,
I don't know who you are,

112
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,084
I don't know why I'm here.
I swear.

113
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,920
Confession, I have no idea
what to do with him now.

114
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,089
I'm gonna give you
my family lawyer's number.

115
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,557
He'll get you paid.

116
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,259
Of course he thinks
I want money.

117
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,960
You know who my father is?

118
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,963
Benjamin Ashby II,
hedge fund manager.

119
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,333
We have a jet. We'll send
you anywhere in the world.

120
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,903
Best case, that's somewhere
far away from you, Beck.

121
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,473
Worst case,
that ends with prison time.

122
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,043
Not an option.

123
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,513
It's a poppy seed bagel,
extra schmear.

124
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,149
Go to hell.

125
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,485
I don't eat gluten.

126
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,021
It's an allergy, okay?
That shit is real.

127
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,024
Gluten, dairy, if I ate
a peanut, I could die.

128
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,960
Well, gosh,
whatever can I get you?

129
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,930
I'd just like a bare burger
wrapped in chard.

130
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,698
Or I could do sushi.

131
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,866
Sushi?

132
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,371
My diet is limited. Please?

133
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,806
Whoever you are,
you're not a killer.

134
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,475
Oh, how I wish I was.

135
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,577
This would be
much less complicated.

136
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,645
Let me out of here.

137
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,849
I won't say anything to anyone.

138
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,284
He doesn't even know my name.
I can figure this out.

139
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,520
I'm claustrophobic.

140
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,557
My blood sugar's low.

141
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,128
Is this sugar?

142
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,131
I found it in your wallet along
with three bars of Xanax,

143
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,867
Adderall, half a sheet of,
I think, acid, is it?

144
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,468
Whatever. It's not even for me.

145
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,569
I network. I own a business.

146
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,037
That's right, Home Soda.

147
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,273
It's artisanal.
It's gonna blow up.

148
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,541
Is it?

149
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,043
Do your investors know
you do heroin?

150
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,280
Or your--your father?
How about your girlfriend?

151
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,584
I don't have a girlfriend.

152
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,455
Oh, shit!

153
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,159
That's where I know you from.

154
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,462
You were in the cab!

155
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,863
Beck's cab!

156
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,298
She--she said your name.

157
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,534
It's Jimmy. No.

158
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,336
This is Joe.
He literally saved my life.

159
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,671
It's Joe!

160
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,174
Now, that's a complication.

161
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,243
Do not tell me that you're
doing this because of Beck.

162
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,511
She's not my girlfriend.

163
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,913
You can have her!

164
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,047
Take her!

165
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,449
Careful, Benji.

166
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,950
Not winning any points.

167
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,984
If you knew her,

168
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,320
you would not be
putting me in a cage

169
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,292
and ruining your life over
Guinevere Goddamn Beck!

170
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,495
If you want out,

171
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,231
you'll do what I want.

172
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,171
The days of being with a man
who doesn't value you,

173
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,673
those are over.

174
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,477
If we can get over
the first date hump.

175
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,379
Can't help it,
worried about Benji.

176
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,114
That's why it's so crucial
Benji's out of your picture.

177
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,016
Please, he's off
getting shit-faced.

178
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,985
Or he's in some kind of trouble.

179
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,521
What we have right now is
just a little spark.

180
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,423
Every choice is a message.

181
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,260
With Candace, I always felt
like I was pushing.

182
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,363
But now I realize,
can't force it,

183
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,332
the timing, the spark.

184
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,034
So you tell me if
you're too distracted, Beck.

185
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,737
You decide.

186
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,774
Sure. Looking forward.
Free at six.

187
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,293
So it was just one of those
cheesy diaries with a lock,

188
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,161
but I couldn't stop writing.

189
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,899
I just--I felt better having it
all down on paper, you know?

190
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,067
And then I did this little
creative writing assignment

191
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,969
and it just blew
my teacher's mind.

192
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,472
She acted like it was the best
thing she'd...

193
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,108
Honestly, part of me thought
this date would never come,

194
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,810
and now it feels so easy,
so right.

195
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,347
This is how our story goes,
Beck.

196
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,650
And here I am.

197
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,253
Sometimes you just,
you do things on instinct

198
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,790
because you have to, and
then you scramble, you know.

199
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,694
Yeah, I kinda know.

200
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,963
I totally didn't Google
you, but if I did,

201
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,666
I might discover you
aren't on social media.

202
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,303
Fact, it renders you insanely
vulnerable with zero upside.

203
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,837
I'm an old-fashioned guy.

204
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,839
I like real life.

205
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,308
What about your job?

206
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,676
Bookstore manager or--

207
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,811
or international
super spy, which is--

208
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,848
I mean, is that your goal or--

209
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,251
I know I'm in a city
full of people

210
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,054
with--with--with big, fat
neon sign aspirations.

211
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,025
And I know it's not cool to say
and it's not big and flashy...

212
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,463
but I love books,

213
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:03,234
and I want my life to be about
what I actually love.

214
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,138
Yeah, I get that.

215
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,112
Sorry, just a second, okay?

216
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,414
Yeah, go ahead.

217
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,517
Hey.

218
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,520
Yeah, I know it's serious,
Peach.

219
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,922
I'm the one who told you
I was worried.

220
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,226
Okay. Yes, I'm coming.

221
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,298
I'm sorry, I have to go.

222
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,368
This friend, he just--apparently
he had to go meet someone

223
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,069
and never came back.

224
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,371
It's worrying.

225
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,872
We can pick it up some other
time if you have to.

226
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,074
All right, thank you.

227
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,043
I hope your friend is okay.

228
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,711
I thought I'd done it,

229
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,847
gotten Benji out of our way.

230
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,083
Looks like I have to
finish the job.

231
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,188
To figure out what to do
with the poster boy

232
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,090
for white male privilege
in the cage,

233
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,359
I need to understand
who he truly is.

234
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,696
And to do that, I need to know
what he cares about.

235
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,164
This is totally unfair.

236
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,666
If I knew you were
gonna quiz me,

237
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,401
I'd have put more recent
books on the list.

238
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,903
So bottom line, you've never
even read "On the Road".

239
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,538
It's very possible to
read a book

240
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,441
without having to read it
in the traditional manner.

241
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,575
You can read about a book.

242
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,780
Yeah, I get it.

243
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,014
You're a fraud.

244
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,949
Here, give me the stupid book.

245
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,052
I'll read it right now,
you sadistic prick.

246
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,188
Anything to get me out of here.

247
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,357
I do understand something
about you now, Beck.

248
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,894
You somehow think this guy
is all you deserve.

249
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,629
You're looking a little gray
and mealy in there.

250
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,031
Yeah, no shit.
You stole my stash!

251
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,600
I thought it wasn't for you.

252
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,769
Fine.

253
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,006
You happy? It's mine.
I'm a chipper.

254
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,142
I never do it more than
three days in a row.

255
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,510
And I'm quitting.

256
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,915
Okay, only if you're quitting.

257
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,991
Doesn't work that way.

258
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,296
It's only one way.

259
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,900
Thank you. Thank you.

260
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,874
Just one more thing.

261
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,477
Password.

262
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,452
Leanna.

263
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,221
L-E-A-N-N-A.

264
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,457
His phone lock is
another girl's name, Beck.

265
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,328
Jesus Christ.

266
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,397
Oh, yeah.

267
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,906
Well, he's been living
a frankly off-brand life

268
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,841
for a guy who markets
health soda.

269
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,610
Based on the evidence,

270
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,078
he's not missing you
when you're gone.

271
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,515
You don't mean anything to him.

272
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,024
Say cheese.

273
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,592
I was worried.
I called his mother.

274
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,127
We were about to call
the police, and he's high

275
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,729
in some random shitburg
in Massachusetts

276
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,864
according to his geolocation.

277
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,433
Don't say geolocation.
You're not a stalker.

278
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,536
At least we know he's fine,
just being the worst.

279
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,173
So we're all gonna go try
that new bar tonight, right?

280
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,108
In SoHo.

281
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,775
You are such a lush.

282
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,710
Shit, I can't go. I'm sorry.

283
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,713
I'm supposed to have drinks
with my thesis adviser.

284
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,115
Oh.

285
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,851
Ugh, scale of one
to ten, how pervy?

286
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,519
He won an award
for a book of poems

287
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,056
that probably has 35 references
to, like, vagina lips.

288
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,125
Well, banging your professor
is like a grad school

289
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,560
- rite of passage.
- Is it?

290
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,461
Annika's like the Wikipedia
page for slut, so...

291
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,864
Whatever. I banged
my bio professor.

292
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,199
It was fine.

293
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
Notably, I passed the class.

294
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,402
You know, eyes on the prize.

295
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,803
Ovary up, girl.

296
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,239
Beck doesn't want to ovary up.

297
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,141
He controls my status as a T.A.

298
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,542
He could knock me
out of my housing.

299
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,245
Or you could not figure
it out and report him.

300
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,414
I think it only works
that way in the movies.

301
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,451
Whatever.
We're seeing you tomorrow.

302
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,119
My party.

303
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,890
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of my parents' divorce.

304
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,426
The party I always have
to distract myself.

305
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,063
Of course. Sorry. I'm coming.

306
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,370
One more line, man, come on.

307
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,874
Just tell me your plan
and I will help you.

308
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,642
Where is she right now?

309
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,711
She's partying her face off
with Lynn and Annika, right?

310
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,213
Actually, she's about
to meet her thesis adviser,

311
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,250
but glad to hear
you take her seriously.

312
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,921
See, this is
what I'm telling you.

313
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,891
You see this hardworking
writer chick.

314
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,626
How could you not?

315
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,728
She's branded the living shit
out of herself

316
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,962
across the Internet.

317
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,530
I want you to know,

318
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,165
if I wasn't about
to be late to see you,

319
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,101
I would beat this guy bloody

320
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,069
for the way he talks about you.

321
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,107
I'm telling you,
this is her thing.

322
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,143
Right now, she's got on
red lipstick

323
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,747
and she's getting ready to
work her professor hard

324
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,949
for that "A".

325
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,985
I'll see you later, Benji.

326
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,954
Hey, come back.

327
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,958
I'm hungry!

328
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,501
There's a directness.

329
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,903
That's what's special
about your work.

330
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,306
So if it's not direct
to the bone, cut it.

331
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,342
Thanks. That's really helpful.

332
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,478
And coming from you,
it means a lot.

333
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:51,049
A lot of people find
a direct woman irresistible.

334
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,952
You should lean into that
in your life as well.

335
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,088
Yeah, easier said than done.

336
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,891
Well, you can always
practice on me.

337
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,994
I'm safe.

338
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,564
You really have nothing
to be nervous about.

339
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,668
The world is your
bright red apple.

340
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,340
You think he writes these
lines in advance like a poem?

341
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,177
I wish I had your... confidence.

342
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:24,816
Putting your work out
into the world is a service.

343
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,517
I'll try and remember that.

344
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,486
I wouldn't tell you
if you weren't talented.

345
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,822
I'm happy to share
all my secrets.

346
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,494
So, Beck, maybe it's time to
acknowledge what there is here.

347
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,074
Don't touch me.
It's not sexy, it's repulsive.

348
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,679
Sorry, but this is--

349
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,080
You invited me to.

350
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,882
No, I didn't.

351
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,650
You flirt brazenly.

352
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,819
You wear clothes so sheer
I can see your nipples.

353
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,287
What do you call that?

354
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,756
- It's crazy.
- If you're gonna stay

355
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,493
on the safe side of the
plausible deniability zone,

356
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,828
cover your tits,

357
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,697
stop the blow-job eyes,

358
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,167
and write... better.

359
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,869
I like you,

360
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,570
but clearly you're overworked.

361
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:23,641
It's only right to release you
from the T.A. position.

362
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,742
No. No, please.

363
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,945
Get some rest.

364
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,547
You're right to be angry.

365
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,217
Some things can't
just be allowed to be.

366
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,188
Something has to be done
about someone like him.

367
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,670
Hello.

368
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,406
Hey, where are you?

369
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,442
I'm in the Village.

370
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,479
Maybe we can finish our talk.

371
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,683
Yeah, I'll be there in 15.

372
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,830
Are you staring at my lipstick?

373
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,098
No, no. No, I'm not.

374
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,532
I'm not.
No, it's just different.

375
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,936
No, I just--I wanted
to try something new,

376
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,205
but you're right,
it's not really me.

377
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,173
So why did you call me?

378
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,742
I don't know.
Spontaneous impulse.

379
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,778
That's okay. You'll learn
you can tell me anything.

380
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,279
We cut it short last time
because a friend of yours,

381
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,681
he was missing, right?

382
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,750
Oh, God, he's fine.
He's just an idiot.

383
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,886
Agree with you there,
but you want to keep it light.

384
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,421
I can do that.

385
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,491
Okay, this couple here
coming in the door,

386
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,793
what do you think, first date?

387
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,630
Third. She's not sure
she wants to seal the deal.

388
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,265
Hmm.

389
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,001
And those two.

390
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,870
Where?

391
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,138
Brink of divorce.

392
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,741
Ooh, that's cold.

393
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,411
Okay.

394
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,780
Oh, that's easy.

395
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,284
It's us in 30 years.

396
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,286
And that was way too much.

397
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,955
I love that.

398
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,392
Wow, you're in super good
shape for an old guy.

399
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,861
Thank you, and you,
if I may say,

400
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,797
are hot as ever.

401
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,399
But in a dignified,
age-appropriate away.

402
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,737
It's all the yoga.
It keeps me young.

403
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,842
To be honest, Joe, I'm so happy

404
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,311
that you could come tonight.

405
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,812
It's been the worst day.

406
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,949
My thesis adviser,
he made a pass at me.

407
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,184
Oh, you're kidding.

408
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,952
The most embarrassing part is

409
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,022
I actually thought he
believed in me and my work.

410
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,523
This isn't your fault.

411
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,792
Yeah, but dumb shit
like this happens all the time.

412
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,628
I'm starting to think
I'm some kind of magnet

413
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:01,400
for, like, dudes
with serious issues.

414
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,970
So what are you gonna do
about your thesis adviser?

415
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,273
I don't know. Get through it.

416
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,445
I believe in you.

417
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,717
Hey, do you want to come to
a party with me tomorrow?

418
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,586
Already booking our next date.

419
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,089
It's at a friend,
Peach Salinger's.

420
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,757
Like J.D. Salinger?

421
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,992
I mean, yes.

422
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,260
Whoa! Wow.

423
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,062
But she doesn't like
to talk about it.

424
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,396
And she's a sweetheart.

425
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,032
Her family's just
a little, you know?

426
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,002
Yeah, whose isn't?

427
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,116
Mm. I like yours better.

428
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,687
Well, let's give thanks to
our lord Stephen King,

429
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,456
who bestoweth books
so that our bookstores

430
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,992
in third dimensional
locations may live.

431
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,195
It's cool how you
get in the monster's POV.

432
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,397
You understand
why he does stuff.

433
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,733
Almost like it's...

434
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,134
Justified?

435
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,236
Yeah, but then it's weird,

436
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,804
'cause he's bad but not all bad.

437
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,539
Quick Twitter break for Benj.

438
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,008
Maybe Dr. Frankenstein's
the bad one

439
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,878
for even making him, right?

440
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,681
Well, I think it's open
to your interpretation.

441
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,851
You ready?

442
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,221
Let's do it then.
Release the kraken!

443
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,590
Hey, come on in.
Hey, good morning.

444
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,925
Cookies, homemade,
not just for me.

445
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,161
Get a book.

446
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,865
Thank you so much.
Your receipt is in the book.

447
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,633
Whoa, we need another
box already.

448
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,268
Ethan, can you watch
the register for a second?

449
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,503
Kid ran down to
the basement to get it.

450
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,171
I'm an idiot. What? No.

451
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,373
Yeah, I saw him grab the key.

452
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,876
Paco!

453
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,256
Paco!

454
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,424
What did I say?

455
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,792
I'm sorry.

456
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,327
I told you not
to come down here.

457
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,895
I just wanted to grab a book.

458
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,663
Don't be an idiot!
Why would you do that?

459
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,865
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

460
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,114
So what happened with you
and Professor Vaj Lips?

461
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,583
Let's just say I better
find a better job

462
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,918
or some kind of housing or--

463
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,655
I don't know.

464
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,559
Okay, enough of this shit.

465
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,428
Peach, no. I can't--
I can't accept it.

466
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,863
Stop.

467
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,501
It's just first, last,
and a deposit, okay.

468
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,304
Don't be so noble, okay.

469
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,706
Just take the check
and stop stressing.

470
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,809
Here.

471
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,418
Jesus Christ.

472
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,654
If you want to kill me, what
the hell are you waiting for?

473
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,257
Why would I want to kill him?

474
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,792
Who wants to kill people?

475
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,193
Three cups,

476
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,462
one is your brand, Home Soda.

477
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,064
It's the best, right?

478
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,465
So prove it.

479
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,867
Tell me which one it is.

480
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,069
If I get this right,
I get a fix?

481
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,072
If you get this right,

482
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,809
I'll let you out.

483
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,090
I need a palate cleanser.

484
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,959
Cup two.

485
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,267
Three.

486
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,310
One, two, or three?

487
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,580
I don't know.

488
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,717
Wait! None of them, okay!

489
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,387
They all taste like stale,
cheap drugstore soda.

490
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,590
They're not mine.

491
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,958
They're all yours.

492
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,359
That's bullshit!

493
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,296
Home Soda is, obviously.

494
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,698
Let me out of here!

495
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,667
Let me out of here!

496
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,737
You psychopath!

497
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,742
Fine!

498
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,645
You win! I lose!

499
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,747
We all lose.

500
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:48,085
What am I gonna do with
this lying sack of shit, Beck?

501
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,188
You want Beck, right?

502
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,757
Let's--let's be clear.

503
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,595
She does not want to be
with a guy like you.

504
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,830
I can help you.

505
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,067
No. Actually, she invited me
to a party tonight.

506
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,335
To Peach Salinger's.

507
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,972
A Salinger party, oh, Joe.

508
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,975
She--she's taking you
to add texture.

509
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,710
She wants to seem interesting,

510
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,379
like she hangs out
with real folk.

511
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,281
She's deep, she's an artist.

512
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,883
Truth?

513
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,118
Beck will always
leave someone like you

514
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,554
for someone who can
take her places.

515
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,656
We never made it
to a single party

516
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,625
'cause she couldn't
jump on me fast enough.

517
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,729
She's playing you for a chump,
my friend.

518
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,868
So yeah, it was really bad.

519
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,704
Basically, food poisoning
is the reason why

520
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,273
Peach and I are friends.

521
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,908
Puke does bond you.

522
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,676
She show you her ladle?

523
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,177
She's got this red
kitchen ladle.

524
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,046
It's a whole call-you-daddy,
spank me thing.

525
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,482
She's kinky as shit with me

526
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,551
because I'm loaded.

527
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,352
Not you 'cause--
'cause who are you?

528
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,055
So hopefully nothing
gastrointestinal happens,

529
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,394
but I do hope you guys
like each other.

530
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,899
You want to change that.

531
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,336
You need me.

532
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,708
Shit.

533
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,316
One look and I can tell you,
not my crowd.

534
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:30,087
What they are is everything
Benji claims you want to be.

535
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,388
Beckalish.

536
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,923
Hi.

537
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,325
Hey.

538
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,926
Mwah, mwah.

539
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,227
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

540
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,096
Is this Joseph?

541
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,264
Joe.

542
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,532
Am I just texture here, Beck?

543
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,467
Now, Joseph...

544
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,868
Just--just Joe.

545
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,503
I'm gonna have to borrow
our friend here.

546
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,872
So make yourself at home.
Everyone here is friendly.

547
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,376
Brown people don't bite.

548
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,813
Alumni.

549
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,349
Where'd you go?

550
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,284
I didn't.

551
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,652
Hmm.

552
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,588
Come on.

553
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,232
I blacked out.

554
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,669
Annika Atwater,
rich and #carefree,

555
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,271
building a brand as
a body positive influencer,

556
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,973
which seems to involve

557
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,843
wearing a lot of free stuff
on Instagram.

558
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,946
Lynn Lieser, publicist,
#cocktaillover.

559
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,848
Daughter of a surgeon
and tech CEO, adopted,

560
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,419
and has all the smugness,
none of the angst.

561
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,554
If you have a full set,
each one of them is worth

562
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,756
three times as much
for a collector.

563
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,825
You've read that one?

564
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,728
Just the first one.

565
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,032
Typical.

566
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,337
You think I need some
illiterate working in my shop?

567
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,606
No, hey.

568
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,974
If you want to work
in this shop,

569
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,011
you learn the value
of these books.

570
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,946
Mr. Mooney, please.

571
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,016
Everything you need is in there.

572
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,551
- Please!
- Joseph.

573
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,188
There you are.

574
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,223
It's Joe, just Joe.

575
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,892
This is a lovely
collection, Peaches.

576
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,495
It's Peach, and, I mean, you've

577
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,832
probably read more of these
books than I have.

578
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,469
A good salesman has to
know his product, right?

579
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:03,340
So you met Beck
at a book shop, right?

580
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,042
That's right.

581
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,244
Only in New York.

582
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,812
And then you just
happened to meet again.

583
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,349
Casual tone, detective eyes.

584
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,017
Well, it's lucky we did.

585
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,620
She was on the tracks
at the time.

586
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,288
So I heard.

587
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,023
Oh, God, thank goodness for you.

588
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:23,494
I mean, being in Greenpoint
of all places

589
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:27,365
at the very right moment.

590
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,470
Oh, it's time for the toast.

591
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,085
So in the time I was in there,

592
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,721
you attract Benji 2.0.

593
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,856
Peach looks thrilled.

594
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,458
Are you thrilled?

595
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,761
What do you want?

596
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,139
So which Beck are you?

597
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,310
The one I see
or the one Benji does?

598
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,550
Hey, stranger.

599
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,718
How are you holding up?

600
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,022
Having fun?

601
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,296
Beck.

602
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:36,033
Why did you bring me here?

603
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,303
I don't know.
I thought it could be fun?

604
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,905
I don't think I have
a lot in common

605
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,975
with your other friends.

606
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,412
I like that about you.

607
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,915
I always think I'm
gonna love these things,

608
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,784
yet somehow never do.

609
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,853
Then why did we come?

610
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,789
It's been this way since Brown.

611
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,391
Just feels like
I'm getting sucked in

612
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,527
and I could just be me,

613
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,064
yet that somehow never feels
quite good enough.

614
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,800
You know, I stole
this dress to fit in,

615
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,001
which is pathetic.

616
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,402
I don't know about that.

617
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,171
Yeah, not as pathetic
as the fact that Peach

618
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,873
wrote me a check
to keep me afloat,

619
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,877
which I don't want to cash
but now I have to.

620
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:25,115
Look, if you're not one of them,

621
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,951
it's just 'cause stuff didn't
just get handed to you.

622
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,386
It didn't.

623
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,088
Right, and when it's like that,

624
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,359
sometimes, to survive...

625
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,130
you have to show some teeth.

626
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:44,335
And I'm guessing that
yours are pretty sharp.

627
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,713
I'm glad we met,
glad we're friends.

628
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,115
For the love of Christ.

629
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,557
Joe? I know that voice.

630
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,093
Joe Goldberg?

631
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,663
Maddie Johnson.
I'm Candace's friend.

632
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,132
Great, a little soon
for you to hear this, Beck,

633
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,300
but here we go.

634
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,568
Wow, Maddie, that's crazy.

635
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,070
It's so good to see you.

636
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,371
This is Beck.

637
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,707
Hey.

638
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,944
So I heard about
you and Candace.

639
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,845
You know, I thought
we were pretty happy,

640
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,449
but she thought she could be
happier with some guy in Rome.

641
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,319
So you know, I get it.
She's following her bliss.

642
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,523
It's just how she left
so suddenly.

643
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,125
I mean, we were all
kind of hurt.

644
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,928
Would you excuse us?
My Uber is here.

645
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,229
It was nice to meet you.

646
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,500
Sorry. It was good
to see you, Maddie.

647
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,039
I just felt like that
needed to be over.

648
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,243
Let's get you home.

649
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,482
Be here for Paco.

650
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,352
What could he possibly
need from me?

651
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,755
He needs someone who isn't
drunk, Ron, how about that?

652
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,961
What the hell is wrong
with you, punching a wall?

653
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,998
Solve our problems.

654
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,333
I'm sorry.

655
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,334
It's okay.

656
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,902
It's not okay to yell.

657
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,771
Grown-ups do it all the time.

658
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,873
Grown-ups are assholes.

659
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,345
Some people used to
yell at me, too, you know.

660
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,815
And I don't want to
be like them.

661
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,118
I got you something.

662
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,465
I can't take this in the house.

663
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,467
Ron.

664
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,005
So all the bathrooms
in the building

665
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,607
have the same kind of ceiling.

666
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,509
So go in the bathroom.

667
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,613
The ceiling tiles around
the vent move if you push them.

668
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,681
So you push one...

669
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:16,253
pop the book in there,
slide it closed.

670
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,655
Like a secret hiding place.

671
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,791
Cool.

672
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,592
Thank you.

673
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,062
Mm-hmm.

674
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,698
Have a good night, Paco.

675
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,970
If you want it, it's here.

676
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,352
You are not responsible
for my feelings,

677
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,855
I am, but for the record,

678
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:56,493
I feel like congealed, day-old
egg rolls right about now.

679
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,763
What was the point of
taking me to that party?

680
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,631
Benji was right.

681
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,934
Benji!

682
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,888
Honestly, I get how he feels.

683
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,124
You left me here to die!

684
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,860
You left me here to die!

685
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,566
Enough of this, just kill me!

686
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,348
Hi.

687
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,617
I--

688
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:57,120
I just--I want to ask you
to please reconsider.

689
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,824
I need the T.A. job.

690
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,260
I need housing.

691
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:07,331
Can we maybe discuss placing
me with another adviser?

692
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,066
It's the middle of the term.

693
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,869
I know.

694
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,372
Inconvenient, but it's--

695
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,208
it's really important.

696
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,510
I wish you the best.

697
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:24,014
But I really can't,
in good conscience, do that.

698
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,218
I understand.

699
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,631
So I--

700
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,702
I guess I'm realizing
I have no choice...

701
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,279
but to share this.

702
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,250
And that is?

703
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,386
Well, it can fit in one tweet.

704
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,256
A list of six women who
have a story about you.

705
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,825
Not hard to find,
didn't take much asking around.

706
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,926
What's the term again,

707
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,229
harassment or misconduct?

708
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,863
Anyway, they were too scared
to come forward,

709
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:17,734
but then we realized it's
harder to dismiss seven women

710
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,569
with the same story.

711
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,472
That's not possible.

712
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,873
I've done nothing inappropriate.

713
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,376
You want to make yourself
a public liar?

714
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,878
That actually would
sink your career.

715
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,949
Blackmail is not something
you live down.

716
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,519
You're trying to call my bluff,

717
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,055
but I'm not bluffing.

718
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,892
So your call.

719
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,067
I've had a lot of time
to think in here.

720
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:54,170
You're right.

721
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:58,508
I am a fraud.

722
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:03,046
I've done things worse than you.

723
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,082
And that's how I know, Joe,

724
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,852
you're not a killer.

725
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,892
I want to tell you something.

726
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,094
And once I tell you,

727
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,063
I'll know your worst secret.

728
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,466
You'll know mine.

729
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,937
Then you can let me go.

730
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,213
Yeah! We thought
this group was strong.

731
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,250
A lot of interesting stuff
in Benji's nightstand.

732
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,951
But he was right.

733
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,988
The thumb drive is by far
the most interesting.

734
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,924
It started out your standard
issue frat hazing,

735
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,295
but a certain intensity
kicked in.

736
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,332
Then the coke or the homophobia.

737
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,599
Teach this bitch a lesson.

738
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,001
Teach him a lesson!

739
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,369
They all stood there,

740
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,271
laughing.

741
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,106
- And Benji...
- Whoo!

742
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,375
...was the worst
because he stood there

743
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,743
holding the camera.

744
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,713
Dumbass, wake up, dumb-ass!

745
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,449
Oh, shit!

746
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,917
Their parents made it go away,

747
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,886
but Benji kept
a copy of the video,

748
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,722
I assume, to hold over
friends' heads.

749
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,658
Instead, I get to hold it
over Benji's.

750
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,393
And he doesn't deserve it,

751
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,528
but he's right.

752
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,332
It is enough to buy his freedom.

753
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,477
Should I have changed
the subject on that balcony,

754
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,178
tried to kiss you sooner?

755
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,814
It's not fair how easy it is
to kill a spark.

756
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,050
It's a miracle
love ever happens.

757
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,184
If it's not a myth.

758
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,120
Hi.

759
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:54,558
Thanks to you, I showed
that professor some teeth.

760
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,929
And?

761
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,565
What's that?

762
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,033
A thank-you doughnut.

763
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,468
It worked.

764
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,570
Hmm.

765
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,339
That's good. I'm glad.
I mean, I was worried.

766
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,374
You were right
and I have housing

767
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,642
and can rip Peach's check up

768
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,479
and generally live
to fight another day.

769
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,182
And I wouldn't have
had the guts if you hadn't--

770
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,117
so really, thank you.

771
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,753
All I want to do is help, Beck.

772
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,623
I mean, you saw something in me

773
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,526
and, God, not everyone
gets why I'm here

774
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,127
and what being a writer means.

775
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,430
It's the most--I mean, it's
the only important thing.

776
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,702
And--and you helped me
to not lose it.

777
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:44,742
Aren't you gonna look, see if
I guessed the right flavor?

778
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,848
No bullshit, classic,
even old-school,

779
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,483
and secretly better than
all those crazy,

780
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,786
trying-too-hard ones.

781
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,723
It is nice to be seen.

782
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,226
It's a good guess.

783
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,665
It's good.

784
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,012
Come back here.

785
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,328
So plain glazed, yes.

786
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,931
Noted.

787
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,267
I have to go to class.

788
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,437
Have a good class, Beck.

789
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,929
Did you get it? The video?

790
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,598
Maple latte, almond milk,

791
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,835
two Stevia,
did I get that right?

792
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,305
Yeah, yeah, I saw the video.

793
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,341
Yes! Yes!

794
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,443
Yes!

795
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,683
Oh, mutually assured
destruction.

796
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,518
Let's talk about something
first, though.

797
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,687
What you said about Beck

798
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,223
basically being a gold digger...

799
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,393
I was just being honest,
that's--that's all.

800
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,794
What you are is wrong.

801
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,796
I'd go so far as to say

802
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,699
you create the problem

803
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,734
when you assume this stuff,

804
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,504
when you treat her like trash.

805
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,007
You cast her in a role

806
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,810
that isn't her and--
and you trap her in it.

807
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,813
Bro, I'm--I'm--
I'm done with her.

808
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,283
Say I can trust you.

809
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,685
I've got the video, right?

810
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,888
I mean, solid maybe.

811
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,424
The thing is that doesn't make
up for the damage you've done.

812
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,658
I'm sorry.

813
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,960
If it was between
me and you, Benji,

814
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,195
honestly, I would roll the dice.

815
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,530
I would.

816
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,833
Like you said, I'm not a killer.

817
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,438
But this...

818
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,839
is about her.

819
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,076
I'm telling... you--

820
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,644
I'm scared.

821
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,181
I'm very scared of what
you would do to her.

822
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,319
Maple almond latte.

823
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,923
Two Stevia,

824
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,460
two tablespoons of peanut oil.

825
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,632
Could have gone either way.

826
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,734
He's lied about so many things.

827
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,537
Who knew the peanut allergy
was real?

828
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,788
Guess Benji's gonna die
an honest man.
