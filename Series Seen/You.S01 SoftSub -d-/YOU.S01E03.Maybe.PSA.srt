1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,901
Previously, on "You"...

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,137
Everyone just calls me Beck.
And you're...

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,106
- Joe?
- Goldberg.

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,874
A guy needs to protect himself,

5
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,844
and your name was
a glorious place to start.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,912
The next thing our little
friend the internet gave me

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,382
was your address.

8
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,550
Uhh!

9
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,520
Maybe we could get
a drink sometime?

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,554
Sure.

11
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,789
Hey, let me up.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,258
Oh, you make me insane.

13
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,494
Oh, Beck, who is this?

14
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,829
Benjamin J. Ashby.
Greenwich born,

15
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,930
boarding school bred.

16
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,799
- After you.
- All right.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,769
Man, I'm thinkin' maybe--

18
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,670
Do not tell me
that you're doing this

19
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,938
because of Beck!

20
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,874
I'm very scared
of what you would do to her.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,476
She show you her ladle?
She's got this red kitchen ladle.

22
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,879
It's a whole "call you Daddy,
spank me" thing.

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,647
Benji, I'd love your help.

24
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,885
Unfortunately, I know
you're a pathological liar.

25
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,755
I just knew Benji
was the worst kind of poison,

26
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,259
so I did what I had to do
to help you.

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,438
It's been three days...

28
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,972
Since our first kiss,

29
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,241
and I have to say...
things are looking

30
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,343
pretty good for us post-Benji.

31
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,845
If you could only watch
one movie

32
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,081
for the rest of your life,
what would it be?

33
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,282
"Beverly Hills Cop."

34
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,384
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Dead serious.

35
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,654
Okay... I'll bite. Enlighten me.

36
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,256
Well, it's funny,
but the danger...

37
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,925
feels very real.

38
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,359
It checks all the boxes.

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,162
What's yours?
What's your forever movie?

40
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,965
Mm. I'd have to go with...

41
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,467
"Pretty in Pink."

42
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,435
Invisible townie girl
swept off her feet

43
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,371
by the one guy
who really sees her.

44
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,906
A little on the nose, Beck.

45
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,375
I love that movie.

46
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,544
I'll be that guy,
the one who sees you.

47
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,480
You deserve that, after Benji.

48
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,482
So...

49
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,584
your... old girlfriend,

50
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,286
the girl at Peach's party
was talking about...

51
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,355
- Candace, is it?
- It's customary...

52
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,457
the inventory
of past heartbreak.

53
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,025
- Do I wanna know?
- But Candace--

54
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,061
I'm not sure
how to tell you about her yet.

55
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,996
It's too soon, Beck.

56
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,732
I mean, I'm an open book,
but it's--it's the old story.

57
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,302
Just... thinking you're right
for someone...

58
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,637
and you're not.

59
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,806
Hmm. I got about
a dozen of those.

60
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,042
- Hmm.
- Maybe sometime over a drink.

61
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,911
Or ten.

62
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,613
- Yep.
- Ten?

63
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,781
Ten. Ten...

64
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,484
Give or take.

65
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,293
I want to come in, I do.

66
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,328
But I'm gonna make us wait.

67
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,030
You're worth waiting for.
Besides...

68
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,565
Bye.

69
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,233
Right now, I have something

70
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,970
rather pressing to deal with.

71
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,813
Nothing sweeter than townie pie.

72
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,516
#MuffinGrabNGo.

73
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,100
Grab N Go? Really?

74
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,535
Townie Pie? What the--

75
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,439
You're dead to me, Benji. Dead.

76
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,007
You're finally moving on.

77
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,909
And now that you've
dealt with Benji,

78
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,414
it's time for me to do the same.

79
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,595
How exactly does one
get rid of a body?

80
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,563
I can't just Google
this kind of thing

81
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,032
without creating a pretty
damning evidence trail.

82
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,768
So I turn to those
I trust most for tips--

83
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,005
King, Carr, Franzen, Flynn.

84
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,140
Fun fact:
spatchcocking a chicken

85
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,542
and dismembering a human

86
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,144
involve the same six
essential steps.

87
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,879
Not sure I'm down for that.

88
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,748
Little intense. But...

89
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,518
I think I finally have
a plan for Benji.

90
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,387
Oh, hey, Joe, I didn't know
you were up there.

91
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,756
Do you mind if I play
some, uh, Enrique Iglesias?

92
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,524
I'm trying to
bone up on my Spanish.

93
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,026
These are officially
the darkest days...

94
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,761
Sounds great.
In the history of the world.

95
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,129
I mean, I can pick
something else.

96
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,564
I got a ton of playlists
on here.

97
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,567
I got rock music,
club music, jazz music.

98
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,602
I wonder if he's a virgin.
Stick with the Iglesias.

99
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,404
I'm just gonna be in the
basement working on some books.

100
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,639
I don't wanna be disturbed.

101
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,073
- All right?
- No problem.

102
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,241
Thanks, Joe!

103
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,010
Here's what I know.

104
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,013
There can be no dead Benji
for you to mourn.

105
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,648
He needs to disappear.

106
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,751
Already handled the optics
on social media--

107
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,421
portrait of a dude hard
partying his way off the grid.

108
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,690
As for the body--

109
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,226
cremation seems expedient.

110
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,061
This will require chemicals,

111
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:00,633
a steady blaze, and absolutely
no dental records.

112
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,243
Bluuh...

113
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,045
It looks like

114
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,848
I'm gonna need to slow
the biological roll on Benji.

115
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,850
It's about temperature,
and it's about humidity.

116
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,554
And dropping the temp this low
puts the books at risk--

117
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,691
dry, brittle, lost forever.

118
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,226
My humidifiers
won't let that happen.

119
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,095
Gertrude Stein is dead.

120
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,231
She's not coming back
to sign books.

121
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,234
Hopefully, this holds him
until I can man up

122
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,004
and do the deed.

123
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,739
- Come in.
- Hi... there.

124
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,375
I'm, uh... Guinevere Beck.

125
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,177
I'm your new MFA transfer.

126
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,414
Professor Leahy and I agreed,
uh, that it would be bet--

127
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,049
Oh, sorry.

128
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,353
Um, I'm looking for
Professor Mott?

129
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,554
Beck, is it?

130
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,456
- Yes, hi.
- Blythe.

131
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,491
I heard you were joining us.

132
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,259
- Yeah.
- We meet here for workshop

133
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,794
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

134
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,464
Mott's no Leahy, though,
so bring your A game.

135
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,998
I intend to.

136
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,568
You know, I actually--
I read one of your essays

137
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,269
in the "Review" last month,

138
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,139
and it was so illuminating.
I tweeted it.

139
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,244
Social Media. It's like
the next great genocide.

140
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,314
- Jersey, right?
- Sorry?

141
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,815
It's where you're from?

142
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,618
No, I'm, uh, I'm from Nantucket.

143
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,788
Oh, interesting.

144
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,491
- Where are you from?
- Such a tough question.

145
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,793
Um... I was born
in Papua New Guinea,

146
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,529
but my dad worked
for the State Department,

147
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,930
so we moved around a lot.

148
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,198
Actually separated from
my parents at one point.

149
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,467
Did some modeling in Tokyo.

150
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,705
My hair is super-unique there.

151
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,351
I'm sorry, it's my grandparents.

152
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,752
I'll see you in class, okay?

153
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,387
- Okay.
- Okay.

154
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,923
Hey...

155
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,024
Yeah.

156
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,726
And then she walked away,

157
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,294
and I melted into the earth.

158
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,563
Sounds like a pretentious
bitch, if you ask me.

159
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,165
No. Blythe's amazing.

160
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,667
She wrote this piece
about how she and her mother

161
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,403
got bulimia together
while in Italy, and she was 12!

162
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,605
- Chic.
- What the--

163
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,108
- Is that a nose?
- It's a dick pic, Annika.

164
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,544
So what? It's just zoomed in.

165
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,847
- No!
- Why's it against shag carpet?

166
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,182
- I don't know.
- Perspective?

167
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,583
I don't get it.

168
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,718
I mean, why do men think
disembodied members

169
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,353
equal foreplay?
You know, they're not

170
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,923
- aesthetically pleasing.
- Ooh! I disagree.

171
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,825
I have over 200
saved on my phone

172
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,995
organized by category.
It's my Guggenheim.

173
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,264
Fat bats.

174
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,666
Boomerangs.

175
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,501
Banana boats.

176
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,336
Late bloomers.

177
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,737
And Jewish guys.

178
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,206
More power to 'em,
but your friends

179
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,041
kinda treat sex
like it means nothing.

180
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,642
Till she sees his junk in zoom!

181
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,411
But you're different,
aren't you?

182
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,946
Honestly, I see her point.

183
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,514
I hooked up with
some guy last night.

184
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,984
Knee deep in before I realized
he's uncircumcised.

185
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,652
- Ooh!
- It kind of looked like...

186
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,988
- I don't know, a... hoodie?
- Whoa!

187
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,923
Bookstore clerk
has a turtleneck?

188
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,925
Bookstore manager,
but, no, not Joe.

189
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,728
Some guy from Tinder.
Just a little down and dirty.

190
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,463
- You know?
- Wow!

191
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,832
Joe is still a maybe.

192
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,301
A maybe? I'm a maybe?

193
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,003
And you're still screwing
other guys?

194
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,738
Beck! How did I miss this?

195
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,241
How did I read this
so completely wrong?

196
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,676
Look, if you wanna bone
Benji outta your system,

197
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,345
more power to you.

198
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,281
I just wanna make sure that
you're respecting yourself.

199
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,417
Look, I'm just saying...

200
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,854
are you being your most
amazing self right now?

201
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,590
I mean, this is...
this is my process.

202
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,959
It's like a Benji exorcism.

203
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,396
I'm just exploring
my options in a city of...

204
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,131
8 million people.

205
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,166
- It's only reasonable, right?
- Yeah.

206
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,435
I'm gonna get a drink.

207
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,074
I like your tattoo.

208
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,976
I don't have a tattoo.

209
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,212
Love is patient and kind.

210
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,780
And so am I, Beck.

211
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,049
For you, I can be patient.

212
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,918
Maybe this is your process.

213
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,819
Nobody buys the first pair
of jeans they try on,

214
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,555
no matter how perfect.

215
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,457
But as much as I'm hoping
this is just a stage,

216
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,426
a quick password search
on your iCloud

217
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,396
has revealed a swipe-fest
of millennial man-boys.

218
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,864
Guy with tiger.

219
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,432
Junior William Morris agent.

220
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,968
Viking Wannabe.
You've been a busy girl, Beck.

221
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,270
It's more competition
than I realized.

222
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,605
This thing between us--

223
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,540
it's new, tenuous.

224
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,943
And the cost was a corpse.

225
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,045
But I can't get rid of
every guy in New York.

226
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,882
If I wanna win your heart,
I'm gonna have to show you--

227
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,386
Aah!

228
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,221
I'm not a "maybe".

229
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,924
I'm The One.

230
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,332
It's time.
Time to get rid of Benji

231
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,968
so I can focus
my undivided attention

232
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,670
on you, Beck, on us.

233
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,706
So I'm gonna need
a few supplies.

234
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,773
Hey, Joe.

235
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,942
You said you needed to talk?

236
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,911
I do, yeah. So here's the thing.

237
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,913
I have a secret project
I'm working on,

238
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,381
but I gotta open up the shop,

239
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,717
so I thought you could
run some errands for me.

240
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,485
I'll give you a little
money for books.

241
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,220
Just between us.

242
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,755
Yeah. No problem.

243
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,757
Between us. What do you need?

244
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,928
Well, you might have to
run to a few different places.

245
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,868
You can count on me, Joe.

246
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,107
Thanks, Pac.

247
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,745
The swine and I.

248
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,782
Eye to eye.

249
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,785
My heart is his.

250
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,920
And that...

251
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,757
was sunset.

252
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,397
I'm not sure it had
the vigilance or depth

253
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,733
that you're capable of.
I just wasn't fully invested.

254
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,169
Interesting, Blythe.

255
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,872
How do we maintain
the reader's attention?

256
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,574
We infuse the universal

257
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,610
with painful specificity,

258
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,211
or they simply turn the page.

259
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,613
Exactly.

260
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,116
My worst fear--and I'm not
commenting on Yuri's poem,

261
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,987
per se, is not to be bad
but unremarkable.

262
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,057
Unremarkable. That is the fear.

263
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,759
I hope this was helpful, Yuri.

264
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,695
I think that does it for today.

265
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,596
Next up is... Blythe.

266
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,964
And Beck.

267
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,200
Send a piece of your choosing
to myself

268
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,704
and your fellow classmates,
and we'll review on Thursday.

269
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,198
Here's what I've gleaned

270
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,034
from this little exercise
in futility, Beck.

271
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,037
You're in no mood to write.

272
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,207
And you need a new bed.

273
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,776
So, hey, maybe your enthusiastic

274
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,311
but ultimately empty encounter

275
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,779
with that Warby Parker-wearing
mixologist

276
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,314
could work to our advantage.

277
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,615
Any chance you're down
for shopping trip?

278
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:31,783
I've got time to kill

279
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,353
while Paco's out shopping.

280
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,257
You read my mind.

281
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,126
Pick you up in an hour.

282
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,561
But I have to play this
perfectly,

283
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,563
and in order to do that,

284
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,466
I gotta break out the big gun.

285
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,138
Mr. Mooney's Buick Skylark.

286
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,907
You bound down the stairs
in those tight,

287
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,242
not-too-tight jeans.

288
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,743
You're in flip-flops

289
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,044
and your toenails sparkle

290
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,613
and your hair's in a bun,

291
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,381
and, hey, at least you
don't have any hickeys.

292
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,484
So there's that.

293
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,358
Oh, my God, I can't
believe this is your car.

294
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,193
You're a lifesaver.

295
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,928
No idea how much

296
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,165
I needed a new bed.

297
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,184
New Challenge.

298
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,153
How do I segue this from

299
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,155
browsing glassware to...

300
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,992
"Holy shit! Joe's the one"?

301
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,895
Weird.

302
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,464
I have one just like this.

303
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,567
Yeah, I-I know all about it.

304
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,803
- Benji told me.
- It was my dad's.

305
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,438
The infamous red ladle.

306
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,440
How you like to be spanked
with it.

307
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,310
Is that what
you really want, Beck?

308
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,647
Is that the guy
you're looking for?

309
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,218
Just pick one.

310
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,653
It's all cut from the same
hunk of overpriced wood.

311
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,488
I can't decide.

312
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,490
People trying to buy some
sort of meaning in their lives

313
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,594
with $60 candles
and sustainable lamps.

314
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,162
They all look pretty good to me.

315
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,631
No, I just mean
should I get the queen

316
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,299
or the king-size bed?

317
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,668
Your bedroom isn't big
enough to fit a king.

318
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,205
You're right, it's too...

319
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,876
How do you know that?

320
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,477
It's New York.

321
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,114
No one's bedroom is
big enough to fit a king.

322
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,385
Ugh...

323
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,853
What's wrong?

324
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,521
This girl, Blythe, in workshop,

325
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,625
she just submitted
her short story.

326
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,160
- And?
- And I haven't even

327
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,464
started mine yet,
and it's due tomorrow.

328
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,903
Hers...

329
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,504
it's brilliant.

330
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,475
It's about a crow that flies
into a woman's house,

331
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,944
runs into the walls,
and leaves blood everywhere.

332
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,413
That sounds terrible.

333
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,216
Read it.

334
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,328
Well?

335
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,531
- You might be right.
- Ugh!

336
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,768
I know.

337
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,606
Can I ask you something?

338
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,041
Anything.

339
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,777
Promise to tell the truth?

340
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,179
Scout's honor.

341
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,220
Do you think...
I'm unremarkable?

342
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,030
Unremarkable people don't worry

343
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,434
about being unremarkable.

344
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,180
This is it, Beck.

345
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,514
This is the moment
I'm gonna show you

346
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,416
just how remarkable you are.

347
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,219
You want down and dirty,
you got it.

348
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,392
Stop, Joe, stop!

349
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,827
What? I--What?
I thought that you--

350
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,261
That I wanted to get arrested

351
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,597
while you're going
all bush diver on me in public?

352
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,735
That's not exactly
on my to-do list today.

353
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,207
I guess I read that wrong.

354
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,611
You haven't made eye contact
for the past ten minutes.

355
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,848
Things couldn't get
any worse right now.

356
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,052
- Hello?
- Hey, Joe, it's Ethan.

357
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,021
- Ethan from the bookstore.
- Yeah, yeah, I know

358
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,422
who you are, Ethan.

359
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,559
Right. Thing is,
the power's out. Um...

360
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,229
the electrician says he thinks
the system is overloaded,

361
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,764
but he can't get
to the fuse box because...

362
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,599
It's in the basement
with a dead body.

363
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,035
Which is locked.
He thinks he can pop the lock,

364
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,503
but I just wanted to--

365
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,738
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Just--Just--

366
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,340
just tell the electrician
to go home.

367
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,175
I'll call him later.
You lock up and go home.

368
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,877
I'll deal with it
when I get back.

369
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,779
All right?

370
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,481
Okay.

371
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,317
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

372
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,420
It's fine. It's just
a little problem at the shop.

373
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,389
I should get you... home.

374
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,592
I was afraid this might happen.

375
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,195
Six humidifiers and an AC unit
from the late '70s

376
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,830
cranked to its lowest setting...

377
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,266
even in death, Benji is
a colossal pain in my ass.

378
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,743
Okay. With the AC out,

379
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,248
seems deterioration speeds
really picked up.

380
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,931
Oh! Is that... ooze?

381
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,899
Things have grown

382
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,502
biologically dire
in the Benji department.

383
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,437
Also the rare book department.

384
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:31,042
But... I can't protect them
until I get rid of him.

385
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,113
Benji has to go.

386
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,896
Ugh!

387
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,667
Hey, what are you up to?

388
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,303
Do you happen to read Chinese?

389
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,007
Or own a mallet?

390
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,478
The books were safe.

391
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,013
Basement is 100% corpse-free.

392
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,581
Can't burn the body
in daylight anyway,

393
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,083
so the least Benji can do

394
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,219
is wait in the car
for a little while.

395
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,358
- Ready for that.
- Okay.

396
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,426
Let go for a second.

397
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,595
- Okay.
- Yeah.

398
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,331
- It's in the peg!
- Okay.

399
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,636
- Hand me the mallet.
- Yeah. Ah!

400
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,175
Should be good.

401
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,856
There it is.

402
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,292
Go!

403
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,395
Say when.

404
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,265
When. I think--when.
When, when, when.

405
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,639
Cheers to us.

406
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,741
You make a good apprentice.

407
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:15,047
I was gonna say
the same thing about you.

408
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,322
I'm sorry about earlier.
I didn't mean to get so upset.

409
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,691
It's okay.

410
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,527
No, it's not, it's just...

411
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,831
I don't want you to think of me

412
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,835
like that.

413
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,544
I... like you, Joe.

414
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,215
Like actually... like.

415
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,388
And I was a little
in my head, to be honest.

416
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,058
Blythe's short story kinda
threw me for a loop.

417
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,760
It's not a competition.

418
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,428
I know, but...

419
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,931
I wonder...

420
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,635
am I ever gonna write
anything that amazing?

421
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,670
You're talented.

422
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,472
- You don't know that.
- I--I know--

423
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,875
I know you need to
get out of your head and...

424
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,679
forget Blythe,
this Blythe person.

425
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,881
Forget everybody.
Just write what you want.

426
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,451
God! Everyone says that
like it's so easy.

427
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,220
I know, I know.

428
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,956
Okay, so, um...

429
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,858
pop quiz.

430
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,960
Don't think.

431
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,128
Just answer.

432
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,896
Okay.

433
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,998
What hits you
like a gut punch when you--

434
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,867
the first thought?

435
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,869
My dad.

436
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,204
Before he...

437
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,107
Yeah. Right.

438
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,843
Of course.

439
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,515
He was an addict.

440
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,785
It was hard...

441
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,854
and scary.

442
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,658
I mean, there were
good days too.

443
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,529
Like I always knew
it was gonna be one of those

444
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,801
when I woke up to the smell
of pancakes cooking.

445
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:21,405
He used this red ladle
to scoop up the batter.

446
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,576
This is the red ladle story?

447
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,714
And I would be... laughing,

448
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,216
singing along to some

449
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,419
bad Top 40 song.

450
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,290
And everything
would be... right.

451
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,731
But then he'd...
he'd go out and...

452
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,468
the ladle would go back
in the drawer.

453
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:54,539
And I'd wait
for the next good day.

454
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:01,580
Until there weren't any more.

455
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,849
Wow!

456
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,252
I did not expect
to say all that.

457
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,121
I think you're right.
You definitely don't have

458
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,790
anything meaningful
to write about.

459
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,260
Ohh. Benji was wrong
about all of it.

460
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,663
His whole red ladle story.
You don't wanna be spanked.

461
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,999
You wanna feel safe,

462
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,601
loved.

463
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,738
You want someone to make
pancakes for you.

464
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,130
Um...

465
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,366
hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

466
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,236
Coming!

467
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,140
- Is everything okay?
- No!

468
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,976
- Peach. I should have known.
- Thank God you're here.

469
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,012
I'm having a really
bad flare-up.

470
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,916
I think I need you to take me
to the emergency room.

471
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,984
Oh... Joseph.

472
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,786
I didn't realize you were here.

473
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,088
I told you he was coming.

474
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,291
Uh, Peach is really sick.

475
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,160
This is probably more
than you need to know,

476
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,529
but... I have a rare
chronic bladder disease

477
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,897
called interstitial cystitis--

478
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,200
Oh... gosh!

479
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,436
I mean, you know, some
people think I'm being uppity,

480
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,272
but... I can't have
any fast food.

481
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,409
And if I drink, it has to
be a high PH, you know,

482
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,411
like Ketel One or Goose

483
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,079
and pear juice.

484
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,648
Weren't you doing Jager
shots at your party?

485
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,083
Oh--oh!

486
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,952
Let's get you to the hospital.

487
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,054
- Yeah.
- And Joe has a car.

488
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,822
He can take us. Right, Joe?

489
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,591
You can take us?

490
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,227
Of course.

491
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,596
I mean, I've got a dead body
in the trunk,

492
00:24:58,597 --> 00:24:59,730
but, hey, no biggie, right?

493
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,198
Oh, this is taking forever!

494
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,101
I mean, he took the worst
street to get across town.

495
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,436
Be nice.

496
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,438
I'm in real pain!

497
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,608
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,143
Ohh... Joseph...

499
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,045
- Yep.
- I'm feeling nauseated.

500
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,248
Can you crack a window?
There's like a...

501
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,251
sort of putrid aroma that keeps
wafting in the backseat.

502
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,221
What can I say?
The smells of the city.

503
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,326
Oh... God.

504
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,995
I can't deal. I can't deal.

505
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,098
We'll walk!

506
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,302
I'm so sorry.

507
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,474
It's almost the witching hour.

508
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,110
Grab the supplies.
Drive the narcissistic cadaver

509
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,978
formerly known as Benji
to his final destination,

510
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,983
light a match,
and I'm yours forever, Beck.

511
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,687
Well, this is a development.

512
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,290
That's him.

513
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,732
Potassium nitrate.

514
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,167
Six rolls of duct tape.

515
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,103
Fire starter, twine,
burlap, wood stakes.

516
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,172
You wanna explain
what all this is for?

517
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,974
Explain the shopping list

518
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:20,311
straight out of
"Body Disposal for Dummies"?

519
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,413
I know.

520
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,948
I know how this all must look.

521
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,317
I know involving Paco
was the wrong thing to do.

522
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,486
But th-things have been
a little crazy for me lately.

523
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,457
I guess I was hoping I could
make the world a better place.

524
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,862
You know--It...

525
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:43,001
it would--it would just
be easier if I show you.

526
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,105
Yeah, I'll show you. Come on.

527
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,209
Technically, we're not allowed
to plant anything in here.

528
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,379
I was just trying to keep it
a bit under wraps.

529
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,714
And the chemicals?

530
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,282
They dissolve roots.

531
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,751
Fire starters?

532
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,121
I like to grill.

533
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,992
Here.

534
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,332
It's good.

535
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,533
Thank you.

536
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,335
So he built a garden. So what?

537
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,405
I told this guy--stay away
from my girlfriend's kid.

538
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:25,176
And what does he do? He gives
him money for errands?

539
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,746
Hey, I told you,
I'm a parole officer, okay?

540
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,280
We see guys like this
all the time.

541
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,751
He's a sicko.
I feel it in my gut.

542
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,320
Hey, will you get back
inside, Paco?

543
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,023
Just tell your mom I'm gonna
be right there, okay, buddy?

544
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,059
All right, all right, all right.

545
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,095
Kid's got ADHD.
Tough to manage at times.

546
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,097
But that's what makes him
vulnerable to freaks like this.

547
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,667
Look, I apologize
if I crossed the line.

548
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,436
I just noticed how hungry
Paco is all the time, you know?

549
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,005
I gave him a few dollars
to go to the store, honestly,

550
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,540
so he could buy himself
a sandwich.

551
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,777
I lend him books from time
to time, too--that's all.

552
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,879
Just seems a little neglected.

553
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,848
- You kidding me right now?
- I'm not saying they're unfit.

554
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,684
- A lot of people drink--
- All right, that's it--

555
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,352
All right, all right, all right.

556
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,654
Sorry to have
taken up your time.

557
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,322
Good luck with the garden.

558
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,392
Thank you, Officer.
People. They're easy to fool.

559
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,995
Like these cops. I'm the nice,
straight-edge guy.

560
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,663
So there's nothing
to worry about.

561
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,266
People believe whatever
supports their world-view.

562
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,069
Unfortunately, that seems
to include you, Beck.

563
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,338
You believed you deserved
Benji and his neglect,

564
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,541
and you believe you deserve
Peach and her drama

565
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,142
and on and on.

566
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,545
I want to call and tell you,
but I can't,

567
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,047
because there's a traditional
waiting period

568
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,549
between every goddamn
communication

569
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,584
when trying to date someone.

570
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,088
I hate this generation.

571
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,387
Thank you.

572
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,791
Thanks for staying with me.

573
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,893
Honestly, I... I don't know

574
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,762
what I would have done
without you.

575
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,898
You can always count on me.

576
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,467
Thanks.

577
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,439
So what do you think about Joe?

578
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,876
Uh... yeah, you know,
I like him.

579
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,111
I think I might really like him.

580
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,047
I mean, I wasn't sure
if I was ready to get involved,

581
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,483
- but... maybe?
- Okay, you can't be serious.

582
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:50,687
I mean, the guy
works at a bookstore.

583
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,558
Beck, look, I know you.

584
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,060
You don't wanna spend
your fifth anniversary

585
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,464
going Dutch at Katz's Deli.

586
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,934
You need someone
to take care of you.

587
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,905
So you can write, be free,

588
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,940
happy.

589
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,877
Not someone like Joe
and his financial limitations.

590
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,979
That is not fair.

591
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,349
Nobody pays me to be fair.

592
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,751
What do you say we get
a bite to eat?

593
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,955
- 'Cause I'm starving.
- I think I better skip it.

594
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,224
I should really get home.

595
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,694
Glad you're feeling better.

596
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,912
Oh, no. No, not--not now.

597
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,681
Okay, Beck. All right.

598
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,983
Hey. How's the patient?

599
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,385
Better. Thanks for the ride.

600
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,821
The doctor said it was good
that we came when we did.

601
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,656
Oh, yeah?

602
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,193
Why don't you meet me
back at my place?

603
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,262
Maybe we can pick up
where we left off?

604
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,563
What about Peach?

605
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,066
- What about her?
- Where is she now?

606
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,267
Indochine.

607
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,135
It's her comfort food.

608
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,071
Perfect.

609
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,373
Peach is gulping steamed
Chilean Sea Bass

610
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,909
down her scrawny gullet,
and I'm about to get caught.

611
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,144
So... what do you think?

612
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,080
I think you complain about
not being able to write,

613
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,715
but then you, you know,
drop everything

614
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,084
for some medical emergency,
which, by the way,

615
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,585
many believe to be
psychosomatic in origin.

616
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,655
I meant about you...
coming over.

617
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,490
I wish I could.

618
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,759
Ha. I wish I could, but I'm
just really busy right now,

619
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,494
so... in fact, I should go.

620
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,830
Look, I know Peach
showing up was bad timing,

621
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,199
but I wasn't exactly writing
when she showed up.

622
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,902
No, I know. Pro tip of the day:

623
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,537
screen your calls when
you're trying to burn a body,

624
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,106
because it turns out
things slip out

625
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,574
that you didn't actually
wanna say.

626
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,376
I don't mean to be harsh,
but... you know

627
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,877
you're sending
some mixed messages, right?

628
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,178
What is that supposed to mean?

629
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,247
I'm--I'm trying
to do what you want,

630
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,216
but I-I can't tell what that is.

631
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,817
Like build you a bed,
be with you on the bed?

632
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,419
Drop you down the block
because your friend

633
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,121
is asking, and not very
politely?

634
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,089
Seriously, Joe, shut up.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

635
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,659
I have to go.

636
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,495
But--

637
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,398
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

638
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,668
That's one hell of a bonfire.

639
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,370
Yeah, what can I say?
I went a little crazy.

640
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,440
You know what, you're welcome
to join if you like.

641
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,208
Please say no. Please say no.

642
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,945
Oh, that would be great...

643
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,681
but we need to get back
to the car

644
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,149
before it gets any darker.

645
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,984
Good luck.

646
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,522
- Yeah, have a good one!
- You too.

647
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,059
Did you remember
where you parked?

648
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,761
I believe in love
at first sight.

649
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,496
I had it with you, Beck.

650
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:49,933
And maybe, just maybe,
I destroyed it

651
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:54,905
just as fast, in the space
of a single phone call.

652
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:55,306
Was all this for nothing?

653
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,314
"The king and queen,

654
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,583
when they saw their daughter..."

655
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:10,087
I've been calling Beck, but...

656
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,621
straight to voicemail.

657
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,690
Worst three words
in the English language.

658
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,727
I wonder what our kids
would have been like.

659
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,795
They'd have grown up reading,
not glued to iPads,

660
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,364
and we definitely
wouldn't have named them

661
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,965
things like Gulliver or Blaze

662
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,533
or Misti with an "i".

663
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,803
We would have crushed this.
Together.

664
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:30,240
It wasn't supposed to
end like this.

665
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,909
Call me back, Beck.

666
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,645
The end.

667
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,192
I don't mean this to blow
smoke up your ass or anything,

668
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,528
but your writing makes me think

669
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,231
that Raymond Carver
has been reincarnated.

670
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,666
That is so kind of you
to say, Tomas.

671
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,302
I was born in '88,
the year he died,

672
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,871
so, weirdly enough,

673
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,040
you're not the first
person to have said that!

674
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,676
Again, great work, Blythe.
Excited to see what's next.

675
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,345
Beck, we weren't expecting you.

676
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,080
You didn't send along pages.

677
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,848
I know. I'm sorry.

678
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,284
And I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just...

679
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,287
I wrote them, but they
sounded super emo.

680
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,688
So I wrote them up
and started over,

681
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,924
and I lost track of time,
but, uh...

682
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,493
this... feels like me

683
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,664
and what I want to say.

684
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,333
It's only one page, but--

685
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,069
That isn't really enough
for us to critique.

686
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,539
Are we supposed to
read it now... in front of you?

687
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,407
That's... kind of awkward.

688
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,342
If that's the case,
I should warn you,

689
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,744
I have this facial autism thing

690
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,279
where I can't hide
what I'm thinking.

691
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,548
Let's just reschedule

692
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,652
your review for another time.

693
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,976
Beck?

694
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,347
Hey.

695
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,249
Uh... okay, so I hate
to admit it,

696
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,750
but you were right.

697
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,352
A little bit.

698
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,521
I will do anything
for my friends,

699
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,022
and do I hide behind them--
yeah.

700
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,558
And do I use them as
an excuse not to write?

701
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,861
Honestly, I'd use anything
as an excuse not to write,

702
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,564
because... okay,
I'm afraid I might fail--

703
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,500
one terrible page away

704
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,835
from confirming I'm the worst
writer in history.

705
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,539
All of that to say
if I'm sending mixed messages,

706
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,343
it's because...
I don't know who I am.

707
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,745
So how am I supposed to
know what I want?

708
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,481
And I know--I know
I sound super gross,

709
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,151
like so...
I don't know--millennial.

710
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,453
Don't say anything.

711
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,488
In this moment,
you are everything.

712
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,956
Here's the thing.

713
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:03,927
If you know who you are,
it's not like you share it.

714
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:08,598
I mean, you're a Nice Guy with
the "You are remarkable" stuff

715
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,334
and Feelings Guy with the
"Write what moves you".

716
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,737
But then
you try and go down on me

717
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,238
in the middle
of a furniture store.

718
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,573
If I didn't know better,

719
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,608
I'd think you were hiding
something.

720
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,646
For God's sakes, why are you
holding a Pendleton blanket?

721
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,384
I've never even seen your place.

722
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,387
And you never talk about
any of your friends.

723
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,690
I mean, who are you?

724
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,161
Okay, that was too much. Um...

725
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,096
It sounded better in my head.

726
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,667
I wanna show you something.

727
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,310
You wanna know me, Beck?

728
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,550
I'll show you exactly who I am.

729
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,538
This is where we keep
the rarest books--

730
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,275
the collectibles,
first editions.

731
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,115
It's paper, cloth, leather,

732
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,452
paste. It's all vulnerable.

733
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,554
All sensitive to light,

734
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,423
humidity, temperature.

735
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,328
That's why...

736
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,965
they need to be in here.

737
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,402
To protect them.

738
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,938
I can take you to my apartment.

739
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,642
Anytime you want.

740
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,380
I want you to meet
my friends, I do.

741
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,883
But this...

742
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,585
this right here

743
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,823
is the most important
place in the world to me.

744
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,160
As weird as it sounds...

745
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:21,264
these books are more alive,

746
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,601
more... worthy

747
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,871
than most people I know.

748
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,810
You wanna know who I am,
this is it.

749
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,132
There you are.

750
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,936
That's it. I am officially
out of the Tinder business.

751
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,138
Bravo, honey.

752
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,108
I just--Oh, I feel like
this is a good step, you know?

753
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,310
Like this is good for me.

754
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,813
Joe is good for me.

755
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,816
Whatever you need, Becks.

756
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,386
No, I'm just saying--
and I mean this, honestly--

757
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,222
maybe a simple life
isn't so bad.

758
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,824
Maybe it's what you need.

759
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,692
Maybe I should be
looking for that.

760
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,161
Joe isn't simple.
He's... he's different.

761
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,630
Complicated.

762
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,166
That's funny...

763
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,835
there's a book missing.

764
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:35,105
Really? What book is that?

765
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,573
"Ozma of Oz."

766
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,742
Huh. It was just here.

767
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,444
Joe was looking at it
at my party.

768
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,714
I'm sure it'll turn up.

769
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:57,560
You've deleted Tinder,
and now you've called

770
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,629
and asked me to come over.

771
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:05,769
My faith in our epic love
story is officially restored.

772
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,303
I'm sorry, Joe. I'm so stupid.

773
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,740
I left your list on my bed,
and Ron found it.

774
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,842
- I'm sorry.
- You're not stupid.

775
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:16,212
- It's not your fault.
- I tried to explain, but...

776
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,216
It's not your fault!

777
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,752
Guys like Ron are bullies.

778
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,322
We just need to stay
one step ahead of them.

779
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:29,793
Like the Musketeers--always
one step ahead of the Cardinal.

780
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,127
Right?

781
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,229
One for all...

782
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,900
And all for one.

783
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,234
Paco!

784
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,136
Get inside.

785
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:44,641
I can smell the bourbon
from here.

786
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,643
I told you...

787
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,778
leave the kid alone.

788
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,513
Look, you may have
the cops fooled

789
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,415
with your bullshit
tomato garden,

790
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,684
but I'm right.

791
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,720
There's something wrong
with you.

792
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,157
I see it in your eyes.

793
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,434
File that away

794
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,869
under future problems.

795
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,304
Knock, knock. You here yet?

796
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,639
Because tonight...

797
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,044
tonight I show you...
I'm The One.

798
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,795
Oh--

799
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,738
Did you just...
