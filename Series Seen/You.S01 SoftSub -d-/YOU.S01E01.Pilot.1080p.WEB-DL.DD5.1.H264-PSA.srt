1
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,016
Well, hello there.

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,617
Who are you?

3
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:21,453
Based on your vibe, a student.

4
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,989
Your blouse is loose.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,658
You're not here to be ogled,
but those bracelets,

6
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,360
they jangle.

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,563
You like a little attention.
Okay, I bite.

8
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,399
You search the books.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,301
Uh, fiction. F through K.

10
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,738
Now, hmm, you're not
the standard insecure nymph

11
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,741
hunting for Faulkner
you'll never finish.

12
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,977
Too sun-kissed for Stephen King.

13
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,913
Who will you buy?

14
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,715
Sorry.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,884
You sound apologetic,

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,553
like you're embarrassed
to be a good girl.

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,891
And you murmur
your first word to me.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,859
Hello.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,561
Do you work here?

20
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,196
Guilty.

21
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,497
Can I help you find something?

22
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,899
Paula Fox?

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,267
That's a good choice.

24
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,170
Hmm, I feel weirdly validated.

25
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,672
Follow me.

26
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,043
She's gonna be in here.

27
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,611
Celebrity authors.

28
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,346
I thought Fox
was pretty obscure.

29
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:24,616
She is Courtney Love's
maternal grandmother.

30
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,951
You're not expected
to know that.

31
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,753
Good, I didn't.

32
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,455
Mr. Mooney wants anyone in here

33
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,923
who's even tangentially famous.

34
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,357
He thinks it sells more books.

35
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,226
That's sad... people buying books

36
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,228
because of what's popular,
not because they want to be

37
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,398
moved or changed in some way.

38
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,934
Yeah. It's an epidemic.

39
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,102
Hmm.

40
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,470
Yeah, you see this guy,

41
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,572
here with the glasses,
behind you?

42
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,908
He just grabbed Dan Brown's
latest on the way in.

43
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,377
So he's gonna wander around
for another, like,

44
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,379
five or ten minutes just
to find something legitimate

45
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,581
to buy with it.

46
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,949
Oh, like the cereal guys buy

47
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,283
when they're really there
for condoms?

48
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,718
Only makes it more conspicuous.

49
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,386
Like, own your shit.

50
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,124
If Dan Brown's your kink,
then be out about it.

51
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,460
At the end of the day,

52
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,830
people really are
disappointing, aren't they?

53
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,000
Sometimes they surprise you.

54
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,503
Paula Fox, top shelf.
Do you want me to...

55
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,305
Oh, no, I got it.

56
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,310
Oh, are you not wearing a bra?

57
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,012
And you want me to notice.

58
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,914
If this was a movie,

59
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:33,118
I'd grab you and we'd go at it
right in the stacks.

60
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,753
Have you read her fiction?

61
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,655
"Desperate Characters" is her...
It's her best.

62
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,323
Oh, that's what I keep hearing.

63
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,791
You haven't read
"Desperate Characters"?

64
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,260
I know. I know.

65
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,528
I'm worried it's not gonna
live up to the hype.

66
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,363
I can safely say
it is that good.

67
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,864
That's a high endorsement.

68
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,167
And from a bookstore clerk,
nonetheless.

69
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,835
Well, it's bookstore manager.

70
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,105
Hello? Anyone working here?

71
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,173
Asshole.

72
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,607
Oh.

73
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,610
Whoa.

74
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,615
Do you mind? Uh, I'm in a hurry.

75
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,484
He's just pissed
he's gotta buy Salinger

76
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,352
to feel respectable
when all he really wants to do

77
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,688
is eat Cheetos
and jerk it to iPorn

78
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,992
before washing it all down
with a Dan Brown chaser.

79
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,361
Have a nice day, sir.

80
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,633
Okay, I'm going for it.

81
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,068
Good, you won't regret it.

82
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,236
Better not.

83
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,138
Paula Fox, nice.

84
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,739
You know, she was, uh,
Courtney Love's

85
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,974
maternal grandmother.

86
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,276
That's why I'm buying it.

87
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,514
You have enough cash
to cover this,

88
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,382
but you want me
to know your name.

89
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,817
Guinevere?

90
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,319
Yeah, my parents were assholes

91
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,020
with the whole naming thing.

92
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,390
But everyone just calls me Beck.

93
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,759
And you're Joe?

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,861
Goldberg.

95
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,764
Everyone calls me Joe.

96
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,836
Aren't you gonna tell me
to have a nice day?

97
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,838
You have a nice day, Beck.

98
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,708
You have one yourself, Joe.

99
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,747
You smiled, laughed at my jokes,

100
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,618
told me your name,
asked for mine.

101
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,553
She write her number on there?

102
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,588
She was on you hard.

103
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,423
No, she was just being nice.

104
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,292
I'd be Googling the hell
out of her right now.

105
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,727
You know her full name.

106
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,629
That's pretty aggressive, Ethan.

107
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,063
What do I tell you?

108
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,934
Always be closing that shit.

109
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,602
- If you need me...
- If you need me...

110
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,637
both: I'll be in cookbooks

111
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,038
but for work, not for fun.

112
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,706
I swear.

113
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,575
At the end of the day,

114
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,711
people are really just
disappointing, aren't they?

115
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,985
But are you, Beck?

116
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,421
Are you?

117
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,441
Yes, people find "the one".

118
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,911
I believe that.
I try to stay open.

119
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,446
I was in love once.

120
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,348
She broke my heart, Beck.

121
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,251
Oh, she really
did a number on me.

122
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,086
I should have seen the signs.

123
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,189
But we never do
when we're in love.

124
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,291
Exhibit A: Claudia and Ron.

125
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,093
Went out for a couple of drinks.

126
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,928
Get off my back, Claudia.

127
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,431
Claudia's a nurse.
Single parent.

128
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,166
- It's every night!
- It's not every night!

129
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,834
You think she knew
Ron was a shitbag

130
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,536
when she fell in love?

131
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,771
No, she thought he was a prince.

132
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,173
Hey, Paco.

133
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,008
What's up, Joe?

134
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,711
And now hers is not
the only life she ruined.

135
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:49,648
Leave me alone!
I don't wanna talk to you!

136
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,016
Is everything cool in there?

137
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,819
Yeah, Mom and Ron
are just talking.

138
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,387
No, man, this isn't your house...

139
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,557
Wow, you are burning
through that book, aren't you?

140
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,958
Reads quick.

141
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,393
It's good.

142
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,494
Well, let me know
when you finish.

143
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,229
I'll... I'll get you another one.

144
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,467
All right, well,
I don't care about that!

145
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,635
Are you hungry?

146
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,904
'Cause, you know, I just got
this meatball sub,

147
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,308
but I remembered I have Thai
from last night.

148
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,311
No, my mom will just
make me something later.

149
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,879
It's a shame. This won't keep.

150
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,981
It's getting tossed.

151
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,283
You sure, Joe?

152
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,421
All for one and one for all.

153
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,439
The point, Beck: Love is tricky.

154
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,793
A guy needs to protect himself.

155
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,462
I had to be sure you're safe.

156
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,465
And your name was
a glorious place to start.

157
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,401
Not a lot of Guinevere Becks.

158
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,803
And there you were.

159
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,571
Every account set to public.

160
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,873
You want to be seen...

161
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,109
heard, known.

162
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,579
Of course, I obliged.

163
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,882
Born and raised,
Nantucket Island.

164
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,785
A brother, Clyde,
and sister, Anya.

165
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,955
Your parents really were
assholes about the names.

166
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,391
Your folks split
when you were 12.

167
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,060
Your dad dropped out
of the picture.

168
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,262
Went to Brown, where you
majored in lit, cool.

169
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,565
And minored in douchebags, mm.

170
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,834
And then on to NYC
to conquer an MFA

171
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,502
and make your mark, presumably.

172
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,671
Now, you still write. Barely.

173
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,239
Too busy living out moments
you won't remember

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,907
five years from now.

175
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,176
I know this because you
post about this life

176
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,846
all the goddamn time.

177
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,149
Candidly, it's
the least appealing thing

178
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,851
about you, Beck.

179
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,954
You posted this
hours after our encounter.

180
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,755
I was concerned.

181
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,591
You didn't mention that
cute guy in the bookstore.

182
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,293
And then I realized,
your online life isn't real.

183
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,195
It's a... it's a collage.

184
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,763
You paste this Beck up...

185
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,166
This, uh, together,
lovable, cute,

186
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,968
bendy little creature.

187
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,836
If anything, the fact
that you didn't share me

188
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,806
with your followers only
confirms we really connected.

189
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,175
The next thing our little
friend the Internet gave me

190
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,711
was your address.

191
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,284
There it is, with its big,

192
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,186
naked windows.

193
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,721
It's nice... too nice.

194
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,490
I'm thinking subsidized
school housing.

195
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,293
Jesus, it's like you've never
seen a horror movie

196
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,996
or the news.

197
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,138
But you want people to watch,
don't you?

198
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,873
You know, I plan on asking you
about this quality

199
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,575
when we get to know
each other better.

200
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,343
A proposal:

201
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,912
Why don't we spend the day
together tomorrow,

202
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,647
just you and me?

203
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,348
To everyone out there
chasing their dreams,

204
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,349
don't give up.

205
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,651
And in the meantime,

206
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,220
Mac N Cheese!

207
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,321
It's cute.

208
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,423
Not deep, but cute.

209
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,425
Is there more to you?

210
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,928
Let's find out.

211
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,406
Our day starts
at the ass crack of dawn.

212
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,207
I know from your posted
schedule that you teach

213
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,944
a 6:30 class called
Get Up N Flow.

214
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,613
You caress the sweaty backs
of bulimic,

215
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,715
dead-eyed Real Mommies
of Soho...

216
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,184
I am loving your form
today, Tasha.

217
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,588
Offering smiles
and lies of encouragement.

218
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,525
By 10:00, you're at campus
to TA a romantics class

219
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,627
and play Vanna White
to some shirt.

220
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,362
Good morning, Professor Leahy.

221
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,264
I told you, it's Paul.

222
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,899
Are you ready for class?

223
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,867
Professor Obvious
wants to fuck you.

224
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,536
But you're smart.

225
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,438
You... you let him think
one day, he might.

226
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,873
And what's the harm in that,
right?

227
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,377
After class, you head
to your favorite cafe

228
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,081
to write for the first time
all day.

229
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,883
But your life doesn't cooperate.

230
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,119
Your wealthy girlfriends
have just now woken up

231
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,455
and have nothing better to do
than plan their next

232
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,957
pointless yet
Instagrammable night.

233
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,792
Can we get real for a second?

234
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,261
You have questionable taste
in friends, Beck...

235
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,402
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

236
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,339
Oh, yes, happy birthday!

237
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,342
And expensive taste in lives.

238
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,912
- Ready?
- Thank you.

239
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,648
Do you like it?

240
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,282
No, I hate it.

241
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,951
Of course I love it!

242
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,486
Jason didn't even get her
something that nice,

243
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,422
and Annika finally
let him do anal.

244
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,425
Please.

245
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,593
Open my gift next and tell me

246
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,129
how much you hate me then, lady.

247
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,834
A butterfly?

248
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,136
It's my spirit animal
for the year.

249
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,704
You remembered?

250
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,339
Only 'cause you wouldn't
shut up about it.

251
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,808
You want so badly
to be one of them.

252
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,476
- Happy birthday.
- You guys are so beautiful.

253
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,811
They've got nothing
to do after this,

254
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,312
so yeah, they'll party till 5:00

255
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,048
and scrape it together tomorrow.

256
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,350
But you can't.
You have to work for a living.

257
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,786
A McQueen, Beck?

258
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,020
How much was it?

259
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,622
It was on clearance.

260
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,357
They haven't put
a McQueen scarf on clearance

261
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,392
since he hung himself in 2010.

262
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,461
It'd be too much
even if she did deserve it,

263
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,329
which she does not.

264
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,632
Hmm, not all your friends
are dumb.

265
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,200
You always do this.

266
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,836
You make, like, a big gesture
that you can't afford

267
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,505
because, I'm sorry,
you're too nice.

268
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,640
It's no big deal.

269
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,910
I had, um, a gift card.

270
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,479
How broke are you?

271
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,148
Just tell me what's up.

272
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,417
Actually sounds like she cares.

273
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,152
Look, I appreciate...

274
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,555
Why don't you just let me
loan you some cash, okay?

275
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,323
I keep telling you it's nothing.

276
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,925
Also sounds condescending.

277
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,994
You know I'd do
anything for you.

278
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,897
Don't forget that.

279
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,766
Sure you can't come out with us?

280
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,000
I gotta write.

281
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,837
Virtuous. Catch you later.

282
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,410
Is that the best friend
you've got?

283
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,014
If so, Beck,
you really are alone.

284
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,959
Your social media's a liar.

285
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,696
It says you're
a happy-go-lucky dilettante.

286
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,233
But underneath it all,
you seem like

287
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,801
the genuine article.

288
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,302
Stretched ADD thin, sure,

289
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,904
but as soon as the door closes,

290
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,472
you're back at the keyboard,

291
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,808
trying to write.

292
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,829
Thanks.

293
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,167
Keep the change, man.

294
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,571
Hey, let me up.

295
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:26,972
Uh, Beck, who the fuck is this?

296
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,485
My best friend walked in
on you getting your dick sucked

297
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,253
by some random woman
in a bathroom

298
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,789
at a party that I took you to.

299
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,825
I was wasted.
I didn't even finish.

300
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,493
That's your apology?
"I didn't come"?

301
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,295
That's the one
you're going with?

302
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,696
And I obviously shouldn't
have gone in the bathroom

303
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,097
with any girl that wasn't you.

304
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,465
But she said she had good coke,

305
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,535
and I've been
seriously stressed.

306
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,938
I thought when Johno and I
started our line,

307
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,673
it was gonna be, like,
picking out flavors and shit.

308
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,308
It turns out
it's 16-hour lectures

309
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,676
on microbial management.

310
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,377
And that's why no one
starts their own

311
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,379
artisanal soda company
and why America has to keep

312
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,348
drinking crap
that's giving them cancer.

313
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,817
You actually managed to
connect your illicit blow job

314
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,053
to curing cancer.

315
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,289
I'm genuinely impressed.

316
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,026
Beck, I...

317
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,363
Seriously,
I am drowning in work.

318
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,465
I don't have time
to keep hooking up

319
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,868
or whatever it is
you're even capable of.

320
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,338
I know I've done
some stupid shit.

321
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,807
But I'm on it now.

322
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,246
I don't wanna be just some guy
that you sleep with.

323
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,484
God, you make me insane.

324
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,159
Way to go, Beck.
Looks like a catch.

325
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,931
Benjamin J. Ashby III.
Oh, there's three of them.

326
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,833
Greenwich born,
boarding school bred.

327
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,203
His father is the Ben Ashby
of Ashby Brokerage.

328
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,838
Two failed careers.

329
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,039
Model... oh, boy.

330
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,741
And cocreator of a dating app

331
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,276
that connects people
through musical tastes

332
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,111
called LoveHooks.

333
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,880
Current CEO of Home Soda
Artisanal Beverages.

334
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,116
Motto: Drink Better by Hand,

335
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,385
which makes no sense
but evokes a homespun quality

336
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,888
that lines up with a guy who
wears $600 Japanese sneakers.

337
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,290
The hair.

338
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,225
The privilege he tries to hide

339
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,360
with retweets
of Black Lives Matter.

340
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,262
Not to sound judgy, but this guy

341
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,766
is everything wrong
with America.

342
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,702
See, this is why
I do my research.

343
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,104
You fall for the wrong men...

344
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,306
Bad men.

345
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,640
You let them in.

346
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,875
You let them hurt you.

347
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,610
Too far away to know for sure,

348
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,412
but my guess is,
if he came anywhere close

349
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,713
to making you come,
you'd have made

350
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,315
a Broadway show out of it.

351
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,783
But you didn't...

352
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,785
'cause he didn't.

353
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,557
"Desperate Characters"?

354
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,125
Yeah, I just got it.

355
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,493
You can borrow it when I'm done.

356
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,795
It's supposed to be her best.

357
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,463
Johno's consultant
we brought in,

358
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,798
she's been all over me
about this kind of thing.

359
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,434
Saged the crap
out of the office.

360
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,903
The book title has the word
"desperate" in it.

361
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,237
You don't wanna
think of yourself

362
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,174
as a desperate character, Beck.

363
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,777
'Cause you're
the opposite, babe.

364
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,414
You're the smartest girl I know.

365
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,818
Honestly, you blow me away.

366
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,090
Oh, shit. Gotta roll.

367
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,658
Johno's blowing up my phone.

368
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,827
Hey, you should
come by the office,

369
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,261
test out some new flavors.

370
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,696
We're doing cumin.

371
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,964
I know how much
you like Indian food.

372
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,467
Sure. Sounds good.

373
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,937
Looks good on you, by the way.

374
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,340
The extra weight.

375
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,511
Yeah, hey, I'm on my way, bro.

376
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,279
You guys ordering pizzas?

377
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,547
Yeah, don't dick me over
like last time.

378
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,615
Gluten-free crust.

379
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,983
Not from that vegan place.

380
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,686
Vegan cheese tastes
like asshole.

381
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,965
I'm talking French gourmet shit.

382
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,834
No, Johno, Johno, listen to me.

383
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,303
They can't do half gluten-free
'cause of the dough.

384
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,073
They have to use a spelt dough.

385
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,936
So you didn't finish.

386
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,706
Just like that.

387
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,216
Here.

388
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,551
Oh, thank you.

389
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,453
You're so kind.

390
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,490
I don't suppose you can help me
get a cab, can you?

391
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,657
Of course.

392
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,060
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

393
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,780
Wow, don't tell me
you're finished already.

394
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,082
Almost.

395
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,850
It's so good.

396
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,585
Sometimes the dialogue's
weird, though,

397
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,154
like when they're
killing each other

398
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,421
and still all nice about it.

399
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,756
Well, it was the 19th century.

400
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,492
People still had manners.

401
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,163
I was hoping we could
go get another one.

402
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,365
Ooh, I mean,
it's pretty late, Pac.

403
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,100
I don't know.

404
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,136
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I want you to come.

405
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,005
Ugh, something's
in the air tonight, Beck,

406
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,775
'cause everyone but me
is getting action.

407
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,544
Even the lovebirds made up.

408
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,880
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

409
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,950
Did you know Dumas
was a black dude?

410
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,018
I Googled him.

411
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,386
His grandmother was a slave,

412
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,288
and his dad was
a brigadier general.

413
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,890
He killed, like,
half a battalion.

414
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,726
You probably knew that
since you work at a bookstore.

415
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,195
I didn't.

416
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,229
How'd you get
to work here, anyway?

417
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,664
Mr. Mooney gave me a job

418
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,665
when I was just
a little older than you.

419
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,799
He sort of took me in.

420
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,167
He seems nice.

421
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,337
He was a dick.
But he loved books.

422
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,738
And he taught me
to love them too.

423
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,807
I never see him around here.

424
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,042
Is he dead?

425
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,410
No, he's just old.

426
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,178
I'm sorry, Pac.

427
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,246
I had one back here for you,

428
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,414
but Ethan must have sold it.

429
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,415
Sold what?

430
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,183
Your next read.

431
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,652
Come on, I'll show you
where we keep the good stuff.

432
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,203
Freaky.

433
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,210
It's the cage.

434
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,679
It's where we keep early
editions and collectibles.

435
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
It's cold.

436
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,049
65 degrees for the books.

437
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,720
If the zombies come,
this is where I'm hiding.

438
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,357
Why don't you set
that milk shake down?

439
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,610
Careful, Joseph.

440
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,545
When it comes
to the value of a book,

441
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,481
it's all about condition.

442
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,815
I'll show you.

443
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,251
It's always 65 degrees,
humidity 40%.

444
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,454
Too moist, the pages can mildew.

445
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,256
Too dry, they get brittle.

446
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,726
Always keep books upright
so the spines don't become

447
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,129
rolled or warped
or what we call cocked.

448
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,798
And we never want
to fold or crease the pages.

449
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,734
And we dust the covers
with a chemical-free duster.

450
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,636
Always towards the spine.

451
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,605
Under no circumstances
is there any sunlight

452
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,073
in this room.

453
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,575
Sunlight can ruin a book
as fast as fire.

454
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,977
Faster.

455
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,478
It's a lot of stuff to remember

456
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,647
just to take care
of some old books.

457
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,317
The most valuable things in life

458
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,055
are usually the most helpless.

459
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,591
So they need people like us
to protect them.

460
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,827
You know?

461
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,100
"Don Quicks-oat"?

462
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,535
"Quixote".

463
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,103
It's about a guy
who believes in chivalry,

464
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,771
so he decides to be
an old-school knight.

465
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,173
What's chivalry?

466
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,207
It's treating people
with respect,

467
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,208
especially women...

468
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,876
Like men should.

469
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,978
It's good.
It's one of my favorites.

470
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,814
I probably shouldn't
take this home.

471
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,349
It's not a first edition.
It's just an old one.

472
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,051
Besides, I trust you.

473
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,836
Where you been, Paco?

474
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,237
We just grabbed
some milk shakes.

475
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,005
You just walk off
with strangers?

476
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,741
Joe's not a stranger.

477
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,310
Yes, he is. Inside, now.

478
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,313
Okay? All right.

479
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,720
Keep away from
my girlfriend's kid.

480
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,422
Look, I'm sorry.

481
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,824
But he was out here and he
could hear everything in there.

482
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,227
Don't you tell me how to parent.

483
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,495
Look, this whole nice-guy act,

484
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,363
this might work on other people.

485
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,232
I'm a parole officer 15 years,
and I can see what you are.

486
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,567
Well, you're an alcoholic
shitbag who beats women,

487
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,937
so, please, enlighten me.

488
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,874
You're a freak.

489
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,075
So stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

490
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,576
I'm gonna grab a steak knife

491
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,745
and I'm gonna cut
those freak eyes out.

492
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,516
There are scary people
in the world, Beck.

493
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,218
That's why it's important
to be safe.

494
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,057
And why I have to do

495
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:47,559
what I'm about to do.

496
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,736
Fun fact: Did you know the law

497
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,272
requires gas leaks
to be investigated?

498
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,940
I've been learning a lot
since I met you.

499
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,775
Hey, Beck, you left
the door open again.

500
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,144
I thought we said we weren't
gonna do that anymore.

501
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,913
I was careful to call
the gas company

502
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,414
on a day when you had
a full schedule.

503
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,649
Wouldn't want to scare you.

504
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,584
Hey, is Beck here?

505
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,618
Nope, super let me in.

506
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,986
Someone reported a leak.

507
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:16,987
Right, yeah, she mentioned that.

508
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:17,988
Is everything okay?

509
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,256
Yeah, all clear.

510
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,724
Tell your girlfriend
there's no leak.

511
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,259
I'm done, so...

512
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,897
Okay, thanks.
Well, I can just lock up.

513
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,502
I just need to know
who you really are,

514
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,905
besides a broke poetry student
in a subsidized apartment

515
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,674
you could never afford.

516
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,943
Where is it, Beck?

517
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,479
When we live together,
your place won't be a pigsty.

518
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,948
I'll clean for us.

519
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,583
And you won't eat
all this frozen shit.

520
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,618
I'll cook for you every day.

521
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,687
I promise.

522
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,961
I'll even do your laundry...

523
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,131
And take care
of your favorite books.

524
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,970
I'll make our bed every morning.

525
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,205
Oh, there it is.

526
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,274
No matter how hard you fight me,

527
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,778
I will always make sure you
password protect your devices.

528
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,018
"One day, you won't
need love anymore.

529
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,053
One day, you won't
walk through the world

530
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,556
as though it was your job
to hold everything up.

531
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:30,060
The sun, the sky,
the hard part of the night."

532
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,530
It's good.

533
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,665
It's quite good.

534
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,200
But, Beck, where's the rest?

535
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,270
You owe me 20 more pages.

536
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,339
I've been honestly working
every day and grading papers.

537
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,008
If the schedule is too rigorous,

538
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,175
drop back to part-time.

539
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,710
But then I won't qualify to TA.

540
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,046
I-I need the cash, the housing.
I'd lose my place.

541
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,414
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

542
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,849
You're smart,
or you wouldn't be here.

543
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,485
- Please, Professor Leahy...
- Paul.

544
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,086
Paul.

545
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,821
I'll get you the pages
by the end of the week.

546
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,524
I-I can't go to part-time.

547
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,826
Okay?

548
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,697
I'm rooting for you.

549
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,266
You just need to keep up.

550
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,235
Happy to discuss further,

551
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,170
after class some evening.

552
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,738
If we're gonna seriously
discuss poetry,

553
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,040
it should be over a drink.

554
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,409
There's a little
gastropub I love.

555
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,511
I would love that, Paul.

556
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,681
Just, uh, how would your wife
feel about you...

557
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,616
About me helping out
an aspiring writer?

558
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,687
She's... she's used
to my generosity.

559
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,356
So Thursday night, then?

560
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,225
Thursday night it is.

561
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,727
Excellent.

562
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:37,962
And don't worry about
the next few days.

563
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,632
Just go home and get caught up.

564
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,445
Need to see you tonight.

565
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,481
Well, if I can, babe.

566
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,149
Working late.

567
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,620
PS, I can still smell you
on my fingers.

568
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,288
I learned two definitive things

569
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,123
by scouring your computer.

570
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,459
First, there are no
recent pictures of your dad

571
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,227
because he's dead.

572
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,930
He OD'd, and you were
the one that found him.

573
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,165
You've started a few poems
about that day,

574
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,834
but you never finish them.

575
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,936
I'm so sorry, Beck.

576
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,138
But none of this matters
because of my second

577
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,140
and greatest discovery.

578
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,276
11:06 a.m., an hour after
our encounter at the bookstore,

579
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,911
amidst a group text
on the merits

580
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,848
of, uh, vaginal detoxing,
you wrote...

581
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,451
Wow. Just met a human male
who actually reads.

582
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,020
Alert the media.

583
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,521
What if it's finally time for me

584
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,023
to date someone good for me?

585
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,758
Thank you for letting me know

586
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,026
I wasn't crazy after all.

587
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,460
No!

588
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,628
Yes.

589
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,763
I remember what you said

590
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,998
when you sent money last.

591
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,868
Yes, I'm grateful.

592
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,470
I'm working constantly.

593
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,674
There's no place cheaper
to live.

594
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,042
I did.

595
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,779
He basically offered
to sleep with me.

596
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,781
No, I can't report him.
That's not how it works.

597
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,382
I'm not worried.

598
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,184
I've seen enough
romantic comedies to know

599
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,019
guys like me are always
getting in jams like this.

600
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,487
Not the school, the world.

601
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,123
That's not how the world works.

602
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,159
I know how much you helped me.

603
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,529
It's just, it's hard here, Mom.

604
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,802
Okay. I'll figure it out.

605
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,737
All right, love you too.

606
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,972
Bye, Mom.

607
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,618
It's okay, Beck.

608
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,830
- Hi, Becks!
- Hey, bitch, where you at?

609
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,231
Come play!

610
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,400
Oh, I can't.
I just had the worst day.

611
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,268
Aww, Beckalicious,
whatever it is,

612
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,003
there's nothing
that we can't fix, okay?

613
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,039
Yes, us and copious
amounts of alcohol.

614
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,041
Oh, my God. There's a sale.

615
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,745
You guys love me?

616
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,179
- Of course!
- Why would you even say that?

617
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,882
Okay, then.
Meet me in Greenpoint.

618
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,717
Look, why don't
you come here, okay?

619
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,052
- Come here.
- It's actually really fun

620
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,053
where we are. I promise.

621
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,554
- Yeah.

622
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,590
There's something
I need to do for myself.

623
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,858
I'll text you on my way.

624
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,527
- See you soon.
- Bye.

625
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,536
I guess we're going
to Greenpoint, Beck.

626
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,312
I never go to Greenpoint.

627
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,616
But the things you do
for love, right?

628
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,651
Hi, um, okay, so we're gonna get

629
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,819
a few more drinks.

630
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,220
Hold on one second.

631
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,122
Guys?

632
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,458
What is she thinking?
Open mics are for

633
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,794
models/singer-songwriters/vegans.

634
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,562
I mean, these people don't
wanna hear some wannabe

635
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,964
read a poem about the bleakness
of life or whatever.

636
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,100
Your friends are disloyal.

637
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,504
And that Peach is the worst.

638
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,774
Another round of picklebacks.

639
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,911
Beckish, do we think
now is the night?

640
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,412
Positive.

641
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,314
All my life lately
has been about surviving.

642
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,517
I need to remind myself why
I came here in the first place.

643
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,852
- Yes!
- Yeah.

644
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,287
- You go.
- Who do you keep texting?

645
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,622
- I invited Benji.
- Beck.

646
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,791
What? He likes poetry.

647
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,526
- For sure.
- And he texted he was coming?

648
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,163
He texted a row
of smile emojis, like,

649
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,865
45 minutes ago.

650
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,099
Some guys are assholes,

651
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,334
and you just have
to realize that.

652
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,036
I get it, Peach.

653
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,337
No, you're the one who
told me to keep reminding you

654
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,805
he's a bastard.

655
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,875
Up next, we have Guinevere Beck.

656
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,210
Whoo!

657
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,611
- All right.
- All right.

658
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,347
To vulnerability and shit.

659
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,448
Yeah.

660
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,883
- Cheers.
- Okay.

661
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,785
- Okay.
- Okay.

662
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,020
Kill it, Beck.

663
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,724
Hey, everyone, um, I'm Beck,

664
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,627
and I'm... not to sound like,
you know, whatever,

665
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,697
but just... I'm a... I'm a poet.

666
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,465
Yeah, you are!

667
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,833
Whoo!

668
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,102
Yeah, you are!

669
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,039
One day, you won't
need love anymore.

670
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,542
One day, you won't
walk through the world

671
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,745
as though it was your job
to hold everything up.

672
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,315
The sun,
the hard part of the night,

673
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,352
the secret time when you wake
to the sound of beating,

674
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,188
rise to answer the door,
but he's not there

675
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,657
because that sound
is coming from inside you.

676
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:37,094
And you cannot answer it
no matter how far in you go.

677
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,031
Wrap it up!

678
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,101
Whoo!

679
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,836
You loved him the way

680
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:49,172
fragile kids
love gorgeous bullies.

681
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:53,110
You wrote songs about him...
Uh, I mean...

682
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,280
You wrote poems about him.

683
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,916
You still write poems about him.

684
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,051
You're writing one right now.

685
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,920
Why are you so sad?

686
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,888
Just so sad.

687
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:08,258
Just something happier
for a change might be nice.

688
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,394
I think everyone agrees.

689
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,862
Can we get the singer back?

690
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:12,863
She was...

691
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,364
Sorry, I, uh...

692
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,066
I just, um... I lost my place.

693
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,235
It'll just take a second
to find where I was.

694
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,736
I can't stand seeing this.

695
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,372
I'm sorry. I-I just can't.

696
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,740
It's obvious what you are.

697
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,208
You're blind with love.

698
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,077
And what you love... writing,

699
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,545
this city, your friends,

700
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,047
most of all, men like Benji...

701
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,648
What all those
have in common is,

702
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,583
they will never love you back,

703
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,086
while you give everything.

704
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,654
It's crazy, the lengths we go.

705
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,990
We're a lot alike, Beck.

706
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,826
Last of the true romantics.

707
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,138
I was considering this
with my new friend,

708
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,007
Mr. Batshit Homeless Guy,

709
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,577
when the second luckiest thing
this week happened.

710
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,613
Could it really be?

711
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,850
It feels like I'm dreaming.

712
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,154
I'm not.

713
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,156
Beck, you're too drunk
to be alone.

714
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,026
What if some sicko
had followed you down here?

715
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,627
And you're too wasted
to be standing so close

716
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,262
to the tracks. Beck!

717
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,431
Beck, stop texting
that arrogant club soda

718
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,301
no-show dickhead.

719
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,010
You want Benji.

720
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,179
You need Benji.

721
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,981
You hold that phone
like it is Benji

722
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,350
'cause it's your only means
to stay connected.

723
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,620
Forget Benji.

724
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,323
And to hell with that phone!

725
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,725
Pick it up. Pick it up.

726
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,329
Pick it up. Pick it up.

727
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,804
Hey, hey, hey!

728
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,039
You okay?

729
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,573
Are you all right?
Can you stand up?

730
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,342
Just stay still.

731
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,077
Half that shit down there
can electrocute you, all right?

732
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,645
So just give me your hand.

733
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,180
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

734
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,181
Pick it up. Pick it up!

735
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,582
Sir, please shut up!

736
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,717
- Pick it up!
- Give me your hand.

737
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,485
The train's coming.

738
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,154
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

739
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,423
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

740
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,893
Your hand, now!

741
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,061
Pick it up!

742
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,696
Pick it up!

743
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,416
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

744
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,684
- Whoo!
- I am so sorry.

745
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,919
No, it's fine. It's fine.

746
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,122
I, uh... I hated...
I hated this jacket.

747
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,524
I really am sorry.

748
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,026
It's okay.

749
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,161
Do you mind?

750
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,932
Sure, um...

751
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,204
You know what? Let's get you
in a cab, all right?

752
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,209
I'm not always like this.

753
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,979
I figured you had
some kinda night.

754
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,049
Some kinda...

755
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,387
Hey, I don't wanna sound
like a stalker, but...

756
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,456
I think I know you.

757
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,226
Paula Fox?

758
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,727
Oh, right, right!

759
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,828
Of course.

760
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,164
I remember. I'm sorry.

761
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,500
This is what I look like
when I'm sober

762
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,667
and have my hair up.

763
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,137
Yeah, no, I remember.

764
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,306
It's okay.
I have a pretty bland face.

765
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,542
No, you don't.

766
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,945
Yeah, uh,
"Desperate Characters".

767
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,780
I remember.

768
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,383
Yeah.

769
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,284
Where you headed?

770
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,585
Village.

771
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,420
Are you anywhere close?

772
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,622
Ride with me.

773
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,324
It's the least I can do.

774
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,594
Okay.

775
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,974
Did you move here
to be something?

776
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,676
I did, but it's not working out,

777
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,778
and I'm just running around
18 hours a day.

778
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,014
Why?

779
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,517
Oh, God, never mind. Sorry.

780
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,352
No, please.

781
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,855
I feel the same way sometimes.

782
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,324
This guy I know,
he owns the bookstore.

783
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,626
He once told me that all books

784
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,864
add up to one essential truth,

785
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,701
which is, if your IQ is above
a certain number...

786
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,170
Life is pretty much unbearable.

787
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,473
And the number
is not even that high.

788
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,812
I do think I'd be happier
if I was stupider.

789
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,181
But then the world
wouldn't know your poetry.

790
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,384
How'd you know I write poetry?

791
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,356
Doesn't every young writer
in New York?

792
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,992
I mean, I read a lot of poetry.

793
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,762
Who do you like?

794
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,398
Strand, Sexton, Merrill.

795
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,101
You're describing my nightstand.

796
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,271
Well, if you read them
to get to sleep every night,

797
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,374
then you definitely belong here.

798
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,210
What was your last name again?

799
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,446
Goldberg.

800
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,882
Where did you come from,
Joe Goldberg?

801
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,385
I grew up here.

802
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,221
I left for a little while,

803
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,422
chasing a girl.

804
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,458
Mm, but you came back?

805
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,860
Yeah, I missed it.

806
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,528
And I'm not a good chaser.

807
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,965
Hmm, me neither.

808
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,817
Oh.

809
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,588
Oh, this is, uh... this is me.

810
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,157
Mm, it's not bad.

811
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,294
Thank you for sobering me up.

812
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,062
And for saving my life.

813
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,498
No, I didn't...
I didn't save your life.

814
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,733
Yeah, you did.

815
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,411
Oh, God.

816
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,346
Of course.

817
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,114
- Benji.
- Hi.

818
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,916
Um, this is Joe.

819
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,585
He literally
saved my life tonight.

820
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,454
I-I fell on the tracks.

821
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,922
It was crazy.

822
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,192
Babe, I told you,
people are basically good.

823
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,593
It's a great job, bro.

824
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,296
Bro? You waste of hair.

825
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,933
Okay, Beck,
it's freezing out here.

826
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,173
Wait, uh, maybe I can
get your info.

827
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,543
Yeah, um...

828
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,917
Shit, my phone.

829
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,618
I must have dropped it
in the subway.

830
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,454
Oh.

831
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,690
Oh, okay, well, um,
just maybe give me your number

832
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,625
for when you get a replacement?

833
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,128
I'm basically enslaved to e-mail.

834
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,996
I get it. Smart.

835
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,065
I'm practically a stranger.
Can't be too careful.

836
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,333
Okay.

837
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:34,037
It's beckinreallife@gmail.com.

838
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,639
All right.

839
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,175
Beck in real life.

840
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,644
Thank you.

841
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,149
So here's what I learned
this week.

842
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,584
I'm sorry I didn't make it.
You know.

843
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,753
You are special.
You're talented.

844
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,155
You're passionate.

845
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,391
You're smart...

846
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,661
Except in the ways
you're really not,

847
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,363
like not locking your phone

848
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,365
and falling for men like Benji.

849
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,869
You know better,
but you can't stop because...

850
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,737
well, because everyone
needs someone.

851
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,606
What you really need
is someone to save you.

852
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,741
I can help, Beck.

853
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,843
Let me help you.

854
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,284
Joe.

855
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,788
Pac, hey.

856
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,623
What's going on?
What are you doing out here?

857
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,192
It's Ron.

858
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,728
He came home drunk.

859
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,730
He started yelling,

860
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,432
saying I thought I was smart,

861
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,867
reading my books and looking
at him like he's dumb.

862
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,636
What... what happened?

863
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,304
Did he hurt you?

864
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,107
No, he didn't touch me.

865
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,984
I tried to stop him.

866
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,453
I'm sorry.

867
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,722
Paco, Paco, it's okay.

868
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,057
Really, it's okay.

869
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,392
You know what? Come with me.

870
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,094
We can fix this together,
all right?

871
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,068
So, you know, the first step
to fixing something

872
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,171
is to know no matter
how destroyed it seems,

873
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,874
it can always be saved.

874
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,677
Books are no exception.

875
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,744
You got it?

876
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,112
Got it.

877
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,515
So what we have here
is a line press.

878
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,517
Basically just a huge clamp.

879
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:31,187
Polyvinyl acetate glue means
no acid to burn the pages.

880
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:34,757
Got your needle, thread,
and finally...

881
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,594
Right out of "Bugs Bunny"...

882
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,596
A trusty mallet.

883
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,532
You see this?

884
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,669
We don't need this.

885
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,608
Johno, listen to this!

886
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,776
"Dear Benji,
heard about your soda.

887
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,044
I'm interested in including you

888
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,679
on my fall list of must-tries.

889
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,314
Would love to discuss,
perhaps even try some.

890
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,816
Jeff Pevensey."

891
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,317
That's the dude
you're always retweeting?

892
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,454
It's the culture guy
from "New York" magazine.

893
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,023
Hit him back, bro.

894
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,458
No shit.

895
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,993
Back off while I think.

896
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,995
Jeff, comma,

897
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,564
so nice to hear from you, bud,
period.

898
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,799
Yeah, our sodas are legit,
period.

899
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,167
I would love to meet up

900
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,904
to have you try the goods,
period.

901
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,206
Let's set something up.

902
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,746
Scrape carefully
along the spine.

903
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,049
Of course,
you gotta watch your fingers.

904
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,989
"Sounds great.
I can call between meetings

905
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,824
to see if you're available."

906
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,427
This is gonna take us
next level.

907
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,663
What time you think we'll meet?

908
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,400
No offense. We discussed this.

909
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,669
It's best if the product
has one clear face

910
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,836
at the beginning.

911
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,539
That's just more me.

912
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,343
Okay, the spine is sewn.

913
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,578
So take this.

914
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,713
Pull it as tight
as you can that way.

915
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,016
Yeah, that's it.

916
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,125
Jeff!

917
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,128
The glue is set.
We've applied the binder.

918
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,531
Now...

919
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,267
You gotta be precise

920
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,604
and use exactly
the force needed.

921
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,450
Hey!

922
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,752
Nice to meet you, man.

923
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,153
Nice to meet you too.

924
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,822
Have you...
Have you been here before?

925
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,591
It's, uh... not a lot of people
know about it yet.

926
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,061
It's an incredible after hours.
Very exclusive.

927
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,564
Yeah, I've been here
a couple of times.

928
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,898
- Yeah?
- Mm.

929
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,901
Huh. Well, good.

930
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,138
So you'll feel
right at home, then.

931
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,981
Please, after you.

932
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,690
It's just down to the left.

933
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,839
Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

934
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,962
It's 2:00 p.m.
when the door chimes,

935
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,865
and I'm ready.

936
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,468
You told your girlfriends
you'd come by.

937
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,503
I know this because
I have your phone.

938
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,572
- I'll be in back.
- Okay.

939
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:10,973
Hey.

940
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,308
Remember me?

941
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,478
Almost dying
on the train tracks?

942
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,547
Uh, it rings a bell.

943
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,015
Hang on. Hang on.

944
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,551
Well, I wanted to say thank you.

945
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,386
No, you already did that.

946
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,489
Well, uh, thanks again.

947
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,427
And I'm sorry for, uh,
running off the other night.

948
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,195
You had a guest.

949
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,297
Hardly.

950
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:37,533
So I got you a present.

951
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,901
No, no, no, please.

952
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,936
You don't have
to get me anything.

953
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,772
Shut up and just look at it.

954
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,712
"Engine, engine number nine
on the New York Transit line.

955
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,914
If your girl falls on the track,

956
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,382
pick her up, pick her up,
pick her up."

957
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,718
We already have in jokes.

958
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,122
So...

959
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,758
anyway, that, and I'd better...

960
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,561
Maybe if you're not too busy,

961
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,697
we could get a drink sometime?

962
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,799
Sure.

963
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,068
Oh, but I still
can't find my phone.

964
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:15,037
I know. E-mail.

965
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,406
That's right.

966
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,744
See you, Joe.

967
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,314
See you soon, Beck.

968
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,090
Well played, sir.

969
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,059
Well played.

970
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,661
I'm not always right.

971
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,996
I'm human. I make mistakes.

972
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,497
You'll see.

973
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,466
I have to check
on a shipment downstairs.

974
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,101
Can you... um,
can you watch the register?

975
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,103
Yeah.

976
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,073
Hell, maybe I'm just
a fool in love.

977
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,109
But I'm right about you.

978
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,146
And I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve, Beck.

979
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,631
Please,
whatever you think I did,

980
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,466
you got the wrong guy.

981
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,536
No...

982
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,172
I don't.
