You been to

I've been trying to get
a hold of Beck, actually.

492

- Yeah, well, we... we broke up.

So I'm not really in touch.

that means

you probably found Lynn,
Beck's friend.

Beck, she might be out of town.

Good luck.
It was nice to meet you.

Are you following me?

Did your ex ever tell you
that Peach had a stalker?

Central Park incident.

it was anything

868
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,020
This is good, a fresh start.

869
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,020
<i>[soft music]</i>

870
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,320
You can put the bad things
behind you.

871
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,830
Yeah.

872
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,260
You too.

873
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,670
<i>I'm trying, I am.</i>

874
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,500
<i>But I'll admit,</i>

875
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,970
<i>it's getting harder to live
with so much heartbreak.</i>

876
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,180
<i>And there are days,
I just don't believe in love.</i>

877
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,350
<i>I tell myself
to keep my heart open,</i>

878
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,250
<i>that in the end,
I was wrong about you.</i>

879
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,390
<i>Every relationship teaches us
hard lessons, right?</i>

880
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,560
<i>That's their gift,
to make us ready for the day</i>

881
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,800
<i>when someone,
maybe the one, walks in</i>

882
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,060
<i>who could truly love us...</i>

883
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,800
[clanging]

884
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,570
<i>And we could truly love them.</i>

885
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,970
<i>Well.</i>

886
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,910
<i>Hello, there.</i>

887
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,250
<i>Who are you?</i>

888
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,580
<i>You've got that hoodie.</i>

889
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,880
<i>You don't like to be stared at.</i>

890
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,590
<i>But your legs are bare.</i>

891
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,590
<i>You like a little attention.</i>

892
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,060
<i>Okay, I'll bite.</i>

893
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,030
<i>[tense music]</i>

894
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,570
Hey, bunny.

895
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,310
Candace.

896
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,680
- You're...
- Alive.

897
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,050
Yeah, so uh...

898
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,520
I think we have some unfinished
business to talk about.
