Want you to know I wouldn't blame you.

12
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,846
It's a tough scenario
when they go full sorority ho on ya.

13
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,015
Oh, come on. She's...

14
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,725

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,688
[Joe]<i> And it's for the best.</i>

<i>Can you imagine what I'd do to Calvin

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>Or worse, what I might do...</i>

18

20

<i>We have a connection, something deep.</i>

29
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,310
<i>But the last time I loved someone...</i>

30
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,897
<i>Well, I can't risk repeating history.</i>

31
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,488

From what you're telling me...

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,115
it would be easier
for you and this chick to...

40
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,741
smash.

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,493
Don't say "chick."

[chuckles] Lady friend?

43
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,913
You won't tell me her name, so...

So is she pretty?

55
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,034
I'll be back at lunch.

56
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,288
Man, you could talk to me,
the least you could do is talk to me.

57
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,708
You're living under a false name
in a new city, [scoffs]

58
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,044
that's mega-lonely.

59
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,339
Maybe you could use a friend, too.

60
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,967
Like I said, I already have a friend.

61
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,012
I don't think you understand
how friendship works.

[stammering] Man, I'm just kidding.

63
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,186
[rapidly] How about
a heritage grain bowl for lunch?

[overlapping playful shouting]

65
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,734
[chuckling] Oh, man.

66
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,069
That was great.

67
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,237
Okay.

68
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,487
[sing-songy] Hi.

69
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,490
You can play. Just stay close.

70
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,551
- You want to play?
- There you go, go on the slide.

71
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,120
I promise we didn't drag you here just to
watch our child almost bash their face in.

72
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,204
Yeah.

73
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,291
We have news.

74
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,961
- We have a date.
- For the wedding?

75
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,589
- Yes.
- [gasps] Oh, my God!

76
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,800
When? Where?

77
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,528
- October. It's a formality, obviously.
- It's more than an formality.

78
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,280
- It's gonna be modest.
- It's gonna be huge.

79
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,584
- We're on a budget.
- We're not.

80
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,557
I want to make your cake.

81
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,910
- [Lucy] No.
- [Sunrise] No way, no.

82
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,102
That's too much work for you.

83
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,225
Your only job at this wedding
is to drink and dance.

84
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,649
- [Sunrise chuckles] Yeah.
- Please? I mean, I'll be amazing. It...

85
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,110
Come on, it would mean so much to me. I...

86
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,027
[Love sighs]

87
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,696
Not to be corny, but...

88
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,615
baking is how I express my love.

89
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,619
- Don't do that.
- Come on, don't break my heart.

90
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,536
- Of course!
- Oh, fine!

91
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,179
- Yes! Yeah-yeah-yeah!
- [both laughing]

92
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,207
Oh, my God, okay, I am so excited.
I have so many ideas.

93
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,127
And I have all this energy
that I don't know what to do with.

94
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,210
Oh, there it is.

95
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,129
What is where?

96
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,758
You cook when you're happy
and you only bake when you're frustrated.

97
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,220
Let me guess.
Will Bettelheim flaked on you <i>again.</i>

98
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,472
Does he even exist?

99
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,767
And if so, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's obviously not into you.

100
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,728
[scoffs] Yeah, well, that's impossible.

101
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,023
Okay, look, if you're determined
to ignore the red flags,

102
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,026
then, yeah, you've gotta
take your cues from him.

103
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,735
- Or a radical idea: Bumble.
- True.

104
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,736
No.

105
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,738
But the second
you start to feel desperate...

106
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,197
- Ripcord.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,867
We'll see.

108
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,539
I'm definitely walking the line between
desperate and, you know, shameless.

109
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,665
[Lucy chuckles]

110
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,421
[Love]<i> Will, hope you're not triggered
by the word "moist."</i>

111
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,140
[Joe] <i>Oh, it's like eating pure sex.</i>

112
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,225
<i>How am I supposed to resist this?</i>

113
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,353
<i>If only the universe
would send me some sign,</i>

114
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,147
<i>some platonic way
to stay in your good graces.</i>

115
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,649
[Forty] William fucking Bettelheim.

116
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,401
[Joe] <i>Can I get a different sign?</i>

117
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,863
Love's buns, am I right?

118
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,157
[Joe]<i> Well,
that's accidentally horrifying.</i>

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,658
Your sister's very talented.

120
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,995
[Joe] <i>Whereas your twin brother
literally reeks of privilege.</i>

121
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,955
<i>Who shows up to work unshowered?</i>

122
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,166
<i>Who shows up anywhere in a kimono?</i>

123
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,127
So, I couldn't help but notice,

124
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,171
you are crushing it.

125
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,883
Like, customers are talking about books.

126
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,551
[Joe]<i> This is about Love, clearly.</i>

127
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,428
<i>Does he not know I'm not a threat?</i>

128
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,305
But if I might humbly

129
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,932
make one suggestion...

130
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,976
[Joe]<i> Here it comes, some clumsy version
of "stay away from my sister."</i>

131

132
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,189
You know, the muse strikes like lightning,

133
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,567
and the best ideas are always
the ones that slip away.

134
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,027
You're a writer.

135
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,322
Director-producer, but writer first.

136
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,409
[Joe]<i> I almost forgot, this is LA.
He's not interested in me,</i>

137
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,327
<i>he needs me to be interested in him.</i>

138
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,664
You know, managing the store
just kinda helps me recharge.

139
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,874
I've got five features in development,

140
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,835

Annapurna actually is set to produce,

145
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,304
and my dear friend, Daniel Day-Lewis,

146
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,641
is attached to this dope pitch
I've been kicking around.

147

[Joe] <i>And last I checked,
family automatically trumps friends</i>

148

<i>in the social hierarchy.</i>

<i>I need to win this guy over.</i>

150
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:25,778
But DDL's oeuvre is not about that
four-quadrant hero's journey bullshit.

151
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,822
So I'm, like, birthing the scenes

152
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,451

on the rocks of a three-act structure.

That's Raymond Chandler.

156
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,169
Exactly.

158
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,174
Come with me to Harold Night after work.

159
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,592
I'm talent scouting.

160
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,968

I'm serious,
I don't want you laughing at my shit

00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,532
because then I'll be
second-guessing my taste.

219
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,076
All right? All right, strap in

220

Um... So just, like, five minutes,

225
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,473
I promise, just long enough
for me to reconnect with Hendy.

226
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,891
Okay, hang on a second.

227
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,267
From what you know, is he...

228
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,894
Is he a good guy?

229
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,814
Oh, yeah, he's like,<i> the best.</i>

230
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,733
I mean,
he used to be kind of a party monster.

231
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,904
Um, then the cancer, like,
really set him on, like, a higher path.

00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,781
Just... Okay.

Jonah, man, long time no see, dude.

Um, I just have
some business with Henderson.

No, no. You've got some balls, Quinn.

Come on, man. Like, you're a <i>manager </i>now.

You're not a bouncer.

I'm... I'm sober now.

239
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,421
[Jonah] Then take Henderson
off your amends tour.

240
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,591
Okay, well, I'm sure
if you just let me speak to him...

241
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,011
What, you're gonna let <i>her </i>through?
What is she? 13?

- Ellie.

[Joe] <i>Oh, no.</i>

244
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,644
[Ellie] Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.

245
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,355
Fucking manager.

246
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,567
Five years ago,
that guy was Henderson's weed dealer.

247
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,238
And he would not know talent
if he was choking on its dick.

248
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,198
- Cool.
- Let's just go.

What's up, you need a ride home?

252
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,970
Um, nah, I'm good. I'm a few blocks away.

253
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,724
- No candy from strangers, huh?
- [Ellie chuckles]

254
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,559
Have fun.

- Ellie.
- [gasps]

258
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,528
You scared me.

259
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,490
Oh, okay, this cannot be our thing.

260
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,159
What, are you following me?

261
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,119
- No, I was at the show.
- Why?

262
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,536
You're not funny.

263
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,497
I was with a friend.

264
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,123
Listen, I have to ask.

265
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,253
Uh, hanging out with Henderson,
you know, your... your sister has...

266
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,379
history with him.

267
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,505
Oh, my God.

268
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,841
Did Delilah put you up to this?

269
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260
Yeah, 'course I know she slept with him.

270
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,554
He's one of a hundred,
she's one of a thousand.

271
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,598
- So why are you hanging out with him?
- I'm not.

272
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,391
I'm chasing an internship.

273
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,268
And Delilah's okay with that?

274
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,938
I stole Henderson's email
from her contacts.

275
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,356
Don't you dare tell her.

276
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,734
- Ellie, you know guys like that...
- Guys like what?

277
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,570
Wait, let me guess. She called him a perv.

278
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,238
Know who else she called that?

279
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,408
Half the fucking cast
of <i>Sesame Street, </i>okay?

280
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,369
It's her go-to.
And who do you think you are?

281
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,164
Oh, my God, you're so kind.

282
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,458
You're so protective.
You're like my daddy.

283
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,186
- [yelling] Is that what you like to hear?
- No.

284
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,170
- [louder] Do you want to fuck me, William?
- No.

285
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,933
- No, yeah, of course you do!
- Never mind.

286
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,173
Of course you do!

287
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,218
Everybody wants to fuck the 15-year-old!

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,141

You got laid, didn't you?

294
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,074
Tell me everything.

You're an arm away from death.

297
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,924
Serves you right for changing the subject
away from your lady friend.

298
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,468
Well, there's nothing to talk about,
we're still friends.

299
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,761
Still platonic.

300
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,179

you need to see a shrink
'cause you are fooling yourself.

307
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:29,118
Your deal is we're all subconsciously
trying to date our moms over and over.

00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,661
Patterns are set young,

309

and all romance is basically
reenacting parental dynam...

What? I'm quoting my shrink.

00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,211
- Oh!
- And... and he's right.

She lives in the Philippines.

Is this the one
you sent all your money to?

317
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,349
Yeah, man. I told you I love her.

318
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,184
We met online.

Well, yeah,
I gave you the biggest hint ever.

323

Wait, hey, are we just gonna play games
until my meds run out again?

you will be the first to find out.

Wait, you're not eating?

No. No, the lady friend's a baker.

Stop playing games
and just wife her already.

00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh, great.

347
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,647
Three-hour project,
I'll get right on that.

348
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,816
[slams locker loudly]

349
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,697
This is weird, right?

350
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,467
All I meant was that I'm grateful
for whatever I can get.

351
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,659
Which is...

352
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,327
whenever <i>you </i>want.

353
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,830
- Or if you don't...
- You're right, this is weird.

354
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,916
[Joe]<i> Shit. If I could kiss you right now,</i>

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,376
<i>you'd know I meant no harm.</i>

356
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,630
<i>But apparently, friendships
are more fragile than relationships.</i>

357
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,133
[metal clattering]

358
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,930
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,810
[sighs] For what?

360
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,917
I just don't know what you expected.

361
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,163
[Forty] Sport.

362
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,747
Hi.

363
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,333
So, uh...

364
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,588
Now that I know
you're not a crazy person...

365
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,174
- I gotta ask.
- [Joe]<i> And here it comes.</i>

366
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,384
What are your intentions with my sister?

367
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,928
[Joe] <i>Apologize to you, marry you,</i>

368
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,806
<i>send your brother
out of strangulation's reach.</i>

369
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,974
Intentions?

370
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,058
Yeah.

371
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,061
Not to be all like, you know...

372
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,771
but um...

373
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,690
if you were to hurt my sister,

374
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,736
I could make life
very difficult for you at the store.

375
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,149
Love and I are just friends.

376
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,033
Don't get me wrong, she's amazing.
I'm the problem.

377
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,545
I'm kinda getting over some stuff,
you know?

378
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,870
I'm working on myself.

379
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,996
Oh, shit.

380
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,747
Dude, are you...

381
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,083
Are you in recovery?

382
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,375
- [Joe]<i> Nope.</i>
- Kinda.

383
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,836
Man, me too. Which... which program?

384
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,337
SLAA?

385
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,506
Wait.

386
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,842
Just because I choose to live so openly
does not mean you have to answer that.

387
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,470
I'm in AA, and you know...

388
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,679
for right now...

389
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,431
that's enough.

390
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:21,975
Thanks, man.

391
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,894
[chuckling] Yeah. You know, I um...

392
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,815
actually have this killer idea
for, like, a psychological thriller

393
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,359
set in the world of celebrity rehab.

394
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,276
[Joe chuckles]

395
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Let me guess.

396
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,531
An addiction counselor
turns out to be a celebrity stalker?

397
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,407
Holy shit.

398
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,245
I think you just cracked it.
Are you... are you a writer?

399
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,621
I'm just a reader.

400
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,414
Speaking of Love...

401
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,793
does she seem off to you?

402
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,254
I think I might have offended her.

403
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,755
[Forty] I wouldn't sweat it.

404
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,383
She's, like, very wound up lately. [sighs]

405
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,135
She's always baking.

406
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,137
But like...

407
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,847
who bakes for the baker?

408
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,723
You know?

409
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,685
[Joe]<i> Your brother's right.</i>

410
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>I've been taking your talents
and you for granted.</i>

411
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,402
<i>Maybe in my attempt to give you space,</i>

412
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,863
<i>our friendship's become one-sided.</i>

413
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,074
<i>Maybe I can feed you like you feed me.</i>

414
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,577
[Delilah] Don't walk out on me!
Ellie, stop right there!

415
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,081
Are you or are you not
dicking around with Henderson?

416
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,625
[Joe] <i>Good, Delilah, set her straight.</i>

417
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,211
Are you or are you not spying on me?

418
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,922
You were at his not-so-secret set.

419
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,382
Not exactly discreet.

420
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,468
- How much did you pay Will to follow me?
- What are you talking about?

421
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,672
The house manager texted me.
She's one of my tipsters.

422
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,848
[sighs] Listen, Ellie...

423
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,516
Henderson is bad news.

424
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,185
- You need to believe me.
- Why?

425
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,437
I don't even know what happened
between you two

426
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,314
because you won't tell me
anything about it.

427
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,916
Maybe because there's nothing to tell.

428
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,443
[chuckling]
You're a walking after school special.

429
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,862
Hey, not everything is a story, okay?

430
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,072
You think everyone is damaged
because you're damaged.

431
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,866
Matter of fact, you love damage so much,

432
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,868
you made it your full-time job,

433
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,119
and it turned you ugly.

434
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,461
[knocking on door]

435
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,796
Oh, hey.

436
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,756
One,

437
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,342
what the fuck are you doing
creeping around my sister?

438
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,802
Two, why the fuck would you not tell me?

439
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,387
Delilah, I ran into her.

440
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,431
The last thing I wanted was any of this,

441
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,642
but so you know,
I actually <i>did</i> try to talk to her,

442
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,393
and she said... she said it was harmless.

443
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,562
Oh, okay. Yeah, good neighboring, okay.

444
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,397
Did you reach her little heart

445
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,732
with your little words?

446
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,567
She's 15, Will!

447
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,171
Doesn't matter what she thinks
because the age of consent is 18.

448
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,780
She said it was an internship.

449
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,448
Really.

450
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,658
How can I help?

451
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,284
Just... [huffs]

452
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,828
stay the hell out of the way
while I take down the bad man.

453
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,579
What are you gonna do?

454
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,415
Same thing Ronan Farrow does,

455
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,834
except faster and with a personal agenda.

456
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,888
It's only a matter of time
before I Harvey the shit out of Henderson.

457
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,800
I have rumors and sources,
and eventually I'm gonna have evidence.

458
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,513
- [door opens and closes]
- [Joe]<i> Her heart's in the right place.</i>

459
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,058
<i>I just wish I could trust Delilah
to protect her little sister.</i>

460
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,645
<i>More to the point,
I wish I could trust Ellie, period.</i>

461
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,649
<i>Full disclosure,
I put some family-friendly spyware</i>

462
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,277
<i>on the new phone I gave her
to protect myself.</i>

463
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,655
<i>Crazy the lengths parents have to go to
to keep an eye on their kids these days.</i>

464
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,716
<i>- Now, it's going to help me...</i>
- It's a new phone.

465
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,825
[Joe]<i>...protect her.</i>

466
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,996
<i>I wasn't lying, Love. The last thing
I want to be in is her business.</i>

467
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,915
<i>But I meant it when I said
I'll make myself worthy of you.</i>

468
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,503
<i>That means not turning a blind eye
to obvious cries for help from a child.</i>

469
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,866
<i>Here's what I've learned so far.</i>

470
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,632
<i>Teenagers' inner lives are,
on the outside, boring</i>

471
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>and borderline nonsensical.</i>

472
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,177
<i>In Ellie's defense,</i>

473
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,221
<i>she's smarter than her chuckle buddies.</i>

474
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,348
<i>Bottom line, though,
Henderson's correspondence</i>

475
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,726
<i>seems as benign as the others.</i>

476
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,728
<i>She seems to be working for him.</i>

477
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,564
<i>He seems to respect her taste.</i>

478
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,608
<i>And all of their texts are about films,</i>

479
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,485
<i>which brings us to tonight's event:</i>

480
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,364
<i>obscure film screening
with a group of mixed-gender adults.</i>

481
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,492
<i>Not my idea of a good time,
but, I gotta say, harmless.</i>

482
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,495
<i>I think I can stand down,
which is a relief because, frankly,</i>

483
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,373
<i>I've gotta focus
on salvaging our friendship.</i>

484
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,168
<i>Let's face it, me baking for the baker</i>

485
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,211
<i>is a one-way ticket to a kitchen fire.</i>

486
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,340
<i>So I'm getting creative
and I owe my inspiration to your brother.</i>

487
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,176
Love and I
were making our own breakfast

488
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,345
from total junk every morning.

489
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,554
[knocking on door]

490
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,099
[chuckling] Oh, no.

491
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,018
I stole it from work.

492
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,728
Don't tell my boss.

493
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,811
Okay.

494
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,774
Fancy!

495
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,779
Mm! It smells like absolutely nothing.

496
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,488
Well...

497
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,575
That, my friend, is where you are wrong.

498
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,453
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

499
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,372
<i>Merci.</i>

500
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,790
<i>Et voilà!</i>

501
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,210
Chilla Wafers?

502
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,754
I have not had this since I was a kid.

503
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,173
- Forty put you up to this.
- Kind of.

504
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,551
But he neglected to mention
you call them "Chilla Wafers."

505
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,387
Oh, yes. This is an art.

506
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,431
You take the challah,
you soak it in the cocoa,

507
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,309
then you take that wet blob
and you put it between two wafers.

508
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,978
- That sounds delicious.
- Will, it is...

509
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,064
[smacks lips]...terrible.

510
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,347
- [chuckling]
- Like, inedible.

511
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,901
Please don't actually try this. [chuckles]

512
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,904
It's the thought that counts.

513
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,202
And so, uh...

514
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,788
What is this called?

515
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,124
It's breakfast, it's lunch,
sometimes it's dinner.

516
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,647
It was the best I could do as a kid.

517
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,627
Which, you know, well, uh, it's pathetic.

518
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,212
Anyway, try it. Try it.

519
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,633
[Joe moaning] Uh...

520
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,467
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,471
I am so sorry.
I did not mean for this to be romantic.

522
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,849
Are you kidding?

523
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,934
I mean, look at this.

524
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,690
Are you a sociopath? I mean...

525
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,985
I told you, I'm... This is...
I'm trying to not hurt you.

526
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,779
And I told you that's stupid
and giving me zero credit.

527
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,342
Okay, I don't... [stuttering]
I don't care what you think you are,

528
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,160
I care about your actions, what...

529
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,828
what you <i>do.</i>

530
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,706
And these mixed signals, I mean...

531
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,085
peak shitty.

532
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,882
[door shuts]

533
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,099
[whispering] Oh, Love.

534
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,894
[girl vomiting loudly]

535
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,899

537
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,783
[sighs]

538
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,619
I'd like to ask if you're okay,

539
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,542
but I don't wanna be accused
of hitting on you.

540
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,621
What do you care?

541
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,510
I don't want the plants
to be over-watered.

542
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,127
[coughs, sniffles]

543
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,664
- Ellie, if something happened to you...
- Oh, my God.

544
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,507
Just shut up about Henderson.

545
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,841
It's not his fault, okay?

546
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,344
- What do you mean?
- We were all watching a movie.

547
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,845
There were snacks.

548
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,596
I ate...

549
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,057
something.

550
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,353
Next thing I knew,
I was lying on the balcony.

551
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,480
[stuttering] Henderson was a good guy.

552
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,483
He chewed Jonah out for the edibles

553
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,109
and he even paid for my town car.

554
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,280
Ellie, are you saying you don't remember,
like you lost time?

555
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,364
[Ellie] Don't.

556
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,242
You sound like Delilah.

557
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,245
Shit. You can't tell my sister.

558
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,039
She'll blow things
<i>way </i>out of proportion. Please.

559
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,250
Please don't tell her.

560
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,127
Okay.

561
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,464
I won't tell Delilah.

562
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,007
[Ellie coughs]

563
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,718
[continues coughing]

564
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,764
[Joe] <i>I'll just have to do
the parenting myself.</i>

565
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,728
[gate squeaking]

566
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,939
[gate slams]

567
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,853
Tell me how to hack a celebrity.

568
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,284
I...

569
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,454
require more information.

570
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,916
Henderson. An underage girl.

571
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,084
Probably dozens.

572
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,668
That's all you need.

573
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,797
Okay, but hacking?
What are you looking for?

574
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,216
Evidence he's a pervert,
something that'll take him down.

575
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,718
[Will sighs]

576
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,601
Are you doing this for the baker?

577
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,852
No.

578
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,562
I'm trying to protect a kid.

579
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,688
[Will chuckles]

580
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,942
No offense, but you don't strike me
as the vigilante type.

581
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:55,363
Which means you're getting something
out of this other than altruism.

582
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,781
Like...

583
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,199
sense of self-worth?

584
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,577
To prove you're a good person?

585
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Will...

586
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,246
listen to me closely.

587
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,459
If you don't quit the faux shrink bullshit
right now and help me,

588
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,502
I will know you are a bad person,

589
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,714
and I have no trouble
doing bad things to bad people.

590
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,175
I...

591
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,512
bow to your superior self-justification.

592
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,850
I can probably hack the man,

593
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,102
but first I require two things.

594
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,229
One,

595
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,648
the dude's jacktop.

596
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,276
No celeb keeps gross shit
on the cloud or their phone

597
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,654
since Celebgate 2014.

598
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,740
So if he's smart,
he's got a dedicated perv device, hence...

599
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,492
Jacktop, okay.

600
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,284
What's the other thing?

601
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,703
A second laptop.

602
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,412
With WiFi.

603
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,581
Not a chance.

604
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,834
I need to download my tools, man.

605
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,213
Unless you know <i>Python, Perl, Lisp...</i>

606
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,549
There are ten ways you could send
an SOS with one minute of WiFi...

607
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,635
<i>Linux, Nexus, Hashcat...</i>

608
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,470
Or I could teach you how to hack.

609
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,306
By the time we're done,
your victim will be of legal age.

610
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,065
[scoffs]

611
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,901
What is going on with you today, huh?
What is this?

612
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,863
Don't blame <i>me.</i> You're the one who has
all the time in the world to work out.

613
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,240
I've been swamped.

614
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,283
I've been managing our parents' store,

615
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,743
rewriting my feature,

616
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,995
and now I'm in development
on <i>False Promises</i> with Will.

617
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,791
It's like Promises in Malibu,

618
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,376
but with fake people.

619
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,710
Yeah.

620
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,129
I get it.

621
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,007
Didn't know you two
were spending so much time together.

622
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,302
Why are you so prickly about Will, huh?

623
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,847
Is something going on?

624
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,057
If something's going on,
you should tell me

625
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,184
because... twinsparency.

626
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,562
You know, it's really funny

627
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,606
how you only seem to care
about twinsparency

628
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,608
when you have <i>nothing </i>going on.

629
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,445
Wow! Wow!

630
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,196
Fuck that. Come on.

631
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,366
You know I'm just trying to protect you.

632
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,785
Why are you all up in my shit today?

633
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,997
Because you're avoiding.

634
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,169
You keep glomming onto people thinking
that's what's gonna make you successful.

635
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,503
Will can't help you.

636
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,505
<i>You </i>need to help you.

637
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,968
Why don't you just do the work?

638
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,933
Or maybe you're threatened
by the possibility

639
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,270
that Will and I could become closer
than you ever could.

640
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,690
Good game.

641
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,027
Yeah, write a script.

642
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,488
Fuck.

00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,037
Yeah.

694
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,862
- Great show.
- Oh, thanks, man.

695
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,584
- You used to be in <i>WolfJizz,</i> right?
- Oh, yeah, totes.

696
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,502
And that team had instant group mind.

697
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,672
Totes. I saw you at Del Close
a couple years back.

698
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,758
Eugene said you were a must-see.

699
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,884
Oh, you know Eugene?

700
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,845
[Joe] <i>He's but the tip
of a second-hand bullshit iceberg.</i>

701
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,722
Man, Eugene is the best teacher

702
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,806
I've ever had.

703
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,224
Such strong initiations.

704
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,268
Like, I got to guest spot
a few fuck around shows,

705
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,271
and watching him and Billy
and Henderson mind-meld...

706
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,982
- It's church.
- They're good, yeah.

707
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,943
You know? So I just moved from New York.

708
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,404
You and Hendy
used to be on a Harold team, right?

709
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,168
[chuckling] Oh, Chudthumper?
You know that?

710
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,659
- Yes! Your object work was brilliant.
- That group was crazy.

711
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,410
Oh, thanks, man.

712
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,040
Hey, uh, speaking of Hendy, you know
about the after-show thing at this place?

713
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,523
- No, but it'd be sweet to catch up.
- Yeah, you should come.

714
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,754
Gate code is D-I-C-K-S. [laughing]

715
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,798
- Classic Henderson, right?
- Classic.

716
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,383
- I'll see you there?
- Yeah.

717
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,301
Chudthumper...

718
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,262
[Joe]<i> Well, that was only mildly debasing.</i>

719
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,808
<i>Now, all I need
is to slip in and out with a jacktop,</i>

720
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,060
<i>unnoticed in a stream of white guys.</i>

721
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,146
<i>I know, I'm using my privilege for good.</i>

722
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,941
[Forty] Old sport?

723
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,318
What are you doing here?

724
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,946
[Joe]<i> No. No way. Did he follow me?</i>

725
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,781
I hit it off with someone at the theater.

726
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,741
Did you and Henderson make up?

727
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,703
Not yet, but I'm seizing the bull.

728
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,121
I'm... I'm doing the work.

729
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,874
I'm gonna pitch <i>False Promises</i>
live and in the flesh.

730
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,502
So go ahead.

731
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,214
[Joe]<i> Poor bastard didn't even get
an invite.</i>

732
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,258
<i>So much for unnoticed.</i>

733
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,134
[keypad beeping]

734
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,221
<i>Forgive me, Love,
I've gotta ditch your brother, ASAP.</i>

735
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,472
[Forty giggles]

736
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,641
"Dicks." Classic.

737
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,773
[indistinct chatter, indie music playing]

738
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,434
[Henderson] I want to know who from
the Family got cut from the guest list.

739
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,459
[woman laughing]

740
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,377
Take care. Send me the pic.

741
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,880
[Forty] See that chick?
That's Henderson's agent.

742
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,715
- I'm gonna find a bathroom.
- Okay.

743
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,512
[Joe] <i>It's risky to leave Forty
in a force field of anti-sobriety,</i>

744
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,431
<i>but I'm not his babysitter.</i>

745
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,099
<i>I'm here for Ellie.</i>

746
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,899
Tina.

747
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,777
[Tina chuckles nervously]

748
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,694
Tina.

749
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,821
Forty. It's been a minute.

750
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,865
Oh, what are you working on these days?

751
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,866
I'm so glad you asked.

752
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,952
I have got this psycho-sexual thriller

753
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,705
set in a, um, a celebrity rehab facility

754
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,124
that I think Henderson
would be perfect for.

755
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,292
It's real, it's fucked up,

756
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,415
- funny, star vehicle...
- Oh, wow. How does it end?

757
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,464
Well, you would need to know
the beginning and the middle...

758
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,840
Wow, sounds promising.

759
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,384
- Yeah, let's set up a meeting and we can...
- No.

760
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,136
Mm-mm. No way.

761
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,555
[chuckling] Why?

762
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,100
Forty, you know when people
talk about having <i>it?</i>

763
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,476
You don't have it.

764
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,146
<i>It </i>is a combination of talent
and work ethic.

765
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,731
And I'm telling you this to help you

766
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,901
because you can have ideas
and nothing to say.

767
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,195
But here's the silver lining:

768
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,363
you're rich.

769
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,948
You don't need to struggle.

770
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,075
You could, like, finance
indie films or something.

771
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,077
You'd be so good. You're so fun.

772
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,329
- [Forty laughs]
- Think about it, okay?

773
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,290
I love you.
I'm trying to protect you. Mwah!

774
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,583
Mm-hmm.

775
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,050
[Joe] <i>Henderson's inner sanctum.</i>

776
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,636
<i>It's so... normal.</i>

777
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:44,142
<i>It's a certain kind of assault,
but bad taste does not a predator make.</i>

778
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,311
<i>I wonder how many people Josh alienated</i>

779
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,814
<i>as he climbed the mountain
to become Henderson.</i>

780
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,402
<i>And how many girls Henderson traumatized
once he had all the power.</i>

781
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,080
[Forty]<i> It's Chekhov's knife.</i>

782
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,915
And as soon as we see it,

783
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,376
then you know throats are gonna get cut.

784
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,046
But we don't know whose,
and we don't know why.

785
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,217
Sure, she's...
she's cutting an apple right now,

786
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:22,847
but the audience
is gonna be subconsciously terrified...

787
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,056
[Joe] <i>Oh, shit.</i>

788
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,642
...for the human apple.

789
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,019
[man] It's powerful, man.

790
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,144
Old sport!

791
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,940
I am pitching <i>False Promises</i>

792
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,359
to these fine fuckers,

793
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,111
and I'm on page six,

794
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,156
which now that I'm saying it out loud,

795
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,699
feels like page three.

796
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,005
[Joe]<i> I should leave, I should just leave,</i>

797
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,662
<i>go help Ellie, let Forty screw Forty.</i>

798
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,843
[Forty, echoing] Sport? Sport.

799
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,637
[shutter clicks]

800
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,180
Forty, hey...

801
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,599
Forty, your sister's asking for you.
Let's get out of here.

802
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,808
No.

803
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,227
Boo-oo!

804
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,519
Party foul!

805
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,730
Tell her... tell her I'm mid-pitch.

806
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,857
I'm <i>en fuego.</i> She'll get it.

807
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,858
Forty!

808
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,195
Please, let me take you home. Come on.
You don't want her to see you like this.

809
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,156
- [male party-goer] Yo, Captain Buzzkill!
- Why not?

810
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,159
This is exactly...

811
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,787
what she expects, promise.

812
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,791
Do you have any idea how painful it is

813
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,502
disappointing someone who is that perfect?

814
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,921
You would be surprised.

815
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,966
Hey, you know what?

816
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,385
You need to be drinking that swill
if you're doing blow.

817
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,971
- Get down. Hey, easy, easy.
- [Forty] Henderson, Henderson.

818
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,808
- Yeah, no, I have a pitch for you.
- We got a lot of catching up to do, buddy.

819
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,477
All right? But let's just, uh,
not mix business with pleasure.

820
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,438
Let's just call Tina and we'll set up
a meet with the both of us.

821
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,274
[Joe]<i> Henderson's trying to help.</i>

822
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,943
- No, I'm... I'm good. Let's talk.
- No, no, I know you're good.

823
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,826
As a matter of fact,
I'm the one that's tired.

824
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,781
Actually... Everybody, guys,
I'm tired, so...

825
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
[party-goers booing]

826
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,660
All right, whatever.
Fuck you, young people.

827
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,163
I'm in my 30s, I'm down a nut,
and I need my eight hours, so good night!

828
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,499
[Joe]<i> Did this guy just tank his own party</i>

829
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,668
<i>to make Forty feel better about leaving?</i>

830
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,546
- Oh, Henderson, man, I owe you an apology.
- No, shh.

831
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,590
- I'm really sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey. You're a delicious prince.

832
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,674
Okay?

833
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,843
Get home safe.

834
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,303
Bygones are bygones.

835
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,972
Here, I'll get you to Love's, okay?

836
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,182
No, no! No, please, please.

837
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,519
I don't... I don't want to go to somewhere
funded by Quinn blood money.

838
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,479
Don't... don't you get the curse yet?

839
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,981
Okay, okay, then we'll go to mine.

840
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,064
- Okay.
- All right?

841
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,193
Hey, buddy, do I know you?

842
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,863
[Forty grunting]

843
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,408
Will. We, uh... we met at a party, Valley.

844
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,244
- Oh, the finger guy, right? Yeah.
- Yes.

845
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,371
You're Delilah's friend.
So you know Ellie.

846
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,788
Yes.

847
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,457
And...

848
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,209
she's very smart.

849
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,836
Did you just yes-and my small talk?

850
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,380
Yes, and I regret it.

851
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,299
Hey, keep practicing.
That was really good.

852
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,345
She... Ellie is...
Is she your intern or...?

853
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,348
Yeah, that kid is so, so smart.

854
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,351
Ah, it's the least a privileged
white male asshole can do.

855
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,234
[Forty puking]

856
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,028
[breathing heavily]

857
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,905
[knocking on door]

[Forty groans]

859
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,574
Hey.

860
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,952
- What did he take?
- No idea.

861
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,371
It happened so fast.

862
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,872
[Forty] I'm sorry.

863
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,831
I'm really sorry.

864
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,124
[Love] What did you take?

865
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,210
[Forty puking]

866
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,194
Would you mind putting on some tea?

867
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,546
[Forty grunting]

868
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,423
[whining] I'm sorry.

869
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,729
There you go.

870
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,984
Do you think I'm talented?

871
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,486
Of course I do.

872
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,157
- That's why I push you.
- But...

873
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,909
do I have to, like...

874
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,746
live in a shitbox like this
to be a real artist?

875
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,830
Like...

876
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,083
where even are we?

877
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,667
[stern] Hey.

878
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,795
You're with me.

879
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,505
Always will be.

880
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,717
And that's all that matters.

881
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,553
What's the point?

882
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,558
Even if I made something really good now,

883
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,685
nobody is gonna care about it.

884
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,853
That's not true.

885
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,273
Whatever you write, I can't wait...

886
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,065
to read it

887
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,818
'cause it's gonna come from you.

888
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,952
I'm sorry I didn't look after
your brother tonight.

889
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,788
It's not your job.

890
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,457
It's mine.

891
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,253
And Forty's fragile.

892
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,134
Life just keeps kicking the shit
out of him.

893
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,429
Always has since we were kids.

894
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,517
Everybody sees the money.
They don't understand he never...

895
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,895
[inhales and exhales deeply]

896
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,522
He never had a chance.

897
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,693
Oh, when he was little, he was confident.

898
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,905
Creative.

899
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,533
<i>So </i>sweet.

900
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,495
[sighs] Then, this one summer...

901
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,708
the year my parents launched Anavrin,

902
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,252
they left us with this...

903
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,797
fucking crazy <i>au pair.</i>

904
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,633
Forty saw way too much, too young.

905
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,511
Now I'm the one
who picks up the pieces because...

906
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,596
he needs someone.

907
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,142
He's a good person.

908
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,979
He just does some bad things sometimes.

909
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,897
I'm sorry.

910
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,731
That's hard.

911
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,900
But that's love.

912
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,444
[Love chuckles softly]

913
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,488
See, this is what I'm talking about.

914
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,367
I'm not perfect either.

915
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,579
Codependent brother...

916
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,788
A widow...

917
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,294
You haven't even met my parents yet.

918
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,840
You deserve better...

919
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,385
than <i>another </i>broken soul.

920
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,387
We're all a little broken.

921
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,643
Yet some pieces still manage
to fit together.

922
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,637
- [Joe groans]
- Shh! He's sleeping.

923
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,932
[snoring]

924
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,144
[both breathing heavily]

925
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,438
[Love moans gently]

926
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,317
[Joe grunts]

927
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,277
[shushes]

928
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,573
I told you.

929
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,368
We have to be quiet.

930
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,885
[Love moans loudly]

931
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,056
[muffled moaning]

932
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,558
[Love grunting]

933
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,148
[both grunting louder]

934
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,165
[Joe]<i> You're a different kind of
woman, Love.</i>

935
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,754
<i>This time will be different.</i>

936
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,384
<i>I will never hurt you.</i>

937
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,344
<i>If anything, we can heal each other,</i>

938
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,306
<i>and I promise, I'll never take
your cooking for granted again.</i>

939
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,644
[Forty] Morning, old sport.

940
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,479
How do you like your eggs?

941
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,189
Sunny side up.

942
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,526
[Joe]<i> And I will try my hardest to accept</i>

943
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,028
<i>being in a damn throuple
with your brother.</i>

944
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,500
[tapping] How much longer?

945
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,335
Ask the shitty burner you bought.

946
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,545
[Will inhales]

947
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,091
Well, good news,

948
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,468
dude was easy to crack.

949
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,179
The bad news, the dude was clean.

950
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,930
It's impossible.

951
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,684
I scrubbed all his files, accounts,

952
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,561
search history, Pornhub.

953
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,731
[Joe]<i> Well, I did my job.</i>

954
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,400
<i>If I'm willing to put my faith in Love,</i>

955
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,861
<i>then maybe Ellie deserves the same trust.</i>

956
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,738
<i>She's smart.</i>

957
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,821
How you feeling?

958
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,367
Embarrassed.

959
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,746
Hey, I'm really sorry
I puked in such close proximity to you.

960
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,206
- Ah...
- It was a bad edible.

961
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,289
So gross.

962
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,170
Thanks for not narcing me out.

963
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,338
It's on your list.

964
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,924
A bookseller gets murdered
in the first 20 minutes,

965
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,635
so, uh... if it's too much for you,
I'll understand.

966
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,638
All right, gotta get to Hendy's.

967
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,225
The hustle never stops, William.

968
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,560
You're gonna come home
to the first book on your list.

969
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,562
- It's a hardcover.
- I'm already bored.

970
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,071
[Joe]<i> For Ellie, something dark,</i>

971
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,823
<i>funny, ambitious,</i>

972
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,742
<i>a break from the dreck
that crosses Henderson's desk.</i>

973
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,119
Bettelheim.

974
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,790
- [Joe]<i> Oh, speaking of.</i>
- So here is the crusher.

975
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,792
I have been...

976
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,502
giving it some thought,

977
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,505
and I don't think <i>False Promises</i>
is gonna happen.

978
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,341
It's a short story, not a feature film.

979
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,969
Oh, I'm sorry. That's a real shame.

980
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,513
It's okay.
We'll think of something better, right?

981
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,807
A real showcase for Henderson.

982
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,518
My lunch with him
is still on the books for next week, so...

983
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,188
That's great.

984
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,606
Hey, can I ask?

985
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,193
What happened between you two?

986
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,781
You know, I don't actually remember
much of the night in question.

987
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:52,035
I mean, there was not much at that party
that wasn't in my system.

988
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,665
It was all gonna...
come up eventually, right? [chuckles]

989
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,626
Just wish it hadn't been
all over his secret toy room.

990
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,589
- Secret toy room?
- Yeah.

991
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,841
It's one of those old Prohibition houses

992
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,343
with the hidden speakeasy doors.

993
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,805
Henderson has transformed it
into this whimsical little...

994
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,474
creepy dungeon, I guess.

995
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,519
And I went full <i>Exorcist </i>on that shit,
just like...

996
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,313
[imitates demon]

997
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,814
You said it's creepy.

998
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,568
Imagine if you collected kids' stuff,

999
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:30,115
yet also were low-key
a bit of a fucking sadist in the sack.

1000
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,160
- That.
- [Joe]<i> A secret room.</i>

1001
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,244
Huh.

1002
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,788
I'm disappointed I missed <i>that.</i>

00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,042
