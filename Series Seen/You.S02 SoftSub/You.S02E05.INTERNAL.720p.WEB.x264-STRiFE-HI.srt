00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,522
I cannot believe
there are no charging stations.

3
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,025
Fucking Arizona.

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,070
Well, we could call a tow,

5
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,198
but, uh, you know, what the fuck,
it's gonna take way too long.

6
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,867
Let's just take the PJ.

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,994
I know jets are wasteful,

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,079
but I don't want you driving
through the night,

9
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,247
and my mom...

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,458
really hates it when people are late.

11
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,127
God, I cannot wait for you to meet her.

12
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,553
- What time is Love getting there?
- Who knows?

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,884
She's on her new boyfriend's dick
like herpes.

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,611
Don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but...

15
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,804
Will, right? She's bringing him?

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,180
Yep.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,185
[Candace]<i> Move, Joe.</i>

18
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,936
Wait, stop! Stop!

19
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,313
Stop, Candace.

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,314
I love you.

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,523
Just let me go.

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,983
Tell me you don't love me.

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,736
I don't! I don't love you.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,321
I never have.

25
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,199
What are you gonna do about it, Joe?

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,117
Don't do this!

27
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,785
Stop!

28
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,839
Looks like it's gonna be
a proper meet-the-parents Wellkend.

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,590
Oh! [clears throat]

30
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,633
Hi. Yeah.

31
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,010
Forty Quinn here.

32
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,304
Yes, like the number, but spelled out.

33
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,098
F-O...

34
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,016

00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,737
[Joe]<i> I now truly understand
the term "love of my life."</i>

37
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,865
<i>My life makes sense now with you in it.</i>

38
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,827
<i>Complete. Not closed.</i>

39
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,789
<i>More open to the world
and everything beautiful than ever before.</i>

40
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,958
<i>Nothing to hide.</i>

41
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>You've asked me to meet the parents.</i>

42
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>Might be messy, family can be.</i>

43
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,714
<i>But whatever comes,
we'll get through it, together.</i>

[groans]

46
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,136
I don't wanna.

47
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,263
Can your parents really be that bad?

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,932
Worse. They can be worse.

49
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,101
Okay, remember,

50
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,770
they charm so that they can manipulate.

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,897
My mom is a lot.

52
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,649
Just give in to her crazy.

53
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,693
And my dad is impenetrable.

54
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,528
Just don't take it personally.

55
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,071
Try not to.

56
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,239
I still do.

57
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,491
Is there anything I can do to support you?

58
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,410
We could have a signal.

59
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Like...

60
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,248
What is that? Are... Are you Spider-Man?

61
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,667
[chuckles] No, no.

62
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,460
Um, it's... it's, uh...

63
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,713
ASL for "I love you."

64
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,884
In, like, a friendly
you know, like, platonic way.

65
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,093
[Joe]<i> I love you.</i>

66
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,555
<i>In the non-friendly way,</i>

67
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,099
<i>but I'm waiting to say it.</i>

68
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,934
<i>Why rush when we have
the rest of our lives?</i>

69
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,020
[Love] Hmm!

70
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,606
My dad's gonna like that shirt.

71
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,566
[Joe]<i> I know. I do my research.</i>

72
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,820
<i>America's surrogate dream parents,
Ray and Dottie Quinn.</i>

73
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,864
<i>Ray is a Pasadena golden boy</i>

74
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,449
<i>who comes from old-school money.</i>

75
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,327
<i>Dottie is the spark plug
that gives him life.</i>

76
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>They met in the naked hot tubs
at Esalen,</i>

77
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,705
<i>eloped shortly thereafter.</i>

78
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,166
<i>Joan Baez is rumored to have officiated.</i>

79
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,295
<i>Dottie opened Anavrin
with Ray's family cash.</i>

80
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,505
<i>What started as a pet project has evolved</i>

81
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,175
<i>into a global brand largely due to Dottie,</i>

82
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,720
<i>all centered on the Quinn family motto,</i>

83
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,889
<i>"Transparency and realness."</i>

84
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,683
<i>This weekend is Ray and Dottie's
30th anniversary,</i>

<i>and they're making up
for their quickie wedding</i>

86

<i>with a wellness bacchanal.</i>

87
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,269
<i>Ray and Dottie's vow renewal
will be the culmination</i>

88

<i>of packed community...

89
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,359
<i>"Wellkend."</i>

90
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,444
<i>Shoot me in the face.</i>

91

<i>But whatever you need, Love.</i>

92

00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,204
- [Joe]<i> Speaking of messy family...</i>
- Hey.

95
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,457
<i>Did you know Ja Rule
and Ashanti never banged?</i>

96
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,625
Okay. And?

97
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,920
I don't know, it just kind of ruins it
for me knowing their love was never real.

98
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,422
Can you check out?
It fucks up inventory when you steal.

99
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,426
- Is that kombucha?
<i>- Stop being so codependent, okay?</i>

100
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,430
'Buch has about as much alcohol in it
as fresh-pressed juice,

101
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,599
and I want to pour one out for Henderson.

102
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,851
Because it was our thing.

103
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,854
[Forty]<i> Did you hear they're saying
it was a suicide now?</i>

104
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,440
<i>Too good for this world.</i>

105
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,152
[Joe]<i> Another melancholy clown
dies by his own hand,</i>

106
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,613
<i>and his adoring fans
and acquaintances grieve deeply</i>

107
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,074
<i>for, oh, about the next one
to two news cycles.</i>

108
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,368
Are you making it to meetings?

109
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,203
I'm in such a positive place right now

110
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,998
and AA is a breeding ground of negativity.

111
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,708
Speaking of circle jerks,

112
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,710
<i>you still coming to Mom and Dad's
Wank-end?</i>

113
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,128
Yes, of course.

114
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,544
Forty, just promise me
that you won't do anything...

115
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,966
Gotta go. Amy's in the whip.

116
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,467
[phone beeps]

117
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,930
Is everything okay?

118
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,014
Yeah.

119
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,686
No. [sighs]

120
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,605
Forty's gonna go off the rails again.
I can tell.

121
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,399
It's gonna be bad.

122
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,359
You like the girl he just met, right?

123
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,403
Sure.

124
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,364
We went to the movies.

125
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,283
We didn't even talk.

126
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,286
What can I say? He's on pattern.

127
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:32,123
Meets a girl, each a new
impossible-to-predict type of bad for him,

128
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,625
and then he tries
to get our parents to like her,

129
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,878
then he flings himself off a cliff
when they don't.

130
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,713
[Joe]<i> Leaving you to clean the splatter.</i>

131
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,256
I can neutralize.

132
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,884
I can distract. I'm good with parents.

133
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,761
We got this.

134
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,765
[Ellie] Sure, I could tell you
were my sister is, but...

135
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,891
what is this about?

136
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,684
[man] It's about Joshua Bunter.

137
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,454
- You might know him as...
- [Joe] <i>Henderson.</i>

138
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,646
<i>Clearly, I need to be
in two places at once,</i>

139
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,106
<i>with you and near Ellie.</i>

140
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,274
Just crossing the T's here.

141
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,438
We know from Henderson's IMs he was
planning on seeing your sister that night.

142
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,238
Yeah, I don't read the news.

143
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,699
It's, like, so depressing,
but I... I thought he...

144
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,825
offed himself.

145
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,468
[Joe]<i> Delilah's smarter than these guys.</i>

146
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,330
[detective] Yeah, well, it seems that way.

147
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,750
[Joe]<i> And I've got parental tech
to keep an eye on Ellie</i>

148
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,836
<i>and the fallout
from Hendy's tragic suicide.</i>

149
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,296
Well, Ellie's not home right now,

150
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,549
but I can call you when she is
if you want, or, like...

151
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,177
Oh, no. I have to go into work.

152
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,469
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,845
Bye.

154
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,607
Were you at Henderson's
the night he died, Ellie?

155
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,649
What are these?

156
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,923
- What do you think they are?
- Don't evade with a question.

157
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,865
- You evaded with a question first!
- Jesus!

158
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,617
Half the time you treat me like an adult,

159
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,870
but, wait, suddenly, I'm a kid because
you can't get it together to be an adult?

160
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,122
You really wanna know?

161
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,251
Those are Henderson's.

162
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,671
No, they're not.

163
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,840
They're random.

164
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,967
They're... He's not even in 'em.
They're just...

165
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,051
I know...

166
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,139
because he did it to me.

167
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,476
I don't believe you.

168
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,482
- Where's your photo then?
- You don't believe me? You need proof?

169
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,612
Listen, don't get mad at me because
he was a bad guy and you fell for it.

170
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,989
He was my friend!

171
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,116
He wasn't your friend, Ellie!
Let me guess.

172
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,137
He made you promise not to tell anyone
you were hanging out alone together?

173
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,162
Basic predator move.

174
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,247
You are a lot of things...

175
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,207
but you're not stupid.

176
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,793
[Ellie sobs]

177
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,719
[new age music playing]

178
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,734
[Lucy and Sunrise chuckling]

179
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,195
[Lucy] Ah, ooh, ooh! Hi.

180
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,946
- Hello.
- Hi, babe.

181
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,073
[Love] Oh, my God,
I'm so glad you guys are here.

182
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,158
Oh, my God.

183
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,159
[both moaning]

184
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,702
- How are you?
- I'm good.

185
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,953
Yeah, this is great.

186
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,348
[Joe]<i> Well, thankfully,
teenagers text emotional gibberish,</i>

187
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,832
<i>so I know Ellie's okay.</i>

188
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,584
All right, put the phone away.

189
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,378
Welcome to the Hellmouth.

190
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,713
[chuckles]

191
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,715
[Joe]<i> And I'm in a Wes Anderson movie</i>

192
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,051
<i>set in a weirdly Caucasian ashram.</i>

193
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,969
- Hey, Dad.
- Lovey, hey.

194
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,053
Hey.

195
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,347
This is Will Bettelheim.

196
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,140
Oh. You related to Bruno?

197
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,142
[Joe]<i> Ray's a not-so-secret fantasy fan.</i>

198
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,106
<i>He's referring to Bruno Bettelheim,
author of...</i>

199
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,063
<i>The Uses of Enchantment </i>is a classic.

200
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,107
No relation, I'm just a fan.
It's good to meet you, Mr. Quinn.

201
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,817
Call me Ray.

202
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,109
[woman] Will?

203
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,655
Finally we meet. [chuckles]

204
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,239
Oh!

205
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,908
You are delicious.

206
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,409
The pleasure is all mine, Dottie.

207
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,203
Come here, darling. You look beautiful.

208
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,288
- Hey, Mom.
- I'm sorry, I'm all over the place.

209
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,249
- Let's get you a drink.
- Okay.

210
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,293
Sounds good.

211
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,713
[Forty and Will grunt]

212
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,007
- Forty.
- Sport! Hi, Love.

213
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,801
Where'd she go? There she is.

214
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,427
You gotta meet my girl, Amy.

215
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,804
Amy, come here.

216
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,100
[song in slow motion]

217
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,729
Hi there. [chuckles]

218
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,274
Will Bettelheim,

219
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,357
Amy Adam.

220
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,110
Nice to meet you.

221
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,236
[Joe]<i> It can't be.</i>

222
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,946
<i>Am I hallucinating?</i>

223
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,407
<i>This is her hand, this is real.</i>

224
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,491
<i>Candace is here.</i>

225
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,492
Will Bettelheim...

226
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,035
What a great name.

227
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,704
Almost sounds made up.

228
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,290
[Joe]<i> Is she trying to spar with me?</i>

229
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,458
That's funny, I was just thinking,
"Amy Adam."

230
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,460
How totally un-google-able.

231
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,004
[all laughing]

232
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,965
[Joe]<i> This is a game to her.
She's enjoying this.</i>

233
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,425
I'm so happy to see you again.

234
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,552
[Joe]<i> She's crazy, Love.</i>

235
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,905
I'm also so hungry
I could eat my own hand, so let's...

236
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,557
- Oh, no, don't worry. Just eat mine.
- Oh! [laughs]

237
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,143
[Joe]<i> Like the kids say, "Fuck my life."</i>

238

[Candace whimpering]

239
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,697
[car engine stops]

240
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,991
Oh, good, you're awake.

241
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,327
- [Candace sobs]
- Shh-sh-sh-sh.

242
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,454
It's okay, you are totally safe.

243
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,914
I have a surprise for you.

244
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,001
[Candace whimpering]

245
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,255
Can you promise to be calm?

246
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,175
Okay, good.

247
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,013
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said. I'm an idiot.

248
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,681
Okay, I'm stupid. Let's just go home.

249
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,285
You're just saying that
because you think it's what I wanna hear.

250
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,977
No, I'm saying that

251
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,605
because I'm tied up in the back of a van.

252
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,856
I had to...

253
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,608
so we could get here...

254
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,068
to talk.

255
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,277
I am so sorry.

256
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,907
- But it's all gonna be worth it.
- Where are we?

257
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,449
Lake Mahopac.

258
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,329
You remember that amazing picnic we had?
I brought all your faves again.

259
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,414
No, just, okay...

260
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,625
I know... I know you don't want to hurt me.

261
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,794
- I would never hurt you.
- Just untie me. Untie me.

262
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,879
I can't do that yet, you know I can't.

263
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,631
Just hang on.

264
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,881
[door opens]

265
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,767
Thanks. Thank you.

266
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,105
Candace!

267
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,028
[shrieks]

268

[Candace grunting]

269
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,868
Listen, you don't understand.
Don't do this!

270
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,371
Stop! Please, don't do this!
Shh! Sh-sh-sh-sh!

271
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,372
Stop...

272
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,455
- [thuds]
- Stop!

273
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,515
[Joe]<i> How?</i>

274
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,435
<i>How did she manage this?</i>

275
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,062
So tell, tell! How you two met.

276
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,313
We're dying to hear.

277
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,291
- [Ray] Yeah, tell us.
- [Forty] Well, we were at...

278
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,900
- [Candace] South By.
- Yeah, and...

279
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,529
- Amy was giving me stalker eyes.
- I was interested, but so was he.

280
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,031
- So she reached for the <i>queso.</i>
- Oh, the <i>queso!</i>

281
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,451
- And, um, it felt like...
- It was fate.

282
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,035
Inseparable ever since.

283
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,787
[Joe]<i> Enjoy it while it lasts.</i>

284
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,290
[Forty] Yeah, we actually road-tripped
back from Austin.

285
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,250
Got to know each other
a little bit better.

286
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,210
- [both chuckle]
- And what are you doing?

287
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,629
- Amy is an indie film producer.
- [Joe]<i> Oh, come on.</i>

288
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,798
[Forty[ Yeah,
we're actually already in soft prep

289
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,925
for a film we're trying to get going.

290
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,384
[Dottie] Honey?

291
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,927
[Forty sighs]

292
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,518
He could pretend to care,
like, if he wanted to.

293
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,272
[chuckling]
Wow, these waiters are so slow!

294
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,900
Oh, you want a drink?
I'll... I'll grab you a drink, bunny.

295
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,735
Yeah, could I get a 'buch, please?

296
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,988
- Virgin, obviously.
- [chuckling] Yes.

297
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,281
[Forty] Appreciate you.

298
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,328
- [bartender] Here you go.
- Thanks.

299
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,081
What are you doing here?

300
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,751
I told you I'd show up
to give you what you deserve.

301
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,919
So here we are.

302
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,962
Merry Christmas.

303
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,050
[Joe]<i> How do I get this time bomb
away from you, Love?</i>

304
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,344
- Want to know how I found you?
- I would love to hear.

305
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,427
[scoffs]

306
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,600
[Candace] So, I was feeling like shit
one fine afternoon,

307
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,686
when I saw this clickbait
about how the stars live.

308
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,563
I mean, who doesn't need
a little escapism?

309
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,295
So I clicked and there was this link

310
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,397
about how all the cool kids
go to Henderson's house,

311
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,202
and although
I wasn't familiar with his work,

312
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,655
I was curious about this random douchebag

313
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,824
high as balls on his coffee table,

314
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,536
which is when I first set eyes
on my new dreamy <i>beau.</i> [scoffs]

315
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,997
[Joe]<i> Of course, your brother
destroyed my life,</i>

316
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,290
<i>our life.</i>

317
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,417
And he's such an idiot.

318
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,670
And I keep watching and...

319
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,631
No.

320
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,800
Couldn't be.

321
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,719
Could not be.

322
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,763
[Joe]<i> I was trying to help you, Love.</i>

323
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,598
<i>Altruism is dangerous.</i>

324
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,058
Shocked you'd choose LA.

325
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,350
But I found you.

326
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,977
Great.

327
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,437
What's the move?

328
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,857
You gonna tell them this dramatic tale?

329
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,693
I mean, it is their special weekend,

330
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,279
so I'll wait if and when I have to,

331
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,783
But in the meantime, I am going
to protect them from you, bunny.

332
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,743
[scoffs] Especially...

333
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,538
your gorgeous girl.

334
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,623
Lucky man, Will. [chuckles]

335
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,876
- I missed you, babe.
- Aw!

336
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,007
[Love] Yeah, we can, uh,
situate ourselves for dinner.

337
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,387
The fuck?

338
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,100
I didn't know you bite your nails.

339
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,228
I don't.

340
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,023
Not since I was a kid.

341
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,186
Well, what, is meeting my parents
making you nervous?

342
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,027
'Cause I don't care what they think.

343
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,195
And now I have to do this vow renewal.

344
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,282
I cannot believe
I have to call my parents "lovers."

345
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,741
Then don't.

346
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,536
- Do you.
- No, I can't. My mom gave me a script.

347
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,100
I mean, she said, "Make it your own,"

348
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,540
but I'm pretty sure
that means, "Don't change anything."

349
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,208
Do you want some space to work?

350
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,668
I can go to Forty's yurt.

351
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,506
Yeah, actually. I mean, if you don't mind.

352
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,591
No.

353
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,052
The kombucha thing
is not a good sign. I just...

354
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,137
- I know, I get it.
- Okay.

355
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,680
Don't get lost out there.

356
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,274
[Joe]<i> I will help you, helicopter sibling.</i>

357
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,278
<i>I need to keep eyes on Candace
so I can protect you from her,</i>

358
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,738
<i>but...</i>

359
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,866
<i>lest I accidentally stumble
into Jeff Bezos' lodge,</i>

360
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,452
<i>I need the blessed yurt map.</i>

361
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,370
Will?

362
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,706
Everything okay?

363
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,833
It's perfect. Thank you.

364
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,837
I just, you know,
wanted to check out the Truth Yurt.

365
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,161
- [chuckles] I was also looking for...
- Care to partake?

366
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,053
- I don't really...
- I insist you be here now.

367
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,014
Okay.

368
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,101
[Joe chuckles]

369
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,403
[Joe]<i> It's fine. I won't inhale.</i>

370
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,612
Now inhale.

371
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,906
[inhales]

372
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,742
[Joe coughs]

373
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,246
So, fresh in from New York, huh?

374
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,164
- Yeah.
- [Dottie chuckles]

375
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,750
I remember being in New York
when I was a kid.

376
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,044
Ah, to be young.

377
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Oh, you're still young.

378
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,548
Tell that to my vagina.

379
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,049
No one warns you.

380
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,635
You wake up one day drier than the Sahara.

381
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,302
If it weren't for this wonder lube
we've developed,

382
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,514
I don't know what I'd do.

383
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,143
It's already so difficult
to reach orgasm at this age.

384
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,466
[Joe]<i> Is this really happening?</i>

385
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,604
Anyways,
it seems like you understand, Will.

386
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,106
What a chin.

387
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,694
[Joe]<i> She's not flirting,
she's testing me.</i>

388
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,363
<i>I'm drugged. She hopes it's truth serum.</i>

389
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,704
I think your daughter
is the most amazing woman...

390
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,413
I've ever met.

391
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,464
I like you for Love.

392
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,636
[Joe]<i> Between the obstacle course
that is Dottie,</i>

393
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,386
<i>and the more fundamental issue,</i>

394
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,973
<i>that every millisecond
of this Wellkend is scheduled,</i>

395
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>how do I get Candace alone?</i>

396
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,518
<i>How do I do this, Love?</i>

397
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,020
<i>How do I get her away from you?</i>

398
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,024
[man]
Let the wolf awakenyour unconscious.

399
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,317
Meet your id.

400
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,573
[Joe groans quietly]

401
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,825
Hey.

402
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,165
[wolf snarls]

403
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,374
[shrieks]

404
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,251
[Candace laughing]

405
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,463
[group murmuring]

406
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,175
[Joe]<i> On the plus side,
she's striking out with the Quinns.</i>

407
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,969
Schadenfreude is karmic suicide.

408
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,770
[Forty cleans throat]

409
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,607
Dad, do you actually...
Do you have a minute?

410
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,943
Not now, son,
I've got doubles with Bozzi from the Palm.

411
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,404
Right. Sorry, Bozz.

412
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,948
- [chuckling]
- Let's go, Bozz.

413
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,950
Shit.

414
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,576
It's okay.

415
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,788
Forty always...

416
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,042
you know, tries to impress our parents
with these girls.

417
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,670
Can you just help?

418
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,923
[sighs]

419
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,603
[sniffles]

420
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,943
[news anchor]<i> Ali Wong's in studio
to talk about Henderson,</i>

421
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,028
<i>or as she knew him, Josh.</i>

422
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,003
[Forty cleans throat]

423
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,633
I will make a film that premieres
Sundance 2020 at the Eccles.

424
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,177
Friday night slot.

425
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,220
Then goes on to sweep the Gothams,

426
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,308
winning two, no,
three Indie Spirit awards.

427
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,851
Fuck the Oscars.

428
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,566
I hear and accept you, Forty.

429
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,234
[both chuckle]

430
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,986
Is this gonna work?

431
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,280
'Cause my car is really old.

432
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,616
Yeah, that shiny, new Prius is all yours.

433
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,784
All you need is a group hug and 35K.

434
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,164
I...

435
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,626
will find the perfect partner.

436
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,255
[chuckles] That's good.

437
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,134
[Dottie] We hear and accept you, Gabe.

438
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,805
I will fulfill my life-long dream...

439
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,268
of... traveling to Italy. [chuckles]

440
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,063
[Joe]<i> Italy?</i>

441
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,605
<i>Seriously?</i>

442
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,192
<i>She is obsessed with me.</i>

443
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,863
Okay, come on,
somebody needs to help her. Go.

444
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,676
- [Sunrise] I accept you.
- [woman] I accept you.

445
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
I hear...

446
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,038
and I accept you...

447
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,705
Amy.

448
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,878
[heart thumping]

449
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,924
[stammering] You... sorry um...

450
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,801
[chuckles nervously] I'm not feeling well.

451
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,345
- I... I think I'm just dehydrated.
- [woman] It's okay.

452
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,347
Don't fear love.

453
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,015
Hug.

454
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,543
[Candace yowls]

455
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,468
I'm... I'm sorry,
I... I just need to lie down.

456
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,610
Don't... try... anything.

457
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,697
I am texting someone
on the outside every hour.

458
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,157
You hurt me or the Quinns,

459
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,326
I reveal your identity to everyone,

460
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,078
and <i>everything</i> to get turned over
to the authorities.

461
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,080
Are you crazy?
I'm just trying to talk to you.

462
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,499
Oh, you mean like the time
you left me for <i>fucking</i> dead?!

463
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,877
[Joe]<i> She can't hold a knife.
One swift move and...</i>

464
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,921
<i>No, no, she's wrong, I don't hurt people,
especially women,</i>

465
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,685
<i>especially when they're
out of their minds.</i>

466
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,342
<i>No, that is not me.</i>

467
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,302
Candace, can we...

468
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,055
- please just have a truce?
- Stay...

469
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,765
away from me.

470
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,688
I think this is just
some big misunderstanding.

471
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,685
Stop gaslighting me!

472
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,604
[Candace grunts, pants]

473
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,522
You don't want to protect them.

474
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,984
You want to hurt me.

475
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,657
Go ahead.

476
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,952
Do it.

477
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,005
I can't.

478
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,467
[Joe]<i> It's a lot harder than it looks.</i>

479
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,055
What are you guys doing in here?

480
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,765
[chuckles] Hey.

481
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,183
Is everything all right?

482
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,435
Yeah, um... [clears throat]

483
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,727
Allergies.

484
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,023
Will snuck me some Claritin. Thanks, man.

485
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,649
No problem.

486
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,070
[Forty] Let's go.

487
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,571
Time to get pretty.

488
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,696
[Will] Ooh.

489
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,076
[whispering] All right.

490
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,327
All right, well...

491
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,539
So, I brought two,

492
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,666
and you can pick whichever one.

493
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,168
Oh, I'm... I'm fine with either.

494
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,338
Amy, are you okay?

495
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,342
Look, I know my mom can be a handful.

496
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,763
And I know my dad can also be a handful.
[chuckles]

497
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,306
Thanks. It's... it's...

498
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,225
not really that, it's more...

499
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,394
You can tell me anything.

500
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,146
I am a vault.

501
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,691
I don't want to sound crazy.

502
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,068
Well...

503
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,363
you won't and you aren't.

504
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,742
Something bad happened to me...

505
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,369
out in a place like this.

506
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,666
Just, I... I got lost with a guy
who I kind of thought was bad news.

507
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,085
It... it turned out fine, though.

508
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,838
Well, that's good.

509
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,674
Yeah, I mean, you're...

510
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,593
probably being triggered.

511
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,763
Trauma lives in the body, so,
you know, you can't control it, but...

512
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,310
At the risk of sounding like my mom,

513
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,563
maybe Shaman Open can help.

514
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,858
It's... it's really no big deal.

515
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,445
You and your family
have been so welcoming.

516
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,696
- Oh...
- And also cool.

517
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,823
[chuckling] I'm glad you think so.

518
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,910
[chuckles] So tell me,
how did you and Will meet?

519
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,579
You two seem <i>so</i> great together.

520
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,415
Oh. Um... work.

521
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,250
I basically forced him to date me.

522
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,793
Ooh, does that get complicated?

523
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,671
- Working with someone you're dating?
- Not really.

524
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,144
Does it get complicated
with you and Forty?

525
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,927
Oh, no, we're great. We're... we're good.

526
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,096
He... We're actually hiring.
Cinematographers.

527
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,014
Already?

528
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,975
Isn't that a bit early?

529
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,438
No, just... just establishing...
like, tone.

530
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,066
Yeah, where do you work?
Have you met my friend Lucy?

531
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,567
She works at United.

532
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,569
- Oh, I'm independent.
- Mm-hmm.

533
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,405
And I usually just fly Southwest.

534
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,324
[both chuckle]

535
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,370
I meant the agency.

536
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,665
- United Talent?
- Oh, right. Um...

537
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,833
No, no. I don't think I've met her.

538
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,795
[chuckling] No, it's...
It's an easy mistake.

539
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,588
[Candace chuckles]

540
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,641
Dad. [clears throat] Finally.

541
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,602
Um... did you get my email?

542
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,813
It's not every man
that can pull off linen.

543
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,441
Can you say hi to me at least?

544
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,111
Forty, I don't want to hear it.

545
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,155
Okay, okay.

546
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,116
Uh, look, I know, but...

547
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,493
Amy actually has a really
incredible idea...

548
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,577
Amy. [chuckles]

549
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,914
Ugh, another walking visible panty line.

550
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,209
Let me guess. She wants to open a...

551
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,671
vegan junk food restaurant,
like Krystal-with-a-K?

552
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,172
[Forty chuckles]

553
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,050
Will, [smacks lips]
ask him how much he wants.

554
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,469
[Joe]<i> In times of triangulation,</i>

555
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,888
<i>it's best to stay awkwardly quiet.</i>

556
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,350
Did Forty tell you how he doodled
on his SAT Scantron?

557
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,312
I had to donate a building
to Dartmouth to get him in.

558
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,395
Okay, Dad...

559
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,026
you know that I've struggled
with drug addiction on and off, my...

560
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,986
[chuckling] It's not eczema, Forty.

561
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,365
Addiction's not an on-and-off thing,
and it's no excuse for being a bum.

562
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,245
One hundred K,
this is the last time I ask.

563
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,247
Will... Will has heard the pitch.

564
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
Yeah, I have.

565
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,253
I think it's a great idea.

566
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,839
Your son shows real promise.

567
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,842
Well, if my son wasn't such
a big flapping pussy,

568
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,218
he wouldn't need other people
to carry his water for him.

569
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,431
[Ray] I'm not writing you another check.

570
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,807
Get a job.

571
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,642
And a life.

572
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,648
- Well...
- [phone chimes]

573
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,568
That is my Postmates.

574
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,654
<i>Yo quiero </i>Taco Bell.

575
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,197
Forty. Forty, are...

576
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,782
Are you okay?

577
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,449
Yeah.

578
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,119
He's a douche, and I am <i>so done</i>

579
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,181
- with all of this vegan bullshit.
- [phone buzzes]

580
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,289
You should come with.

581
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,378
Uh, you can service my sister
post-chalupa.

582
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,597
What does the future hold?

583
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,848
[Love chuckles]

584
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,436
Okay. Um, what were you and Amy
talking about earlier?

585
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,980
Oh, why? Did something seem...

586
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,273
No, no. I just...

587
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,441
I caught her in a lie.

588
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,819
And, uh... now I'm worried.

589
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,862
[Joe]<i> I knew we were on the same page.</i>

590
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,072
I agree, she's...

591
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,699
- she's the worst.
- [chuckles]

592
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,991
Get rid of her now.

593
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,284
[chuckling] Wait, what?

594
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,494
No, that's aggressive.

595
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,332
And, plus, it would upset Forty.
I mean, what is going on with you?

596
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,959
[Joe]<i> Wrong page.</i>

597
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,169
I know we're not in the Truth Yurt,

598
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,755
but we can still be honest
with each other, right?

599
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,759
You've been... off.

600
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,595
You feel weird, ever since we got here.

601
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,724
[Joe]<i> I want to tell you everything.</i>

602
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,018
<i>And I will, soon, but for now...</i>

603
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,353
You want to know why I'm weird?

604
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,731
'Cause your family is insane.

605
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,315
I warned you.

606
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,277
You warned me? Your mom can't stop
telling me about her vagina.

607
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,236
She did what?

608
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,071
And your dad,
I just stepped in it with him

609
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,995
trying to help Forty,
which you asked me to do,

610
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,409
and then he made me eat a chalupa,
and now I'm sick.

611
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,492
Wait.

612
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,203
- Forty ordered Taco Bell?
- Yeah.

613
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,705
What...

614
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,374
What? What's happening?

615
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,709
Well, I have to go.

616
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,712
Forty always orders Taco Bell
before he relapses.

617
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,088
You are so obsessed with your brother.
This is not normal.

618
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,298
Just to recap,

619
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,134
you now have a problem
with my mom, my dad,

620
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,761
Forty, me,

621
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,680
- this chick Amy for some reason...
- You don't like her either.

622
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,266
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I am trying...

623
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,101
to be the perfect boyfriend.

624
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,061
- I want to be so badly,
- [scoffs]

625
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,647
but you fed me to the wolves, literally.

626
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,525
[stammers]

627
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,363
Thanks for making a stressful weekend
so much worse by starting this fight.

628
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,494
[Joe]<i> Our first fight.</i>

629
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,370
<i>I blame Candace.</i>

630
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,789
<i>It's time for her to go.</i>

631
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,252
[knocking on door]

632
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,095
Um, no, I... I...
I look like cat shit right now.

633
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,472
I'm on my period.

634
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,516
Okay, who gives a fuck. Just let me in.

635
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,272
Jesus, what kind of assholes have you
dated that care about that kind of stuff?

636
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,608
Why are you here?

637
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,819
Uh, [sighs] I need those pictures back.

638
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,489
Um... why?

639
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,908
I think you look great...

640
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,618
for the record.

641
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,332
Yeah, uh, they're trying to get a full
picture of what Henderson was into.

642
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,015
I told them that I got a lead on someone

643
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,295
who has some knowledge of some
young girls that we could follow up with.

644
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,718
D, they want to know why he did it.

645
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,639
Okay.

646
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,233
What's wrong?

647
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,320
I left them right here. I...

648
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,788
[woman] Hi.

649
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,874
[indistinct chatter]

650
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,458
Have you guys seen my brother?

651
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,210
No, not since cornhole.

652
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,130
Are we literally drinking
the Kool-Aid right now?

653
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,048
[chuckles] Goodbye, cruel world.

654
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,932

[Joe]<i> Candace must go,
but first things first.</i>

656
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,305
<i>Time to apologize.</i>

657
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,913
<i>You're more important than my pride.</i>

658
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,977
Love, I'm sorry.

659
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,248
I cannot be the one
that makes you feel better right now.

660
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,191
I am looking for my brother
and trying to handle my mother and...

661
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,735
Okay, I'll help. I'll find Forty.

662
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,069
Okay.

663
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,488
Thank you.

664
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,827

- Delilah, hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

666
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,741
Any chance you're with Ellie?

667

[Joe]<i> That's what I get
for not parent-spying on her for an hour.</i>

668
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,129
No, but I... I have some texts from her.
Hang on.

669
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,515
Okay, uh, the... the Alex Theater
is doing a Chandler thing.

670
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,935
<i>- You could try that, but I gotta go.

[Love chuckles] Um...

676
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,387
My parents aren't just parents,

677
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,555
they're lovers.

678
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,056
They're, um...

679
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,034
I hate rom-coms.

680
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,287
- I do. Take away my ovaries.
- [guests chuckling]

681
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,539
Want to know why?

682
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,209
Because throughout my life,
when I look at my parents,

683
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,336
their love doesn't feel like one.

684
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,713
You know, it's, um...

685
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,813
fighting over which toilet paper to buy.

686
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,424
And then...

687
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,052
plunging the toilet together
when it gets clogged.

688
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,221
- [guests laugh]
- It's being there...

689
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,017
when someone's damage
makes them impossible.

690
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,976
Knowing...

691
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,188
that they are so much more
than their worst moments.

692
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,524
[Joe]<i> You're not talking about them.</i>

693
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,443
Contrary to internet opinion,

694
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,361
my parents' love is not perfect.

695
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,155
[Joe]<i> You're talking about us.</i>

696
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,239
It's, uh...

697
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,533
It's sticky,

698
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,076
messy,

699
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,287
often potentially way too much to handle.

700
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,372
[all chuckle]

701
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,250
But it is so much better than perfect,
because...

702
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,376
it's real.

703
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,923
Wait. Wait, I want to go.

704
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,592
Forty...

705
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,093
No, I want to go. I want to go.

706
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,472
Um... [clears throat]

707
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,891
- Forty?
- [Forty] Um, remember...

708
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,935
when they, uh, they dragged us
to the Hoffman Institute

709
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,396
because, uh,
they had differing definitions

710
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,939
of the word "monogamish"?

711
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,108
- [guests chuckling]
- That was real.

712
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,711
- I have more. I just, uh...
- Enough, son.

713
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,445
I... I just need a smoke.

714
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,489
Just need a smoke. [chuckles]

715
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,784
Oh, um, not that one. No, it's fine.
It's... it's okay. Got it. It's okay.

716
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,868
- [Love] It's okay.
- Oh!

717
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,287
It's fine. Everything's...

718
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,914
You look lovely, Mom.

719
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,749
Let's go. It's okay. Shh.

720
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,459
- I don't feel good.
- [Love] Yeah.

721
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,085
[Ray] I do.

722
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,420
[applause]

723
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,464
Let's party!

724
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,341
[guests cheering]

725
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,222
[Love] Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

726
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,516
- How are you guys doing?
- You've done enough.

727
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,769
All you ever have to do
is keep your brother safe. You failed.

728
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,729
You disgust me.

729
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,029
You're a fucking hypocrite.

730
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,572
[loud slap]

731
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,577
[Joe]<i> Earth mommy dearest.</i>

732
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,912
<i>Oh, Love.</i>

733
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,376
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

734
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,419
- It's okay.
- [scoffs]

735
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,671
[Dottie] It's okay.

736
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,262
[Joe]<i> I saw what your mom did.
Are you okay?</i>

737
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,225
My dad hit me a lot.

738
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,398
Why couldn't you tell me?

739
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,693
Probably...
same reason you couldn't tell me.

740
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,821
I couldn't tell you
because I wanted us to stay us.

741
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,867
[sighs] I didn't want it to be polluted
by all this fucking...

742
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,078
I guess...

743
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,000
my life has been dark.

744
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,378
Well, who you really are...

745
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,006
the dark, that's not a burden.

746
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,883
You don't have to push that away from me.

747
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,760
I want to know you.

748
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,014
I want to know you.

749
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,516
You know, the more I get to know you,
the nicer it is.

750
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,102
I don't just mean the cute parts.

751
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,439
As far as I'm concerned...

752
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,358
we will stay us...

753
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
no matter what.

754
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,618
Yeah, I feel like I've been, um...
I've been acting weird,

755
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,781
and I feel like it's because
there's all these things

756
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,748
that I felt like I couldn't tell you,
but, like, fuck that.

757
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,835
[sighs] Okay, um...

758
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,963
You remember the, um...

759
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,301
the Nilla Wafers, the <i>au pair?</i>

760
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,802
Of course.

761
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,638
My parents started Anavrin

762
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,097
when we were, like, 13.

763
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,019
And they hired this woman, Sofia.

764
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,772
She was, like, 19. She was from Spain.

765
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,026
The way Forty tells it...

766
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,321
she was his first love.

767
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,240
To this day, he does not acknowledge

768
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,909
that it was was abuse.

769
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,624
And eventually my parents
caught them together,

770
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,208
and...

771
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,711
so much shit ensued.

772
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,131
And... they let her go.

773
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,343
And she was troubled.

774
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,887
She killed herself.

775
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,184
Forty's the one who found the body.

776
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,229
[groans]

777
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,856
Yeah, and nothing has ever
really been the same.

778
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,860
My parents kept everything quiet
with money.

779
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,824
[sighing] Yeah.

780
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,452
I get that Forty is a lot. I know.

781
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,250
And I know
that I take care of him too much.

782
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,127
But...

783
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,423
you've met my parents now,
so you know why.

784
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,549
I'm stuck with him.

785
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,591
No.

786
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,219
<i>We</i> are.

787
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,472
[exhales heavily]

788
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,353
[Joe]<i> I don't think
I've ever been in love before.</i>

789
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,900
<i>- It's been infatuation.</i>
- [groans]

790
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,903
<i>This is it.</i>

791
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,490
<i>Accepting you're not perfect
and loving you more for it.</i>

792
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,377
What the fuck?

793
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
[Love laughs]

794
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,257
[imitates a snarl]

795
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,469
I'm sorry, did that trigger you?

796
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,777
Can I tell you I love you yet?

797
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,406
Whenever you're ready.

798
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,872
In the meantime, let me say...

799
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,792
I love you...

800
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,292
Love.

801
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,297
Ugh, it's a complicated word.

802
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,966
Oh, yeah.

803
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,010
Is there another word we can use?
Our word?

804
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,969
Um...

805
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,432
I wolf you.

806
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,352
I wolf you too.

807
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,065
I like it.

808
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,859
It's like you're part of my pack.

809
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,238
I am your pack.

810
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,667
[breathing loudly]

811
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,919
[Love chuckles]

812
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,133
[indistinct chatter]

813
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,516
- Hey!
- Klepto.

814
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,101
The police came for these.

815
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,770
- The actual police or your fuckboy?
- Why would you take these?

816
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,148
[stammers]

817
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,108
I couldn't believe he would do this.

818
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,195
But I do now.

819
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,244
I'm sorry I was being such an asshole.

820
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,246
It's okay.

821
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,544
I think we should burn those.

822
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,505
If these photos were ever leaked...

823
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,258
every time someone googled the girls,

824
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,384
it would just...

825
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,930
What would you want done with yours?

826
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,351
Hey, just so you know...

827
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,148
nothing could ever
make me see you different.

828
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,167
[cop] <i>Tell me again what happened.</i>

829
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,629
Um, my boyfriend... ex...

830
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,129
We fought.

831
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,174
And he...

832
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,259
He took me to the woods.

833
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,510
Um...

834
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,347
I don't remember what happened next.

835
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,599
I just... I... I woke up.

836
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,558
Like...

837
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,019
buried.

838
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,774
We sent a car out. No tire marks.

839
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,025
No, he dug a grave.

840
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,154
A lot of tree removal in that area, right?
Loose dirt.

841
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,697
No one saw anything?

842
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,326
You happen to take any pictures
or save any texts between you?

843
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,409
No!

844
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,454
He has my phone!

845
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,541
I mean, isn't there any DNA
where he buried me alive?

846
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,293
This isn't <i>CSI,</i> all right?
We're in Putnam County.

847
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,380
So you have no proof?

848
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,883
[sniffles, chuckles]

849
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,888
[clears throat]
Honey, let me level with you, all right?

850
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,472
I looked you up.

851
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,475
- You have a rap sheet.
- [scoffs]

852
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,061
Ever had any friends go through
with reporting assault?

853
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,731
This'll be labeled domestic violence.

854
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,108
This isn't...

855
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,444
He tried to murder me.

856
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,739
The best we can do
is get a restraining order.

857
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,157
Right, temp for three months.

858
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,386
For a permanent one,
you'll have to stand before a judge,

859
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,203
- so will he.
- But it will be permanent?

860
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,997
Well, three years.

861
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,331
And then file again.

862
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,792
If you have no pics, no proof...

863
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,130
What am I supposed to do?

864
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,223
He thinks you're dead?

865
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,226
You want some really
off-the-record advice?

866
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,352
Stay that way.

867
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,896
[scoffs]

868
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,526
This is unreal.

869
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,204
Figured you'd come find me.

870
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,040
[Candace chuckles]

871
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,169
[sighs]

872
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,464
Crazy family
we've fallen into, huh? [chuckles]

873
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,133
So now you see I'm not...

874
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,052
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

875
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,930
If you really had something on me...

876
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,019
- you would've turned me in already.
- I'm not afraid of you either.

877
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,687
Why would you be afraid of me?

878
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,981
Candace, it was an accident.

879
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,524
[Candace cackles]

880
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,234
End of story.

881
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,365
I never tried to kill you.

882
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,617
[snorts, chuckles]
Yeah. You know what they say?

883
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,829
You never know if you're fight or flight
until you're forced to find out.

884
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,206
Turns out...

885
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
I'm fight.

886
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,338
So now I found you,

887
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,298
I'm not going anywhere,

888
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,343
and I don't care what story
you tell yourself,

889
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,388
because all I have to do
is wait for you to mess up.

890
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,142
Murder has a way of following you.

891
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,687
And you're not getting away with it.

892
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,205
[Joe] <i>Things aren't over with Candace.</i>

893
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,543
<i>But I have to rest
before I plan my next move.</i>

894
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,420
<i>Wellness is exhausting.</i>

895
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,466
<i>Huh.</i>

896
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,011
<i>A postcard from Will in Manila.</i>

897
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,055
<i>It's going well with Gigi.</i>

898
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,642
<i>If I stay committed to being a good man,</i>

899
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,769
<i>things might work themselves out.</i>

900
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,105
[Delilah] My God, why aren't they burning?

901
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,815
[Ellie] We need kindling.

902
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,984
Oh, man.

903
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,404
Evidently, there's toxins in Polaroids.

904
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,454
[both sigh]

905
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,080
All right, there's one more.

906
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,782
[door opens]

907
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,331
- Aw.
- I wolf you.

908
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,791
Mm. Do you now?

909
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,042
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

910
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,864
Do you want to go to the stockroom?

911
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,675
Yes, I would like that very much.

912
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,885
[giggles]

913
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,430
Stop with the PDA.

914
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,351
Before anybody asks...

915
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,686
Amy picked me up from a meeting,

916
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,396
where I found a new sponsor.

917
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,273
Can't name names, but, uh...

918
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,818
- let's just say the Academy robbed him.
- [Candace chuckles]

919
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,862
Anyway, I will have to make amends.

920
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,490
So I promise I will apologize
to both of you...

921
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,909
whenever I get to that step.

922
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,369
You don't need to do that.

923
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,913
I'm just glad you're okay.

924
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,084
I really am.
And, um, I'm staying busy too.

925
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:21,338
I mean... adapting this book
Amy found for us is going to consume me,

926
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,757
in the best way possible.

927
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,426
- Thank fuck we got that option.
- [Candace chuckles]

928
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,845
What's the book?

929
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,056
I thought you were busy prepping
<i>Bang, Marry, Kill.</i>

930
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,600
Yeah, that felt like more
of a second feature.

931
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,061
But, uh...
Amy turned me on to this memoir.

932
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,276
Yeah, this main character, Beck...

933
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,570
she really speaks to me, you know?

934
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,155
- She just wanted to be loved.
- [Candace] Mm.

935
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,784
- [Joe]<i> She's worse than Eva Braun.</i>
- Oh! Ugh!

936
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,388
Anyway, just waiting for the deal points
to come through, but...

937
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,247
- [Love] Oh, my God.
- [phone pings]

938
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,584
Holy fuck.

939
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,503
- No way.
- What?

940
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,856
- [Forty] Hold on.
- What happened?

941
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,880
[Forty] No way.

942
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,134
Now they're saying
they think Henderson was murdered.

943
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:12,055
[Joe]<i> Benji, Peach, Beck,
Ron, Jasper, Henderson...</i>

944
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,809
Well, if... if that's true,
a famous man like Henderson,

945
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,186
they won't stop
until they find who did it, right?

946
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,022
- Right.
- He won't get away with it.

947
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,733
[sighs]

948
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,402
Murder has a way of following you.

949
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,453
[closing music playing]
