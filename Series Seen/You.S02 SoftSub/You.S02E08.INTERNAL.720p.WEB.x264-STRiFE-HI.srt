1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,270
[Delilah]<i> Please let me out!</i>

2
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,439
Ellie needs me.

3
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,357
I know she does.

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,862
I won't say a word.

5
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,865
Okay? Fuck Henderson.

6
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,743
You think I ever shed a tear
over that asshole?

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,371
And... and whatever this...
human aquarium thing is,

8
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,123
I will not tell a soul.

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,958
[Joe] <i>I want to believe you, Delilah.</i>

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,752
You don't have to worry. I'm not stupid.

11
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,754
- [phone buzzing]
- [Joe]<i> Oh, far from it.</i>

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:51,718
<i>I want your story to end like Will's,
but you are a jaded gossip columnist</i>

13
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,636
<i>with a cop for a fuckbuddy.</i>

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,722
- Did you tell him you found this?
- No.

15
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,515
No. [stammering] I was going to,

16
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,435
but I didn't,
and now I'm definitely not going to.

17
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,729
You want to prove I can trust you?

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,149
- [phone continues buzzing]
- [lock screen clicks]

19
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,026
[Fincher on phone] <i>Delilah.</i>

20
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,945
- H-Hey.
<i>- D!</i>

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,655
Finally. What is going on?

22
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,074
Um...

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,119
I heard Ben got another DUI. Uh...

24
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,661
Can you confirm?

25
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,707
<i>That's what's so important right now?</i>

26
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,336
Girl's gotta pay rent. So?

27
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,630
[sighs] Yeah.

28
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,382
But... you didn't hear that from me.

29
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,470
- Okay, thanks. Bye.
<i>- No, hang on.</i>

30
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,971
Hang on, um...

31
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,851
[sighs] I've been thinking about
what you said, and, um...

32
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,314
I want to take you out. Like, a real date.

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,733
<i>Are... are you free tonight?</i>

34
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,361
I can't tonight.

35
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,616
Um, but soon. Yeah, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

36
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,410
<i>Yeah. All right.</i>

37
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,413
[phone beeps]

38
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,212
You said prove it. I proved it.

39
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,880
[Joe]<i> As soon as she's free,</i>

40
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,133
<i>she could run straight to him
and tell him everything.</i>

41
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,301
Okay. You know what? You're right.

42
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:20,098
It'd be naive to just trust me at my word,
so why don't we just come to an agreement?

43
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,724
Okay? Let's negotiate.

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,602
Do you want to buy my silence? I'm game.

45
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,896
[Joe] <i>That'd be ideal, but what do I have?</i>

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,190
<i>- A few hundred bucks?</i>
- Please, Will.

47
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,528
- I don't want to die in here.
- You won't.

48
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,698
I promise.

49
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,535
[Joe]<i> And I mean it.
I won't let this situation go bad.</i>

50
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,162
<i>I've been through that.</i>

51
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,581
I'm gonna let you out tomorrow.

52
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,667
[Joe] <i>After I've made some arrangements
for me to escape.</i>

53
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,750
[stammering] What?

54
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,880
Will, no! Will, don't leave! Will!

55
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,567
- [Joe] <i>Delilah </i>will <i>go free.
- </i>[sobbing] Will! Please don't leave me.

56
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,385
[Joe]<i> Even if it means
breaking my own heart.</i>

57
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,097
<i>To be a man who's worthy of you,</i>

58
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>Love, I have to let you go.</i>

59
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,269
<i>Goodbye, Love.</i>

60
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,729
<i>In another reality,</i>

61
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,065
<i>I'd be packing a picnic you made</i>

62
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,028
<i>for us to share at Griffith Park
instead of the passport Will made me</i>

63
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,738
<i>in case I ever needed it.</i>

64
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,827
<i>I'd be buying you peonies, Love,</i>

65
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,372
<i>not a plane ticket for tomorrow
at 9:02 a.m.</i>

66
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:31,628
<i>Oh, I wish things were different.
But now, I have to leave. Forever.</i>

67
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,296
[phone chimes]

68
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>In another reality, I wouldn't have to lie
to Ellie about where her sister is.</i>

69
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,555
<i>For both of their benefit.</i>

70
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,516
<i>Oh, facial recognition.</i>

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,937
<i>Well, big sis will be back to Ellie soon.
Very soon.</i>

72
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,980
[gate screeching]

73
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,582
No Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

74
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,376
You know those are my favorite.

75
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,378
You're going to need more than that.

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,547
You're gonna be in here
another 16 hours.

77
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,716
You're leaving again?

78
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,885
Oh, what the fuck are those?

79
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,053
- No. Uh-uh.
- No, no no no.

80
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,471
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Uh-uh, no.

81
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,722
They're time-release.

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,183
There's a timer. Watch.
I'll set it to three seconds.

83
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,892
And when it's up...

84
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,728
[beeping]

85
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,397
[timer chimes]

86
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,732
See? They unlock automatically.

87
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,653
So you eat, and we cuff you to the table,

88
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,866
and then we set the timer to go off
when I am on my way out of the city.

89
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,785
After that, you're free.

90
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,746
How will I get out?

91
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,958
I'm gonna leave the doors unlocked.

92
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,560
[opening music playing]

93
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,822
Once they're set,
you can't reset them till time's up.

94
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,966
I don't want you
to drive yourself crazy

95
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,534
trying to override the timer.

96
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,829
There is no override.

97
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,017
- Unlock.
- For what?

98
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,685
For your sister.

99
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,939
[lock screen chimes]

100
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
Okay.

101
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,559
I'm leaving this here
for when you get out.

102
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,052
I'm sorry
our friendship had to end like this.

103
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,179
[Joe]<i> She'll hate me forever,</i>

104
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,099
<i>but she'll be fine tomorrow.</i>

105
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,979
You have aseverely fucked concept
of friendship.

106
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,358
[Joe]<i> Now all I have left
is to say goodbye</i>

107
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,442
<i>to you.</i>

108
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,319
[women moaning approvingly]

109
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,614
Okay, so they're all gluten-free
and gastritis-friendly.

110
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,827
- Oh, my God! The lemon. Incredible.
- Yeah? But is it perfect?

111
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,703
How does Moroccan chocolate sound?

112
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,706
- Like heaven in my mouth.
- Oh, yeah. Let's go with that one.

113
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,790
But you can't just agree.

114
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,085
What about this other recipe
I've been working on?

115
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,547
- It's vanilla and almond and praline and...
- Love, please.

116
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,631
Stop.

117
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,467
What? I'm...

118
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,446
- You just deserve the best. I'm just...
- [Lucy] Well, what's wrong?

119
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,431
Is this about Milo or...?

120
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,145
No. I mean, I was using Milo.

121
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,021
I haven't thought about him since he left.

122
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,983
- Will, on the other hand...
- [Sunrise] Oh, okay.

123
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,820
There it is.
You think you let a good one get away.

124
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,881
[Lucy] No, I'm sorry.
Are we all conveniently forgetting

125
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,907
- that he lied to you?
- No one's forgetting.

126
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,161
But maybe he deserves a second chance.

127
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,705
I'm a Quinn.

128
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,084
Once burned, we tend to cut our losses
and move on.

129
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,546
Okay. You are not your family.

130
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,174
Your new mantra. You're welcome.

131
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,302
If you still want the guy, go get him.

132
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,532
- What if it's too late?
- Then he's not who you thought he was,

133
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,975
- and in that case, boy bye.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,852
Yeah, okay.

135
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,104
Yeah.

136
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,816
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good.

137
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
Good for you. I'm proud of you, Lovebug.

138
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,379
- [Lucy] You deserve it.
- [Sunrise] Look at you. You're amazing.

139
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,947
[Lucy] Yes. You're thriving.
Look at what you've done.

140
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,450
[Love]...all three.

141
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,453
[Lucy] Wait, is that
the praline one right there?

142
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,036
[Love] Yeah...

143
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,915
- [chatter continues]
- [Joe]<i> "Dear Love.</i>

144
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,167
<i>You've changed me.</i>

145
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,545
<i>I used to see the world as black or white.</i>

146
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,926
<i>Now everything is gray and messy,
full of nuance</i>

147
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,887
<i>and beauty because of you.</i>

148
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,558
<i>In an alternate universe,
we'd still be together.</i>

149
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,895
<i>A team. Ready for anything.</i>

150
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,066
<i>But where I'm heading now,
I have to go on my own.</i>

151
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,693
<i>I want to be the man you think I am,</i>

152
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,905
<i>so know I am doing this
to do the right thing.</i>

153
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,533
<i>And that means saying goodbye.</i>

154
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,911
<i>Wolf you always, Joe."</i>

155
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,999
Sport, you are not gonna believe this.

156
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,252
- [Joe]<i> I bet I'm also not gonna care.</i>
- What's that?

157
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,963
I ran into none other
than Kathryn <i>"Hurt Locker" </i>Bigelow

158
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,673
at Manganiello's last <i>D&D</i> night.

159
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,259
I elevator-pitched her <i>D-FOL. </i>NBD, right?

160
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,718
Guess who just called me.

161
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,888
- Tell me.
- Her assistant. Okay?

162
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,974
Apparently, Kathryn read the book

163
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,560
after we talked,
and now she wants to see a script.

164
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,145
She's, like, thirsty for it, dude.

165
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,356
[Joe]<i> Ugh, if I don't feign enthusiasm,</i>

166
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,651
<i>he might burst into tears
or start freebasing. Or both.</i>

167
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,404
[chuckling] Forty, wow. Congratulations.

168
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,073
- It is so well-deserved.
- Right?

169
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,701
Yeah, so we gotta get to work,
like, right now.

170
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,827
[Joe]<i> Oh, no.</i>

171
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,630
The whole script needs a polish,
and I gotta get it to Kathryn, stat.

172
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,165
Literally,
her assistant used the word "stat."

173
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,585
What do you need me for?
Go over it with your manager.

174
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,308
No, I need your genius, 30 minutes,
then go on about your whatever.

175
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,029
[Joe]<i> Timing couldn't be worse,
but this is important to him,</i>

176
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,758
<i>which means important to you.</i>

177
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,677
<i>So, my parting gift to you.</i>

178
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,306
It's creepy when you get quiet like that.

179
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,641
Thirty minutes, okay? That's all I have.

180
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,644
Schweet! You're so fucking money,
and you don't even know it.

181
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,565
[timer beeps echoing]

182
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,588
- [Forty grunts]
- [camera shutter snapping]

183
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,280
So candid, I love it.

184
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,992
[Joe]<i> Wow, pedestrian.</i>

185
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,119
- It's good, right?
- I'm still reading.

186
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,663
[Joe]<i> The truth? I don't want this movie
to actually get made.</i>

187
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,791
<i>Thankfully, odds of that are worse
than Forty's dialogue.</i>

188
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,544
<i>But at least I can keep him
from embarrassing himself.</i>

189
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,256
Okay, there's a little exposition
in here that you don't need. Like here.

190
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,008
You don't need Dr. Nicky to say

191
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,771
how long he
and Beck have known each other.

192
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,471
- They already know that.
- True, but I want to emphasize it.

193
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,347
Why?

194
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,224
'Cause, man, like,

195
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,144
why should it always be the woman
keeping track of shit like that?

196
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,479
Feminism.

197
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,482
- [tires screech]
- What's this fuckbonnet doing?

198
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,192
Hey, you can't park here!

199
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,045
- It's a no-parking. I said you can't...
- [Joe] What're you doing?

200
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,349
You can't... What are you doing?

201
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,988
- [Joe] Let me go!
- Oh! What the hell?

202
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,258
- What're you doing? Wait!
- Unhand me, brah!

203
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,325
- Rape!
- [Joe] Wait!

204
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,118
- Rape! I said rape!
- [Joe] No!

205
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,329
- [Forty] Wait!
- Forty, shut the fuck up!

206
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,798
[Joe]<i> Fuck. Why is this happening?
What do I do?</i>

207
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,966
<i>Benji, Peach, Ron, Beck,
Jasper, Henderson.</i>

208
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,095
<i>Jasper goons? Salinger's?
Was Hendy involved in organized crime?</i>

209
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,888
[Forty] I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

210
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,933
[Joe]<i> And now I've dragged this poor idiot
into my bullshit.</i>

211
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,269
You have to calm down, Forty.
You have to calm down.

212
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,396
Deep breaths.

213
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,147
[Forty panting]

214
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,442
I'm so sorry, Joe. This is all my fault.

215
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,488
What are you talking about?

216
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,949
I'm not the man
that you think I am. I'm...

217
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,159
I'm an addict.

218
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,663
I know you're an addict.

219
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,833
No, Joe. A gambling addict, okay?

220
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,794
It's called "cross addiction"
and when it rains, it pours.

221
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,088
I've been in the hole for months.

222
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,525
I told them I was gonna make
the money back with this movie,

223
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,591
but they are obviously...

224
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,677
[Joe]<i> How's this for an act one
turning point?</i>

225
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,220
<i>Syd Field would be proud.</i>

226
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,303
<i>Though if this were a movie,
I wouldn't believe it.</i>

227
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,724
No more talking!

228
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:09,311
[Joe]<i> All this time, I've been worrying
that my own sins would be my undoing,</i>

229
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:14,567
<i>only to be kidnapped
because of Forty fucking Quinn.</i>

230
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,284
[Joe]<i> As cages go, this one's, uh, posh.</i>

231
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,787
That was a little toasty, gentlemen.

232
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,415
Can we maybe use a more breathable hood
next time?

233
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,169
Oh, you should see your face right now.

234
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,420
[Forty laughs]

235
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,259
Forty.

236
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,180
Did you hire these men to kidnap us?

237
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,183
It was pretty convincing, huh?

238
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,478
I really got you with that gambling shit,
didn't I?

239
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,480
Thank you,
Dame Helen Mirren's master class.

240
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,732
[speaking Russian]
See you at the next meeting.

241
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,984
[in Russian] Yes, see you.

242
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,030
Igor's in the program,
and he and his brother Dimitri repo cars.

243
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,216
And I didn't think
they were gonna go for this, but...

244
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,867
anything for the right price, I guess.

245
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,994
This is fucking insane.

246
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,662
Even for you.

247
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,748
Okay, it's unconventional,

248
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,584
but we have to break out
of our comfort zone

249
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,629
if we are going to connect with the muse.

250
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,214
[Joe laughs]

251
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,176
You connect with the muse.

252
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,968
I'm out of here.

253
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,971
[Forty] Mmm. About that...

254
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,309
See, if either of us tries to leave,
Dimitri will shoot us.

255
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,439
Do... do you... even hear yourself?

256
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,195
[Forty] Dimitri don't give a fuck, bro!

257
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,405
And B-T-dubs,
he confiscated all your shit,

258
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,366
so you might as well just settle in.

259
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,409
Dimitri.

260
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,038
Can I please have that back?

261
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:51,956
You...

262
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,332
write script.

263
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,749
Yes!

264
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,001
Okay.

265
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,003
Uh...

266
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,009
You're right. I mean, it is a great idea
to connect with the muse,

267
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,804
but I'm not very useful to you

268
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,282
- if I'm being held hostage. Should...
- No can do.

269
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,726
He will not let us out of here
until we have a completed script.

270
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,522
Relax, man. Stop fighting the process.

271
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,233
Besides,
I heard this is how Toni Morrison does it.

272
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,860
What?

273
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,195
She's, like, a very famous black chick
who writes books?

274
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,114
I know who fucking Toni Morrison is.

275
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,241
I highly doubt she writes at gunpoint!

276
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,367
Oh, no, no no.

277
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,161
I just meant that she writes in hotels.
[chuckles]

278
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,414
Forty, I didn't sign up for this!

279
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,457
- [knocking on door]
- Could you get that?

280
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,464
- What are you doing here?
- What's all the noise about?

281
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,965
Hey.

282
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,803
What is she doing here?
This is not a safe environment for her.

283
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,804
Relax, Grandpa.

284
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,015
[Forty] She's fine.
She's across the hall in um...

285
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,975
- Suite 216.
- Yeah.

286
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,769
And Dimitri knows that she can come
and go as she pleases.

287
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,648
Yes, but... what's she doing here?

288
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,526
He hired me
as your guys' writer's assistant.

289
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,113
[Joe]<i> Shit, Forty.
Uh... at least I can keep an eye on her.</i>

290
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,033
I thought of everything.
This is gonna be fun. All right.

291
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,951
Now, uh, who wants room service?

292
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,245
Are we eating, or are we working?

293
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,456
<i>¿Por qué no los dos?</i>

294
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,336
[Joe]<i> This crazy, entitled, sick
son of a bitch.</i>

295
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,129
<i>How has he lived this long?</i>

296
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,884
<i>And so many accidents can happen
in a hotel room.</i>

297
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,347
[stutters]<i> No, no, I can do this.
Quickly fix the flawed script,</i>

298
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,559
<i>get my passport, and go off to Mexico
before Delilah's 16-hour hold is up...</i>

299
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,897
<i>and I leave you forever, Love.</i>

300
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,567
<i>"Wolf you always, Joe."</i>

301
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,282
Glad I caught you.

302
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,743
Join me for dinner tonight.

303
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,996
You pick the place. Just the two of us.

304
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:02,294
What? Did your crackhead shaman tell you
to olive-branch me?

305
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,256
Don't be absurd.
Shaman Open conned our entire family.

306
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,219
Shaman Kevin, however,
is authenticity personified.

307
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,389
And, yes, he believes
I need to mend my relationship with you.

308
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,516
You disagree?

309
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,978
- You need a shaman to tell you that?
- Come on, Love.

310
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,272
I'm trying. I want us to be friends.

311
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,944
It's essential for my growth,
and I can't imagine it would harm yours.

312
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,788
Baby...

313
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,124
it's okay.

314
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,337
You need this just as much as I do,
you know?

315
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,049
Start breaking down the walls.

316
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,010
Let's start tonight.

317
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,052
[Love sniffs]

318
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,181
We'll have cocktails and dessert,
and we'll have fun.

319
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,641
[both chuckle]

320
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,851
It'd be good for us.

321
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,021
Good for the whole family.

322
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,732
Okay, Mom.

323
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,219
- How's the dialogue trim going?
- Already got a page off.

324
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,524
Good. Okay, if we cut some fat
from the bottom of act two,

325
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,581
- the flow will be much smoother.
- Dope.

326
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,673
- What are you drinking?
- Kombexy. It's kombucha and dexedrine.

327
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,217
Oh, it's my secret weapon
for staying focused.

328
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,137
I'm diagnosed ADHD.

329
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,056
Of course you are.

330
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,099
[Joe]<i> Great. The pharmacy's open again.</i>

331
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,811
<i>I could pressure Forty
to face his eternal battle with sobriety,</i>

332
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,775
<i>- but that would take time I don't have.</i>
- Boom!

333
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,484
With Ellie's edits, we are at 118 pages.

334
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,943
Same length as <i>The Hurt Locker.</i>

335
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,571
Fin.

336
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,822
[Joe]<i> Oh, thank God.</i>

337
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,074
I hit every moment.

338
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,241
Check it, comrade.

339
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,496
[Joe]<i> Well, it's a script.</i>

340
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,873
Who's the man, Joe? I'm the man!

341
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,958
I'm the man! I'm the man!

342
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,713
You look like somebody just pissed
all over your rainbow.

343
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,590
What's wrong with her?

344
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,675
Nothing's wrong with me.

345
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,969
I just don't think you're done.

346
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,138
- [Joe]<i> Oh, no, no.</i>
- [Forty] Say more.

347
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,224
- First off, the script is predictable.
- Okay,

348
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,785
I was staying true to the source material.

349
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,870
[Ellie] And the female perspective
is sorely lacking.

350
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,730
- Okay...
- [Joe]<i> No. Ellie is too smart</i>

351
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,941
<i>and way too honest. Shit.</i>

352
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,069
Beck was real.
She humps a pillow multiple times!

353
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,740
Okay, okay. What would you suggest,
Sofia Coppola?

354
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,159
[Joe]<i> Don't do it, Ellie.</i>

355
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,453
<i>- </i>I think you should start over.
- [Joe]<i> Fuck.</i>

356
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,499
Figure out who Beck really is
and why you're the one to tell her story.

357
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,627
That seems a bit drastic.

358
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,172
Let's not...
Look, let's do a quick Beck pass, huh?

359
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,008
It's gonna need more than a quick pass.

360
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,386
Forty, where are you going?

361
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,221
I gotta get out of here.

362
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,307
Oh, great. Well, let's tell Dimitri
we're making a change of...

363
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,976
Forty, stop.

364
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,310
Wait, stop! What?

365
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,478
- What?!
- [heavy thud]

366
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,573
He does not handle criticism very well.

367
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,950
[Joe]<i> If I lose him,
I'll never get my passport back.</i>

368
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,326
<i>Smash cut to apocalypse.</i>

369
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,287
Okay, go back to your room,

370
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,914
order all the food you want,
and go to bed.

371
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,500
I can't tell if you're a worse producer
or babysitter.

372
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,169
Just don't leave.

373
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,752
Ah.

374
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,673
[Joe grunts, thud]

375
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,886
White male fragility.

376
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,281
[Joe]<i> Six bars and finally...</i>

377
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,468
- Got something against the hotel bar?
- It was too stuffy for me.

378
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,372
And also, I was blacklisted.

379
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,917
Got you a seltzer.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,627
Figured you'd find me.

381
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,212
You're just like that.

382
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,548
Are these all you?

383
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,968
[scoffs] I politely requested
a bottle of tequila,

384
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,846
but the asshole bartender
wouldn't sell it to me,

385
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,891
so I had to buy it shot by shot.

386
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,478
[Joe]<i> How high is his tolerance?
How is he alive?</i>

387
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,648
<i>I can't imagine what it's been like
to watch this slow suicide</i>

388
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,982
<i>year after year.</i>

389
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,944
- Why don't we go back to the hotel room?
- She's right, you know.

390
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,196
I don't know dick about writing women.

391
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,782
It <i>is </i>predictable, and it's not...

392
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,742
special.

393
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,870
[Joe]<i> Do not let this escalate.</i>

394
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,830
<i>Talk him off the ledge.</i>

395
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,749
- You're talented.
- I'm a loser.

396
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,085
[scoffs] I'm such a loser,

397
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,463
I'm still texting the girl
who used the fuck out of me.

398
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,007
What girl? What are you talking about?

399
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,969
- You're not talking about...
- Amy. Sorry, Candace...

400
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,720
or whatever her name is today.

401
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,057
[Joe]<i> He's still in touch with Candace?</i>

402
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,768
- Why are you two still talking?
- Closure.

403
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,647
She wants it. And I do too, I guess.

404
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,607
- [Joe]<i> This can't be happening.</i>
- God!

405
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,152
Why can't I just meet, like, a nice girl

406
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,279
like Jessica Alba,

407
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,782
who won't lie to me,
and who just wants to have my babies

408
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,534
and love me forever?

409
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,288
Like... is that... is that too much to ask?

410
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,456
Of course not. You deserve that.

411
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,793
- Candace is not that. No more texting.
- That's what I want.

412
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,586
That's it.

413
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,670
Yes.

414
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,590
- Attention, everybody! Excuse me.
- Forty, stop.

415
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,967
Attention, everyone.

416
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,096
Congratu-fucking-lations, you two.
Get over here.

417
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,347
Come here.

418
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,018
I am feeling particularly generous
this evening,

419
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,271
and there is nothing sweeter in the world
than newlyweds.

420
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,023
So here is my proposal.

421
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:00,277
I will give the happy couple ten grand
in cash...

422
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,029
- [man] Wow.
- [woman] Are you serious?

423
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,197
...if this handsome groom...

424
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,576
will let me kiss his beautiful bride.

425
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,662
Forty, let's get some coffee.

426
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,166
[Joe]<i> How dark is he going to get?</i>

427
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,544
- I don't like this.
- I know, but we can pay the mortgage down.

428
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,588
[Joe]<i> Maybe he'll let it go.</i>

429
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,839
<i>No.</i>

430
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,217
<i>He enjoys this.</i>

431
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,386
<i>He's a sadist.</i>

432
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,807
[bar patrons murmuring]

433
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,936
[Forty exhales]

434
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,772
[Forty] Hoo!

435
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,149
[Joe]<i> And before it's even begun...</i>

436
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,902
- Enjoy it.
- [Joe]<i>...Forty has ruined their marriage.</i>

437
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,030
<i>I've seen Forty the addict,
Forty the braggart,</i>

438
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,741
<i>the crybaby, the manipulator.</i>

439
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,452
<i>But I've never seen this side.</i>

440
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,997
<i>Your brother, Love, is dangerous.</i>

441
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,084
[Forty] Get me a drink.

442
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,337
No. We're going back to the hotel.

443
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,506
[Joe]<i> Get my passport, escape.</i>

444
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,674
You're coming with me, or don't,

445
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,675
but I'm done.

446
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,805
Wait. Wait.

447
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,684
What... are you doing... now?

448
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,647
Since you're leaving me forever,

449
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,316
that is the time
you started drinking your seltzer,

450
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,071
and it's going to be very important
to you later

451
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,283
when you don't know where
or when the fuck you are.

452
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,328
Why wouldn't I know those things?

453
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,288
Oh... [chuckles]

454
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,419
I kinda definitely dosed
your seltzer water with LSD.

455
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,003
[Joe]<i> He's joking.</i>

456
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,087
<i>He has to be.</i>

457
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,133
I just felt like we really needed this

458
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,593
if we were gonna have
a breakthrough tonight.

459
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,221
You drugged me?

460
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,266
Yeah. And I didn't know
how much you'd trip,

461
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,852
so I just gave you
four times the usual dose

462
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,228
to make sure that it would work.

463
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,148
I've never taken acid before in my life.

464
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,108
Oh...

465
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,237
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

466
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,781
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just three rules.

467
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,658
One, cars are real.

468
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,036
Two, anything you want to try,
please do it from the ground first.

469
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,582
And three, if you cannot stop sobbing,
just drink a Moon Juice.

470
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:27,924
Okay, sport. You gotta be careful
'cause you're about to feel everything.

471
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,052
[Joe]<i> All I feel is rage.</i>

472
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,514
<i>I tried, Love,
but your brother's a lost cause.</i>

473
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
Hey. Let's get a selfie.

474
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,941
- Do we have to?
- Yes, why not?

475
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,401
Okay.

476
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,197
- [camera shutter snaps]
- Nice.

477
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,286
So, is this what you had in mind?

478
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,331
Skin care advice and selfies?

479
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,461
Your father's cheating again.

480
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,755
Oh.

481
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,922
But it's fine.

482
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,591
Or it will be fine

483
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,678
once you, me, and Forty remind him
what an incredible family he has.

484
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,974
You know, him seeing us together here
is gonna make him very happy.

485
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,435
[chuckling] Wow.

486
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,729
Seven likes already.

487
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,651
Anyway, Forty's clean and working.

488
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,861
I have a healthy libido still.

489
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,488
Fuck you, menopause.

490
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,699
And, you know,
everything would be picture perfect

491
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,618
if you hadn't let Will slip away.

492
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,954
But <i>c'est la vie.</i>

493
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,957
- Anyway, we all have our part to play.
- No.

494
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,961
- Excuse me?
- No, I'm sick of us always pretending.

495
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,840
You pretending
that Dad's cheating doesn't hurt you.

496
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,136
Or that Forty isn't a walking time bomb.

497
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,724
No, instead you just slap
a Shaman Kevin Band-Aid on it.

498
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,102
That's not true.
You're completely off base.

499
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,772
Oh, like I was off base about you sweeping
the <i>au pair</i> incident under the rug?

500
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,900
You've had too much to drink.

501
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,111
What that woman did to Forty was criminal.

502
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,030
Then what did you do?
Oh, yeah, I remember.

503
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,824
A sage smudge.

504
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,326
- She should've gone to jail!
- It was impossible.

505
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,162
You pretended like it wasn't happening
until it was too late.

506
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,498
- He's your son!
- I did what I had to do!

507
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,338
[chuckles]

508
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,135
You know,
I love this family unconditionally,

509
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,378
- and I will do...
- I know...

510
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,930
what unconditional love feels like.

511
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,977
This is not it.

512
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,617
[Joe]<i> Wikipedia says kick-in times
are variable.</i>

513
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,328
<i>This trip's gonna last, oh,
nine to 16 hours.</i>

514
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,123
<i>So getting my passport back quick
without Forty's help is job one.</i>

515
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,501
<i>I'll have to deal with Dimitri on my own.</i>

516
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,754
<i>Question is, where is he?</i>

517
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,424
<i>If only I hadn't been brought here
in a hood and jumped out the window.</i>

518
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,137
<i>Am I tripping, or is that you?</i>

519
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,930
Hey, you.

520
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,352
[Joe]<i> Well, you smell a little drunk,
honestly.</i>

521
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,978
What are you doing here?

522
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,437
Um...

523
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,858
I was hoping that I would run into you.

524
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,443
Forty mentioned

525
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,363
that he might be writing here
this weekend.

526
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:41,368
I saw you on his Instagram this afternoon,
and I put two and two together.

527
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,870
[Joe]<i> I'm gonna miss how smart you are.</i>

528
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,163
That letter you wrote...

529
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,959
[sighs, shuddering] it shattered me.

530
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,713
Are you really leaving LA?

531
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,092
[Joe]<i> Your sadness, disappointment in me.</i>

532
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,678
<i>The goodbye I wanted to avoid.</i>

533
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,262
Okay, well,

534
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,806
if you have to leave,

535
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,309
meet me tomorrow.

536
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,188
For lunch, okay?

537
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,607
You know, we've been through a lot...

538
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,070
[echoing] in such a short period of time,
and I care about you.

539
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,114
[Joe]<i> Oh, no.</i>

540
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,283
Can we just meet for one more lunch?

541
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,327
[Joe]<i> Shit. It's kicking in.</i>

542
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,579
<i>This is not how I want to remember you.</i>

543
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,664
Oh...

544
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,666
- Okay.
- [Joe] <i>What? No.</i>

545
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,167
- I understand.
- [Joe]<i> Speak.</i>

546
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,460
No.

547
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,544
[Love retches]

548
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,005
[coughing and gasping]

549
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,549
[Dottie] Love, Love.

550
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,676
[sniffles, breathing heavily]

551
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,845
Come here. It's in your hair, sweetie.

552
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,932
- I'm so sorry if she called you.
- I drank.

553
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,017
My daughter's having one
of her drama queen days.

554
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,186
- [Love] I'm sorry.
- [Joe]<i> I see it now.</i>

555
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,790
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go get cleaned up.

556
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,106
[Joe]<i> Your mother's a demon,</i>

557
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,108
<i>dragging you to hell with her.</i>

558
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,902
<i>I have to rescue you from her.</i>

559
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,114
[stammering]<i> Four hits of acid.</i>

560
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,532
<i>It's okay.</i>

561
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,658
<i>It's all in my mind.</i>

562
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,870
<i>- I've ridden harder rides.</i>
- [boy] Where are we going?

563
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,791
[Joe]<i> Is that me?</i>

564
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,335
<i>Is my intuition telling me to go that way,</i>

565
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,379
<i>or is every horror fan in the universe</i>

566
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,632
<i>currently screaming
at me not to follow the creepy kid?</i>

567
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,802
<i>Did I teleport or...</i>

568
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,722
<i>No, it's acid.
This is a Grateful Dead concert.</i>

569
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,724
<i>I love you, Love.</i>

570
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,184
<i>I'll get through this.</i>

571
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,190
<i>Candace? No. Deadhead concert.</i>

572
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,775
Very bad writer.

573
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,276
[Joe grunts]

574
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,119
I'm sorry tonight didn't turn out
as you expected.

575
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,747
I swear I didn't mean to upset you.

576
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,000
We just...
never talk about the right things.

577
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,296
If I did such a horrible job,
how'd you turn out so well?

578
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,132
Oh, you're biased.

579
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,384
Or you're lying.

580
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,220
I never lie to you.

581
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,050
You're the only other Quinn
who can handle the truth.

582
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,182
[chuckles lightly]

583
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,601
I know I can be hard on you sometimes,

584
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,938
and that's because you're strong, like me.

585
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,359
I really do see so much of myself in you.

586
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,615
One day you'll have children,
and you'll understand.

587
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,784
When they need you,

588
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,161
like you need me right now,

589
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,997
it's no longer so hard to love them.

590
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,085
I'm gonna get us our suite.

591
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,838
Meet me up there whenever you're ready.

592
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,981
[female voice echoing] <i>Joey! Joey! Joey.</i>

593
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,524
- Mom?
- [fingers snapping]

594
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,360
[Forty] Hey. Welcome back, Mr. Producer.

595
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,363
Your mom's not here, but use that.

596
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,992
[both grunt]

597
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,494
[exhales]

598
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,203
[sighs]

599
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,663
Ellie was right.

600
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,543
The whole thing needs to be
from Beck's perspective.

601
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,045
What does Beck want?

602
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,257
What did Beck feel?
What did Beck dream about?

603
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,507
Beck,

604
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,888
the poor girl who lost her life
to give us this story,

605
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,141
what was she searching for
in that sea of men?

606
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,268
We need to see her, Joe!

607
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:39,022
- Beck! Come on, man! Think!
- Beck! Come on, Joe! Think!

608
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,189
[Joe]<i> I think I'm dead.</i>

609
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,401
<i>He poisoned me,
and I died, and this is my hell.</i>

610
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,405
I need to become Beck.

611
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,034
[Joe]<i> I need the earth to split open
and swallow me whole.</i>

612
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,118
Let's role-play.

613
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,995
You be Dr. Nicky, I'll be GB.

614
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,997
- I can't.
- Come on.

615
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,249
[exhales heavily]

616
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,503
I was your patient.

617
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,839
Why did you take advantage of me?

618
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,674
[Joe]<i> I am not doing this.</i>

619
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,551
[shouting]
Why did you take advantage of me?

620
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,387
- I was trying to help you.
- I needed a therapist,

621
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:16,392
not some psychotic asshole posing
as Prince Charming.

622
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,018
Okay.

623
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,855
- I hear you.
- What gives you the right?

624
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,334
- You thought that I would be grateful?
- [Beck]<i>...grateful?</i>

625
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,651
Your life was a mess!

626
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,194
Yes, but it was <i>my </i>life!

627
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,530
- And I didn't need some sociopath...
<i>- </i>[Beck] <i>And I didn't need some...</i>

628
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,367
- ...on a white horse to clean the house.
- We can't do this!

629
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,952
Come on, Joe, do it.

630
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,635
- Choke me. Do it. Don't be a pussy hat.
- Forty, I can't do this!

631
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,823
- You're not special. You're broken.
- [Beck] <i>You're not special. You're broken.</i>

632
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,044
[Beck's voice]<i> I could never love you.
You are the bad thing.</i>

633
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,381
<i>You are the thing
that you should have killed.</i>

634
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,757
[choking]

635
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,591
Do it.

636
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,760
[grunting]

637
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,766
[Forty grunts]

638
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,604
[Joe yells in pain]

639
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,314
[both grunting]

640
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,692
[both panting]

641
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,152
Wow. That was, like, um...

642
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,781
Joaquin-level method. Way to s...
Way to commit.

643
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
Respect.

644
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,826
Oh...

645
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,705
Okay, okay. Uh-oh. Crying.

646
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,333
You know what that means.
Rule number three,

647
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,677
we're just gonna drink
some Moon Juice, okay?

648
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,047
[shouts] What fucking Moon Juice?
We don't have any Moon Juice.

649
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,425
- Shh, shh, shh.
- [whimpering]

650
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,093
You're gonna go to Anavrin,

651
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,303
you're gonna buy some Moon Juice.

652
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,681
Maybe some cassava chips,

653
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,517
some dried apple slices.

654
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,977
What about Dimitri?

655
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,438
[wheezing]

656
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,606
"Mama Ru" is the safe word.

657
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,984
If you just say that, he'll let you out.

658
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,323
[shouting]
There's been a fucking safe word?

659
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,284
Of course.

660
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,246
I'm not a crazy person. All right?

661
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,415
But we can only use it once,

662
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,876
- so make it count.
- [sobbing]

663
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,795
I wou... Oh.
I would come with you, but, um...

664
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,049
[chuckles] I think I'm peaking.

665
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,801
You can do this, Joe!

666
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,431
Mama Ru! Mama Ru!

667
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,024
[Joe]<i> What? How the hell did I get here?</i>

668
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,486
<i>Is this the hotel room?</i>

669
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,823
<i>Did I leave and come back? Or...</i>

670
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,701
<i>What in the hell?</i>

671
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,369
[water running]

672
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:54,592
<i>Was the blood real? Did I wash it off?
Is it on my shirt? Was that really there?</i>

673
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,928
<i>What is even real?</i>

674
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,974
<i>How long was I gone and what did I do?</i>

675
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,937
<i>Grocery bags. That is a clue.</i>

676
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,944
Good. You stopped crying.
What did I tell you?

677
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,445
Moon Juice is the shit.

678
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,782
- Did I leave this room?
- Yeah.

679
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,702
Where do you think all this came from?
Feeling good about Beck now.

680
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,248
When you were, um... strangling me,
I really got it.

681
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,917
[Joe]<i> I don't have a car, so...</i>

682
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,669
How did I get to Anavrin?

683
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,838
Or back?

684
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,256
How should I know?

685
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,758
I am breaking story, brah.

686
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,679
I'm, like, balls deep
in Dr. Nicky's psyche over here.

687
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,407
How do you think Dr. Nicky
hid his sociopathy for so long?

688
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,641
How long was I gone?

689
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,703
- Answer my question, I'll answer yours.
- Why does he have to be a sociopath?

690
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,647
Maybe he's a man
who would do anything for love.

691
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,400
Your turn. How long was I gone?

692
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,483
About an hour.

693
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,529
[Joe]<i> Not enough time to get all this
and do something bad.</i>

694
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,655
Or three.

695
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,659
Difficult to say. I was in flow.
Somewhere between one and three hours.

696
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,920
- You're getting that look again.
- What look?

697
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,082
That weird panicky look you had
when you came in.

698
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,501
You kept saying
there was blood on your hands.

699
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,420
- Was there?
- Couldn't say.

700
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,673
Yeah. Every time I looked at your hands,
all I could see was lobsters.

701
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,216
[Joe] <i>Who else might've seen me?</i>

702
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,676
[gasps]<i> Dimitri.</i>

703
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,850
[Joe screams]

704
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,359
Dinner break. What?

705
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,445
[sighs]

706
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,381
When I came back from the store,
did I have anything on my hands?

707
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,451
No. Hands clean.

708
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,453
Go write.

709
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,872
[Joe]<i> Okay. This is good. Hands clean.</i>

710
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,207
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

711
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,751
<i>On track. Mexico City. 9:02 a.m.</i>

712
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,586
- [phone ringing]
<i>- Your ringtone, Love.</i>

713
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,421
<i>I need to make sure you're okay.</i>

714
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,504
I need my phone.

715
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,634
- No phone.
- Man, it's important!

716
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,177
No phone!

717
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,470
[Forty] I'm trying to work!

718
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,934
You're welcome.

719
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,852
Thank you.

720
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,149
[phone continues ringing]

721
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,865
[Joe]<i> Be normal.</i>

722
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,909
<i>I'm normal.</i>

723
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,167
- Hey you.
<i>- Hey.</i>

724
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,629
<i>You look terrible. Are you in a bathroom?</i>

725
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,298
Yeah, I... I, uh...

726
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,676
I'm... I'm sorry...

727
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,264
if I seemed weird earlier

728
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,348
<i>in the hall.</i>

729
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,349
<i>I was...</i>

730
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,103
<i>overwhelmed saying goodbye.</i>

731
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,148
No. That's why I'm calling. Okay?

732
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,524
Listen to me.

733
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,237
No to goodbye.

734
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,032
I refuse your goodbye.

735
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,829
You are the first thing in so long
that has felt right.

736
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:15,001
Now, I grew up with toxic,
conditional love, and I am done.

737
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,879
I forgive your stupid lie.

738
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,339
I just... I want to be with you.

739
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,842
<i>I want a life with you.</i>

740
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,759
<i>Do you...</i>

741
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,345
want that, too?

742
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,930
Yes.

743
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,392
[both chuckle]

744
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,685
<i>More than anything!</i>

745
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,602
Okay.

746
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,150
Whatever you're running from,
we can figure it out together.

747
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,030
[Joe]<i> If only that were true.</i>

748
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,407
<i>Once Delilah's free, we can't be here.</i>

749
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,490
Um...

750
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,118
What if we...

751
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,370
<i>What if we leave together?</i>

752
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,372
<i>Start over.</i>

753
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,207
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

754
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,211
<i>Away from your parents.
You could finish cooking school in Paris.</i>

755
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,464
Or anywhere. Anywhere you want.

756
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,342
Wow, that sounds amazing, but...

757
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,595
<i>what about Forty?</i>

758
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,098
<i>I can't... leave him with them.</i>

759
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,433
Um...

760
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,605
<i>Yeah. Of course.</i>

761
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,484
We'll take Forty with us wherever we go.

762
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,028
<i>Thank you.</i>

763
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,696
[sighs in relief] <i>Thank you.</i>

764
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,740
I am so happy.

765
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,702
<i>I can't wait. Okay.
Will you meet me tomorrow morning?</i>

766
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,661
Um...

767
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,373
I have something to tend to.

768
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,625
But then I'm yours.

769
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,753
<i>I wolf you.</i>

770
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,505
I wolf you more.

771
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,138
[sighs happily]

772
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,099
[Joe]<i> This night does have a silver lining</i>

773
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,725
<i>We will make it work.</i>

774
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,103
<i>I'll negotiate with Delilah,</i>

775
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,605
<i>buy her silence.
We will be in another country.</i>

776
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,816
<i>We won't have to look over our shoulders.</i>

777
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,818
<i>Forty, we'll, uh, figure that one out.</i>

778
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,986
<i>Everything is going to be all right.</i>

779
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,363
[woman] Joey...

780
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,126
There you are.

781
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,589
- You gave Mommy a scare.
- [Joe] <i>You are not here. This isn't real.</i>

782
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,882
Oh, Joey...

783
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,469
Do you really think your love story
is gonna have a happy ending?

784
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,602
- Stop.
- People like us don't change.

785
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,062
I've changed.

786
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,109
Then why are you already thinking of ways
to get rid of Forty?

787
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,861
I'm not. I haven't been.

788
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,448
So many accidents that can happen
in a hotel room, can't they?

789
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,662
- You're not real. I'm not gonna...
- Of course

790
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,414
you're gonna kill him.

791
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,207
Just like Delilah.

792
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,710
It was a done deal
once you threw her in that cage.

793
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,712
She's already dead.

794
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,797
You're wrong.

795
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,841
I let Will out.

796
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,302
And I'm gonna let Delilah out.

797
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,345
I've changed.

798
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,809
Are you sure?

799
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,402
[Joe screams]

800
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,321
Forty.

801
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,032
Are they real?

802
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,660
Are my hands... Are...

803
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,581
[Joe] <i>Whoa.</i>

804
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,958
I figured it out.

805
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,340
And you were right. It wasn't sociopathy.

806
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:53,636
It was a crime of passion
by someone who loved her.

807
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,846
[Joe] <i>Where is he going with this?</i>

808
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,682
But Dr. Nicky didn't love her.

809
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,644
She was just his side piece.

810
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,855
Her ex-boyfriend loved her, though.

811
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,609
What ex-boyfriend?

812
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,861
She mentions him a few times in the book.

813
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,364
Casually. Never even by name.

814
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,741
He seems harmless.

815
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,663
But he murdered her in a jealous rage,
and he framed Dr. Nicky.

816
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,876
Nobody suspected him, though.

817
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,255
He's just a... normal guy.

818
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,507
Like you or...

819
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,883
me.

820
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,888
You want to know how I figured it out?

821
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,770
It's okay, baby.

822
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,070
I'll forgive you.

823
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,117
I'll tell you how I know.

824
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,286
Because it's exactly what I did.

825
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,044
I was in love with Sofia,

826
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,421
our <i>au pair.</i>

827
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,385
My parents said I was too young,
but... I wasn't.

828
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,388
I loved her.

829
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,515
And she loved me.

830
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,351
It wasn't just some dumb crush.

831
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,731
It was love.

832
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,570
When I found out she was seeing
some college guy,

833
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,284
I felt this rage inside of me.

834
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:45,914
Like an animal made of teeth and of fire.

835
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,876
And I blacked out.

836
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,464
[voice cracking] And I killed her.

837
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,927
[crying] I came to,
and I was standing over her.

838
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:04,391
My parents made it look like a suicide.
Made it go away.

839
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,313
Do you know...

840
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,192
how painful it's been?

841
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,362
Carrying around a secret like that?

842
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,365
[Joe]<i> More than he'll ever know.</i>

843
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,452
You were just a kid.

844
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,413
A confused kid.

845
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,667
You're forgiven.

846
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,922
You don't think I'm a monster?

847
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,631
No.

848
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,844
I think you have a bright future.

849
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,806
[Joe] <i>And on acid, at least,
he's a savant.</i>

850
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,016
What you just pitched to me,

851
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,688
it's a great movie.

852
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,357
I think you should write it.

853
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,275
You should fictionalize it.

854
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,528
[Joe] <i>Taking as many liberties</i>
as possible.

855
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,821
You should write it.

856
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,911
[sniffles] Um...

857
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:12,835
I, um... don't know what's going on
between you and my sister, but...

858
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,673
she would be crazy to let you go.

859
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,178
I think we're gonna make it.

860
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,038
[Joe]<i> It's been 11 hours.</i>

861
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,624
<i>Most of it must be out of my system
by now.</i>

862
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,834
<i>And there's still time.</i>

863
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,464
<i>I'm sober and free.</i>

864
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,216
Forty?

865
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,389
[Joe]<i> Let's, uh, hope
he just went out for coffee.</i>

866
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,352
<i>Come on, Ellie, I don't have time.</i>

867
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,190
- What?
- Hey, um,

868
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,358
do you think you could get yourself home?

869
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,736
Can I pick up my phone
and request an Uber?

870
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,822
Yeah, I think I can manage that.

871
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,657
Okay, great. Well, see...

872
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,036
[Joe]<i> Now, I just have to get to Delilah
before those cuffs open up.</i>

873
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,246
<i>In another reality,</i>

874
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,415
<i>I'd be heading to the airport, but...</i>

875
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,586
<i>I'm rewriting our movie, Love,
because of you.</i>

876
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,130
<i>The hero races to the cage,</i>

877
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:45,219
<i>he raises the door, and steps inside,
eager to set Delilah free,</i>

878
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,555
<i>and begin the rest of his life.</i>

879
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,787
[closing music playing]
