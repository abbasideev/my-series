00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,561
[woman] I take care of him
every single day.

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,564
All day long. And you're gonna bawl me out
for one night with my friends?

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,565
[man] You think I'm stupid?

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,651
- You think I'm gonna believe this shit?
- No. I think you're paranoid.

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,319
You need help.

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,030
[man] I'm not done talking to you.

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,341
- [woman] Don't touch me!
- Or what? What are you gonna do?

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,635
- [woman] Let go of me. You're hurting me.
- You think I'm a fool?

9
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,869
Is that what you think of me?

10
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,163
- Why can't you just do right...
- No, please!

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,081
...and love me
like you're supposed to, huh?

12

[Joe]<i> It's been said

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>So why do I keep dreaming
about my childhood?</i>

17
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,348
<i>Dr. Nicky would have said
I have unprocessed feelings</i>

18

<i>about how my parents
didn't take very good care of me.</i>

19

<i>more selfless.</i>

24

<i>You make me feel good.</i>

25

<i>So good, I forget whatever darkness
resurfaced in my sleep.</i>

Can that wait?

33
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,480
No, I ignored him three times last night.

34
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,273
Okay. Hey.

35
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,776
Lovey, where you been?

36
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,778
[Love] <i>Uh, Phone died. What's up?</i>

37
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,488
Ted Hope is what's up.

38
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>Ran into him at NeueHouse.</i>

39
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,119
<i>Told him I am this close
to attaching Hendy to my new project,</i>

40
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,579
and he wants to see the full pitch.

41
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,915
Can you even process that?

42
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,374
That's great.

43
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,335
That's really great.

44
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,047
Now all I need to do is mind meld
with our idea machine, Will.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,341
You haven't heard from him, have you?

46
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,009
He... um... hmm.

47
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
Yeah, you know,
I haven't heard much from him.

[breathless]
<i>The guy must really not be feeling well.</i>

49
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,142
Yeah, poor guy. Oh.

50
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,684
One other thing.

51
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,312
My inner Sasquatch is coming out,

52
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,691
so I'm gonna need you
to, uh, cut my hair before this meeting.

53
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,109
Yeah, okay. Tomorrow afternoon?

54
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,736
Yeah. Uh, why do you sound
so out of breath?

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,947
I'm on the elliptical, you know. Gotta go.

56

[Joe]<i> Old me would be annoyed
by such an intrusion.</i>

57

<i>- wasn't even fazed by it.</i>
- [both panting]

59
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,127
- [Joe]<i> And you know why that is.</i>
- Oh, right there!

60
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,254
<i>Because I finally feel</i>

61
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,965
<i>like I'm becoming a better man.</i>

62

[Love moans]

63
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,551
That's so fucking good!

64
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,179
[Joe]<i> And it's all because of you.</i>

65
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,056
[theme song playing]

66
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,738
Didn't peg you for an outer space guy.

67
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,574
Oh, it came with the apartment.

68
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,910
Along with the pink, fuzzy pillows.

69
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,622
Hey, you can see my house from here.

70
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,809
- All the better to spy on you.
- [gasps]

71
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,544
[Joe]<i> Not that I've needed to

73
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,137
Let me guess.

74
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,512
Forty?

75
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,390
When you text him back just...

76
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,184
don't tell him about us.

77
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,562
[Joe] <i>But if your brother knew about us,
maybe he'd give us some space.</i>

78
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,272
Remind me again...

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,025
why "us" is a secret.

80
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,070
Whenever I start dating someone,

81
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,365
Forty tends to feel threatened.

82
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,533
You know, he doesn't have
many people to count on

83
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,952
so he needs me.

84
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,247
And his sobriety is always
the most fragile in the first...

85
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,457
you know, right after he's slipped.

86
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,834
Let's just give him a week or two

87
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,503
before we, you know,

88
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,506
shove our euphoria in his face.

89
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,384
[Joe]<i> Even your empathy is a turn-on.</i>

90
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,970
If you're euphoric now, just wait,

91
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,972
just wait until Santa Barbara
this weekend.

92
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,098
I know.

93

94
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,315
[Joe]<i> And there goes Santa Barbara.</i>

95
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,941
What if...

96
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,238
we take a rain check

97
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,823
on Santa Barbara?

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,369
The more time you spend with him now,
the cooler he'll be when we do tell him.

99
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,748
[Joe]<i> Anything for you, Love.</i>

I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

103
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,588
Okay.

104
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,844
Well, I guess that means
we'll have to make up for that

105
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,971
lost Santa Barbara sex some other way.

Um what do you think you're doing?

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,698
[Ellie] Working on a project?

110
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,991
What project?

111
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,118
I told you, I don't want...

112
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,037
I'm not hanging out
with Henderson anymore.

113

[pauses music]

114
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,707
Why? What'd he do?

115
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,126
He just drinks too much.
It's embarrassing.

116
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,005
[Joe]<i> This explains why she hasn't
been texting Henderson all week.</i>

117

<i>Huge relief.</i>

118
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,258
Goetz's dad's girlfriend needs a PA

119

for a short that starts shooting
next week.

120
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,013
Painfully derivative,

121

[Ellie] Till then,

122
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,184
I'm expressing myself through collage.

Just... do not ruin my walls.

127
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,825
Yeah, she so wants to be at power top.

128
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,029
- Tell me about it.
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,388
Can you believe she put
that spy software on my phone?

[Joe]<i> Shit.</i>

- You sure it was her?
- Who else would it be?

132
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,627
So you're not gonna tell her you know?

133
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,629
Obviously not.

134
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,758
It's way more useful
if she thinks it's still working.

If you bring me the <i>Beast Wars</i> box
in my coat closet,

176
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,169
I can make a fake passport,

177
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,380
and you will never hear from me again.

178
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,464
I have an idea.

179
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,342
You like games.

180
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,720
Love 'em, in other contexts, dude.

181
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,804
Right.

182
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,974
I will let you out...

183
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,433
if you prove

184
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,269
you'll never turn me in.

185
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,146
Prove my loyalty?

186
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,776
And how am I supposed to do that
from inside a cage?

187
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,363
I don't know. You're smart.
I believe in you.

[Will scoffs]

189
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,491
Don't give up.

190
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,328
You need something
to get your brain juices flowing.

191
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,372
You need a project.

192
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,627
What do you need this time?

193
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,965
I need Henderson's home security disabled.

194
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,217
- [quietly chuckling]
- He's hiding something.

195
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,594
Sounds familiar.

196
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,849
You're gonna need a jammer.

197
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,018
Question is which kind,

198
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,228
so I'll need to know what system he's got.

199
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,648
Oh, am I allowed to touch a laptop

200
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,108

201
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,611

Stop. That one.

204
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,203
Is that a sign by the hedge?

205
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,583
People put those signs around their house
to make them feel safe

206
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,918
because they are, respectfully,

207
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,713

Oh, Emma showed up to set the other day
with her head and eyebrows shaved,

- Ashita..

- Good.
- But she says it's a pitta imbalance,

257
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,887
Of course.

258
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,097
Yeah, but she refuses to do blood cleanse.

259
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,367
- [Lucy] Because it tastes like fresh anus.

Tell me you're doing reiki. Come on.

Or, you know, cupping will help.

Okay, so...

288
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,617
I just thought...

289
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,747
that if I was going to meet
your insanely tight inner circle,

290
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,917
you know, I would get in my head

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,420
and, like, research everyone, and...

292
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
I just wanted you
to be able to be relaxed.

293
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,884
[Joe]<i> You did this for me.</i>

294

Okay.

295
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,974
Then can someone please tell me
what the hell a pitta imbalance is?

296
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,142
- Oh, yes.
- [laughing] Oh, honey.

297
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,812
I thought you would never ask. Um,

298
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,188

No.

Hey, Forty, I thought it was your day off.

307

Just coming in for my green juice.

00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,796
- Well, join us. Grab a bun.
- Yeah.

Wait, Love, weren't you checking out
agave wholesalers today?

310
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,261
Yeah, I was going to
and then we all ran into each other.

311
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,887
Mm-hmm.

312
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,765
Why don't you just sit down?

313
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,849
[Forty] Why?

314
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,727
So you can lie to my face right now?

315
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,272
Yeah, I've been knowing
that you two were hooking up.

316
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,443
And I was just waiting
for you to come clean.

317
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,779
And you don't even have the decency

318
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,198
to invite me to your coming-out brunch.

319
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,992
We can talk when I cut your hair...

320
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,202
No, you're not touching my hair!

321
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,415
Forty, this is not the time or place.
You need to stop it now.

322
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,257

He's punishing me.

328
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,494
God.

329
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,122
[sighs] I hope he's not drinking.

330
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,168
I should... I should text his sponsor.

331

[Joe]<i> Honestly, you could both
use some boundaries.</i>

Every one of us has a blind spot.</i>

- No.
- [phone clatters]

334
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,926
I shouldn't.

[sighs] This is crazy.

336
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,182
I am... [sing-songy] crazy!

337
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,851
You're not crazy.

338

You are <i>trying</i> to be a good sister.

339
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,692
[Joe]<i> Here is where old me would suggest
you need to distance yourself,</i>

340

<i>even if that meant pushing Forty
further toward the edge.</i>

341
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,573
Then why do I feel so shitty?

342
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,037
[Joe]<i> But new me, the me I'm becoming

Forty wants to be...

Can you just...?

346
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,838
Forty wants to be included.

347
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,507
All right? So let's include him.

348
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,843
Standing Sunday brunch thing.

349
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,595
Beach day once a month.

350
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,389
- Once.
- [chuckles]

351
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,894
Yeah, I think he would really like that.

352
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,148
Starting now,
I'm gonna be a better friend.

353
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,901
I'm gonna help him come up
with a killer pitch.

354
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,822
[Joe]<i> Busier he is with a viable project,
the less dependent he'll be on you.</i>

355
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,991
I cannot ask you to do that.

356
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,244
You didn't. It would be my honor.

357
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,964
[panting]

358
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,050
[both moaning]

359
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,095
Aw, man.

360
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,638
That...

361
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,848
That was heaven.

362
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,517
[panting] That was medicine.

363
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,561
They should bottle you, Delilah.

364
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,438
They should.

365
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,358
[exhales]

366
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,028
You okay?

367
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,237
What? Yeah, yeah.

368
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,697
You sure? You seem...

369
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,199
kinda distant.

370
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,702
[chuckling] I'm sorry,
are we <i>that</i> kind of fuck buddy now?

371
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,163
You know, we can talk about real stuff...

372
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,625
without violating
the fuck buddy code of ethics.

373
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,918
It's... It's been done.

374
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,546
Okay. Um... [snaps tongue]

375
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,883
I am... dealing with a thing.

376
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,053
And I could actually use
some professional advice.

377
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,430
Like from... Yeah, of course.

378
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,433
But like so fucking off the record,
it's not even funny.

379
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,603
Okay, OTR, I got it.

380
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,686
Okay.

381
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,357
Someone anonymously...

382
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,443
sent me some photos that I know for a fact

383
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,113
were taken by a certain
high-profile celebrity.

384
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,493
And some of the girls in the photos,

385
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,328
maybe all...

386
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,163
are underage.

387
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,750
That prick you've been trying to nail,
Henderson.

388
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,128
Maybe one of your sources
is trying to give you some more ammo.

389
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
Maybe.

390
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,174
I want to write the exposé. I want to...

391
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,636
nail his one remaining ball
to the ceiling, but...

392
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,638
the more that I think about it...

393
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm one of the girls.

394
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,561
Oh, no, man, Delilah...

395
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,273
And if I break the story,
and it comes out later

396
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,876
that the same thing happened to me,
then I lose all credibility.

397
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,528
The whole story just gets picked apart.

398
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,488
I could take the photos into Sex Crimes.

399
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,907
I'll say that I got them anonymously.

400
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,619
Yeah, so some star-fucker cops
can get paid off to bury them? Yeah.

401
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,913
I know the right people
to talk to, Delilah.

402
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,623
Don't you trust me?

403
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,669
Okay.

404
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,647
[man] Come on, people must have told you
you look like a model.

405
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,525
- We should get a drink sometime.
- You're single?

406
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,319
[woman] It's complicated.

407
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,156
I'm going out of town tomorrow,
but I could take you out tonight.

408
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,908
[woman] Tonight doesn't work,
but how about now?

409
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,953
Seems like you've got
your hands full already.

410
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh, he's a big boy.

411
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,146
I'm gonna need you to stay here for a bit.

412
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,178
Read your book. I'll be back.

413
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,601
[Love giggling]

414
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,270
[Forty moans]

415
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,881
- Don't go too short like last time, okay?
- [Love] I'm not.

416
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,692
You asked me to do this.

417
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,818
[chuckles]

418
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,863
Top of the morning, will.i.am.

419
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,073
I hope we didn't wake you.

420
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,157
I hope we did.

421
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,703
So I can apologize
for losing my shit yesterday.

422
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,998
Oh, it's already forgotten.

423
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,710
You are one magnanimous motherfucker.

424
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,295
And we...

425
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,672
are going to make a great team.

426
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,926
Right. I told Forty that you said
you would help him with his project.

427
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,012
<i>- </i>[Joe] <i>Only so I can have more of you.</i>
- Absolutely.

428
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,347
Schweet.

429
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,059
I had to push the Ted Hope meeting
because I was irate after...

430
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,270
Well, we don't need to talk
about the brunch anymore.

431
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,273
Uh, but It's fine. I'll pitch him
when he gets back from South By.

432
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,608
Sounds like a plan.

433
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,571
But you and I should get started
this afternoon.

434
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,487
- Okay.
- Also, Lovey said something

435
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,697
about all of us going
to the beach later today?

436
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,781
Oh, right.

437
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,326
[Joe]<i> Sooner than I'd care to, but...</i>

438
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,285
Great.

439
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,829
But I need Love...

440
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,706
to go with me
to buy a new suit for the pitch.

441
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,458
Sure, let's go shopping.

442
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,378
No, like, just me and Love.

443
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,173
I get self-conscious
when I go suit shopping because of...

444
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,342
my thighs.

445
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,512
Forty, Will and I have plans.

446
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,723
It's fine. Will doesn't mind.

447
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,934
Do you, old sport?

448
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,521
[Joe]<i> Your brother is a monster.</i>

449
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,604
Not at all.

450
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,232
Happy shopping.

451
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,738
[Joe]<i> Becoming a better person
is way more aggravating than I thought,</i>

452
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,241
<i>but I'm still going to find a way
to help your brother.</i>

453
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:12,951
How's book one?

454
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,538
Margarita just rescued the rape victim
from eternal damnation.

455
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,499
So, uh, you know... light beach reading.

456
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,007
That's the book guy?

457
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,800
He doesn't play for your team.

458
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,012
No fair. You already have Hendy
so why do you get all the hot zaddies?

459
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,930
Okay, first,

460
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,974
Will is like a eunuch to me.

461
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,434
And Hendy?

462
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,603
He is not my zaddy either.

463
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,896
Which reminds me,

464
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,856
I'm going to his screening tonight.

465
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,859
Text me and invite me to sleep over
so D thinks I'm at your place.

466
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,985
[sing-songy] Thank you.

467
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,324
[Joe]<i> Why hasn't Delilah
gotten Henderson arrested yet?</i>

468
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,578
[heavy pounding]

469
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,877
[pounding intensifies]

470
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,047
[Joe]<i> Flaming Hot Cheetos.</i>

471
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,341
<i>Stress food, very bad sign.</i>

472
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,927
Management should really get that fixed.

473
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,513
What do you need, Apartment Three?

474
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,350
Just wanted to make sure
you got that envelope on your doorstep.

475
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,520
How did you know about that?

476
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,939
I saw a girl drop it off.

477
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
What'd she look like?

478
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,693
I saw her from behind.
She had a... hoodie.

479
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,777
Why?

480
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,404
Nothing.

481
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,115
Doesn't seem like nothing.

482
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,243
Hey, is someone harassing you?

483
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,326
No.

484
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,248
Delilah, I've seen the look on your face.
If someone is bothering you, just...

485
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,667
- Hi.
- Hi.

486
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,630
If someone is bothering you,
go to the cops.

487
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,073
- I'll go with you.
- Would you relax? Nobody's stalking me.

488
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,428
This is about Henderson.

489
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,808
The woman you saw dropped
his kiddie porn photos on my doorstep.

490
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,102
Well, this is great, right?

491
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,604
I showed 'em to a cop,
and he said they're useless

492
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,166
and he can't do shit with them
because Henderson's not in them.

493
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,234
And the backdrop's completely nondescript.

494
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,902
Bastard's smart.

495
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,406
- [Joe]<i> Shit. Shit, shit, shit!</i>
- So what are you gonna do?

496
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,129
Stick 'em in a drawer until somebody else
blows the whistle on him.

497
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,829
If the police had found them on Henderson
or in Henderson's house,

498
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,623
then they could've made a case,
but as it is...

499
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,835
whoever swiped them
bungled the shit out of this.

500
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,339
[phone buzzing]

501
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,135
[Joe]<i> Double fuck!</i>

502
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,488
<i>Promised to help your brother,
but now I have to make sure</i>

503
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,181
<i>Ellie doesn't
walk into the jaws of perversion.</i>

504
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,183
<i>I'll have to keep it short with Forty.</i>

505
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,351
Sit down.

506
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,811
In the end,

507
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,524
our guy has to murder all three women.

508
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,736
It's like... the ultimate irony.

509
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,779
So what do you think?

510
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,912
[Joe]<i> That it sounds like the most
anti-feminist horror film in history,</i>

511
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,244
<i>- which is saying a lot.</i>
- I think it's really good.

512
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,121
You don't think it gets wonky
in the middle?

513
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,831
- No.
- You don't think we need to, like,

514
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,125
spitball that page 90 shit?

515
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,670
[Joe]<i> He's not going to let me leave
until I say...</i>

516
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,088
Honestly, I think it's genius.

517
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,299
Okay...

518
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,053
don't throw the G word around
if you don't mean it, Will.

519
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,846
- I do.
- I knew it.

520
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,183
Man, I wish I could go
to South By Pitch Fest tomorrow.

521
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,684
It's fine.

522
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,770
Gives us more time
to work the dough, right?

523
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,772
I think we are on a roll.

524
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,982
I think... we should go all night?

525
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,611
[Joe]<i> How do I get out now
without this six-foot-one baby</i>

526
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,612
<i>throwing a tantrum?</i>

527
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,239
No, no.
You don't want to overwork the dough.

528
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,158
I think you should go to South By tonight.

529
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Pitch it tomorrow.

530
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,787
- For reals?
- Take the red-eye.

531
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,456
You said Ted Hope is there, right?

532
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,999
Show him you're in demand.

533
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,834
Start a bidding war.

534
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,796
- Fuck yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

535
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,589
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good for you.

536
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,930
[man]<i> Where you been?</i>

537
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,599
[woman] At the market.

538
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,850
[man] For four hours?

539
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,255
[woman] You should ask your son.

540
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,729
He wanted to play hide-and-seek
and scare Mommy.

541
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,441
I'm gonna get the rest of the groceries.

542
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,904
[door closes]

543
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,785
You're old enough to know that your mom...

544
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,539
sometimes accidentally tells a little lie.

545
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,042
But I know you always tell the truth.

546
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,335
Come here, Joey.

547
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,212
Come here.

548
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,556
Pain, it can make people truthful.

549
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,639
[Will] Hey.

550
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,642
What you doing with that rope?

551
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,186
Don't worry, it's for Henderson.

552
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,479
Uh-huh...

553
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,068
And what exactly
are you planning to do to him?

554
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,904
Gonna get him to confess on video,

555
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,198
ruin his career, and get him arrested.

556
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,451
Why? What'd you think I was gonna say?

557
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,871
Someone else, not you...

558
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,834
a less stable person might see...

559
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,337
Hendy's depravity
as justification for killing him.

560
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,007
That's not me.

561
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,717
I know.

562
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,720
I know it's not.

563
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,557
You're thoughtful, controlled...

564
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,684
[chuckles softly]

565
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,519
The more I learn about you,

566
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,105
the more clearly I see
the answer to your question.

567
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,857
How can you...

568
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,778
be sure I'll be loyal once you let me out?

569
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,696
The answer is...

570
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,033
there is no answer.

571
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,369
No matter what I say, you will never
be sure if I'll turn you in.

572
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,331
[Joe]<i> But I need to be sure, Love, for us.</i>

573
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,414
Hold on.

574
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,752
I know you want to do the right thing

575
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,171
or you wouldn't have asked at all.

576
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,175
I've done business with bad people,
you're not them.

577
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,842
You...

578
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,596
do bad things when you feel trapped

579
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,183
or, key, to protect someone, which...

580
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,603
we all hope we would have the courage
to do that.

581
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,606
To me, that makes you more good than bad.

582
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,442
I think you're a good man.

583
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,028
You could kill Henderson,

584
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,572
but you're letting justice
take its course.

585
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,075
That's what a good man would do.

586
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,702
[Joe]<i> He's biased, but I hope he's right.</i>

587
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,705
But to really be good, Joe,

588
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,374
you have to let me out of here.

589
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,460
[Joe]<i> Another impossible puzzle, Love,</i>

590
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,004
<i>but for you, I'll try to solve anything.</i>

591
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,093
[phone buzzing]

592
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,179
[Joe]<i> It's not the best time,
but you always come first.</i>

593
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,263
Hey, you.

594
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,433
Did you tell Forty
to take a red-eye to South By?

595
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,435
I may have mentioned it, yeah.

596
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,147
I really wish you would have asked me.
Film fests are tough on his sobriety.

597
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,732
I didn't realize that, I'm sorry.

598
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,235
I appreciate that,
but it still feels weird,

599
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,070
like you were trying
to get him out of town

600
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,989
so that you wouldn't have
to deal with him.

601
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,950
[Joe]<i> Being attracted to very smart women
is a double-edged sword.</i>

602
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,744
- I would never do that.
<i>- He said you used the words "bidding war."</i>

603
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,954
[Joe]<i> I should lie.</i>

604
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,291
<i>Half-truths just end up getting me burned
so I should lie.</i>

605
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,459
Will, please do not make this worse
by lying to me.

606
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,771
[Joe]<i> I have to because I can't tell you
the whole truth,</i>

607
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>which happens to be I did it
to save someone helpless.</i>

608
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,924
<i>Speaking of, need to stop her, now.</i>

609
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,634
[Love]<i> Hello? Are you there?</i>

610
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,553
[Joe]<i> Yeah, I'm... I'm here. I'm here.</i>

611
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,930
You're right.

612
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>I just wasn't thinking. I messed up.</i>

613
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,268
And from now on, I'll do better.

614
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,561
I promise.

615
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,771
That is what I needed to hear.

616
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,982
<i>Now I have to go.
I don't want to miss my flight.</i>

617
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,775
- Your flight?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

618
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,612
I'm going to be Forty's sober companion
at South By.

619
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,240
[Joe]<i> Kill me now.
Kill Forty, kill everything.</i>

620
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,200
- Have a great trip.
<i>- Call you from Austin.</i>

621
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,889
[Joe]<i> Perfect. Now I have to get Ellie out
of Henderson's, then get his confession.</i>

622
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,122
<i>I'm not sure how to do either.</i>

623
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,540
<i>What could go wrong?</i>

624
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,169
[knocking on door]

625
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,632
- @Ellie-Eyeballs, hey.
- Hey.

626
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,092
So bad news.
Jonah's girl came down with the flu

627
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,094
and Jonah's the one with the print,

628
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,096
so no screening tonight. Sorry.

629
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,973
Here, I'll call you an Uber.

630
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,475
Wait, dude, I came all this way.

631
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,477
We can still hang.

632
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,937
I can show you my short.

633
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,980
It's still in progress, but...

634
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,316
Listen, we're friends and it's cool.

635
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,276
I mean, you're massively cool, but...

636
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,278
you're also 15,

637
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,656
so we're not hanging out
in my house alone.

638
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,825
[Joe]<i> What is his game here?</i>

639
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,285
Okay, neurotic.

640
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,163
I'm not some random girl child.

641
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,290
And you said for weeks
you would watch my short.

642
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:40,959
All right, fine.

643
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,962
But you have to promise me
you won't tell anybody

644
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,356
that you were here alone with me, okay?
'Cause it's kinda...

645
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,255
I get it.

646
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,299
I'm a vault. Scout's honor.

647
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,720
[Joe]<i> Oh, this is his clever trick
to make her feel safe,</i>

648
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,472
<i>like she chose.</i>

649
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,657
[clapping]

650
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,368
- You're a filmmaker.
- [chuckles]

651
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,579
I saw some <i>Rear Window</i>
and a little bit of...

652
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,374
<i>Florida Project,</i> but with your own pathos.

653
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,752
I... I think you could've
held on the last image a bit longer.

654
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,713
That's what I was thinking.

655
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,258
I'm proud of you, Eyeballs.
Now I really wanna hear your feature idea.

656
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,760
Great. I've got a whole pitch prepared...

657
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,722
And I have, like, a super early morning.

658
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,473
Dude, ten minutes.

659
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,351
It's right up your alley
and I think you'll like it enough

660
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,520
to share it
with your producing partners, really.

661
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,608
Well, I never pitch without
at least one Scotch in me for luck,

662
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,485
so in your case, what do you want? Juice?

663
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,237
Uh, yeah, I'll take a watermelon.

664
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,988
Okay.

665
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,963
[Joe]<i> No alcohol. Interesting.</i>

666
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,931
<i>And a twist of GHB
for roofie-ing the teenaged girl.</i>

667
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,939
What the heck?

668
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,602
A little piece of advice: don't get a cat.

669
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,273
Here.

670
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,775
Cheers.

671
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,195
To making art.

672
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,909
[Joe]<i> To his dose kicking in first,
which it will.</i>

673
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,370
<i>It's a hell of a lot stronger.</i>

674
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,453
All right.

675
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,764
[speed metal blasting in headphones]

676
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,602
[music cuts]

677
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,146
What the fuck. Hey.

678
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,729
Hey, hey.

679
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,149
Huh? What?

680
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,360
Easy, easy. You're gonna hurt yourself.

681
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,443
Who are you?

682
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,029
Untie me!

683
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,992
- [Joe]<i> Oh, white male celebrity privilege.</i>
- Help me! Help! Help me!

684
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,244
You know this room is soundproof.

685
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,913
- You built it to be soundproof.
- Help me!

686
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,999
Help me!

687
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,627
I'm going to help you after you confess

688
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,546
to what you've been hiding
in this little...

689
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,006
secret room.

690
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,175
Secret room? What...?

691
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,219
You mean this room
that everybody knows about?

692
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,139
This is just standard, mass-produced
Pleasure Chest kink.

693
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,222
It's not illegal.

696
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,225
I'm not talking about kink,

697
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,273
I'm talking about your thing
for underage girls.

698
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,942
Like the one upstairs, for starters.

699
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,028
Ellie? I never touched her.

700
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,405
I don't have a thing for underaged girls.
This is insane!

701
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,241
The pictures in your cigar box
suggest otherwise!

702
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,120
Those aren't mine.

703
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,040
I'm holding them for a friend, all right?
He knows he needs help.

704
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,666
[Joe]<i> I'm not gonna kill him.</i>

705
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,835
<i>Just scare him into telling the truth.</i>

What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?

No, no no! What do you want?

- Ow!
- No, no! What do you want?!

709
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,595
You know what I want.

710
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,013
The truth.

711

Okay, okay!
They're mine, they're mine!

712
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,076
Okay, I... I never touched them, I swear.

713
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,245
They would fall asleep
and I would take their tops off,

714
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,980
snap a few photos, which I wouldn't
share with anyone, and then...

715
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,192
Who gets hurt? Nobody.
They don't even remember.

You're wrong.

And if you believe any
of what you just said, you're sick.

719

These are kids.

720
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,246
Listen, man,
if I did this to your girlfriend...

721
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,165

I'm really sorry.

722
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,333
I'm sorry. I...

723
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,627
I can pay you both.

724
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,920
I don't want your money.

725
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,297
I want your confession on video.

726
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,423
What?

727
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,053
I can't do that.

728
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,264
That would destroy me.
I'd lose everything.

729
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,347
Oh...

730
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,058
You deserve to.

731
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,686
No, no, no! Okay, okay, okay!
I'll do it, I'll do it! Please.

this is of your own volition.

734
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,697
Okay.

Now, look into the camera.

738

What do you want me to say? What, I'm...?

739
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,629
I'm a sicko?

740
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,759
Okay, fine, I'm... I'm bad.

741
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,344
All right, I'm disgusting.

742
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,639
What, do you think I like this shit?!

743
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,185
My stepdad, he... he touched me.

744
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,519
[Joe] Stop that.

745
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,582
When I told my mom about it,
she made me promise not to tell anyone.

746
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,252
- No, stop. I don't want stories.
- All this started when I was nine.

- I was only nine years old.
- Henderson... Henderson, shut up.

- This happened to you too, didn't it?
- No. No, no, no.

749
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,992
- That's why you're doing this?
- No.

750
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,220
[Henderson] You hate yourself

[Joe] I'm warning you.

00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,748
- We're the same.
- No, no...

You're from my party, right?
You're Forty's friend.

Is that what you think this is, huh?

758
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,739
You feel like you're a piece of shit
so you're trying to be a hero.

759
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,166
- That's enough.
- Ruining my life is not gonna save you

What we went through, this shit stays.

761

763

Nothing can.
